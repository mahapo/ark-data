00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.913 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Hello, my Juicy
co-creators, Lilou here.

00:00:12.913 --> 00:00:15.548 align:middle line:84%
This is another beautiful
video interview.

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:19.820 align:middle line:84%
Oh, my goodness we are so lucky
to be sitting here in London

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.122 align:middle line:84%
and have this interview
with Manjir.

00:00:21.122 --> 00:00:23.157 align:middle line:90%
That is absolutely delicious.

00:00:23.157 --> 00:00:26.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm thrilled to be
meeting you in person here

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.931 align:middle line:84%
in this amazing space in
London, in the center of London,

00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:32.233 align:middle line:90%
what a delight to meet you.

00:00:32.233 --> 00:00:33.634 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:33.634 --> 00:00:34.902 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Manjir Samanta-Laughton:
Oh, thank you for inviting me.

00:00:34.902 --> 00:00:36.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm delighted to meet-- to
meet you, I heard so much

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.240 align:middle line:90%
about you all these years.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.976 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So, tell us about
your story 'cause you've got--

00:00:41.976 --> 00:00:46.514 align:middle line:84%
I know you wrote this
book, "The Punk Science".

00:00:46.514 --> 00:00:51.418 align:middle line:84%
Let's get into God, [laughs] no
let's get into your story first

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:53.921 align:middle line:84%
so that we can understand
because you used to be aseptic,

00:00:53.921 --> 00:00:56.223 align:middle line:84%
you did this-- your
study in London.

00:00:56.223 --> 00:00:58.626 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what happened.

00:00:58.626 --> 00:01:00.628 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Manjir Samanta-Laughton:
Yeah, I mean I was brought

00:01:00.628 --> 00:01:04.031 align:middle line:90%
up by my parents, two daughters.

00:01:04.031 --> 00:01:06.734 align:middle line:84%
And so I was brought up
in Yorkshire, in the North

00:01:06.734 --> 00:01:11.238 align:middle line:84%
of England by medical GPs and I
was expected to be a doctor too

00:01:11.238 --> 00:01:12.873 align:middle line:90%
and go on do the whole thing.

00:01:12.873 --> 00:01:14.642 align:middle line:84%
You know like good
thing girly-girls do,

00:01:14.642 --> 00:01:16.310 align:middle line:90%
and I was skeptic.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.280 align:middle line:84%
I love science, I love the
books by Richard Dawkins

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.051 align:middle line:84%
and I thought anything
spiritual was complete nonsense.

00:01:24.051 --> 00:01:26.253 align:middle line:90%
You know, I was skeptic.

00:01:26.253 --> 00:01:29.456 align:middle line:84%
And all that changed
when I finally got

00:01:29.456 --> 00:01:31.891 align:middle line:84%
into medical school,
came here to London.

00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:35.361 align:middle line:84%
I was lucky enough to study,
Royal Free Medical School

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:38.831 align:middle line:84%
and it was during freshie's
week that somebody sign me

00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:42.736 align:middle line:84%
up for a yoga class and I went
along expecting to do lots

00:01:42.736 --> 00:01:46.006 align:middle line:84%
of exercises and, you know, I
was wearing sweats and the rest

00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:49.109 align:middle line:84%
of it and instead
we did a meditation,

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:52.111 align:middle line:90%
and my kundalini ways and--

00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:53.347 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Did you
know what it was?

00:01:53.347 --> 00:01:55.182 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Manjir Samanta-Laughton:
I had no idea.

00:01:55.182 --> 00:01:59.486 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I'd never heard of
chakras and so when I walked

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:03.791 align:middle line:84%
in the room, there was
a chart with chakras on

00:02:03.791 --> 00:02:06.460 align:middle line:84%
and I was looking and
why do I know that?

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.363 align:middle line:84%
And my parents are Hindu,
so I was thinking about it,

00:02:09.363 --> 00:02:13.467 align:middle line:84%
they tell me this and suddenly
it was like a voice saying,

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:15.869 align:middle line:84%
"You knew this in the
past life in India."

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:17.571 align:middle line:90%
And I was like past lives?

00:02:17.571 --> 00:02:20.241 align:middle line:84%
You know, and some part
of me knew it was correct,

00:02:20.241 --> 00:02:21.942 align:middle line:84%
but part of me was
still skeptic.

00:02:21.942 --> 00:02:23.878 align:middle line:84%
So I was like going,
how can that be true?

00:02:23.878 --> 00:02:25.512 align:middle line:90%
Past lives don't exist.

00:02:25.512 --> 00:02:27.815 align:middle line:84%
But somewhat, you know,
when you just know?

00:02:27.815 --> 00:02:30.417 align:middle line:84%
So, it's my first real
sense of knowing that I was

00:02:30.417 --> 00:02:32.319 align:middle line:84%
in the right place
at the right time.

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.122 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: What do you
mean by kundalini arising?

00:02:35.122 --> 00:02:36.323 align:middle line:90%
>> MSL: Yeah.

00:02:36.323 --> 00:02:39.693 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's a really good
point because kundalini,

00:02:39.693 --> 00:02:43.430 align:middle line:84%
people think it's like something
sexual maybe, it can be.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.300 align:middle line:84%
But, what is, is like a coiled
energy that's in the base

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.570 align:middle line:90%
of the spine in the sacred bone.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.573 align:middle line:84%
And according to Hindu
tradition, and, you know,

00:02:52.573 --> 00:02:55.675 align:middle line:84%
lot of people represent this
in their cultures as well.

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:59.046 align:middle line:84%
This is kind of like a coiled
energy that sort starts to rise

00:02:59.046 --> 00:03:02.349 align:middle line:84%
out through the spine, it
cleanses the chakras as it goes,

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.418 align:middle line:84%
and it comes out
through the crown chakra

00:03:04.418 --> 00:03:10.157 align:middle line:84%
and it actually connects you
from being something who's

00:03:10.157 --> 00:03:13.694 align:middle line:84%
like a material and just
thinking of the material world.

00:03:13.694 --> 00:03:16.263 align:middle line:84%
What it did with me,
it just connected me

00:03:16.263 --> 00:03:19.566 align:middle line:84%
to understanding the
spiritual realms, there's more

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:21.535 align:middle line:90%
to life than the material.

00:03:21.535 --> 00:03:23.804 align:middle line:84%
And it can happen in
all sorts of ways.

00:03:23.804 --> 00:03:26.874 align:middle line:84%
It can happen through
meditation, it can happen--

00:03:26.874 --> 00:03:30.544 align:middle line:84%
I know this woman who-- actually
it happened while she was skiing

00:03:30.544 --> 00:03:34.348 align:middle line:90%
and just one time [inaudible].

00:03:34.348 --> 00:03:36.350 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, buying
[phonetic] something beautiful.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.352 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: It's physical too?

00:03:38.352 --> 00:03:40.487 align:middle line:84%
>> MSL: It's-- It's
in the energy body.

00:03:40.487 --> 00:03:41.855 align:middle line:90%
But, you know, I've had

00:03:41.855 --> 00:03:45.859 align:middle line:84%
since had another kundalini
experience, it felt so physical

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:49.096 align:middle line:84%
like a real snake like
coming off through my spine.

00:03:49.096 --> 00:03:53.567 align:middle line:84%
It's totally a like nonphysical
which is why people who--

00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:56.804 align:middle line:84%
like I used to be a
completely a skeptical.

00:03:56.804 --> 00:03:59.239 align:middle line:84%
But it's the tradition
that's in most--

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.176 align:middle line:84%
if you look at even the medical
profession, what do you see?

00:04:02.176 --> 00:04:05.245 align:middle line:84%
You see a snake going
up a staff, you know,

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:07.981 align:middle line:84%
so in all the Siddha
healing traditions,

00:04:07.981 --> 00:04:11.418 align:middle line:84%
it's represented it just
people don't know what it is.

00:04:11.418 --> 00:04:13.654 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: So, since then you--

00:04:13.654 --> 00:04:16.357 align:middle line:84%
you I mean this changed
your reality,

00:04:16.357 --> 00:04:17.824 align:middle line:90%
totally changed your reality?

00:04:17.824 --> 00:04:19.727 align:middle line:90%
What happened after that?

00:04:19.727 --> 00:04:22.329 align:middle line:84%
>> MSL: Well I still
had five years

00:04:22.329 --> 00:04:24.331 align:middle line:90%
of medical school ahead of me.

00:04:24.331 --> 00:04:29.103 align:middle line:84%
So, I was in London and whenever
I could, I would, you know,

00:04:29.103 --> 00:04:32.740 align:middle line:84%
go to any workshops or anything,
all my spiritual journey

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.776 align:middle line:84%
as you do, synchronicities
what happen, you know,

00:04:35.776 --> 00:04:38.879 align:middle line:84%
I was just following my past
and getting the right books,

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:41.215 align:middle line:84%
Deepak Chopra, Christiane
Northrup,

00:04:41.215 --> 00:04:44.051 align:middle line:84%
any doctors who were
also spiritual which is--

00:04:44.051 --> 00:04:45.052 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Caroline Myss?

00:04:45.052 --> 00:04:46.453 align:middle line:84%
>> MSL: Caroline--
absolutely, yeah.

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:49.857 align:middle line:84%
And so they were just,
you know, sacred to me

00:04:49.857 --> 00:04:53.160 align:middle line:84%
because it was just-- to have
somebody who is in my position

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.464 align:middle line:84%
who knew the medical world
and the scientific world like,

00:04:57.464 --> 00:05:01.168 align:middle line:84%
you know, Candace Pert was
a great inspiration as well.

00:05:01.168 --> 00:05:04.671 align:middle line:90%
So, I was going on this journey.

00:05:04.671 --> 00:05:08.409 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And what's fascinating
and what I-- it's that--

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:10.144 align:middle line:90%
what created that event?

00:05:10.144 --> 00:05:11.678 align:middle line:90%
Did you look afterwards?

00:05:11.678 --> 00:05:15.349 align:middle line:84%
Why did it happen to you
then and at that moment?

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:16.450 align:middle line:90%
>> MSL: You know--

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:17.518 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Because we
all want that really.

00:05:17.518 --> 00:05:20.387 align:middle line:84%
>> MSL: It's interesting,
gosh, how to--

00:05:20.387 --> 00:05:23.490 align:middle line:84%
'cause I think something
happened I got totally

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.960 align:middle line:84%
which is quite similar and
that in the end of the day,

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.730 align:middle line:84%
you can do lots of
things, but it's almost

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.165 align:middle line:90%
as if it's a higher self.

00:05:31.165 --> 00:05:34.134 align:middle line:84%
You actually put these
points in your life

00:05:34.134 --> 00:05:37.938 align:middle line:84%
that are planned ahead
even before you're born.

00:05:37.938 --> 00:05:40.674 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what it felt like.

00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:44.011 align:middle line:84%
And so everybody has got these
points and either you don't need

00:05:44.011 --> 00:05:46.713 align:middle line:84%
to be like me, you don't
need to be born a skeptic.

00:05:46.713 --> 00:05:50.984 align:middle line:84%
Because being skeptic until I
was 18 was quite useful 'cause

00:05:50.984 --> 00:05:53.587 align:middle line:84%
it got me into med school, you
know, 'cause I studied science

00:05:53.587 --> 00:05:54.988 align:middle line:90%
and everything like that.

00:05:54.988 --> 00:05:59.726 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't need to be skeptic
anymore, so that was my moment.

00:05:59.726 --> 00:06:01.862 align:middle line:90%
And having said, you know,

00:06:01.862 --> 00:06:04.331 align:middle line:84%
all my life that I've
wanted to be a doctor.

00:06:04.331 --> 00:06:08.368 align:middle line:84%
When I got into medical school,
I thought this is not for me,

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:11.672 align:middle line:84%
you know, and so my
resolved completely went

00:06:11.672 --> 00:06:14.074 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't-- I
felt really at sea.

00:06:14.074 --> 00:06:17.377 align:middle line:84%
And soon after that
somebody signed me up,

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:19.613 align:middle line:90%
even I didn't signed myself.

00:06:19.613 --> 00:06:21.915 align:middle line:84%
You know, a friend
actually signed me up

00:06:21.915 --> 00:06:25.953 align:middle line:84%
and then she dropped out and I
carried on with this yoga class

00:06:25.953 --> 00:06:27.721 align:middle line:84%
and turned up to
the first class.

00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:30.157 align:middle line:84%
And so it was something
that was meant to be.

00:06:30.157 --> 00:06:31.592 align:middle line:90%
And I think we all do this.

00:06:31.592 --> 00:06:34.695 align:middle line:84%
It's all in our higher
self life script.

00:06:34.695 --> 00:06:37.231 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: I love how we come
off from different background

00:06:37.231 --> 00:06:38.499 align:middle line:84%
and there are those
things that happened.

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:40.501 align:middle line:84%
So you're living this
double life and a lot

00:06:40.501 --> 00:06:41.802 align:middle line:90%
of us can relate, huh.

00:06:41.802 --> 00:06:43.036 align:middle line:90%
How did that go?

00:06:43.036 --> 00:06:46.373 align:middle line:84%
>> MSL: Oh gosh, I had
to keep everything quiet.

00:06:46.373 --> 00:06:48.041 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Your parents,
too, your family?

00:06:48.041 --> 00:06:49.743 align:middle line:90%
>> MSL: My parents didn't know.

00:06:49.743 --> 00:06:54.815 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I left-- oh, I
actually got married as well

00:06:54.815 --> 00:06:57.284 align:middle line:84%
when I was still in med
school and that was, you know,

00:06:57.284 --> 00:06:59.786 align:middle line:84%
[inaudible] following
my spiritual guidance.

00:06:59.786 --> 00:07:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know, I left home,
I left home, my parents and,

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.192 align:middle line:90%
you know, didn't realized

00:07:05.192 --> 00:07:08.929 align:middle line:84%
that I was you know this
growing in my spiritual path.

00:07:08.929 --> 00:07:11.698 align:middle line:84%
And I started to have
multidimensional experiences

00:07:11.698 --> 00:07:15.669 align:middle line:84%
and I qualified as a
doctor, and then I went

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:18.605 align:middle line:90%
on to training to be a GP.

00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:21.742 align:middle line:84%
And I already knew that I wanted
to be a speaker and an author.

00:07:21.742 --> 00:07:25.212 align:middle line:84%
You know, by the time I
finished medical school.

00:07:25.212 --> 00:07:28.515 align:middle line:84%
So, I went ahead and I
trained as a GP and, you know,

00:07:28.515 --> 00:07:30.317 align:middle line:90%
I'm quite a practical person,

00:07:30.317 --> 00:07:33.687 align:middle line:84%
so when I noticed I was getting
energy coming out in my hands,

00:07:33.687 --> 00:07:35.522 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking this
could be quite useful.

00:07:35.522 --> 00:07:41.028 align:middle line:84%
So, I came across something
called "Plexus Bio-Energy."

00:07:41.028 --> 00:07:46.133 align:middle line:84%
It's a sort of healing modality
based in Ireland, and I trained

00:07:46.133 --> 00:07:48.969 align:middle line:84%
with them whilst I
was doing pediatrics.

00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:54.975 align:middle line:84%
So I was doing six months as a
pediatric SHO, and I took sort

00:07:54.975 --> 00:07:57.377 align:middle line:84%
of a special kind of
pattern of annual leave just

00:07:57.377 --> 00:07:59.846 align:middle line:84%
so that I could go-- come
to this area of the world,

00:07:59.846 --> 00:08:01.748 align:middle line:90%
Wimbledon, South London.

00:08:01.748 --> 00:08:06.153 align:middle line:84%
And I trained with Plexus and
that, again, was the next stage

00:08:06.153 --> 00:08:08.221 align:middle line:84%
in my life, because I
trained as a healer.

00:08:08.221 --> 00:08:11.325 align:middle line:84%
And not just that, it
opened me up again.

00:08:11.325 --> 00:08:15.762 align:middle line:84%
So, I started to have really
multidimensional experiences,

00:08:15.762 --> 00:08:19.099 align:middle line:84%
galactic experiences
started to see, you know,

00:08:19.099 --> 00:08:22.202 align:middle line:84%
I'd already seen-- I had
several angelic experiences,

00:08:22.202 --> 00:08:23.937 align:middle line:90%
seeing angels and things.

00:08:23.937 --> 00:08:27.841 align:middle line:84%
And so I started to see the
alien realms are actually

00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:29.610 align:middle line:90%
in different dimensions.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:31.411 align:middle line:84%
So, you can understand
I had to keep all

00:08:31.411 --> 00:08:34.114 align:middle line:84%
of this quiet from
my colleagues.

00:08:34.114 --> 00:08:39.886 align:middle line:84%
And so all kind of came to ahead
after I finish my GP training

00:08:39.886 --> 00:08:44.758 align:middle line:84%
and qualified as a GP and I was
deciding kind of what to do.

00:08:44.758 --> 00:08:47.461 align:middle line:84%
And in the time that I
was doing the training,

00:08:47.461 --> 00:08:49.963 align:middle line:84%
I just had so many hours
that I had to work.

00:08:49.963 --> 00:08:53.700 align:middle line:84%
So, I didn't have time to look
at my marriage which was really

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.503 align:middle line:84%
by this time seven years
and we had just gone

00:08:56.503 --> 00:08:59.706 align:middle line:90%
in different directions.

00:08:59.706 --> 00:09:02.643 align:middle line:84%
So, what happen then was
another thing that, you know,

00:09:02.643 --> 00:09:05.746 align:middle line:84%
you've been through this as well
what you think is it's complete

00:09:05.746 --> 00:09:09.349 align:middle line:84%
disaster but actually it's the
best thing that happened to you.

00:09:09.349 --> 00:09:10.384 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:09:10.384 --> 00:09:13.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And you
liked it in the end?

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:14.855 align:middle line:90%
>> MSL: I know, I know.

00:09:14.855 --> 00:09:17.824 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, so I've initiated
a divorce, and separation

00:09:17.824 --> 00:09:23.930 align:middle line:84%
for my husband and my husband
told my parents about my visions

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:27.134 align:middle line:84%
and my sort of-- you know,
what happens in my healing,

00:09:27.134 --> 00:09:30.370 align:middle line:84%
shape shifting, you know,
there was even a time

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:33.006 align:middle line:84%
when an alien came into
the bedroom and, you know,

00:09:33.006 --> 00:09:36.143 align:middle line:84%
when he was asleep and I could
see it in front of me and I,

00:09:36.143 --> 00:09:39.479 align:middle line:84%
you know, did all these
interdimensional travel

00:09:39.479 --> 00:09:41.515 align:middle line:84%
and things like, that's
just so spontaneously.

00:09:41.515 --> 00:09:46.119 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any kind of
meditation practice anymore.

00:09:46.119 --> 00:09:49.690 align:middle line:84%
I think if I did it would
be just too overwhelming.

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:51.792 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, it
just kind of have--

00:09:51.792 --> 00:09:54.294 align:middle line:84%
all these things kind
of happen spontaneously.

00:09:54.294 --> 00:09:55.962 align:middle line:90%
So, I had told him these things

00:09:55.962 --> 00:09:58.865 align:middle line:84%
and I was working
as a GP, you know.

00:09:58.865 --> 00:10:03.270 align:middle line:84%
So he said all these
things and tried to make

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:05.572 align:middle line:90%
out that I had lost my mind.

00:10:05.572 --> 00:10:08.208 align:middle line:84%
And my parents who didn't
really know about this aspect

00:10:08.208 --> 00:10:11.244 align:middle line:90%
of life also were concerned.

00:10:11.244 --> 00:10:13.580 align:middle line:84%
So, they initiated
an investigation

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:17.784 align:middle line:84%
into my mental health because,
[inaudible] seeing patients.

00:10:17.784 --> 00:10:19.586 align:middle line:84%
So that, you know,
people were concerned

00:10:19.586 --> 00:10:21.722 align:middle line:90%
that I wasn't quite right.

00:10:21.722 --> 00:10:24.091 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, things like
channelings and things

00:10:24.091 --> 00:10:26.560 align:middle line:84%
like that, you know, were
printed off my computer

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.096 align:middle line:84%
and taken to the general
medical counsel and all of that,

00:10:29.096 --> 00:10:30.697 align:middle line:90%
I had the whole thing.

00:10:30.697 --> 00:10:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And it took me a while to
realize and I just thought,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.203 align:middle line:84%
you know what, I'm
meant to quit this.

00:10:36.203 --> 00:10:38.438 align:middle line:84%
I actually meant to leave
the medical profession

00:10:38.438 --> 00:10:40.974 align:middle line:84%
and I thought the
only thing that's--

00:10:40.974 --> 00:10:43.310 align:middle line:84%
because at the end of the
day, no patient had complained

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:45.679 align:middle line:84%
about me, no colleague
had complained about me.

00:10:45.679 --> 00:10:47.914 align:middle line:84%
I've not done anything
professionally

00:10:47.914 --> 00:10:49.916 align:middle line:84%
that was a misconduct
in any way.

00:10:49.916 --> 00:10:53.520 align:middle line:84%
It was purely my ex-husband
and my parents saying this.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.855 align:middle line:90%
So, I just thought--

00:10:54.855 --> 00:10:57.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Devastating, I mean
the emotions on the right.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:58.792 align:middle line:90%
>> MSL: Extremely, extremely,

00:10:58.792 --> 00:11:00.861 align:middle line:84%
but you know, it's
extremely a lot.

00:11:00.861 --> 00:11:03.463 align:middle line:84%
But we're only given
things that we can handle

00:11:03.463 --> 00:11:04.998 align:middle line:90%
in a way and though it was--

00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:06.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: You must
be a super warrior.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:10.537 align:middle line:84%
>> MSL: It was extreme, but
at the other hand I was going,

00:11:10.537 --> 00:11:15.175 align:middle line:84%
you know what, there was this
weekend where I lost my house,

00:11:15.175 --> 00:11:17.911 align:middle line:84%
I lost my husband, I lost
my career, everything was

00:11:17.911 --> 00:11:21.648 align:middle line:84%
in tatters and it was like the
only thing I've got left is

00:11:21.648 --> 00:11:22.983 align:middle line:90%
the physics.

00:11:22.983 --> 00:11:24.451 align:middle line:90%
You know, now when I look

00:11:24.451 --> 00:11:27.254 align:middle line:84%
at the stuff that's been
fascinating me all my life,

00:11:27.254 --> 00:11:31.024 align:middle line:84%
content theory, you know,
secretly I've been interested

00:11:31.024 --> 00:11:35.729 align:middle line:84%
in all of these things and I've
not done anything about it.

00:11:35.729 --> 00:11:37.297 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Quantum
entanglement, I guess?

00:11:37.297 --> 00:11:40.834 align:middle line:84%
>> MSL: All of that sort of
stuff, black holes, cosmology,

00:11:40.834 --> 00:11:44.404 align:middle line:84%
string theory, it was faster
than speed of light theory.

00:11:44.404 --> 00:11:45.939 align:middle line:84%
I was looking at
the cutting edge.

00:11:45.939 --> 00:11:47.474 align:middle line:84%
I was doing that when I
should have been studying

00:11:47.474 --> 00:11:51.611 align:middle line:84%
for medical school exams and I
was fascinated by the physics.

00:11:51.611 --> 00:11:54.347 align:middle line:84%
So, I was fascinated by
the cutting edge and how

00:11:54.347 --> 00:11:59.352 align:middle line:84%
that could actually
relate to esoteric ideas,

00:11:59.352 --> 00:12:01.621 align:middle line:84%
but I'd not really
done much about it.

00:12:01.621 --> 00:12:03.056 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Yeah, so how
do you create a bridge

00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:05.125 align:middle line:84%
between the academies
that you had learned

00:12:05.125 --> 00:12:06.593 align:middle line:84%
and what you were
seeing in there?

00:12:06.593 --> 00:12:08.728 align:middle line:84%
How did you-- because
for us we feel it,

00:12:08.728 --> 00:12:10.730 align:middle line:84%
but we don't have
this scientific mind

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:11.832 align:middle line:90%
to understand it.

00:12:11.832 --> 00:12:13.800 align:middle line:84%
So, it's brilliant to
have you, thank you.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.203 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for showing up
on earth at this time,

00:12:16.203 --> 00:12:18.205 align:middle line:90%
we appreciate what we--

00:12:18.205 --> 00:12:20.740 align:middle line:84%
>> MSL: That's exactly
what I did.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.176 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's how
to put this into--

00:12:23.176 --> 00:12:26.746 align:middle line:84%
I knew that there was a gap to
put this into easy language,

00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:28.081 align:middle line:90%
make it fun, you know.

00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:31.885 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, just-- it's
called Punk Science 'cause it's

00:12:31.885 --> 00:12:33.620 align:middle line:84%
in your face, it
doesn't need approval

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:35.422 align:middle line:90%
from the academics, you know.

00:12:35.422 --> 00:12:37.924 align:middle line:84%
It's going to the people
straight way, you know,

00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:39.826 align:middle line:84%
going to the people
first and saying,

00:12:39.826 --> 00:12:42.596 align:middle line:84%
we don't need Richard Dawkins
to prove this, you know,

00:12:42.596 --> 00:12:43.964 align:middle line:84%
it's going straight
to the people

00:12:43.964 --> 00:12:46.066 align:middle line:84%
and it resonates
with the people.

00:12:46.066 --> 00:12:48.235 align:middle line:84%
And where they might have
some spiritual experiences,

00:12:48.235 --> 00:12:51.738 align:middle line:84%
they can read the book
and the number of e-mails

00:12:51.738 --> 00:12:53.874 align:middle line:84%
that keep saying goes,
this is the first book

00:12:53.874 --> 00:12:56.009 align:middle line:84%
on this subject that
I understand.

00:12:56.009 --> 00:12:59.212 align:middle line:90%
And make it fun too, why not.

00:12:59.212 --> 00:13:01.281 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: I'm very
fascinated by to--

00:13:01.281 --> 00:13:05.919 align:middle line:84%
before going into the
explanations, what did you had--

00:13:05.919 --> 00:13:08.188 align:middle line:84%
what have you experienced
on that level

00:13:08.188 --> 00:13:12.292 align:middle line:84%
on this multidimensional
levels and how does it--

00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:15.262 align:middle line:84%
how does it feel like and
what did that really--

00:13:15.262 --> 00:13:18.999 align:middle line:84%
looking back now
where you're at how--

00:13:18.999 --> 00:13:20.300 align:middle line:90%
what did it really bring you

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:23.036 align:middle line:84%
and why is there this
communication going on?

00:13:23.036 --> 00:13:25.238 align:middle line:84%
'Cause I guess you've
got a lot of information

00:13:25.238 --> 00:13:28.575 align:middle line:84%
and all this makes more sense
than when it started, right?

00:13:28.575 --> 00:13:29.509 align:middle line:90%
>> MSL: Yeah, yeah.

00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:31.878 align:middle line:90%
I mean from being, you know,

00:13:31.878 --> 00:13:35.782 align:middle line:84%
that skeptic I have been
mystique now for like 20 years

00:13:35.782 --> 00:13:38.485 align:middle line:84%
since that happened,
given people my age now.

00:13:38.485 --> 00:13:39.686 align:middle line:84%
And so-- so-- [laughter]
so yeah, it's some--

00:13:39.686 --> 00:13:45.959 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how to
describe it 'cause it's kind

00:13:45.959 --> 00:13:48.495 align:middle line:84%
of like my everyday
life and I will--

00:13:48.495 --> 00:13:51.865 align:middle line:84%
from everything from
seeing peoples--

00:13:51.865 --> 00:13:56.136 align:middle line:84%
members of family who have
past on, to hearing some--

00:13:56.136 --> 00:13:58.805 align:middle line:84%
you know, obviously hearing
like consciousness come

00:13:58.805 --> 00:14:00.040 align:middle line:90%
through you a channel.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:04.444 align:middle line:84%
I have-- I had an
alien experiences

00:14:04.444 --> 00:14:08.748 align:middle line:84%
where I saw this alien
coming to my bedroom.

00:14:08.748 --> 00:14:10.417 align:middle line:84%
This is before all
this happened,

00:14:10.417 --> 00:14:14.521 align:middle line:84%
it kind of like instead of
this kind of thing that's blob,

00:14:14.521 --> 00:14:17.791 align:middle line:84%
that started moving along like,
you know, like a cell wood,

00:14:17.791 --> 00:14:20.927 align:middle line:84%
you know, and I wake
up about 3 o'clock

00:14:20.927 --> 00:14:24.564 align:middle line:84%
in the morning going why
am I sleeping on my side

00:14:24.564 --> 00:14:28.501 align:middle line:84%
and there was this-- I felt
like there were hands in my back

00:14:28.501 --> 00:14:32.372 align:middle line:84%
and I was thinking how
could this possibly be

00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:36.977 align:middle line:84%
and it was burning, my back
was burning and I looked up

00:14:36.977 --> 00:14:40.981 align:middle line:84%
and there was this thing going
out of the door and I was kind,

00:14:40.981 --> 00:14:45.618 align:middle line:84%
you know, in this dimension, why
do you have to go out the door.

00:14:45.618 --> 00:14:48.655 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to wake
up my then husband

00:14:48.655 --> 00:14:49.689 align:middle line:90%
and of course he didn't wake

00:14:49.689 --> 00:14:52.492 align:middle line:84%
up 'cause he was not
meant to see this.

00:14:52.492 --> 00:14:56.629 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of-- I've
been channeling beings

00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:58.665 align:middle line:90%
that call themselves angelus.

00:14:58.665 --> 00:15:00.633 align:middle line:84%
So, it's like help
angelus, you know,

00:15:00.633 --> 00:15:04.337 align:middle line:84%
because I don't know what this
is and I got this kind of voice

00:15:04.337 --> 00:15:06.106 align:middle line:84%
that said, "How did you
know this isn't angelus?"

00:15:06.106 --> 00:15:08.575 align:middle line:90%
I was like I don't.

00:15:08.575 --> 00:15:13.346 align:middle line:84%
And so what I knew-- it was kind
of like an implant had been put

00:15:13.346 --> 00:15:16.082 align:middle line:90%
in my back of a triangle.

00:15:16.082 --> 00:15:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And I spent the whole night
like jumping to different areas,

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:23.790 align:middle line:84%
just from consciousness,
into the jungles of Mexico,

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:26.092 align:middle line:84%
seeing pyramids that have
not been discovered yet

00:15:26.092 --> 00:15:28.795 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't know until
actually at the time

00:15:28.795 --> 00:15:31.698 align:middle line:84%
that that was the case of
lots of pyramids in Mexico,

00:15:31.698 --> 00:15:34.034 align:middle line:84%
they're not been discovered,
so I was like going in and out

00:15:34.034 --> 00:15:37.404 align:middle line:84%
of all these things just going
wherever my consciousness

00:15:37.404 --> 00:15:38.772 align:middle line:90%
took me.

00:15:38.772 --> 00:15:42.609 align:middle line:84%
I was seeing different octaves
of reality with different--

00:15:42.609 --> 00:15:44.944 align:middle line:90%
I mean, everybody, you know,

00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:49.215 align:middle line:84%
probably it sounds really
fantastical but just like music,

00:15:49.215 --> 00:15:51.351 align:middle line:84%
there are different
octaves of reality.

00:15:51.351 --> 00:15:54.154 align:middle line:84%
And there are beings in
all of these octaves.

00:15:54.154 --> 00:15:56.489 align:middle line:84%
And there-- you know, we
talk about aliens getting

00:15:56.489 --> 00:15:58.224 align:middle line:90%
in spaceships and coming over.

00:15:58.224 --> 00:16:00.994 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't have to,
they're in different frequencies

00:16:00.994 --> 00:16:03.029 align:middle line:84%
and they're absolutely
everywhere.

00:16:03.029 --> 00:16:06.232 align:middle line:84%
And so, they're just
overlays on every dimension.

00:16:06.232 --> 00:16:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And we too, we all
have our human selves.

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:13.573 align:middle line:84%
And we have lots of
different alien selves,

00:16:13.573 --> 00:16:16.042 align:middle line:84%
lots of different angelic
selves, all different,

00:16:16.042 --> 00:16:18.044 align:middle line:84%
but with-- alien is a
funny word, you know,

00:16:18.044 --> 00:16:19.145 align:middle line:90%
it's not really alien.

00:16:19.145 --> 00:16:22.282 align:middle line:84%
It's just different
dimensions of ourselves.

00:16:22.282 --> 00:16:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And you could even
say the concept

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:28.822 align:middle line:84%
of a guardian angel is just
yourself in a high dimension.

00:16:28.822 --> 00:16:31.357 align:middle line:84%
So, I've been blessed
enough to see,

00:16:31.357 --> 00:16:33.760 align:middle line:84%
to have angelic experiences
as well with--

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.829 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: You don't get
scared or-- 'Cause you could--

00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:38.698 align:middle line:84%
have been totally coming
from your background,

00:16:38.698 --> 00:16:41.734 align:middle line:84%
seeing those things,
I mean, what a shock.

00:16:41.734 --> 00:16:44.871 align:middle line:84%
>> MSL: Well, it's been sort
of a gradual and, honestly,

00:16:44.871 --> 00:16:48.174 align:middle line:84%
the main thing is, you've
got to keep grounded.

00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:51.811 align:middle line:84%
And some-- I'm a very
practical person as well.

00:16:51.811 --> 00:16:54.414 align:middle line:84%
And it's really important
not to think,

00:16:54.414 --> 00:16:56.049 align:middle line:84%
"I want to have these
experiences.

00:16:56.049 --> 00:16:57.283 align:middle line:90%
What can I do?"

00:16:57.283 --> 00:17:01.087 align:middle line:84%
And to make ignore going
down, do your shopping,

00:17:01.087 --> 00:17:03.956 align:middle line:84%
doing your everyday
stuff, because it's not

00:17:03.956 --> 00:17:06.292 align:middle line:84%
about separating
yourself out and go,

00:17:06.292 --> 00:17:08.027 align:middle line:84%
"Now I'm being spiritual
and now, I'm not."

00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:09.729 align:middle line:90%
And this is just mundane.

00:17:09.729 --> 00:17:13.366 align:middle line:84%
Every single thing you
do contains the bliss

00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:15.001 align:middle line:90%
and love of the universe.

00:17:15.001 --> 00:17:18.303 align:middle line:84%
There is nowhere--
whether-- that doesn't exist.

00:17:18.303 --> 00:17:20.773 align:middle line:84%
So even when you're doing--
it's not just about, "Oh,

00:17:20.773 --> 00:17:24.144 align:middle line:84%
I need to be mindful here, "
it's actually just connecting

00:17:24.144 --> 00:17:26.412 align:middle line:84%
and connecting to
joy and connecting

00:17:26.412 --> 00:17:29.749 align:middle line:84%
to bliss wherever you are,
everything is spiritual.

00:17:29.749 --> 00:17:32.552 align:middle line:84%
You know, I-- we know
that from, you know,

00:17:32.552 --> 00:17:34.554 align:middle line:84%
we know from quantum
theories that, you know,

00:17:34.554 --> 00:17:37.991 align:middle line:84%
when you break something down,
there's nothing solid, you know,

00:17:37.991 --> 00:17:39.993 align:middle line:84%
it's just a frequency,
it's just a vibration,

00:17:39.993 --> 00:17:41.628 align:middle line:90%
it's just information.

00:17:41.628 --> 00:17:42.996 align:middle line:90%
So, there's no point going, "OK,

00:17:42.996 --> 00:17:44.430 align:middle line:84%
this is where it's
not spiritual,

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:47.433 align:middle line:84%
this is where it's spiritual,'
everything is spiritual.

00:17:47.433 --> 00:17:48.768 align:middle line:90%
You know, so--

00:17:48.768 --> 00:17:51.571 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: You seem so colorful
and such a rich experience

00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:56.276 align:middle line:84%
to experience that and most of
us don't see that or some think

00:17:56.276 --> 00:17:59.279 align:middle line:84%
but they're not really
totally into that--

00:17:59.279 --> 00:18:04.250 align:middle line:84%
it's just it's quite--
it's quite not daunting

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.419 align:middle line:84%
but it's quite something
to realize

00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:08.855 align:middle line:90%
or to hear that from you.

00:18:08.855 --> 00:18:11.558 align:middle line:84%
And to just-- oh my God, all
of these things are going

00:18:11.558 --> 00:18:13.393 align:middle line:84%
on that I'm not aware
of, who am I?

00:18:13.393 --> 00:18:15.495 align:middle line:84%
How am I going to
relate to reality?

00:18:15.495 --> 00:18:18.631 align:middle line:84%
How can I even bring
more of this help here?

00:18:18.631 --> 00:18:21.401 align:middle line:84%
>> MSL: Yeah, it's very
important to keep grounded

00:18:21.401 --> 00:18:24.103 align:middle line:84%
and also to-- when
something happens

00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:28.107 align:middle line:84%
like there's a synchronicity
or a book full of the shelf,

00:18:28.107 --> 00:18:31.444 align:middle line:84%
just really blessed
and thank it.

00:18:31.444 --> 00:18:32.912 align:middle line:90%
And the more that you thank it,

00:18:32.912 --> 00:18:35.548 align:middle line:84%
and don't just go
that's nothing,

00:18:35.548 --> 00:18:37.350 align:middle line:84%
it's a coincidences,
it's whatever.

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:39.819 align:middle line:84%
You know, just bless it
because these are your guides

00:18:39.819 --> 00:18:40.887 align:middle line:90%
helping you.

00:18:40.887 --> 00:18:42.522 align:middle line:84%
And the more that
you acknowledge them,

00:18:42.522 --> 00:18:44.591 align:middle line:90%
the more that-- and be grateful,

00:18:44.591 --> 00:18:47.293 align:middle line:84%
the more that the
gratitude opens up your path.

00:18:47.293 --> 00:18:49.829 align:middle line:84%
So that's a really
important thing to do.

00:18:49.829 --> 00:18:51.431 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, it's-- I've actually--

00:18:51.431 --> 00:18:53.366 align:middle line:84%
because of the whole
experience I had,

00:18:53.366 --> 00:18:56.202 align:middle line:84%
I've actually had a psychiatrist
tell me and completely sane,

00:18:56.202 --> 00:19:01.841 align:middle line:84%
so that's one of the-- so it is
also important to be grounded

00:19:01.841 --> 00:19:05.278 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of people
don't want to be there,

00:19:05.278 --> 00:19:06.446 align:middle line:90%
don't want to be grounded

00:19:06.446 --> 00:19:08.948 align:middle line:84%
because of some childhood
trauma, for example.

00:19:08.948 --> 00:19:11.284 align:middle line:84%
So it's also important to
do the emotional healing,

00:19:11.284 --> 00:19:14.354 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people wanted to escape
into this spiritual realms

00:19:14.354 --> 00:19:18.124 align:middle line:84%
and because it's too painful
sometimes to stay in this world.

00:19:18.124 --> 00:19:20.193 align:middle line:84%
So, it's really important
to do your emotional work

00:19:20.193 --> 00:19:22.195 align:middle line:90%
as well, that's essential.

00:19:22.195 --> 00:19:25.365 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Is there-- did
they on the teaching side

00:19:25.365 --> 00:19:28.234 align:middle line:84%
on the scientific part,
how do you get that?

00:19:28.234 --> 00:19:31.237 align:middle line:84%
How do you-- how do
you make sense of this?

00:19:31.237 --> 00:19:32.538 align:middle line:90%
>> MSL: Oh, gosh.

00:19:32.538 --> 00:19:37.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all I started
to notice the correlations

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:39.479 align:middle line:84%
between things like
string theory.

00:19:39.479 --> 00:19:43.216 align:middle line:84%
So string theory is saying,
stuffs that's very similar

00:19:43.216 --> 00:19:46.786 align:middle line:84%
to what the mystics have been
saying throughout the ages.

00:19:46.786 --> 00:19:50.590 align:middle line:84%
That reality is vibrations,
that it happens

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:53.626 align:middle line:84%
in different dimensions
and depending

00:19:53.626 --> 00:19:57.664 align:middle line:84%
on what vibration you're in,
is where you find yourself.

00:19:57.664 --> 00:20:00.967 align:middle line:90%
So, it's very, very similar.

00:20:00.967 --> 00:20:04.737 align:middle line:84%
And so when you see the
correlations, I'm not saying

00:20:04.737 --> 00:20:08.708 align:middle line:84%
that is proof that, you know,
aliens are in different octaves.

00:20:08.708 --> 00:20:11.678 align:middle line:84%
But isn't that interesting
how the ideas are very,

00:20:11.678 --> 00:20:13.179 align:middle line:90%
very correlated.

00:20:13.179 --> 00:20:16.316 align:middle line:84%
So I started to look at all
of these things, and then,

00:20:16.316 --> 00:20:20.420 align:middle line:84%
you know, really and
also because, you know,

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:23.189 align:middle line:84%
quantum physics is also--
say some quantum physicists,

00:20:23.189 --> 00:20:26.693 align:middle line:84%
you know, if you actually-- you
probably know that if you look

00:20:26.693 --> 00:20:28.561 align:middle line:84%
and really experiment, if
you're doing an experiment,

00:20:28.561 --> 00:20:31.164 align:middle line:84%
it changes according
to how we measure it.

00:20:31.164 --> 00:20:33.466 align:middle line:84%
So people started to realize
it has something to do

00:20:33.466 --> 00:20:37.136 align:middle line:84%
with consciousness, that's
fundamental to reality.

00:20:37.136 --> 00:20:40.206 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, when you--
when you take that on board,

00:20:40.206 --> 00:20:44.010 align:middle line:84%
then you realize that
consciousness is fundamental.

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:46.112 align:middle line:84%
And you can-- you can
get different dimensions

00:20:46.112 --> 00:20:47.480 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:51.084 align:middle line:84%
So I started to realize things
like that and I also trained

00:20:51.084 --> 00:20:53.252 align:middle line:90%
as a healer as I said.

00:20:53.252 --> 00:20:57.857 align:middle line:84%
So I realized that a lot of
these ideas in physics can

00:20:57.857 --> 00:21:00.727 align:middle line:84%
or maybe explain
things like healing.

00:21:00.727 --> 00:21:06.065 align:middle line:84%
That's really where I came from
to trying to help my patients.

00:21:06.065 --> 00:21:10.002 align:middle line:84%
I was doing pediatrics and I
was seeing all these children

00:21:10.002 --> 00:21:12.939 align:middle line:84%
who are being subjected to
things like radiotherapy,

00:21:12.939 --> 00:21:15.441 align:middle line:84%
and I was thinking, you
know, this is 3-year-old,

00:21:15.441 --> 00:21:16.909 align:middle line:90%
beautiful 3-year-old, you know.

00:21:16.909 --> 00:21:19.846 align:middle line:84%
A particular boy that came
into the ward, I thought,

00:21:19.846 --> 00:21:22.115 align:middle line:90%
he was like a little angel.

00:21:22.115 --> 00:21:25.451 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought, my
goodness, let's not--

00:21:25.451 --> 00:21:28.054 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean to throw
out medical therapy,

00:21:28.054 --> 00:21:30.223 align:middle line:84%
but what if we were to
use something like Reiki

00:21:30.223 --> 00:21:33.159 align:middle line:84%
and in adjunct to what
he's going through.

00:21:33.159 --> 00:21:37.130 align:middle line:84%
I know from my experience as a
healer just how powerful it is,

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:40.800 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't that help his symptoms,
wouldn't help the side effects.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.769 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
I had to write a book

00:21:42.769 --> 00:21:44.370 align:middle line:84%
that even doctors
could understand,

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:49.142 align:middle line:84%
'cause doctors are not very
well versed on physics at all.

00:21:49.142 --> 00:21:52.578 align:middle line:84%
So it has to be simple, say,
for the medical profession.

00:21:52.578 --> 00:21:55.148 align:middle line:84%
So that was really
where I started out,

00:21:55.148 --> 00:21:57.316 align:middle line:90%
never did I ever think

00:21:57.316 --> 00:22:00.720 align:middle line:84%
that I would be writing a new
physics theory on black holes.

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:04.590 align:middle line:84%
That was just, you know,
completely [inaudible].

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:08.961 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Yeah, I love the
subtitle, "Inside the Mind

00:22:08.961 --> 00:22:13.866 align:middle line:84%
of God", So can you tell
us more about that part?

00:22:13.866 --> 00:22:17.537 align:middle line:84%
>> MSL: Gosh, well, at the
end of Steven Hawking's book,

00:22:17.537 --> 00:22:21.808 align:middle line:84%
he writes that, you know, one
day we might know the mind

00:22:21.808 --> 00:22:26.746 align:middle line:84%
of God and physicists actually
do discuss the mind of God,

00:22:26.746 --> 00:22:29.549 align:middle line:84%
you know, Michio Kaku is
quite a famous physicist.

00:22:29.549 --> 00:22:31.851 align:middle line:84%
And they're always
talking about this.

00:22:31.851 --> 00:22:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And so, when I put
it in this subtitle,

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:36.522 align:middle line:84%
it was kind of a
reference to the mind

00:22:36.522 --> 00:22:39.625 align:middle line:84%
of God is basically the
fundamental consciousness.

00:22:39.625 --> 00:22:43.529 align:middle line:84%
And we are all inside that
fundamental consciousness.

00:22:43.529 --> 00:22:45.998 align:middle line:84%
So I was referencing what
physicists talk about.

00:22:45.998 --> 00:22:50.169 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunate people think
I'm being religious sometimes.

00:22:50.169 --> 00:22:53.139 align:middle line:84%
But what I mean by God
is the big consciousness,

00:22:53.139 --> 00:22:54.440 align:middle line:90%
that's what I'm talking about.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.641 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:22:55.641 --> 00:22:59.011 align:middle line:84%
Do you get to prove that
we are actually mini-Gods?

00:22:59.011 --> 00:23:01.214 align:middle line:90%
That we are Gods too?

00:23:01.214 --> 00:23:03.249 align:middle line:84%
Is that something that
you're looking at?

00:23:03.249 --> 00:23:07.420 align:middle line:84%
>> MSL: We-- We're all
aspects of God, absolutely.

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:11.023 align:middle line:84%
You know, and at the
fundamental level when--

00:23:11.023 --> 00:23:13.960 align:middle line:84%
for example, if you
look at my theory,

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.295 align:middle line:90%
it's all about how we're created

00:23:16.295 --> 00:23:18.965 align:middle line:84%
from black holes at
different levels.

00:23:18.965 --> 00:23:21.834 align:middle line:90%
And the-- it's from the--

00:23:21.834 --> 00:23:23.536 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Once more
[inaudible] explained to us

00:23:23.536 --> 00:23:27.039 align:middle line:84%
that because that's really the
core, so let's get into it now.

00:23:27.039 --> 00:23:28.441 align:middle line:84%
>> MSL: Well, I mean,
a lot of people know

00:23:28.441 --> 00:23:32.678 align:middle line:84%
that black holes are-- I think
the black holes are destructive,

00:23:32.678 --> 00:23:35.314 align:middle line:84%
yeah, because that's what
we're being told for, you know.

00:23:35.314 --> 00:23:37.583 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's 50 years
or more, you know,

00:23:37.583 --> 00:23:41.120 align:middle line:84%
that there's this big
ghastly monsters out in space.

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:44.924 align:middle line:84%
And when we actually started
to look at the data though,

00:23:44.924 --> 00:23:47.226 align:middle line:84%
there were some funny
things going on.

00:23:47.226 --> 00:23:51.764 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of things come out of
black holes like electrons and,

00:23:51.764 --> 00:23:54.700 align:middle line:84%
you know, also a, say, a
matter or antimatter also,

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:57.403 align:middle line:84%
it's the particles that are
coming out of black holes.

00:23:57.403 --> 00:24:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And so, what I realized I
had this, you know, massive--

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:05.111 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't call it a vision,
but it's like-- 'cause I got--

00:24:05.111 --> 00:24:07.613 align:middle line:84%
I was already developed
as a mystic, you know.

00:24:07.613 --> 00:24:12.285 align:middle line:84%
Back in 2003, which is after all
the, you know, losing the house,

00:24:12.285 --> 00:24:14.854 align:middle line:84%
the job and everything like
that and I actually had to--

00:24:14.854 --> 00:24:18.624 align:middle line:84%
'cause I wasn't earning I
had to move into my old house

00:24:18.624 --> 00:24:21.827 align:middle line:84%
with my ex-husband 'cause
that was my house, you know.

00:24:21.827 --> 00:24:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And so, he actually
felt really bad

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:27.133 align:middle line:84%
that everything had gone too
far and he was supporting me.

00:24:27.133 --> 00:24:30.002 align:middle line:84%
So I was able to
sort of contemplate

00:24:30.002 --> 00:24:32.338 align:middle line:90%
and start to write the book.

00:24:32.338 --> 00:24:36.075 align:middle line:84%
And so I was out in the woods
and I suddenly had this vision

00:24:36.075 --> 00:24:39.845 align:middle line:84%
and I realized, well, I became
kind of one with the universe

00:24:39.845 --> 00:24:42.348 align:middle line:84%
and I saw this aspect
of the universe.

00:24:42.348 --> 00:24:45.051 align:middle line:84%
And let me tell you this
so much more, this is--

00:24:45.051 --> 00:24:47.853 align:middle line:84%
the black hole principle, as
I call it, is just a tiny bit

00:24:47.853 --> 00:24:49.589 align:middle line:90%
of what there is to come.

00:24:49.589 --> 00:24:51.891 align:middle line:84%
You know, when-- the
world is infinite,

00:24:51.891 --> 00:24:53.426 align:middle line:90%
there's so much knowledge.

00:24:53.426 --> 00:24:56.429 align:middle line:84%
So I realized that all
these particles are coming

00:24:56.429 --> 00:24:58.364 align:middle line:84%
out of black holes because
they're being created

00:24:58.364 --> 00:24:59.865 align:middle line:90%
by black holes.

00:24:59.865 --> 00:25:03.769 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is the-- mind
of God is kind of the center

00:25:03.769 --> 00:25:07.073 align:middle line:84%
of the black hole which is at
the center of all galaxies,

00:25:07.073 --> 00:25:08.708 align:middle line:84%
that's what astrophysics
have found,

00:25:08.708 --> 00:25:10.910 align:middle line:84%
black holes at the
center of all galaxies.

00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:15.982 align:middle line:84%
And it kind of spirals through
the higher dimensions beyond the

00:25:15.982 --> 00:25:17.350 align:middle line:90%
speed of light.

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:19.785 align:middle line:84%
So the speed of light is not
the speed limit of the universe,

00:25:19.785 --> 00:25:24.190 align:middle line:84%
it's just the limitation of
what we call our reality.

00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:26.659 align:middle line:84%
I now call it the
perception horizon.

00:25:26.659 --> 00:25:29.562 align:middle line:84%
So it gets to the edge of our
reality which is at the speed

00:25:29.562 --> 00:25:32.498 align:middle line:84%
of light and then the
light splits into two

00:25:32.498 --> 00:25:35.668 align:middle line:84%
and it becomes a particle matter
and a particle of energy matter.

00:25:35.668 --> 00:25:38.671 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we see
coming out, at the speed

00:25:38.671 --> 00:25:40.539 align:middle line:90%
of light coming out of galaxies.

00:25:40.539 --> 00:25:43.542 align:middle line:84%
So we can actually
measure the particles

00:25:43.542 --> 00:25:46.712 align:middle line:84%
and astrophysicists don't know
why these particles are coming

00:25:46.712 --> 00:25:49.915 align:middle line:84%
out of these black holes
at the speed of light.

00:25:49.915 --> 00:25:52.618 align:middle line:84%
But in my theory, the reason
why they're doing that is

00:25:52.618 --> 00:25:56.022 align:middle line:84%
because they're just
slow down to our reality

00:25:56.022 --> 00:25:57.690 align:middle line:90%
so that we can measure it.

00:25:57.690 --> 00:25:59.558 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:25:59.558 --> 00:26:02.528 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Starting too, we're
coming from a non-scientific.

00:26:02.528 --> 00:26:04.597 align:middle line:90%
I'm catching up, yes, yes.

00:26:04.597 --> 00:26:06.632 align:middle line:84%
>> MSL: So-- You
know, so I've realized

00:26:06.632 --> 00:26:09.435 align:middle line:84%
that these aren't the
destructive things,

00:26:09.435 --> 00:26:10.536 align:middle line:90%
they're actually creative

00:26:10.536 --> 00:26:13.472 align:middle line:84%
and that's the data
are actually backs up.

00:26:13.472 --> 00:26:16.242 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of like a
breathing process, you know,

00:26:16.242 --> 00:26:17.943 align:middle line:84%
like the breath of
the [inaudible].

00:26:17.943 --> 00:26:20.446 align:middle line:84%
You know, so then the
particles also go the other way,

00:26:20.446 --> 00:26:23.015 align:middle line:84%
they combine again and
they produce a matter

00:26:23.015 --> 00:26:26.419 align:middle line:84%
and antimatter combine again
and they produce light.

00:26:26.419 --> 00:26:29.088 align:middle line:84%
And that forms the gamma
rays that we can see

00:26:29.088 --> 00:26:30.289 align:middle line:90%
without telescopes as well.

00:26:30.289 --> 00:26:32.425 align:middle line:84%
So you get the edge
of the black hole,

00:26:32.425 --> 00:26:34.460 align:middle line:84%
there's this beautiful
breathing process,

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:37.863 align:middle line:84%
that it breathes one way
and it produces the matter

00:26:37.863 --> 00:26:39.832 align:middle line:84%
and antimatter and
that produces stars

00:26:39.832 --> 00:26:41.901 align:middle line:90%
and us and everything else.

00:26:41.901 --> 00:26:43.269 align:middle line:90%
And it also goes the other way

00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:46.472 align:middle line:84%
and that produces the gamma
ray burst, which is a type

00:26:46.472 --> 00:26:48.507 align:middle line:90%
of very fast type of light.

00:26:48.507 --> 00:26:50.409 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
that's happening

00:26:50.409 --> 00:26:53.212 align:middle line:90%
at every single level, so--

00:26:53.212 --> 00:26:55.114 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: What you mean
by at every single level?

00:26:55.114 --> 00:26:58.084 align:middle line:84%
>> MSL: It's not just black
holes at the center of galaxies,

00:26:58.084 --> 00:27:02.822 align:middle line:84%
I realized it's the same process
that's happening in atoms,

00:27:02.822 --> 00:27:06.392 align:middle line:84%
it's happening in our DNA, you
know, DNA winds and unwinds

00:27:06.392 --> 00:27:08.027 align:middle line:90%
and it produces lights.

00:27:08.027 --> 00:27:11.030 align:middle line:84%
You now, it happens at the
level of the sun, you know,

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:15.801 align:middle line:84%
the sun produces neutrinos,
antineutrinos and it was this--

00:27:15.801 --> 00:27:18.270 align:middle line:84%
if you see the sun it
keeps ejecting out.

00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:21.774 align:middle line:84%
You know, so there're all sorts
of evidence too much to go into.

00:27:21.774 --> 00:27:24.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if somebody wants to
know the scientific evidence

00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:26.412 align:middle line:84%
with all the references,
you know,

00:27:26.412 --> 00:27:27.446 align:middle line:90%
you'll have to read the book

00:27:27.446 --> 00:27:29.415 align:middle line:84%
because it's too
much to go into now.

00:27:29.415 --> 00:27:31.517 align:middle line:84%
But it's happening at
every single level,

00:27:31.517 --> 00:27:34.387 align:middle line:84%
the chakras are actually
black holes.

00:27:34.387 --> 00:27:37.923 align:middle line:84%
So it's the same black hole
process creating our bodies,

00:27:37.923 --> 00:27:40.626 align:middle line:84%
coming in from the higher
dimensions at different levels

00:27:40.626 --> 00:27:43.829 align:middle line:84%
and that produces our
bodies and our aura.

00:27:43.829 --> 00:27:47.566 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying that the auras
actually the antimatter region.

00:27:47.566 --> 00:27:50.970 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, the chakras are
also the major black holes

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:52.204 align:middle line:90%
of the body.

00:27:52.204 --> 00:27:54.707 align:middle line:84%
You know, so when you
actually piece it together,

00:27:54.707 --> 00:27:57.576 align:middle line:84%
you see that everything
is happening at--

00:27:57.576 --> 00:27:59.411 align:middle line:90%
in the same method, you know,

00:27:59.411 --> 00:28:02.214 align:middle line:84%
every single level
of the universe.

00:28:02.214 --> 00:28:06.719 align:middle line:84%
And so, at the center of
every single black hole,

00:28:06.719 --> 00:28:09.421 align:middle line:90%
is the same mind of God.

00:28:09.421 --> 00:28:14.160 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, the same
infinity that's at the center

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.896 align:middle line:84%
of the galactic black hole
is the same infinity that's

00:28:16.896 --> 00:28:19.865 align:middle line:90%
in your chakra, it's all one.

00:28:19.865 --> 00:28:20.833 align:middle line:90%
So, that--

00:28:20.833 --> 00:28:22.401 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: That means
interconnected.

00:28:22.401 --> 00:28:25.037 align:middle line:84%
>> MSL: Absolutely, everything
is interconnected and that's

00:28:25.037 --> 00:28:29.041 align:middle line:84%
when non-locality can happen
because it's an aspect

00:28:29.041 --> 00:28:32.778 align:middle line:84%
of every part of you
has an infinite aspect.

00:28:32.778 --> 00:28:36.348 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you--
we're all parts of God.

00:28:36.348 --> 00:28:38.784 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're being
created from the light of God,

00:28:38.784 --> 00:28:42.822 align:middle line:84%
the mind of God, at every single
moment, every single level.

00:28:43.956 --> 00:28:45.191 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Fantastic!

00:28:45.191 --> 00:28:47.626 align:middle line:84%
On the DNA level, what
have you discovered?

00:28:47.626 --> 00:28:49.695 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of people
speak of this during DNA

00:28:49.695 --> 00:28:52.932 align:middle line:84%
that actually would be an
interface to those dimension?

00:28:52.932 --> 00:28:55.534 align:middle line:84%
Is that something, what
is your research showing?

00:28:55.534 --> 00:28:57.203 align:middle line:84%
>> MSL: It's interesting
'cause, I mean,

00:28:57.203 --> 00:28:59.672 align:middle line:84%
I'm not somebody who's actually
out there doing the studies

00:28:59.672 --> 00:29:02.842 align:middle line:84%
but I've seen that the
studies where the DNA winds

00:29:02.842 --> 00:29:05.277 align:middle line:84%
and unwinds according to
the emotions of the person

00:29:05.277 --> 00:29:07.613 align:middle line:90%
that it's been taken from.

00:29:07.613 --> 00:29:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And, I've started to look at
things like biophoton emissions,

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:13.085 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
heard this on,

00:29:13.085 --> 00:29:16.021 align:middle line:84%
but let me tuck it,
talking about that.

00:29:16.021 --> 00:29:17.223 align:middle line:90%
but--

00:29:17.223 --> 00:29:18.023 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: You know, Lynne
actually was supposed

00:29:18.023 --> 00:29:18.824 align:middle line:90%
to interview her in London.

00:29:18.824 --> 00:29:20.659 align:middle line:90%
I have to follow-up on that,

00:29:20.659 --> 00:29:22.795 align:middle line:84%
I even Twittered her [inaudible]
France but since were I'm

00:29:22.795 --> 00:29:25.764 align:middle line:84%
in England I might as
well re-- yeah-- the--

00:29:25.764 --> 00:29:29.201 align:middle line:84%
you have to read this book on
the intention experiment is

00:29:29.201 --> 00:29:30.970 align:middle line:90%
that right and the bond?

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:33.505 align:middle line:84%
>> MSL: Yeah, she talk-- I think
she talks about the biophotons

00:29:33.505 --> 00:29:35.941 align:middle line:90%
in her first book, "The Field".

00:29:35.941 --> 00:29:38.911 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, and she talks
about Fritz-Albert Popp

00:29:38.911 --> 00:29:40.746 align:middle line:84%
who I actually knew
all before the book.

00:29:40.746 --> 00:29:43.249 align:middle line:84%
But she does such
a good explanation.

00:29:43.249 --> 00:29:46.552 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know, Fritz-Albert
Popp is a German scientist

00:29:46.552 --> 00:29:51.857 align:middle line:84%
who actually looked at the light
coming off the body and just

00:29:51.857 --> 00:29:56.161 align:middle line:84%
as the black holes in the
galactic level, they are pulsing

00:29:56.161 --> 00:29:58.497 align:middle line:84%
out and sometimes
the gamma rays,

00:29:58.497 --> 00:30:01.066 align:middle line:84%
sometimes they're
antimatter and matter.

00:30:01.066 --> 00:30:02.568 align:middle line:84%
The astrophysicists
don't know what this is

00:30:02.568 --> 00:30:05.638 align:middle line:84%
about because they think
everything is exploding,

00:30:05.638 --> 00:30:09.508 align:middle line:84%
but it's actually this gentle
pulsing from the galaxies.

00:30:09.508 --> 00:30:10.876 align:middle line:90%
It's the same in the body.

00:30:10.876 --> 00:30:15.848 align:middle line:84%
He discovered that a healthy
body will gently pulse light.

00:30:15.848 --> 00:30:20.386 align:middle line:84%
And so I think it's coming
from the DNA, from the cells,

00:30:20.386 --> 00:30:22.488 align:middle line:84%
you know, obviously we'd have
to do more studies on that.

00:30:22.488 --> 00:30:26.091 align:middle line:84%
And he also realized
that people who are sick,

00:30:26.091 --> 00:30:29.361 align:middle line:90%
the pulsing doesn't go strongly.

00:30:29.361 --> 00:30:33.966 align:middle line:84%
And there's was one moment
where I realized that, OK,

00:30:33.966 --> 00:30:38.771 align:middle line:84%
the work of certain oncologist
like cancer doctors and things

00:30:38.771 --> 00:30:42.741 align:middle line:84%
like that, have found, there's
a guy called Palmer [assumed

00:30:42.741 --> 00:30:43.909 align:middle line:90%
spelling], who have discovered

00:30:43.909 --> 00:30:46.111 align:middle line:84%
that when people get
an emotional shock,

00:30:46.111 --> 00:30:48.781 align:middle line:90%
it can lead to cancer.

00:30:48.781 --> 00:30:51.617 align:middle line:84%
So very, very sort of,
you know, strong shock.

00:30:51.617 --> 00:30:53.519 align:middle line:90%
I thought what is a shock?

00:30:53.519 --> 00:30:54.987 align:middle line:90%
A shock is when you get--

00:30:54.987 --> 00:30:58.357 align:middle line:84%
part of your consciousness
gets stuck in space and time.

00:30:58.357 --> 00:30:59.725 align:middle line:90%
What's space and time?

00:30:59.725 --> 00:31:01.627 align:middle line:90%
Antimatter, matter.

00:31:01.627 --> 00:31:05.931 align:middle line:84%
So what would happen is if
you get a shock, you know,

00:31:05.931 --> 00:31:07.766 align:middle line:90%
it stays your in memory?

00:31:07.766 --> 00:31:09.301 align:middle line:90%
And the shamans call it--

00:31:09.301 --> 00:31:10.536 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: You keep on--

00:31:10.536 --> 00:31:13.439 align:middle line:84%
>> MSL: You keep on
reiterating it on your on mind.

00:31:13.439 --> 00:31:17.309 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of healing, whether
it'd be shamanistic or whatever,

00:31:17.309 --> 00:31:19.244 align:middle line:84%
is going back to that
shock to uncover,

00:31:19.244 --> 00:31:21.780 align:middle line:84%
it could be subconscious,
and trying to heal,

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:24.583 align:middle line:84%
what you're actually doing is
you're bringing that antimatter

00:31:24.583 --> 00:31:28.020 align:middle line:84%
and matter of your consciousness
together into light.

00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:29.388 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Soul retrieval.

00:31:29.388 --> 00:31:31.357 align:middle line:84%
>>MSL: Soul retrieval, that's
what you're actually doing.

00:31:31.357 --> 00:31:35.060 align:middle line:84%
You're going back to pick the
particles of your consciousness

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:37.896 align:middle line:84%
from that and this what John
Demartini talks about, you know,

00:31:37.896 --> 00:31:39.131 align:middle line:84%
where he actually
bring the matter

00:31:39.131 --> 00:31:41.600 align:middle line:84%
and the antimatter
together in light.

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:46.071 align:middle line:84%
So I thought to myself now,
if I'm light, then the--

00:31:46.071 --> 00:31:48.640 align:middle line:84%
what will happen is
when you get a shock,

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:51.176 align:middle line:84%
you get a more antimatter
and matter.

00:31:51.176 --> 00:31:52.611 align:middle line:90%
Now when you get more antimatter

00:31:52.611 --> 00:31:55.280 align:middle line:84%
and matter that's
producing more stuff,

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:58.150 align:middle line:90%
more stuff, more cancer cells.

00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:02.354 align:middle line:84%
You know, so you're going
more to the balance of stuff.

00:32:02.354 --> 00:32:03.722 align:middle line:84%
You know, and I thought
to myself,

00:32:03.722 --> 00:32:07.726 align:middle line:84%
if that's right then the light
of the body should diminish

00:32:07.726 --> 00:32:10.029 align:middle line:84%
because you're not
going, you know,

00:32:10.029 --> 00:32:13.866 align:middle line:84%
you're not balancing anymore
and pulsing between the matter

00:32:13.866 --> 00:32:16.368 align:middle line:84%
and antimatter in
the light, you know,

00:32:16.368 --> 00:32:18.871 align:middle line:84%
when normal body is doing
this, it's breathing.

00:32:18.871 --> 00:32:21.707 align:middle line:84%
So when you get ill,
when you get cancer,

00:32:21.707 --> 00:32:22.775 align:middle line:90%
you're going more towards

00:32:22.775 --> 00:32:25.010 align:middle line:84%
that which is producing
more cancer cells.

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:29.248 align:middle line:84%
And I went to check the
studies, Fritz-Albert Popp,

00:32:29.248 --> 00:32:31.917 align:middle line:90%
and indeed that's what he found.

00:32:31.917 --> 00:32:35.421 align:middle line:84%
When people get cancer,
their light diminishes.

00:32:35.421 --> 00:32:37.790 align:middle line:84%
So that was the nervous moment
for me because I thought

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:41.860 align:middle line:84%
if I've got that wrong, then
maybe the whole theory is wrong.

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:44.863 align:middle line:84%
But so it even happens at
the level of your body.

00:32:44.863 --> 00:32:49.234 align:middle line:84%
So, I know that I'm probably not
known for this but, you know,

00:32:49.234 --> 00:32:53.405 align:middle line:84%
it's very, very important to
do the wonderful therapies

00:32:53.405 --> 00:32:56.241 align:middle line:84%
on emotions that
people are doing the

00:32:56.241 --> 00:32:59.111 align:middle line:84%
so many therapies
now, EFT, you know.

00:32:59.111 --> 00:33:02.748 align:middle line:84%
And really do those soul
retrievals and, you know,

00:33:02.748 --> 00:33:05.884 align:middle line:84%
that's the way to
actually bring the matter

00:33:05.884 --> 00:33:09.054 align:middle line:84%
and antimatter together of your
consciousness, it maybe stuck

00:33:09.054 --> 00:33:12.324 align:middle line:84%
in this life from something that
you experienced in this life,

00:33:12.324 --> 00:33:13.625 align:middle line:90%
or even in the past life.

00:33:13.625 --> 00:33:15.928 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Where does
it go when it's stuck?

00:33:15.928 --> 00:33:20.065 align:middle line:84%
>> MSL: It's just your
consciousness can be

00:33:20.065 --> 00:33:24.970 align:middle line:84%
subconsciously still ruminating
over something that happened.

00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:27.239 align:middle line:84%
And the trauma, you
know, kind of get stuck

00:33:27.239 --> 00:33:31.009 align:middle line:84%
in your consciousness
being and it's--

00:33:31.009 --> 00:33:35.280 align:middle line:84%
and I've actually done the
therapy myself where, you know,

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:39.918 align:middle line:84%
the past life personality,
you release the emotions

00:33:39.918 --> 00:33:41.720 align:middle line:90%
of what happened back then.

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:45.557 align:middle line:84%
And the past life personality
appears on that person's face.

00:33:45.557 --> 00:33:49.495 align:middle line:84%
The person completely shapes
shifts and the releases happened

00:33:49.495 --> 00:33:52.397 align:middle line:84%
and the person in
this life is free to--

00:33:52.397 --> 00:33:55.000 align:middle line:84%
feels a lot freer
from that emotion.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.735 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes it get's so light

00:33:56.735 --> 00:33:58.871 align:middle line:84%
that you can't remember
what it is.

00:33:58.871 --> 00:34:02.174 align:middle line:84%
Five minutes later you
cleared it and so that sort

00:34:02.174 --> 00:34:05.844 align:middle line:84%
of therapy whatever you're
drawn to, you know, is very,

00:34:05.844 --> 00:34:09.280 align:middle line:84%
very important to keep
that black hole breathing

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:11.283 align:middle line:90%
within your whole being as well.

00:34:11.283 --> 00:34:13.218 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Is there some
other practice through to

00:34:13.218 --> 00:34:15.921 align:middle line:90%
so that we can live fully?

00:34:15.921 --> 00:34:18.423 align:middle line:84%
>> MSL: I think doing
the emotions which a lot

00:34:18.423 --> 00:34:21.827 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual people are,
you know, kind of like,

00:34:21.827 --> 00:34:23.428 align:middle line:90%
oh you can't go into emotions,

00:34:23.428 --> 00:34:25.863 align:middle line:84%
it's dirty, that
stuff, you know.

00:34:25.863 --> 00:34:30.334 align:middle line:84%
It's very important and to not
do the whole positive thinking

00:34:30.334 --> 00:34:31.570 align:middle line:90%
and stuff.

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:33.972 align:middle line:84%
I think what Demartini
says is absolutely spot on.

00:34:33.972 --> 00:34:36.175 align:middle line:84%
You've got to do balance
thinking, you know.

00:34:36.175 --> 00:34:37.910 align:middle line:90%
So always think about--

00:34:37.910 --> 00:34:39.144 align:middle line:90%
>>Lilou: Zero point?

00:34:39.144 --> 00:34:40.778 align:middle line:84%
>> MSL: Yeah, the zero
point and the center.

00:34:40.778 --> 00:34:44.082 align:middle line:84%
The zero point is a light;
the polarities of the matter

00:34:44.082 --> 00:34:47.820 align:middle line:84%
and antimatter and our
journey in life really is

00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:52.224 align:middle line:84%
if a situation is bugging
us, we've got to look at, OK,

00:34:52.224 --> 00:34:54.059 align:middle line:90%
what's this reflecting in us?

00:34:54.059 --> 00:34:55.394 align:middle line:90%
Well how is this reflecting me?

00:34:55.394 --> 00:34:57.296 align:middle line:90%
Why is this triggering me?

00:34:57.296 --> 00:35:00.199 align:middle line:84%
And you can either do it
yourself, just meditate on it

00:35:00.199 --> 00:35:03.535 align:middle line:84%
or take out your computer,
ask some questions, you know,

00:35:03.535 --> 00:35:05.804 align:middle line:84%
or write it down in a piece
of-- it doesn't need to--

00:35:05.804 --> 00:35:07.673 align:middle line:84%
you don't need to
spend any money on this

00:35:07.673 --> 00:35:09.541 align:middle line:90%
if you're not drawn to do so.

00:35:09.541 --> 00:35:11.944 align:middle line:84%
You could get the
assistance of a therapist.

00:35:11.944 --> 00:35:13.612 align:middle line:84%
Just see how it's
reflecting you;

00:35:13.612 --> 00:35:16.815 align:middle line:84%
you will be amazed what comes
up from your subconscious.

00:35:16.815 --> 00:35:20.652 align:middle line:84%
And when-- once you see one, oh
this reminds me of, you know,

00:35:20.652 --> 00:35:23.488 align:middle line:84%
back when my mom said this
or, you know, whatever--

00:35:23.488 --> 00:35:25.591 align:middle line:90%
even it can go to past lives.

00:35:25.591 --> 00:35:29.728 align:middle line:84%
Then that situation once you
understand it and resolve it,

00:35:29.728 --> 00:35:31.663 align:middle line:90%
it collapses into light.

00:35:31.663 --> 00:35:34.533 align:middle line:84%
But if you continuously go
no, I got to think positively,

00:35:34.533 --> 00:35:36.869 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to push
that away, then--

00:35:36.869 --> 00:35:40.572 align:middle line:84%
and you don't take the
messages from your reality,

00:35:40.572 --> 00:35:44.409 align:middle line:84%
then you'll get it again and
again, because we're not here

00:35:44.409 --> 00:35:47.312 align:middle line:84%
to just be another
night and, you know.

00:35:47.312 --> 00:35:51.283 align:middle line:84%
We're here to learn because
that expands our frequency.

00:35:51.283 --> 00:35:54.586 align:middle line:84%
And the more that you look
at your reality and go, "OK,

00:35:54.586 --> 00:35:56.989 align:middle line:90%
how can I integrate this?

00:35:56.989 --> 00:35:58.624 align:middle line:84%
What lessons am I
learning from this?

00:35:58.624 --> 00:36:01.260 align:middle line:84%
How is this reflecting
me and do that work?"

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:03.428 align:middle line:84%
The more that-- it's not
about positive thinking,

00:36:03.428 --> 00:36:07.299 align:middle line:84%
it's about balance thinking
and you bring that into light

00:36:07.299 --> 00:36:11.937 align:middle line:84%
and your frequencies actually
expand, you're able to take

00:36:11.937 --> 00:36:14.740 align:middle line:84%
out more of the dimensions,
you know, if people really want

00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:17.542 align:middle line:84%
to know how to live with
multidimensional life,

00:36:17.542 --> 00:36:20.879 align:middle line:84%
you're able to take a
more of that and move

00:36:20.879 --> 00:36:23.515 align:middle line:84%
on to the next stage
of your life.

00:36:23.515 --> 00:36:27.920 align:middle line:84%
Whilst we're here, we never stop
learning, but it does expand.

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:30.455 align:middle line:84%
And if you know these
principles,

00:36:30.455 --> 00:36:31.823 align:middle line:90%
your life does change.

00:36:31.823 --> 00:36:34.359 align:middle line:84%
I talked about having the
magical life and it really--

00:36:34.359 --> 00:36:37.229 align:middle line:84%
you're probably-- it seems like
you're living a magical life

00:36:37.229 --> 00:36:41.333 align:middle line:84%
and it really does change
your life into a magical path

00:36:41.333 --> 00:36:45.037 align:middle line:84%
when you start to see reality
in this way that everything is

00:36:45.037 --> 00:36:47.406 align:middle line:84%
about reflection
and consciousness

00:36:47.406 --> 00:36:50.475 align:middle line:84%
and that you can integrate
that and become centered.

00:36:50.475 --> 00:36:51.877 align:middle line:84%
So it's not about
positive thinking,

00:36:51.877 --> 00:36:54.012 align:middle line:84%
it's about centered
and balance thinking.

00:36:54.012 --> 00:36:56.715 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Yeah, positive
or negative.

00:36:56.715 --> 00:36:58.684 align:middle line:84%
>> MSL: You got to
look at the polarities.

00:36:58.684 --> 00:37:01.086 align:middle line:84%
If something is bothering
you, why is it bothering you?

00:37:01.086 --> 00:37:04.489 align:middle line:84%
And then why is that polarity,
and integrate that polarity

00:37:04.489 --> 00:37:07.492 align:middle line:84%
so you bring the matter and
the antimatter into light.

00:37:07.492 --> 00:37:12.731 align:middle line:84%
Just like Demartini says, we
now have the black hole science,

00:37:12.731 --> 00:37:17.035 align:middle line:84%
the astrophysics to back up what
John Demartini has been saying

00:37:17.035 --> 00:37:18.370 align:middle line:90%
for years.

00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:21.707 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: What are you
working on now and how--

00:37:21.707 --> 00:37:22.808 align:middle line:90%
what is the implication?

00:37:22.808 --> 00:37:25.010 align:middle line:90%
I mean, when was this book out?

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:29.247 align:middle line:84%
>> MSL: It actually
came out in 2006.

00:37:29.247 --> 00:37:31.116 align:middle line:90%
The first paper was in 2003,

00:37:31.116 --> 00:37:32.985 align:middle line:84%
so it's 10 years
of the black hole--

00:37:32.985 --> 00:37:34.219 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Happy birthday!

00:37:34.219 --> 00:37:38.957 align:middle line:84%
>> MSL: And I'm still
finding so many new things.

00:37:38.957 --> 00:37:40.092 align:middle line:90%
For example--

00:37:40.092 --> 00:37:42.327 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Are you still
coherent with everything

00:37:42.327 --> 00:37:43.595 align:middle line:90%
that you all ready wrote?

00:37:43.595 --> 00:37:46.465 align:middle line:84%
>> MSL: I'm going to be
bringing out a new eBook edition

00:37:46.465 --> 00:37:47.866 align:middle line:90%
which is going to be updated

00:37:47.866 --> 00:37:51.536 align:middle line:84%
with all the new research 'cause
I made a number of predictions

00:37:51.536 --> 00:37:54.206 align:middle line:84%
in that book which
NASA have proved.

00:37:54.206 --> 00:37:56.475 align:middle line:84%
They don't actually
understand what I'm looking at.

00:37:56.475 --> 00:38:01.213 align:middle line:84%
For example, in that book I
said that, does black holes

00:38:01.213 --> 00:38:04.149 align:middle line:84%
in the supra-atmosphere are
called terrestrial gamma ray

00:38:04.149 --> 00:38:07.085 align:middle line:84%
flashes and they-- just the
same gamma rays that happen

00:38:07.085 --> 00:38:11.289 align:middle line:84%
in black holes and galaxies and
they happen in thunderstorms.

00:38:11.289 --> 00:38:15.394 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought thunderstorms,
what you get in thunderstorms,

00:38:15.394 --> 00:38:19.664 align:middle line:84%
rain, you get electrons
through the lightning, you know.

00:38:19.664 --> 00:38:23.568 align:middle line:84%
So I thought there's something
about water that gets released

00:38:23.568 --> 00:38:26.905 align:middle line:90%
in black hole activity.

00:38:26.905 --> 00:38:32.177 align:middle line:84%
They since they found water
even in the distant far reaches

00:38:32.177 --> 00:38:36.581 align:middle line:84%
of the cosmos, you know,
it's the galaxy really is

00:38:36.581 --> 00:38:40.585 align:middle line:84%
out into space, they found
water coming out of black holes.

00:38:40.585 --> 00:38:41.787 align:middle line:90%
So that's something

00:38:41.787 --> 00:38:44.122 align:middle line:84%
that I predicted back
then, that's an exclusive.

00:38:44.122 --> 00:38:45.690 align:middle line:90%
No, I've not told anybody else.

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:47.092 align:middle line:90%
It hasn't been published yet,

00:38:47.092 --> 00:38:50.228 align:middle line:84%
so you're getting
the exclusive today.

00:38:50.228 --> 00:38:52.964 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, stuff like
that I'll be updating.

00:38:52.964 --> 00:38:55.567 align:middle line:84%
Also being working
on a movie, so Punk--

00:38:55.567 --> 00:38:58.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: You have
lots of interview, huh?

00:38:58.370 --> 00:39:00.472 align:middle line:90%
You were telling me about that.

00:39:00.472 --> 00:39:02.474 align:middle line:84%
>> MSL: Yeah, let's
try all goods stuff,

00:39:02.474 --> 00:39:04.776 align:middle line:84%
like wonderful people
at Bristletone and--

00:39:04.776 --> 00:39:06.511 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Where's
the documentary?

00:39:06.511 --> 00:39:07.612 align:middle line:90%
>> MSL: Sorry?

00:39:07.612 --> 00:39:08.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: When is coming
out and what is it?

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:10.115 align:middle line:90%
We need to have it in Gaiam.

00:39:10.115 --> 00:39:14.719 align:middle line:84%
>> MSL: If people go to
punksciencemovie.com and sign

00:39:14.719 --> 00:39:17.622 align:middle line:84%
up there, you'll be the
first to know what's going

00:39:17.622 --> 00:39:22.427 align:middle line:84%
on so you can see the
trailer and it's very exciting

00:39:22.427 --> 00:39:25.530 align:middle line:84%
so I'm doing that, I'm
bringing in a number of--

00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:28.333 align:middle line:84%
if you want to actually
understand what's behind all

00:39:28.333 --> 00:39:30.502 align:middle line:90%
these living a magical life.

00:39:30.502 --> 00:39:33.638 align:middle line:84%
You see a lot of people
know that quantum physics

00:39:33.638 --> 00:39:36.041 align:middle line:84%
that gives you certain
level of reality

00:39:36.041 --> 00:39:37.742 align:middle line:90%
but this is the next level.

00:39:37.742 --> 00:39:39.978 align:middle line:84%
You know, we've heard quantum
physics for a hundred years.

00:39:39.978 --> 00:39:42.414 align:middle line:84%
This is-- the black hole
stuff is the next level,

00:39:42.414 --> 00:39:44.349 align:middle line:84%
so a number of people
around the world talking

00:39:44.349 --> 00:39:47.152 align:middle line:84%
about black holes
being fundamental now.

00:39:47.152 --> 00:39:49.554 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you have hear,
Nassim Haramein and people--

00:39:49.554 --> 00:39:50.722 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Yeah, I was
interviewing him in Kauai.

00:39:50.722 --> 00:39:51.389 align:middle line:90%
>> MSL: Exactly.

00:39:51.389 --> 00:39:52.624 align:middle line:90%
So it's--

00:39:52.624 --> 00:39:55.293 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: I miss you Kauai,
to all the Kauai people

00:39:55.293 --> 00:39:56.628 align:middle line:90%
because I know you're watching.

00:39:56.628 --> 00:39:59.331 align:middle line:84%
Oh my God, face and all the
whole gang, I love you guys.

00:39:59.331 --> 00:40:00.565 align:middle line:84%
I had to because
they're so awesome.

00:40:00.565 --> 00:40:01.500 align:middle line:90%
Have you been there?

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:02.601 align:middle line:90%
>> MSL: No, I'd love to.

00:40:02.601 --> 00:40:03.301 align:middle line:90%
I'd love--

00:40:03.301 --> 00:40:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>>Lilou: Magical land.

00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:06.371 align:middle line:84%
>> MSL: It's just
so-- so, you know,

00:40:06.371 --> 00:40:09.241 align:middle line:84%
it's coming to all
corners of the planet.

00:40:09.241 --> 00:40:13.645 align:middle line:84%
You know this new level of
reality and so it's time now.

00:40:13.645 --> 00:40:15.981 align:middle line:84%
So if people want to know
how to live like this,

00:40:15.981 --> 00:40:18.483 align:middle line:84%
how to apply the black
hole physics, I'm bringing

00:40:18.483 --> 00:40:21.186 align:middle line:90%
out a number of online courses.

00:40:21.186 --> 00:40:23.989 align:middle line:84%
