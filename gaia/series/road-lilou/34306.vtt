>> Lilou: Hello mu
beautiful co-creators.

00:00:11.312 --> 00:00:13.147 align:middle line:90%
Lilou here for Gaiam TV.

00:00:13.147 --> 00:00:14.515 align:middle line:90%
I'm on the road.

00:00:14.515 --> 00:00:15.983 align:middle line:84%
I'm really on the road because
I just came back from London

00:00:15.983 --> 00:00:17.585 align:middle line:84%
and now I'm in beautiful
Santa Barbara

00:00:17.585 --> 00:00:18.786 align:middle line:90%
in the mountains with you, Dain.

00:00:18.786 --> 00:00:19.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm so excited!

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.155 align:middle line:90%
>> Dain Heer: So I am I!

00:00:21.155 --> 00:00:23.023 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for having me in the
mountains of Santa Barbara!

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:24.825 align:middle line:84%
How does it get any
better than that?

00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:27.194 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And that's what this
conversation is about really.

00:00:27.194 --> 00:00:31.398 align:middle line:84%
Can life really get that
good, that juicy all the time?

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:34.735 align:middle line:84%
You're the author of Being You,
Changing Your World, is that?

00:00:34.735 --> 00:00:36.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Dain Heer: Yeah, Being
You, Changing the World.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.971 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Changing the World.

00:00:36.971 --> 00:00:38.372 align:middle line:90%
Author of nine books.

00:00:38.372 --> 00:00:41.509 align:middle line:84%
So, we're really going to get
into the world of possibilities,

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:42.810 align:middle line:90%
infinite possibilities.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.514 align:middle line:84%
Life really can be
excellent, great all the time?

00:00:46.514 --> 00:00:49.049 align:middle line:84%
>> Dain Heer: Well, I'd
say most of the time.

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:50.818 align:middle line:84%
You know, I still
have ups and downs.

00:00:50.818 --> 00:00:52.153 align:middle line:90%
And not even ups and downs,

00:00:52.153 --> 00:00:55.022 align:middle line:84%
it's like I still have downs
sometimes, but they're just

00:00:55.022 --> 00:00:57.525 align:middle line:84%
so much less than they
were before, well,

00:00:57.525 --> 00:00:58.792 align:middle line:90%
before I'd say 13 years ago,

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:00.961 align:middle line:84%
I came across something
called Access Consciousness,

00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:05.032 align:middle line:84%
and using those tools, it's
like life just started going

00:01:05.032 --> 00:01:06.634 align:middle line:90%
like this and I think

00:01:06.634 --> 00:01:08.269 align:middle line:84%
if somebody tells you you're
never going to be down,

00:01:08.269 --> 00:01:10.738 align:middle line:84%
they're lying to you or trying
to sell you something, you know?

00:01:10.738 --> 00:01:13.908 align:middle line:84%
But the, the lows
get a lot less low

00:01:13.908 --> 00:01:15.643 align:middle line:84%
and the highs get a lot
higher, and you're just,

00:01:15.643 --> 00:01:17.010 align:middle line:90%
keep it more of the time.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.112 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yes.

00:01:18.112 --> 00:01:19.947 align:middle line:84%
So you were a chiropractor,
is that right?

00:01:19.947 --> 00:01:21.816 align:middle line:84%
And how did this
happen, because I,

00:01:21.816 --> 00:01:24.552 align:middle line:84%
I hear that you this kind
of suicidal thoughts?

00:01:24.552 --> 00:01:25.186 align:middle line:90%
>> Dain Heer.

00:01:25.186 --> 00:01:26.554 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, truly.

00:01:26.554 --> 00:01:28.422 align:middle line:84%
13 years ago, I was at a place
where I was literally going

00:01:28.422 --> 00:01:31.158 align:middle line:84%
to kill myself if things
didn't change, and I was one

00:01:31.158 --> 00:01:32.960 align:middle line:84%
of those people who was
doing everything they could

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.328 align:middle line:90%
to try to create change.

00:01:34.328 --> 00:01:36.462 align:middle line:84%
I would read books, I would
go to seminars, and the number

00:01:36.462 --> 00:01:38.966 align:middle line:84%
of times I'd go to a
seminar and feel so pumped

00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:40.534 align:middle line:90%
by Sunday night and be like yes!

00:01:40.534 --> 00:01:42.002 align:middle line:90%
I finally found the answer!

00:01:42.002 --> 00:01:44.205 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it's going to
happen this time!

00:01:44.205 --> 00:01:47.974 align:middle line:84%
And by Wednesday morning, I was
buried again in the unhappiness

00:01:47.974 --> 00:01:50.110 align:middle line:84%
and the feeling like
I couldn't it.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.111 align:middle line:84%
And that happened
one time too many

00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:54.415 align:middle line:84%
and I said universe
look, you got six months.

00:01:54.415 --> 00:01:57.218 align:middle line:84%
Either my life really changes
this time, either I really,

00:01:57.218 --> 00:01:58.986 align:middle line:84%
actually start to
have the possibilities

00:01:58.986 --> 00:02:00.387 align:middle line:84%
that I know are available
and actually create them

00:02:00.387 --> 00:02:01.655 align:middle line:90%
or I'm killing myself.

00:02:01.655 --> 00:02:02.957 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Oh, so you actually
challenged the universe,

00:02:02.957 --> 00:02:03.691 align:middle line:90%
that's how it went?

00:02:03.691 --> 00:02:04.692 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: Yeah.

00:02:04.692 --> 00:02:05.659 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like
David and Goliath.

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.161 align:middle line:84%
You know, little
Dain going universe!

00:02:07.161 --> 00:02:08.829 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:10.197 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes you
get to that point

00:02:10.197 --> 00:02:11.932 align:middle line:84%
where you don't care what
it is, you don't care,

00:02:11.932 --> 00:02:14.635 align:middle line:84%
it's like you have to make
that demand sometimes.

00:02:14.635 --> 00:02:17.238 align:middle line:84%
In order to be willing to let
go of what you considered was

00:02:17.238 --> 00:02:20.374 align:middle line:84%
so real in the past in order
to let something new in.

00:02:20.374 --> 00:02:22.843 align:middle line:84%
And I did, and literally
a week later,

00:02:22.843 --> 00:02:25.312 align:middle line:84%
I saw an ad for something
called Access Consciousness,

00:02:25.312 --> 00:02:27.615 align:middle line:84%
and it said, "Access,
all of life comes to me

00:02:27.615 --> 00:02:29.783 align:middle line:90%
with ease and joy and glory."

00:02:29.783 --> 00:02:32.853 align:middle line:84%
And of course I was like, no, uh
huh, I wanted to kill the girl

00:02:32.853 --> 00:02:34.054 align:middle line:90%
that put the ad in the paper.

00:02:34.054 --> 00:02:35.556 align:middle line:84%
I was like you don't know
what my life is like!

00:02:35.556 --> 00:02:37.124 align:middle line:84%
My life is pain,
suffering, and gory,

00:02:37.124 --> 00:02:38.425 align:middle line:90%
what are you talking about?

00:02:38.425 --> 00:02:40.628 align:middle line:84%
You know? And I look, you
know, I look back on it now.

00:02:40.628 --> 00:02:41.729 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: You people
that are happy!

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:42.663 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: Exactly!

00:02:42.663 --> 00:02:43.631 align:middle line:84%
What are you talking
about happy?

00:02:43.631 --> 00:02:46.333 align:middle line:84%
Go away happy schmappy,
bamp bamp!

00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:47.668 align:middle line:90%
You know? And it's so funny

00:02:47.668 --> 00:02:49.570 align:middle line:84%
because I literally threw the
paper away and it was here

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.872 align:middle line:84%
in Santa Barbara where
the, the local paper comes

00:02:51.872 --> 00:02:53.641 align:middle line:90%
out once a week, and I'm leafing

00:02:53.641 --> 00:02:55.109 align:middle line:84%
through the paper the
following week looking

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:56.477 align:middle line:90%
for nothing in particular.

00:02:56.477 --> 00:02:59.613 align:middle line:84%
I see this tiny, little ad,
"Access, all of life comes to me

00:02:59.613 --> 00:03:01.548 align:middle line:90%
with ease and joy and glory."

00:03:01.548 --> 00:03:03.217 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to get
really angry again,

00:03:03.217 --> 00:03:05.552 align:middle line:84%
and then something stopped
me and I remembered something

00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:07.087 align:middle line:90%
that I heard a long time ago.

00:03:07.087 --> 00:03:09.456 align:middle line:84%
Whether you love something or
hate it, there's something there

00:03:09.456 --> 00:03:11.525 align:middle line:84%
for you, you just don't
know what it is yet.

00:03:11.525 --> 00:03:13.494 align:middle line:84%
So I called the girl and
I'm like, what do you do?

00:03:13.494 --> 00:03:14.995 align:middle line:84%
And she said we do
all kinds of stuff.

00:03:14.995 --> 00:03:17.097 align:middle line:84%
And she actually
sounds genuinely happy,

00:03:17.097 --> 00:03:19.967 align:middle line:84%
which was very disarming because
I was pissed off at happy people

00:03:19.967 --> 00:03:21.035 align:middle line:90%
at that time in my life.

00:03:21.035 --> 00:03:22.803 align:middle line:84%
You know? If you've
ever been depressed

00:03:22.803 --> 00:03:24.505 align:middle line:84%
and you see happy people
and you want to kill them,

00:03:24.505 --> 00:03:25.939 align:middle line:90%
you know what I'm talking about.

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:29.276 align:middle line:84%
And it's so funny to acknowledge
that that's where I was then,

00:03:29.276 --> 00:03:31.345 align:middle line:84%
but literally, she
sounded happy.

00:03:31.345 --> 00:03:32.546 align:middle line:90%
And I said okay, what do you do?

00:03:32.546 --> 00:03:34.748 align:middle line:84%
And she said all kinds of
stuff, but a good place

00:03:34.748 --> 00:03:36.884 align:middle line:84%
to start would be with
this stuff we call the bar.

00:03:36.884 --> 00:03:39.286 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I went and
I had this session.

00:03:39.286 --> 00:03:43.157 align:middle line:84%
I started giggling from the
moment we started the session,

00:03:43.157 --> 00:03:45.993 align:middle line:84%
an hour and 15 minutes later,
after giggling for an hour

00:03:45.993 --> 00:03:48.262 align:middle line:84%
and 15 minutes, I got up
and I was like oh my god,

00:03:48.262 --> 00:03:50.297 align:middle line:84%
has the world always
been this beautiful?

00:03:50.297 --> 00:03:52.333 align:middle line:84%
But in contrast, everything
else I'd ever done,

00:03:52.333 --> 00:03:53.634 align:middle line:90%
it didn't go away.

00:03:53.634 --> 00:03:56.537 align:middle line:84%
Because what she did was she
also gave me tools to use

00:03:56.537 --> 00:04:00.074 align:middle line:84%
when it felt like the universe
was, you know, going to, blah,

00:04:00.074 --> 00:04:02.443 align:middle line:84%
easy for me to say, going to
contract back into my world

00:04:02.443 --> 00:04:03.744 align:middle line:90%
and onto my head again?

00:04:03.744 --> 00:04:06.580 align:middle line:84%
She gave me tools to
go no, we can undo it.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.749 align:middle line:84%
And it was those tools, in
addition to the sessions

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:10.984 align:middle line:84%
that we did, that really
started changing things.

00:04:10.984 --> 00:04:13.921 align:middle line:84%
So what happened was when
I went to her and I wanted

00:04:13.921 --> 00:04:16.656 align:middle line:84%
to kill myself I was like
this, and it opened up a sense

00:04:16.656 --> 00:04:19.192 align:middle line:84%
of space and I remember it
being one of the first times

00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:20.961 align:middle line:84%
in my life I knew
everything was okay,

00:04:20.961 --> 00:04:23.330 align:middle line:84%
everything always had been,
and everything always would be.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.333 align:middle line:84%
And then we'd, you know, the
universe would try to sit

00:04:26.333 --> 00:04:28.635 align:middle line:84%
on my head again, and
I'd use a tool and,

00:04:28.635 --> 00:04:30.304 align:middle line:84%
and the space would
be there again.

00:04:30.304 --> 00:04:32.039 align:middle line:84%
Because I think what a
lot of us are missing

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:33.907 align:middle line:84%
in our lives is a
sense of space.

00:04:33.907 --> 00:04:35.609 align:middle line:90%
A sense of like hey, it's okay.

00:04:35.609 --> 00:04:37.711 align:middle line:84%
Wherever you live, wherever
you are its like having a sense

00:04:37.711 --> 00:04:39.913 align:middle line:84%
of like [sigh] I
can breathe again.

00:04:39.913 --> 00:04:41.348 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Where there's
a voice all the time,

00:04:41.348 --> 00:04:43.817 align:middle line:84%
it seems like there's not enough
space, because it's running,

00:04:43.817 --> 00:04:45.519 align:middle line:90%
it's in tape, it's in loop even.

00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:46.620 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: All the time.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.654 align:middle line:90%
All the time.

00:04:47.654 --> 00:04:48.956 align:middle line:84%
And you know what,
what's interesting?

00:04:48.956 --> 00:04:50.557 align:middle line:84%
Is that's one of the first
tools she gave me was a way

00:04:50.557 --> 00:04:51.992 align:middle line:90%
to eliminate that.

00:04:51.992 --> 00:04:53.827 align:middle line:84%
And I needed that
so dynamically,

00:04:53.827 --> 00:04:56.430 align:middle line:84%
because one of the things
that she talked to me about

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.298 align:middle line:84%
and now I talk to all kinds
of other people about,

00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:00.234 align:middle line:84%
is 98 percent of your
thoughts, your feelings,

00:05:00.234 --> 00:05:02.936 align:middle line:84%
and your emotions, don't
actually belong to you.

00:05:02.936 --> 00:05:04.171 align:middle line:90%
You're actually picking them

00:05:04.171 --> 00:05:06.407 align:middle line:84%
up like a big psychic radio
received from everyone

00:05:06.407 --> 00:05:08.776 align:middle line:84%
around you all the time
thinking they're yours.

00:05:08.776 --> 00:05:11.078 align:middle line:84%
So if you can imagine if
98 percent of your sadness,

00:05:11.078 --> 00:05:13.347 align:middle line:84%
98 percent of your frustration,
98 percent of your anger,

00:05:13.347 --> 00:05:15.983 align:middle line:84%
98 percent of your judgements,
98 percent of the yuck,

00:05:15.983 --> 00:05:19.219 align:middle line:84%
98 percent of feeling like you
can't do it, wasn't even yours?

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:22.923 align:middle line:84%
If there were an easy way to go,
it's not mine, okay, bye bye,

00:05:22.923 --> 00:05:24.591 align:middle line:90%
that's actually what happens.

00:05:24.591 --> 00:05:25.859 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So this is what
you do each time there is

00:05:25.859 --> 00:05:27.227 align:middle line:90%
these thoughts.

00:05:27.227 --> 00:05:28.629 align:middle line:90%
It's POC.

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:30.030 align:middle line:84%
>> D.H.: Yeah, there's POC and
POD, that's another good one.

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.732 align:middle line:84%
You can use that
to change anything.

00:05:31.732 --> 00:05:34.668 align:middle line:84%
And this particular one is you
go who does this belong to?

00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:36.603 align:middle line:84%
To the thought, the feeling,
the emotion, the judgement,

00:05:36.603 --> 00:05:38.005 align:middle line:84%
the heaviness, and
if it lightens

00:05:38.005 --> 00:05:39.606 align:middle line:90%
up at all, it's not yours.

00:05:39.606 --> 00:05:41.642 align:middle line:84%
You just return it to sender
and you don't have to know

00:05:41.642 --> 00:05:44.078 align:middle line:84%
who the sender is even,
because if it's not yours,

00:05:44.078 --> 00:05:45.612 align:middle line:90%
you can't change it.

00:05:45.612 --> 00:05:47.347 align:middle line:84%
You can only change the
stuff that is yours.

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:48.916 align:middle line:84%
But what most of us
are doing is trying

00:05:48.916 --> 00:05:50.050 align:middle line:90%
to change all the stuff that's

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.086 align:middle line:84%
in our heads thinking
it's ours, but it's not.

00:05:53.086 --> 00:05:55.456 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens, you
ask, who does this belong to?

00:05:55.456 --> 00:05:58.559 align:middle line:84%
And if it lightens up, it's not
yours, and then you're done.

00:05:58.559 --> 00:06:00.527 align:middle line:84%
You're just like oh
cool, it's not mine,

00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:03.197 align:middle line:84%
and the way it works is when
you actually acknowledge

00:06:03.197 --> 00:06:06.166 align:middle line:84%
that it's not yours, that's
what starts setting you free.

00:06:06.166 --> 00:06:07.334 align:middle line:90%
So, the way it works for most

00:06:07.334 --> 00:06:08.969 align:middle line:84%
of us is we're having
a really good day.

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:11.839 align:middle line:84%
We are so on, you know, we're
in the hills of Santa Barbara,

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:13.674 align:middle line:84%
everything is beautiful,
you know, it's sunny,

00:06:13.674 --> 00:06:16.543 align:middle line:84%
it's not 100 degrees like
where I live now in Texas.

00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:19.079 align:middle line:84%
Ah! And, you know, so you're
having a great day and all

00:06:19.079 --> 00:06:21.715 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden you're driving down
the road and you feel like rage

00:06:21.715 --> 00:06:25.486 align:middle line:84%
or anger or, or fear or
sadness, but wait a minute,

00:06:25.486 --> 00:06:26.954 align:middle line:84%
what if it's actually
the person driving

00:06:26.954 --> 00:06:28.322 align:middle line:90%
down the road next to you?

00:06:28.322 --> 00:06:29.890 align:middle line:84%
Who just had an argument with
their husband or something?

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.758 align:middle line:84%
And they don't, and
they're really furious,

00:06:31.758 --> 00:06:33.460 align:middle line:90%
and you pick up on that energy.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.329 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's not yours.

00:06:35.329 --> 00:06:36.630 align:middle line:84%
So you can't do anything
about it,

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:37.664 align:middle line:90%
because it's a person over here.

00:06:37.664 --> 00:06:39.065 align:middle line:84%
So you go who does
that belong to?

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:41.101 align:middle line:84%
It lightens up and then
you're happy again.

00:06:41.101 --> 00:06:44.404 align:middle line:84%
And it literally, I know it
sounds so simple, and so,

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:46.807 align:middle line:84%
and we're so used to
doing things and believing

00:06:46.807 --> 00:06:49.309 align:middle line:84%
that the only things that work
are the things that take a lot

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:50.944 align:middle line:84%
of work and a lot of
effort and are hard work,

00:06:50.944 --> 00:06:52.779 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't have to be that way.

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:56.683 align:middle line:84%
You know, the universe,
itself, is really based on ease.

00:06:56.683 --> 00:06:58.752 align:middle line:84%
Most of us aren't aware
of that and I get it

00:06:58.752 --> 00:07:01.889 align:middle line:84%
because I wasn't either 13 years
ago, which is why I want to talk

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:03.357 align:middle line:84%
to people about it;
I want them to know

00:07:03.357 --> 00:07:04.525 align:middle line:90%
that it's actually possible.

00:07:04.525 --> 00:07:05.826 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So we're
looking in the wrong places

00:07:05.826 --> 00:07:07.961 align:middle line:84%
or asking ourselves
the wrong questions?

00:07:07.961 --> 00:07:09.329 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: Most of the time, yeah.

00:07:09.329 --> 00:07:12.332 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, what most of us,
we don't even ask questions.

00:07:12.332 --> 00:07:13.800 align:middle line:90%
Which is an interesting thing.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.936 align:middle line:84%
Most people, their primary
question is what's wrong

00:07:15.936 --> 00:07:16.870 align:middle line:90%
with me?

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:18.305 align:middle line:84%
You know? Which is
not a question,

00:07:18.305 --> 00:07:20.707 align:middle line:84%
that's already a conclusion
that there's something wrong.

00:07:20.707 --> 00:07:22.609 align:middle line:84%
And now you're just,
now your job is to find

00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:24.044 align:middle line:90%
out what it is that's wrong.

00:07:24.044 --> 00:07:26.113 align:middle line:84%
Let's try a different
question, let's try what's right

00:07:26.113 --> 00:07:27.814 align:middle line:90%
about me that I'm not getting?

00:07:27.814 --> 00:07:30.350 align:middle line:84%
What's right about this
situation that I'm not getting?

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:33.086 align:middle line:84%
So there are these other ways,
you know, these other questions

00:07:33.086 --> 00:07:35.589 align:middle line:84%
that we can ask that literally
just asking them opens a

00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:37.491 align:middle line:84%
different doorway
of possibility.

00:07:37.491 --> 00:07:38.659 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I'm
interested in.

00:07:38.659 --> 00:07:41.428 align:middle line:84%
Because what I see is
if we can actually get

00:07:41.428 --> 00:07:43.163 align:middle line:84%
that there are different
choices available,

00:07:43.163 --> 00:07:45.565 align:middle line:84%
and then actually allow
ourselves to choose them,

00:07:45.565 --> 00:07:47.634 align:middle line:84%
we've got totally
different possibilities

00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:49.369 align:middle line:84%
for what we can create
as our lives.

00:07:49.369 --> 00:07:51.305 align:middle line:84%
And if we do that, and
enough of us do it,

00:07:51.305 --> 00:07:54.007 align:middle line:84%
we actually change the
level of happiness and peace

00:07:54.007 --> 00:07:55.442 align:middle line:90%
and ease on the planet.

00:07:55.442 --> 00:07:58.245 align:middle line:84%
We actually can come together
and contribute to each other

00:07:58.245 --> 00:08:00.881 align:middle line:84%
and support each other in a
way that's not possible now.

00:08:00.881 --> 00:08:03.183 align:middle line:84%
Cause how can people support
each other and contribute

00:08:03.183 --> 00:08:06.320 align:middle line:84%
to each other when they're
so busy working on the trauma

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.788 align:middle line:84%
and drama and trying
to do it and trying

00:08:07.788 --> 00:08:10.057 align:middle line:90%
to just get to a place of level.

00:08:10.057 --> 00:08:12.225 align:middle line:84%
You know? It's like we
deserve far more than that.

00:08:12.225 --> 00:08:14.761 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So it's like
bringing really a lot more light

00:08:14.761 --> 00:08:18.899 align:middle line:84%
in the space and then light
kind of dissolve the rest, huh?

00:08:18.899 --> 00:08:21.768 align:middle line:84%
Or, or because of that
space, because of that, yeah,

00:08:21.768 --> 00:08:24.237 align:middle line:84%
that space of possibility
then things,

00:08:24.237 --> 00:08:25.839 align:middle line:90%
really good things can show up.

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:26.974 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise it's dark!

00:08:26.974 --> 00:08:28.308 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: Yeah, exactly.

00:08:28.308 --> 00:08:30.777 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly what it
is, it's bringing that light,

00:08:30.777 --> 00:08:33.046 align:middle line:84%
and one of the things
that you want to know is

00:08:33.046 --> 00:08:35.482 align:middle line:84%
that what's true always
makes you feel lighter.

00:08:35.482 --> 00:08:37.284 align:middle line:90%
A lie always makes you heavier.

00:08:37.284 --> 00:08:39.886 align:middle line:84%
So, part of the reason so many
people are walking around with

00:08:39.886 --> 00:08:42.289 align:middle line:84%
so much heaviness is because
they're buying all kinds

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:44.057 align:middle line:84%
of things that aren't
really true for them,

00:08:44.057 --> 00:08:46.660 align:middle line:84%
trying to make them true
with their energy, you know,

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:48.662 align:middle line:84%
it's like they're giving
their life's energy

00:08:48.662 --> 00:08:50.831 align:middle line:84%
to make things true for
them when that aren't.

00:08:50.831 --> 00:08:53.533 align:middle line:84%
When you stop doing that,
it's a amazing the amount

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:55.802 align:middle line:84%
of energy you have for
creation, for generation,

00:08:55.802 --> 00:08:58.005 align:middle line:84%
for travelling the world,
you know, creating change

00:08:58.005 --> 00:08:59.239 align:middle line:84%
in people's lives,
like you're doing.

00:08:59.239 --> 00:09:01.108 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's like,
you know what I mean?

00:09:01.108 --> 00:09:02.976 align:middle line:84%
But you got to this place
in your life where you're

00:09:02.976 --> 00:09:04.811 align:middle line:84%
like okay, what I was
doing, enough of that.

00:09:04.811 --> 00:09:06.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing to do something for
me, I'm going to do something

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.515 align:middle line:84%
for fun, I'm going to do
something that will contribute

00:09:08.515 --> 00:09:10.217 align:middle line:84%
to people and change
their lives.

00:09:10.217 --> 00:09:11.852 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Because it's
immediately what we want to do,

00:09:11.852 --> 00:09:15.856 align:middle line:84%
contribute, once, once we're
not on about our own stuff.

00:09:15.856 --> 00:09:17.457 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: Yes, exactly.

00:09:17.457 --> 00:09:18.792 align:middle line:90%
Cause that's out nature.

00:09:18.792 --> 00:09:21.828 align:middle line:84%
You know? That's our nature
is to contribute to others,

00:09:21.828 --> 00:09:23.797 align:middle line:84%
and I think one of the
things that depresses people

00:09:23.797 --> 00:09:26.933 align:middle line:84%
and makes them so happy is they
would really love to be able

00:09:26.933 --> 00:09:30.837 align:middle line:84%
to do that, but they feel like
they're so buried in their lives

00:09:30.837 --> 00:09:34.041 align:middle line:84%
and buried and not being able
to even handle their own stuff,

00:09:34.041 --> 00:09:36.710 align:middle line:84%
pay their own rent, if you
will, and do their own thing,

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:39.346 align:middle line:84%
that they feel like until I get
this handled, I can't contribute

00:09:39.346 --> 00:09:41.548 align:middle line:84%
to other people and it's
part of what makes them go

00:09:41.548 --> 00:09:42.683 align:middle line:90%
into judgement of them.

00:09:42.683 --> 00:09:45.118 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: I know you go
into money conversation,

00:09:45.118 --> 00:09:47.754 align:middle line:84%
body conversation, relationship,
money is a big one, huh?

00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:50.390 align:middle line:84%
As to, oh, only when
I have enough money,

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:51.858 align:middle line:90%
I can then do this work.

00:09:51.858 --> 00:09:53.894 align:middle line:84%
It's easy; it's spiritual,
no, not now.

00:09:53.894 --> 00:09:54.995 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: Right.

00:09:54.995 --> 00:09:56.697 align:middle line:84%
Exactly. It's like, um,
I'll get back to you

00:09:56.697 --> 00:09:58.865 align:middle line:84%
on my whole personal growth
thing once I pay the rent.

00:09:58.865 --> 00:09:59.833 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:09:59.833 --> 00:10:01.301 align:middle line:84%
But what people don't
realize is.

00:10:01.301 --> 00:10:03.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: That is another
conversation that is heavy, huh?

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:04.104 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: Yeah.

00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:04.871 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:10:04.871 --> 00:10:06.106 align:middle line:90%
One, one of the heaviest.

00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:08.875 align:middle line:84%
Especially since, oh, I
don't know, 2008, you know?

00:10:08.875 --> 00:10:11.011 align:middle line:84%
You know, since the
global financial crisis,

00:10:11.011 --> 00:10:12.512 align:middle line:90%
or the worldwide depression,

00:10:12.512 --> 00:10:14.147 align:middle line:84%
whatever you want to
call it, you know?

00:10:14.147 --> 00:10:17.050 align:middle line:84%
It's like especially since
then, but that's another example

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:19.319 align:middle line:84%
of that, who the heck
does this belong to thing?

00:10:19.319 --> 00:10:20.721 align:middle line:90%
Because a lot of people

00:10:20.721 --> 00:10:24.658 align:middle line:84%
around the world went [yelling]
financially and so you pick it

00:10:24.658 --> 00:10:27.160 align:middle line:84%
up even more than you ever
have and then think it's yours,

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.062 align:middle line:84%
and then you pass it
on to other people,

00:10:29.062 --> 00:10:31.665 align:middle line:84%
because you're vibrating
it even more, well,

00:10:31.665 --> 00:10:33.467 align:middle line:84%
what if we all collectively
went, wait a minute,

00:10:33.467 --> 00:10:34.835 align:middle line:90%
who does this belong to?

00:10:34.835 --> 00:10:36.937 align:middle line:84%
And then the one person who's
thinking it can have it back

00:10:36.937 --> 00:10:38.505 align:middle line:84%
and hopefully change
it, you know?

00:10:38.505 --> 00:10:39.372 align:middle line:90%
[Laughing]

00:10:39.372 --> 00:10:39.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: I love it!

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:40.741 align:middle line:90%
I love it!

00:10:40.741 --> 00:10:42.042 align:middle line:90%
Back to the bankers.

00:10:42.042 --> 00:10:43.910 align:middle line:84%
I shouldn't say that, sorry
for the bankers watching.

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:45.212 align:middle line:90%
No, you're great!

00:10:45.212 --> 00:10:46.046 align:middle line:84%
>> D.H.: I'm sure there are
lots of bankers watching,

00:10:46.046 --> 00:10:48.749 align:middle line:90%
she didn't mean that [laughter].

00:10:48.749 --> 00:10:51.518 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So the, the POC,
POC, or how do you call it?

00:10:51.518 --> 00:10:53.754 align:middle line:84%
That one, because
that's a related.

00:10:53.754 --> 00:10:55.155 align:middle line:84%
>> D.H.: Yeah, they're,
they're related.

00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:57.924 align:middle line:84%
And, and the thing is with POC
and POD, you can literally start

00:10:57.924 --> 00:11:00.794 align:middle line:84%
to change anything in your life
you've ever wanted to change.

00:11:00.794 --> 00:11:01.895 align:middle line:90%
And the way it works is this.

00:11:01.895 --> 00:11:02.996 align:middle line:84%
>>> Lilou: You really
like that one.

00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:05.766 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you, his
little hand [laughing].

00:11:05.766 --> 00:11:08.034 align:middle line:84%
>> D.H.: I get like a big
6-year-old, I'm like oh,

00:11:08.034 --> 00:11:09.403 align:middle line:90%
I get to share POC and POD.

00:11:09.403 --> 00:11:11.972 align:middle line:84%
You know? Cause,
cause it really has.

00:11:11.972 --> 00:11:14.307 align:middle line:84%
It's like it's changed
my life so much

00:11:14.307 --> 00:11:15.742 align:middle line:84%
and it's changed the
lives of the people

00:11:15.742 --> 00:11:18.111 align:middle line:84%
that I get the fortune
of working with so much,

00:11:18.111 --> 00:11:19.646 align:middle line:90%
it's like, and it's there.

00:11:19.646 --> 00:11:21.648 align:middle line:90%
You know? It's like use it!

00:11:21.648 --> 00:11:22.682 align:middle line:90%
Why not? You know?

00:11:22.682 --> 00:11:24.551 align:middle line:84%
For me it's kind of
like a magic wand.

00:11:24.551 --> 00:11:26.086 align:middle line:84%
It's like when I was
a little kid, I mean,

00:11:26.086 --> 00:11:27.420 align:middle line:90%
when you were a little kid,

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.655 align:middle line:84%
didn't you know you should
have a magic wand and be able

00:11:28.655 --> 00:11:30.824 align:middle line:90%
to change anything, right?

00:11:30.824 --> 00:11:32.125 align:middle line:90%
Well it's kind of like that.

00:11:32.125 --> 00:11:34.861 align:middle line:84%
And, literally, what it does
is anyplace in your life

00:11:34.861 --> 00:11:36.029 align:middle line:90%
where you're feeling stuck.

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:37.764 align:middle line:84%
Anyplace you're feeling
locked up.

00:11:37.764 --> 00:11:40.167 align:middle line:84%
What you do is you
ask to undo it.

00:11:40.167 --> 00:11:42.469 align:middle line:90%
To destroy the limitation

00:11:42.469 --> 00:11:44.905 align:middle line:84%
and to uncreate it means
take your creative energy

00:11:44.905 --> 00:11:46.673 align:middle line:84%
out of creating limitation
and put it

00:11:46.673 --> 00:11:48.442 align:middle line:90%
into creating possibilities.

00:11:48.442 --> 00:11:51.511 align:middle line:84%
And so, what you do is,
like, want to take a subject

00:11:51.511 --> 00:11:52.846 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah, relationship.

00:11:52.846 --> 00:11:56.116 align:middle line:84%
>> D.H.: Relationship,
just another quick one.

00:11:56.116 --> 00:11:57.284 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter] I love it.

00:11:57.284 --> 00:11:59.186 align:middle line:84%
So far we've talked about
money, relationship.

00:11:59.186 --> 00:12:01.188 align:middle line:90%
[Sigh] Okay .

00:12:01.188 --> 00:12:02.255 align:middle line:90%
What about relationship?

00:12:02.255 --> 00:12:03.056 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: I love it.

00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:03.857 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: I know, it's great.

00:12:03.857 --> 00:12:05.392 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter]

00:12:05.392 --> 00:12:07.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Like it's
the wrong relationship.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.262 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: Oh, that one.

00:12:10.597 --> 00:12:12.933 align:middle line:84%
[Pause] I'm not going to address
that on a personal level.

00:12:12.933 --> 00:12:14.935 align:middle line:90%
Okay, so, here's the thing.

00:12:14.935 --> 00:12:18.205 align:middle line:84%
So how many points of view
about who you should choose

00:12:18.205 --> 00:12:20.073 align:middle line:90%
in relationship have you bought

00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:23.310 align:middle line:84%
from other people
other than you?

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:24.144 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:12:24.144 --> 00:12:24.945 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Lots of books, movies.

00:12:24.945 --> 00:12:25.912 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: Exactly.

00:12:25.912 --> 00:12:26.713 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mom!

00:12:26.713 --> 00:12:28.215 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: Books, movies, mom!

00:12:28.215 --> 00:12:31.318 align:middle line:90%
Mom, mom, and mom.

00:12:31.318 --> 00:12:32.519 align:middle line:90%
And then all of your friends

00:12:32.519 --> 00:12:33.820 align:middle line:84%
that told you the
same thing mom said,

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.155 align:middle line:84%
so you know it must
be real and true

00:12:35.155 --> 00:12:36.556 align:middle line:84%
of what you're supposed
to look for.

00:12:36.556 --> 00:12:39.192 align:middle line:84%
But then every time you find the
person mom decided you should be

00:12:39.192 --> 00:12:41.328 align:middle line:84%
with, you hate it,
and so do they.

00:12:41.328 --> 00:12:42.462 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:12:42.462 --> 00:12:44.998 align:middle line:84%
It's because it's not
you choosing from you.

00:12:44.998 --> 00:12:46.500 align:middle line:84%
So here's what we do
in that situation.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:50.437 align:middle line:84%
So, everybody else that
you bought the idea

00:12:50.437 --> 00:12:53.039 align:middle line:84%
of what the perfect person
to be in a relationship is,

00:12:53.039 --> 00:12:56.910 align:middle line:84%
well you destroy and uncreate
it, and return it to sender.

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:58.178 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: And return to sender.

00:12:58.178 --> 00:12:58.678 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: Okay.

00:12:58.678 --> 00:12:59.880 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.514 align:middle line:84%
"Right and Wrong, Good
and Bad, POD, POC, All 9,

00:13:01.514 --> 00:13:04.117 align:middle line:90%
Shorts, Boys and Beyond."

00:13:04.117 --> 00:13:05.318 align:middle line:84%
Now that's the whole
clearing statement.

00:13:05.318 --> 00:13:06.419 align:middle line:90%
You can do it.

00:13:06.419 --> 00:13:07.621 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: I see your
little hand going like.

00:13:07.621 --> 00:13:09.489 align:middle line:84%
>> D.H.: I know, my hands
wiggling, I'm like oh!

00:13:09.489 --> 00:13:10.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: This is working!

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:11.491 align:middle line:90%
He has the energy.

00:13:11.491 --> 00:13:12.492 align:middle line:84%
>> D.H.: Yeah, and
that's actually,

00:13:12.492 --> 00:13:14.294 align:middle line:84%
when the energy moves,
so does my hand.

00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:16.863 align:middle line:84%
And I don't even realize it, you
know, until you point it out.

00:13:16.863 --> 00:13:19.099 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, oh, it's
happening on TV, okay.

00:13:19.099 --> 00:13:22.035 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: No, it's good, because
I, I, because that's the thing

00:13:22.035 --> 00:13:24.037 align:middle line:84%
that when we're on the
other side of this screen,

00:13:24.037 --> 00:13:26.139 align:middle line:84%
we can't really see, so I'm
sharing as much of your world

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:28.942 align:middle line:84%
as possible so we can get in
that space and, and get it,

00:13:28.942 --> 00:13:31.278 align:middle line:84%
and get that freedom
too, for ourselves.

00:13:31.278 --> 00:13:32.846 align:middle line:90%
So it's beautiful.

00:13:32.846 --> 00:13:33.346 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: Yes.

00:13:33.346 --> 00:13:34.548 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:13:34.548 --> 00:13:35.382 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So there's
nothing wrong with the hand!

00:13:35.382 --> 00:13:37.584 align:middle line:90%
I was not trying to [laughter].

00:13:37.584 --> 00:13:38.752 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: No, no, I.

00:13:38.752 --> 00:13:40.587 align:middle line:84%
[Laughter] No worries,
I'm good, you know.

00:13:40.587 --> 00:13:42.055 align:middle line:84%
And that, and that's
the other thing that,

00:13:42.055 --> 00:13:43.823 align:middle line:90%
that if we can, two things.

00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:46.793 align:middle line:84%
So, when you say the thing about
the hand, you know, and truly,

00:13:46.793 --> 00:13:48.962 align:middle line:84%
there are no worries in my
universe, but 13 years ago,

00:13:48.962 --> 00:13:51.898 align:middle line:84%
if you would have said anything
about my clothes, my hair,

00:13:51.898 --> 00:13:54.067 align:middle line:84%
my hands, or anything, I would
have been like oh my god!

00:13:54.067 --> 00:13:55.802 align:middle line:84%
I, what do I do,
I'm being judged!

00:13:55.802 --> 00:13:57.170 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:59.306 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people live there
because they haven't gotten

00:13:59.306 --> 00:14:00.507 align:middle line:90%
to the place where they realize

00:14:00.507 --> 00:14:02.208 align:middle line:84%
that there's actually
nothing wrong with them.

00:14:02.208 --> 00:14:04.844 align:middle line:84%
And anything somebody else says
is whatever somebody else is

00:14:04.844 --> 00:14:08.048 align:middle line:84%
saying at the time, and what
it does, when you have that,

00:14:08.048 --> 00:14:09.616 align:middle line:84%
is it actually starts
to create a space

00:14:09.616 --> 00:14:11.384 align:middle line:84%
where you don't have
to judge you anymore.

00:14:11.384 --> 00:14:12.619 align:middle line:84%
So in this thing
with a relationship

00:14:12.619 --> 00:14:13.720 align:middle line:90%
that we're talking about.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:16.756 align:middle line:84%
What most of us do is
we are told the type

00:14:16.756 --> 00:14:19.492 align:middle line:84%
of person we should be with
by our family, like you said,

00:14:19.492 --> 00:14:21.928 align:middle line:84%
by mom, especially
mom, and then dad.

00:14:21.928 --> 00:14:24.497 align:middle line:84%
And actually mom tells us who
to be with, dad tells us who not

00:14:24.497 --> 00:14:26.266 align:middle line:84%
to be with, is usually
how it works, you know?

00:14:26.266 --> 00:14:29.069 align:middle line:84%
And then we pick it up from
our friends and so we're trying

00:14:29.069 --> 00:14:30.870 align:middle line:84%
to find the perfect
thing that will match all

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.539 align:middle line:90%
of their expectations.

00:14:32.539 --> 00:14:33.907 align:middle line:90%
So let's do this.

00:14:33.907 --> 00:14:36.609 align:middle line:84%
So all the projections, the
expectations, the separations,

00:14:36.609 --> 00:14:40.180 align:middle line:84%
the judgements, and the
rejections that have been placed

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:42.148 align:middle line:84%
on all of us about who we're
supposed to choose to be

00:14:42.148 --> 00:14:44.017 align:middle line:84%
in a relationship
with, can we destroy it

00:14:44.017 --> 00:14:45.485 align:middle line:90%
and uncreate it please?

00:14:45.485 --> 00:14:46.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yes.

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:48.254 align:middle line:84%
>> D.H.: "Right and Wrong,
Good and Bad, POD, POC, All 9,

00:14:48.254 --> 00:14:50.056 align:middle line:90%
Shorts, Boys and Beyond."

00:14:50.056 --> 00:14:51.023 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Boys and Beyonds?

00:14:51.023 --> 00:14:51.858 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: Yeah.

00:14:51.858 --> 00:14:52.726 align:middle line:90%
Boys and Beyonds, not this is.

00:14:52.726 --> 00:14:53.693 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Not Girls and Beyond?

00:14:53.693 --> 00:14:55.528 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: I know, right?

00:14:55.528 --> 00:14:57.330 align:middle line:84%
It's, believe me, it's
not meant to be sexist.

00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:00.533 align:middle line:84%
It just happens to be that these
guys hold a limitation in place.

00:15:00.533 --> 00:15:02.068 align:middle line:84%
So of course they're
boys, hello,

00:15:02.068 --> 00:15:04.070 align:middle line:90%
girls don't do limited stuff.

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:04.904 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: That's right.

00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:06.272 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: My mom told me that.

00:15:06.272 --> 00:15:08.174 align:middle line:84%
Girls are perfect and boys,
here's, here's the way it works.

00:15:08.174 --> 00:15:11.277 align:middle line:84%
If a tree falls in the
forest and no one is around,

00:15:11.277 --> 00:15:12.812 align:middle line:90%
is the man still wrong?

00:15:12.812 --> 00:15:15.415 align:middle line:84%
Well, yes, of course,
hello, I learned this

00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:17.017 align:middle line:84%
from my mom, see
that's why I've.

00:15:17.017 --> 00:15:18.284 align:middle line:84%
No I'm just kidding,
my mom is great.

00:15:18.284 --> 00:15:20.120 align:middle line:90%
But, but there's this,

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.789 align:middle line:84%
what these boys are is they're
actually something called a

00:15:22.789 --> 00:15:24.157 align:middle line:90%
nucleated sphere.

00:15:24.157 --> 00:15:26.426 align:middle line:84%
And we don't need to go into
that, but it's like this.

00:15:26.426 --> 00:15:29.195 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever been told you have
to peel the layers of the onion

00:15:29.195 --> 00:15:30.597 align:middle line:90%
to get to the core of the issue?

00:15:30.597 --> 00:15:32.632 align:middle line:84%
Well, what these boys
are is literally,

00:15:32.632 --> 00:15:35.068 align:middle line:84%
it's not actually an onion,
it looks like an onion,

00:15:35.068 --> 00:15:36.336 align:middle line:90%
cause the core is down here

00:15:36.336 --> 00:15:37.771 align:middle line:84%
and then there's another
layer outside of that,

00:15:37.771 --> 00:15:39.706 align:middle line:84%
and one outside, and
one outside of that,

00:15:39.706 --> 00:15:43.043 align:middle line:84%
but the way this works is with
most of the issues in our lives,

00:15:43.043 --> 00:15:44.778 align:middle line:84%
we work and work
and work and we pop

00:15:44.778 --> 00:15:46.112 align:middle line:84%
that outer layer
and we're like yes!

00:15:46.112 --> 00:15:47.247 align:middle line:90%
We're free!

00:15:47.247 --> 00:15:49.282 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden, it grows in again.

00:15:49.282 --> 00:15:51.017 align:middle line:84%
And then we feel
like we have to work

00:15:51.017 --> 00:15:52.919 align:middle line:84%
on the same darn thing
we just worked on.

00:15:52.919 --> 00:15:54.721 align:middle line:84%
Part of what's involved
in this clearing statement

00:15:54.721 --> 00:15:57.791 align:middle line:84%
that we're undoing, is
exactly that, the onion.

00:15:57.791 --> 00:15:58.925 align:middle line:90%
So let's do this.

00:15:58.925 --> 00:16:02.228 align:middle line:84%
So all of you, all of
you, all of us, okay?

00:16:02.228 --> 00:16:03.997 align:middle line:84%
All the onions that
you've been peeling in all

00:16:03.997 --> 00:16:06.866 align:middle line:84%
of your various lifetimes, that
you've been peeling and peeling

00:16:06.866 --> 00:16:09.035 align:middle line:84%
and peeling and peeling,
that have given you nothing

00:16:09.035 --> 00:16:11.771 align:middle line:84%
but tears, that were
actually nucleated spheres,

00:16:11.771 --> 00:16:14.240 align:middle line:84%
will you destroy and
uncreate it please?

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.075 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Wow, yes!

00:16:15.075 --> 00:16:16.276 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: Right?

00:16:16.276 --> 00:16:17.610 align:middle line:84%
"Right and Wrong, Good
and Bad, POD, POC, All 9,

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:19.379 align:middle line:90%
Shorts, Boys and Beyond."

00:16:19.379 --> 00:16:22.015 align:middle line:84%
Now here's the way this,
this clearing statement works

00:16:22.015 --> 00:16:23.116 align:middle line:90%
and you can use it on your own,

00:16:23.116 --> 00:16:25.985 align:middle line:84%
and you can use the
short form, POC and POD.

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:27.120 align:middle line:90%
Okay? POC and POD.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.321 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: POC and POD.

00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:29.255 align:middle line:84%
>> D.H.: It's a lot
easier to remember than all

00:16:29.255 --> 00:16:30.490 align:middle line:84%
that other stuff
I just said, okay?

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.325 align:middle line:84%
But POC and POD will
actually work.

00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:35.195 align:middle line:84%
And basically it's asking to go
back to the point of creation,

00:16:35.195 --> 00:16:37.697 align:middle line:84%
of wherever you locked
a limitation in place,

00:16:37.697 --> 00:16:40.133 align:middle line:84%
or the point of destruction,
wherever you took something

00:16:40.133 --> 00:16:42.368 align:middle line:84%
that was unlimited
and decided you needed

00:16:42.368 --> 00:16:44.471 align:middle line:84%
to make it more limited
to fit in.

00:16:44.471 --> 00:16:46.439 align:middle line:90%
So, you go POC and POD all that.

00:16:46.439 --> 00:16:49.042 align:middle line:84%
And what you can do is if you
have something that keeps coming

00:16:49.042 --> 00:16:51.744 align:middle line:84%
up in your life, that keeps,
you keep working on it

00:16:51.744 --> 00:16:54.881 align:middle line:84%
and it keeps not
changing, you go, okay, so,

00:16:54.881 --> 00:16:56.549 align:middle line:90%
all those things Dain said?

00:16:56.549 --> 00:16:58.184 align:middle line:90%
POC and POD all those.

00:16:58.184 --> 00:17:00.286 align:middle line:84%
And literally, it'll
start going away.

00:17:00.286 --> 00:17:04.256 align:middle line:84%
And, how does that,
you're like, wait, I know,

00:17:04.256 --> 00:17:05.558 align:middle line:90%
[inaudible] what'd you say?

00:17:05.558 --> 00:17:08.561 align:middle line:84%
[Inaudible] You're like I'm
going to replay that over

00:17:08.561 --> 00:17:10.129 align:middle line:90%
and over and over and over.

00:17:10.129 --> 00:17:11.831 align:middle line:84%
But that's actually,
you know what the,

00:17:11.831 --> 00:17:13.398 align:middle line:90%
the fun part about it is?

00:17:13.398 --> 00:17:15.235 align:middle line:90%
It's actually that simple.

00:17:15.235 --> 00:17:17.870 align:middle line:84%
And you can hear me saying
it and because the energy's

00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:20.540 align:middle line:84%
out there in the world now,
you can hear me saying it

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:23.443 align:middle line:84%
and it actually works
to change for you too.

00:17:23.443 --> 00:17:26.646 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: I know the, the
book is called Being You,

00:17:26.646 --> 00:17:28.281 align:middle line:90%
so how is that related?

00:17:28.281 --> 00:17:29.816 align:middle line:90%
Is that, does that, so then,

00:17:29.816 --> 00:17:31.417 align:middle line:84%
I guess we're becoming
more ourselves?

00:17:31.417 --> 00:17:32.552 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: Absolutely.

00:17:32.552 --> 00:17:35.021 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly what
happens is, literally,

00:17:35.021 --> 00:17:38.491 align:middle line:84%
when you're trying to live up to
everybody else's expectations,

00:17:38.491 --> 00:17:41.194 align:middle line:84%
when you're aware of their
points of view and you're trying

00:17:41.194 --> 00:17:45.632 align:middle line:84%
to meet those rather
than [pause] being you,

00:17:45.632 --> 00:17:48.535 align:middle line:84%
rather than doing what you
know, you create this life

00:17:48.535 --> 00:17:49.936 align:middle line:84%
that has nothing to do
with you and you feel

00:17:49.936 --> 00:17:51.704 align:middle line:90%
like you never get to be you.

00:17:51.704 --> 00:17:54.607 align:middle line:84%
And so, what this is really
about is when you truly get

00:17:54.607 --> 00:17:58.144 align:middle line:84%
to be you, when you truly get
to what's really true and,

00:17:58.144 --> 00:18:00.280 align:middle line:84%
you know, people talk about,
you know, follow your heart,

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:03.583 align:middle line:84%
and I say follow your heart
and follow your awareness

00:18:03.583 --> 00:18:05.251 align:middle line:90%
and follow your whole being.

00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:07.987 align:middle line:84%
You know? Let your heart
expand into your whole world

00:18:07.987 --> 00:18:11.224 align:middle line:84%
and when you get to be that,
you, it's weird, because it's

00:18:11.224 --> 00:18:13.326 align:middle line:84%
like the universe opens up
all these different choices

00:18:13.326 --> 00:18:15.094 align:middle line:90%
that you never saw before.

00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:17.597 align:middle line:84%
Because all you could
focus on was trying

00:18:17.597 --> 00:18:20.466 align:middle line:84%
to make everybody else happy
or trying to live according

00:18:20.466 --> 00:18:22.502 align:middle line:84%
to their projections and
their points of view,

00:18:22.502 --> 00:18:25.138 align:middle line:84%
and what happens is that
takes you out of getting

00:18:25.138 --> 00:18:26.673 align:middle line:90%
to the joy that you are.

00:18:26.673 --> 00:18:28.942 align:middle line:84%
It takes you out of being
here, on a day like today,

00:18:28.942 --> 00:18:32.178 align:middle line:84%
where it's just the sun is
blue, the temperature's perfect,

00:18:32.178 --> 00:18:34.380 align:middle line:84%
sitting next to a beautiful
French woman, oh my god!

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:35.782 align:middle line:90%
How did I get so lucky?

00:18:35.782 --> 00:18:36.916 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:18:36.916 --> 00:18:37.784 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: How does it
get better than this?

00:18:37.784 --> 00:18:38.818 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: Exactly!

00:18:38.818 --> 00:18:40.119 align:middle line:84%
How does it get any
better than that?

00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:41.154 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: It's always that,

00:18:41.154 --> 00:18:42.689 align:middle line:84%
how does it get any
better that that?

00:18:42.689 --> 00:18:43.790 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: Yeah.

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:45.792 align:middle line:84%
And, and truly, from
a place of gratitude.

00:18:45.792 --> 00:18:49.362 align:middle line:84%
From, from being totally
present here, like, hi.

00:18:49.362 --> 00:18:51.931 align:middle line:84%
And totally grateful
for this moment

00:18:51.931 --> 00:18:54.367 align:middle line:84%
and then also how does it
get any better than this?

00:18:54.367 --> 00:18:57.003 align:middle line:84%
Literally, if you'll add this
question to your repertoire,

00:18:57.003 --> 00:18:57.971 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if I said it right.

00:18:57.971 --> 00:18:58.771 align:middle line:90%
Was that pretty good?

00:18:58.771 --> 00:18:59.339 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Perfect!

00:18:59.339 --> 00:18:59.772 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: Yeah?

00:18:59.772 --> 00:19:00.540 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:01.241 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Repertoire.

00:19:01.241 --> 00:19:02.375 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: Oh, you, you.

00:19:02.375 --> 00:19:05.778 align:middle line:84%
I didn't say it nearly
as beautiful as you did.

00:19:05.778 --> 00:19:07.447 align:middle line:84%
We could just sit here and
you could speak French to all

00:19:07.447 --> 00:19:08.648 align:middle line:90%
of us, I'm just saying.

00:19:08.648 --> 00:19:09.682 align:middle line:84%
That would work for
me [laughing].

00:19:09.682 --> 00:19:11.317 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: That was
a French lesson.

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:13.253 align:middle line:90%
This is a moment, right?

00:19:13.253 --> 00:19:16.556 align:middle line:84%
>> D.H.: And how does it
get any better than that?

00:19:16.556 --> 00:19:19.425 align:middle line:84%
But literally, if you'll start
adding this one question,

00:19:19.425 --> 00:19:21.060 align:middle line:84%
how does it get any
better than this?

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:23.696 align:middle line:84%
Yes, when something good happens
or when something bad happens.

00:19:23.696 --> 00:19:25.431 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So how does it
work for when it gets bad?

00:19:25.431 --> 00:19:27.333 align:middle line:84%
That means you want to
deepen that bad experience?

00:19:27.333 --> 00:19:28.401 align:middle line:90%
I don't get that part.

00:19:28.401 --> 00:19:29.869 align:middle line:84%
>> D.H.: No, you want
it to get better.

00:19:29.869 --> 00:19:31.537 align:middle line:84%
So when something bad
happens, like, for example,

00:19:31.537 --> 00:19:33.339 align:middle line:84%
let's say your flight
is cancelled.

00:19:33.339 --> 00:19:35.808 align:middle line:84%
And you go, you've never
had that one traveling

00:19:35.808 --> 00:19:37.210 align:middle line:84%
around the world,
I'm sure [laughing].

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:41.681 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, you know, when
you really want to kill people,

00:19:41.681 --> 00:19:43.416 align:middle line:84%
you go, how does it get
any better than this?

00:19:43.416 --> 00:19:44.217 align:middle line:90%
And ask it.

00:19:44.217 --> 00:19:45.451 align:middle line:90%
And then ask it again.

00:19:45.451 --> 00:19:47.453 align:middle line:84%
And ask it again, but being
totally present with it,

00:19:47.453 --> 00:19:49.455 align:middle line:84%
and ask it again
and ask it again.

00:19:49.455 --> 00:19:52.025 align:middle line:84%
Then all of a sudden, number
one, it changes the energy.

00:19:52.025 --> 00:19:54.060 align:middle line:84%
See cause we're energetic
beings.

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.496 align:middle line:84%
You know, when we feel
alive, when we feel connected

00:19:56.496 --> 00:19:58.665 align:middle line:84%
with everyone, when we have
that energy, that happiness,

00:19:58.665 --> 00:20:01.768 align:middle line:84%
that joy, things happen
as if by magic, right?

00:20:01.768 --> 00:20:03.603 align:middle line:84%
Well, what if our lives
could be more like that?

00:20:03.603 --> 00:20:04.837 align:middle line:84%
What if we could
change the energy

00:20:04.837 --> 00:20:07.907 align:middle line:84%
of any situation that's
going on to make it better?

00:20:07.907 --> 00:20:10.510 align:middle line:84%
So how does it get any better
than this actually does that.

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:12.011 align:middle line:84%
So let's say your
flight is cancelled

00:20:12.011 --> 00:20:13.980 align:middle line:84%
and you go how does it
get any better than this?

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.149 align:middle line:84%
Well, I literally had
a lady who was coming

00:20:16.149 --> 00:20:19.519 align:middle line:84%
to a class I was giving,
and her flight was cancelled

00:20:19.519 --> 00:20:21.087 align:middle line:84%
because of weather
in the next city.

00:20:21.087 --> 00:20:23.156 align:middle line:84%
Like she was going through
Chicago to get to Montreal

00:20:23.156 --> 00:20:25.958 align:middle line:84%
or something, and she,
she goes up to the counter

00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:28.695 align:middle line:84%
and the lady says, yeah,
the flight's cancelled, so,

00:20:28.695 --> 00:20:30.296 align:middle line:84%
and she looks at her
and she says, really,

00:20:30.296 --> 00:20:31.497 align:middle line:84%
how does it get any
better than that?

00:20:31.497 --> 00:20:32.999 align:middle line:90%
And she went hmm, I don't know.

00:20:32.999 --> 00:20:33.900 align:middle line:90%
And she's typing on her.

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.101 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Really?

00:20:35.101 --> 00:20:36.803 align:middle line:84%
>> D.H.: Yeah, literally,
asked it to the person?

00:20:36.803 --> 00:20:38.371 align:middle line:84%
Right? How does it get
any better than that?

00:20:38.371 --> 00:20:41.574 align:middle line:84%
Because what it does it opens
up this, it opens things rather

00:20:41.574 --> 00:20:44.210 align:middle line:84%
than closes things, and
most people are so used to,

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:46.913 align:middle line:84%
especially the people
that are, are, I mean,

00:20:46.913 --> 00:20:49.482 align:middle line:84%
I was on a flight yesterday
and there was this lady yelling

00:20:49.482 --> 00:20:50.783 align:middle line:90%
at the woman behind the counter

00:20:50.783 --> 00:20:52.185 align:middle line:84%
because her flight had been
cancelled and the lady was

00:20:52.185 --> 00:20:54.821 align:middle line:84%
so nice, so they're used to
dealing with that and you come

00:20:54.821 --> 00:20:57.323 align:middle line:84%
up and go, hey, I totally
get it, I totally understand,

00:20:57.323 --> 00:20:58.624 align:middle line:84%
how does it get any
better than this?

00:20:58.624 --> 00:21:00.727 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, you're
not making me wrong?

00:21:00.727 --> 00:21:03.129 align:middle line:84%
And, literally, the lady
started typing on the computer,

00:21:03.129 --> 00:21:04.464 align:middle line:90%
and she said, well, I don't.

00:21:04.464 --> 00:21:07.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: That's the best
traveling tip I've ever heard.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.501 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: You're welcome,

00:21:08.501 --> 00:21:11.637 align:middle line:84%
and especially given your
current travel schedule.

00:21:11.637 --> 00:21:13.172 align:middle line:84%
This one will really
come in handy.

00:21:13.172 --> 00:21:15.074 align:middle line:84%
And so the lady said,
she said, well,

00:21:15.074 --> 00:21:16.642 align:middle line:84%
really I don't think
we have anything,

00:21:16.642 --> 00:21:17.944 align:middle line:90%
but I'm going to keep checking.

00:21:17.944 --> 00:21:19.979 align:middle line:84%
She said, cool, how does it
get any better than that?

00:21:19.979 --> 00:21:22.215 align:middle line:84%
And just then the lady,
her eyes get really wide,

00:21:22.215 --> 00:21:24.717 align:middle line:90%
she's like, oh my gosh!

00:21:24.717 --> 00:21:28.287 align:middle line:84%
She's like I've got
a seat on a flight!

00:21:28.287 --> 00:21:32.024 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be different, but
actually you'll get in early.

00:21:32.024 --> 00:21:33.259 align:middle line:90%
She's like, and, you know what?

00:21:33.259 --> 00:21:35.461 align:middle line:84%
Gosh, imagine that, the only
seat that's available is

00:21:35.461 --> 00:21:36.996 align:middle line:90%
in business class.

00:21:36.996 --> 00:21:38.898 align:middle line:84%
Is it okay if I upgrade
you to business class?

00:21:38.898 --> 00:21:41.167 align:middle line:84%
And she went sure, how does
it get any better than that?

00:21:41.167 --> 00:21:43.102 align:middle line:90%
And the lady goes, I don't know,

00:21:43.102 --> 00:21:44.871 align:middle line:84%
but I think you're doing
pretty well so far!

00:21:44.871 --> 00:21:47.774 align:middle line:84%
And literally, the
lady got there early,

00:21:47.774 --> 00:21:50.009 align:middle line:84%
and she actually got
upgraded to business class.

00:21:50.009 --> 00:21:51.110 align:middle line:90%
And this is a true story.

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:52.678 align:middle line:84%
She told it in class
when she got there.

00:21:52.678 --> 00:21:54.514 align:middle line:84%
She said, I just
want you to know,

00:21:54.514 --> 00:21:55.982 align:middle line:84%
these tools that you
give people actually work

00:21:55.982 --> 00:21:57.450 align:middle line:90%
in real life situations.

00:21:57.450 --> 00:21:59.118 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I'm
interested in.

00:21:59.118 --> 00:22:00.820 align:middle line:84%
Cause it would be one thing
if we could live in a cave

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:01.921 align:middle line:90%
or live in a classroom.

00:22:01.921 --> 00:22:03.189 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:22:03.189 --> 00:22:05.158 align:middle line:84%
It'd be like okay, bad
things, okay, let me, let POC

00:22:05.158 --> 00:22:06.159 align:middle line:90%
and POD it, let me do, you know?

00:22:06.159 --> 00:22:07.060 align:middle line:90%
But we don't.

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:08.561 align:middle line:90%
We live out in the world.

00:22:08.561 --> 00:22:10.196 align:middle line:84%
That's where we're required
is out in the world,

00:22:10.196 --> 00:22:11.531 align:middle line:90%
that's where we need the tools.

00:22:11.531 --> 00:22:13.132 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: But then it gets
really good and it's important,

00:22:13.132 --> 00:22:15.468 align:middle line:84%
we're like oh no, this is
really, really good now.

00:22:15.468 --> 00:22:17.570 align:middle line:84%
>> D.H.: And how does it
get any better than that?

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:19.839 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: No, but at some point
it's like, oh, this is really,

00:22:19.839 --> 00:22:22.875 align:middle line:84%
really good and then we stop
that thrill because it arrived

00:22:22.875 --> 00:22:26.145 align:middle line:84%
at such a peak that we're like
okay, now it's really good.

00:22:26.145 --> 00:22:28.781 align:middle line:84%
>> D.H.: And then the question
becomes, am I really willing

00:22:28.781 --> 00:22:31.551 align:middle line:84%
to live the adventure
that I'm capable of?

00:22:31.551 --> 00:22:34.854 align:middle line:84%
Lilou, traveling around the
world, interviewing people,

00:22:34.854 --> 00:22:37.156 align:middle line:84%
making the world a better place,
on the big jets [laughter].

00:22:37.156 --> 00:22:39.659 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: How does it
get any better than this?

00:22:39.659 --> 00:22:40.960 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: Exactly.

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.361 align:middle line:90%
See, but you're right.

00:22:42.361 --> 00:22:44.564 align:middle line:84%
That is. What we do is we get
to this place and we're like,

00:22:44.564 --> 00:22:46.099 align:middle line:90%
oh, and we think in our.

00:22:46.099 --> 00:22:47.467 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Like lady
with the diamond.

00:22:47.467 --> 00:22:48.534 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: Yeah, yeah.

00:22:48.534 --> 00:22:51.170 align:middle line:84%
There was this lady
who, literally, she,

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:54.340 align:middle line:84%
she took this tool, she got
it, she was in New York,

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:57.210 align:middle line:84%
and Gary Douglas, the founder
of Access, was giving this class

00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:58.845 align:middle line:84%
and he gave her this tool
how does it get any better

00:22:58.845 --> 00:23:00.213 align:middle line:90%
than this?

00:23:00.213 --> 00:23:02.081 align:middle line:84%
She literally goes out of the
class, finds a dime sitting

00:23:02.081 --> 00:23:03.216 align:middle line:90%
on the ground and goes, oh,

00:23:03.216 --> 00:23:04.617 align:middle line:84%
how does it get any
better than that?

00:23:04.617 --> 00:23:06.752 align:middle line:84%
Picks it up, puts it in her
pocket, goes down to get

00:23:06.752 --> 00:23:08.120 align:middle line:84%
out of the elevator
and there was like a 10

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.823 align:middle line:84%
or a 20 dollar bill, one of
those, I never remember anymore,

00:23:10.823 --> 00:23:13.025 align:middle line:84%
sitting on the ground,
and nobody's around,

00:23:13.025 --> 00:23:14.861 align:middle line:84%
and so she picks it up and
goes how does it get any better

00:23:14.861 --> 00:23:15.661 align:middle line:90%
than that?

00:23:15.661 --> 00:23:16.729 align:middle line:90%
And sticks it in her pocket.

00:23:16.729 --> 00:23:18.097 align:middle line:84%
So she decides she's
going to take a taxi

00:23:18.097 --> 00:23:20.533 align:middle line:84%
to her building rather
than wait for the subway

00:23:20.533 --> 00:23:21.601 align:middle line:90%
and all that sort of stuff.

00:23:21.601 --> 00:23:23.169 align:middle line:84%
And she was like,
hello, I got 10 bucks,

00:23:23.169 --> 00:23:24.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do that, right?

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:27.573 align:middle line:84%
And so, the taxi lets her
off in front of her building,

00:23:27.573 --> 00:23:29.075 align:middle line:84%
had she taken the subway,
she would have gone

00:23:29.075 --> 00:23:31.878 align:middle line:84%
around the rear entrance, which
is where she usually goes to,

00:23:31.878 --> 00:23:34.680 align:middle line:84%
she goes to get out of the
taxi, looks down in the gutter,

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:36.649 align:middle line:90%
and she sees something sparkly.

00:23:36.649 --> 00:23:39.018 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know what it was,
it was a diamond bracelet.

00:23:39.018 --> 00:23:41.187 align:middle line:84%
And she literally
goes oh my god!

00:23:41.187 --> 00:23:42.922 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't get any
better than this!

00:23:42.922 --> 00:23:45.224 align:middle line:90%
And then she stopped it.

00:23:45.224 --> 00:23:46.559 align:middle line:90%
It's like what?

00:23:46.559 --> 00:23:48.928 align:middle line:84%
If you're on that kind of roll,
keep asking the questions,

00:23:48.928 --> 00:23:51.130 align:middle line:84%
you know, but you're right,
there's this, there's this place

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:54.000 align:middle line:84%
that we have that we think
is the most we can have.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.003 align:middle line:84%
And, and it's this ceiling
that we put ourselves,

00:23:57.003 --> 00:23:58.804 align:middle line:84%
but what if you didn't
have to anymore.

00:23:58.804 --> 00:24:00.706 align:middle line:84%
What if it could just
keep getting better

00:24:00.706 --> 00:24:02.074 align:middle line:90%
and keep getting greater?

00:24:02.074 --> 00:24:03.876 align:middle line:84%
Well, once you notice
yourself getting to one

00:24:03.876 --> 00:24:05.211 align:middle line:90%
of those ceilings, just feel it.

00:24:05.211 --> 00:24:07.113 align:middle line:84%
Just feel the energy of
it and go, you know what?

00:24:07.113 --> 00:24:08.881 align:middle line:90%
I'm willing to let that go now.

00:24:08.881 --> 00:24:10.449 align:middle line:90%
All the weird stuff Dain said.

00:24:10.449 --> 00:24:12.385 align:middle line:90%
Or POC and POD all that.

00:24:12.385 --> 00:24:14.320 align:middle line:84%
Or everything that
allows us to exist,

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.789 align:middle line:90%
I now destroy and uncreate it.

00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:19.425 align:middle line:84%
"Right and Wrong, Good
and Bad, POD, POC, All 9,

00:24:19.425 --> 00:24:21.627 align:middle line:90%
Shorts, Boys and Beyond."

00:24:21.627 --> 00:24:24.330 align:middle line:84%
How does it get any
better than that?

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:25.698 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: I love it.

00:24:25.698 --> 00:24:28.134 align:middle line:84%
And so you're, how does that
change your practice as you kept

00:24:28.134 --> 00:24:30.369 align:middle line:84%
on continuing being
this, this chiropractor

00:24:30.369 --> 00:24:32.104 align:middle line:90%
or did your life truly blossom?

00:24:32.104 --> 00:24:33.940 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: Totally changed!

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:37.376 align:middle line:84%
Totally changed, in fact,
I literally, I went and I,

00:24:37.376 --> 00:24:40.379 align:middle line:84%
so I had this session, and
it literally, it was like,

00:24:40.379 --> 00:24:41.981 align:middle line:90%
I literally looked around

00:24:41.981 --> 00:24:44.383 align:middle line:84%
and I remember I had this
blue pleather table, you know,

00:24:44.383 --> 00:24:47.253 align:middle line:84%
it's plastic and leather,
and it had these veins going

00:24:47.253 --> 00:24:49.922 align:middle line:84%
through it, and so I
used to hate that table,

00:24:49.922 --> 00:24:52.191 align:middle line:84%
because it was my table,
and when you're depressed

00:24:52.191 --> 00:24:53.926 align:middle line:84%
in your life, you hate
everything you've created,

00:24:53.926 --> 00:24:55.528 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've ever
been there, I hope not,

00:24:55.528 --> 00:24:58.564 align:middle line:84%
but that's one of the common
things is you hate everything

00:24:58.564 --> 00:25:01.100 align:middle line:84%
that has to do with you, and I
looked down and saw the beauty

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:02.635 align:middle line:90%
of this table, and was like,

00:25:02.635 --> 00:25:04.737 align:middle line:84%
this is the most
beautiful table ever.

00:25:04.737 --> 00:25:07.840 align:middle line:84%
Well that kind of change was
the kind of change I had gotten

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:09.842 align:middle line:90%
into chiropractic to create.

00:25:09.842 --> 00:25:11.110 align:middle line:90%
That's what I had always wanted

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:13.646 align:middle line:84%
to do people is give them
an awareness of the beauty

00:25:13.646 --> 00:25:16.649 align:middle line:84%
that life could be and the
tools to actually create it.

00:25:16.649 --> 00:25:19.285 align:middle line:84%
Well here I was, I had just
experienced it, and I was like,

00:25:19.285 --> 00:25:21.687 align:middle line:84%
wow, and I would
do these sessions.

00:25:21.687 --> 00:25:23.689 align:middle line:84%
And I would get that
more and more and more

00:25:23.689 --> 00:25:25.658 align:middle line:84%
and my life would get lighter
and lighter and lighter,

00:25:25.658 --> 00:25:27.493 align:middle line:84%
and everyone I'd give a
tool to that would use it,

00:25:27.493 --> 00:25:29.428 align:middle line:84%
their lives would get lighter
and lighter and lighter.

00:25:29.428 --> 00:25:32.498 align:middle line:84%
And so literally, within
three months, I was like well;

00:25:32.498 --> 00:25:35.835 align:middle line:84%
chiropractic has been amazing,
3 months after finding Access.

00:25:35.835 --> 00:25:37.103 align:middle line:84%
I was like chiropractic
has been amazing,

00:25:37.103 --> 00:25:38.571 align:middle line:90%
chiropractic has been fun,

00:25:38.571 --> 00:25:41.073 align:middle line:84%
but this is creating the
change that I'm looking for.

00:25:41.073 --> 00:25:45.711 align:middle line:84%
And so literally, I started
doing Access Consciousness full

00:25:45.711 --> 00:25:49.482 align:middle line:84%
time, but in the meantime,
right before making that choice,

00:25:49.482 --> 00:25:50.916 align:middle line:84%
the founder of Access,
Gary Douglas,

00:25:50.916 --> 00:25:52.818 align:middle line:84%
had come into my
office for a session.

00:25:52.818 --> 00:25:55.721 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, look, I was a
network chiropractor at the time

00:25:55.721 --> 00:25:57.757 align:middle line:84%
and I love network,
awesome stuff.

00:25:57.757 --> 00:25:59.792 align:middle line:84%
There are three levels of
care there and he said look,

00:25:59.792 --> 00:26:01.193 align:middle line:84%
you have to go to the
most advanced level

00:26:01.193 --> 00:26:03.062 align:middle line:84%
because the other ones aren't
going to work on my body,

00:26:03.062 --> 00:26:04.830 align:middle line:84%
and I went, I don't
know how to do that.

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:07.433 align:middle line:84%
He said look, just ask my
body, follow the energy,

00:26:07.433 --> 00:26:08.834 align:middle line:90%
you'll know what to do.

00:26:08.834 --> 00:26:10.736 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, I'll
know what to do?

00:26:10.736 --> 00:26:12.905 align:middle line:84%
I'm the biggest idiot you've
ever met, are you kidding?

00:26:12.905 --> 00:26:15.107 align:middle line:84%
And he said, look, you'll know
what to do and, literally,

00:26:15.107 --> 00:26:16.642 align:middle line:84%
there was this energy
that came through my body,

00:26:16.642 --> 00:26:19.545 align:middle line:84%
came through my hands, and was
in the room, and at one point,

00:26:19.545 --> 00:26:21.947 align:middle line:84%
I'm standing 15 feet away
from him and he's flopping

00:26:21.947 --> 00:26:25.518 align:middle line:84%
on the table like a fish and
I'm like, [pause] [laughter].

00:26:25.518 --> 00:26:28.654 align:middle line:84%
Have you always been
able to do that?

00:26:28.654 --> 00:26:30.156 align:middle line:84%
You know? Like, why
didn't you tell me?

00:26:30.156 --> 00:26:34.660 align:middle line:84%
You know? And literally, it
was this energy, it was like,

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:37.763 align:middle line:84%
I can't even begin to describe
it, it felt like, it felt like,

00:26:37.763 --> 00:26:40.032 align:middle line:90%
Harry Potter, I don't know.

00:26:40.032 --> 00:26:42.668 align:middle line:84%
But it was like this
sense of peace and space

00:26:42.668 --> 00:26:47.273 align:middle line:84%
and possibilities emerging and
impossibility just blowing away.

00:26:47.273 --> 00:26:48.841 align:middle line:84%
And he got up and
he looked at me

00:26:48.841 --> 00:26:50.910 align:middle line:90%
and he went that was phenomenal.

00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:53.479 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that anytime
somebody would come to me

00:26:53.479 --> 00:26:56.315 align:middle line:84%
and be open to it, I could turn
that energy on, if you will.

00:26:56.315 --> 00:26:58.918 align:middle line:84%
And so I started working
with people and their bodies,

00:26:58.918 --> 00:27:01.020 align:middle line:84%
and really started creating
the miracles that I wanted

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:02.822 align:middle line:90%
to create as a chiropractor.

00:27:02.822 --> 00:27:04.490 align:middle line:90%
And then life got really fun.

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:06.625 align:middle line:84%
So within about three months,
I was like chiropractic,

00:27:06.625 --> 00:27:08.360 align:middle line:84%
you've been awesome, I
love you, I adore you,

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.296 align:middle line:84%
I'm moving on to this
new adventure now.

00:27:10.296 --> 00:27:12.565 align:middle line:84%
And I literally sent a letter
to everybody in my practice

00:27:12.565 --> 00:27:15.901 align:middle line:84%
and said hey, it's been such
a cool journey with you,

00:27:15.901 --> 00:27:18.204 align:middle line:84%
if you want to go on this new
journey, here's where I'm going,

00:27:18.204 --> 00:27:20.306 align:middle line:84%
if you don't, no problem,
totally okay with that,

00:27:20.306 --> 00:27:22.141 align:middle line:84%
I'll refer you to
somebody else in town,

00:27:22.141 --> 00:27:25.511 align:middle line:84%
and I was so glad I did,
because even with all the loans

00:27:25.511 --> 00:27:27.113 align:middle line:84%
and everything else
that I'd accumulated,

00:27:27.113 --> 00:27:30.883 align:middle line:84%
and all the time investment and
everything, it was so worth it

00:27:30.883 --> 00:27:33.619 align:middle line:84%
to start doing something that
was so fulfilling and created

00:27:33.619 --> 00:27:35.454 align:middle line:90%
so much change for people.

00:27:35.454 --> 00:27:38.124 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So, so how did,
how do you explain that?

00:27:38.124 --> 00:27:40.226 align:middle line:84%
What was the relationship
between the role

00:27:40.226 --> 00:27:42.428 align:middle line:84%
that you were playing with
that energy and how do you,

00:27:42.428 --> 00:27:45.197 align:middle line:84%
cause this is pretty
awesome and extraordinary,

00:27:45.197 --> 00:27:46.398 align:middle line:90%
I love this conversation.

00:27:46.398 --> 00:27:47.500 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: Cool, me too!

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:48.334 align:middle line:90%
Having so much fun!

00:27:48.334 --> 00:27:49.435 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: What is that?

00:27:49.435 --> 00:27:50.703 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: Well that, I think,

00:27:50.703 --> 00:27:52.505 align:middle line:84%
is actually an acknowledgment
of who we really are.

00:27:52.505 --> 00:27:55.341 align:middle line:84%
I think we've all got
this capacity within us

00:27:55.341 --> 00:27:57.777 align:middle line:90%
to be greater and we know it.

00:27:57.777 --> 00:28:00.546 align:middle line:84%
It's just nobody's ever truly
invited us to it, you know,

00:28:00.546 --> 00:28:02.348 align:middle line:84%
people have invited it,
but they've said you've got

00:28:02.348 --> 00:28:04.784 align:middle line:84%
to do it this way, or,
they've invited it,

00:28:04.784 --> 00:28:07.319 align:middle line:84%
but they said you need to
do it based on my answer.

00:28:07.319 --> 00:28:10.689 align:middle line:84%
The thing I love about Access
is it's not anybody's answer,

00:28:10.689 --> 00:28:12.191 align:middle line:90%
except yours.

00:28:12.191 --> 00:28:14.827 align:middle line:84%
You know? And even that should
be a question, you know?

00:28:14.827 --> 00:28:17.930 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually about opening
up that in you, that greatness

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:21.934 align:middle line:84%
in you that you are, and that's
where all of this comes from.

00:28:21.934 --> 00:28:23.736 align:middle line:84%
See it'd be one thing
if I'm like hey, Lilou,

00:28:23.736 --> 00:28:26.739 align:middle line:84%
let me work on you and let me
do this to you, but it's more

00:28:26.739 --> 00:28:28.974 align:middle line:84%
like hey Lilou, can
I work with you

00:28:28.974 --> 00:28:31.610 align:middle line:84%
and can we unlock everything
that's keeping you stuck

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:35.214 align:middle line:84%
from getting to be you,
and then life is fun.

00:28:35.214 --> 00:28:36.515 align:middle line:90%
You know? And then it's yours.

00:28:36.515 --> 00:28:39.351 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So this, is that
what you call body language,

00:28:39.351 --> 00:28:43.856 align:middle line:84%
body communication, can we do
that with our, with ourself?

00:28:43.856 --> 00:28:44.690 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: Absolutely.

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:45.825 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:28:45.825 --> 00:28:47.393 align:middle line:84%
And it start, it's
basically two things that,

00:28:47.393 --> 00:28:49.128 align:middle line:90%
that start that process.

00:28:49.128 --> 00:28:51.297 align:middle line:84%
And one is being aware
of the energy of things

00:28:51.297 --> 00:28:52.998 align:middle line:90%
like I was talking about before.

00:28:52.998 --> 00:28:55.668 align:middle line:84%
Because literally your body
communicates energetically,

00:28:55.668 --> 00:28:57.303 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't communicate in words.

00:28:57.303 --> 00:28:58.604 align:middle line:84%
It's like words,
are you kidding?

00:28:58.604 --> 00:29:00.139 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand
words, stop talking to me

00:29:00.139 --> 00:29:01.607 align:middle line:90%
in words, talk to me in energy.

00:29:01.607 --> 00:29:03.309 align:middle line:84%
And so what you want
to do is start noticing

00:29:03.309 --> 00:29:05.711 align:middle line:84%
when your body feels
light, when it feels heavy,

00:29:05.711 --> 00:29:07.613 align:middle line:84%
when you eat something
and you feel heavy.

00:29:07.613 --> 00:29:09.014 align:middle line:84%
When you eat something
and you feel light.

00:29:09.014 --> 00:29:10.382 align:middle line:84%
When you meet someone
and you feel heavy.

00:29:10.382 --> 00:29:11.784 align:middle line:84%
When you meet someone
and your feel light.

00:29:11.784 --> 00:29:13.385 align:middle line:84%
When you have sex with
someone and you feel heavy.

00:29:13.385 --> 00:29:14.887 align:middle line:84%
When you have sex with
someone and you feel light.

00:29:14.887 --> 00:29:15.654 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: That's
not a good sign!

00:29:15.654 --> 00:29:17.056 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: I know, exactly!

00:29:17.056 --> 00:29:20.159 align:middle line:84%
[Laughter] Cause I'm sorry to
say this, but people don't seem

00:29:20.159 --> 00:29:22.094 align:middle line:84%
to realize that if you're going
to have sex with somebody,

00:29:22.094 --> 00:29:24.563 align:middle line:84%
you should actually feel
lighter after, not heavier.

00:29:24.563 --> 00:29:28.267 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people are
actually not even realizing it,

00:29:28.267 --> 00:29:31.804 align:middle line:84%
they're actually healers, and
they're actually sexual healers,

00:29:31.804 --> 00:29:34.073 align:middle line:84%
meaning that what they're doing
is they're finding somebody

00:29:34.073 --> 00:29:35.941 align:middle line:84%
to heal, they're
not finding somebody

00:29:35.941 --> 00:29:37.910 align:middle line:90%
to have sex with for fun.

00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:39.812 align:middle line:84%
Because they're so
naturally wanting

00:29:39.812 --> 00:29:41.780 align:middle line:90%
to make people's lives better,

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:43.782 align:middle line:84%
that what they do is they
have sex with somebody

00:29:43.782 --> 00:29:45.751 align:middle line:84%
that they can heal and
make their lives better.

00:29:45.751 --> 00:29:46.585 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Interesting!

00:29:46.585 --> 00:29:47.786 align:middle line:90%
I've never heard that before!

00:29:47.786 --> 00:29:49.054 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: Really?

00:29:49.054 --> 00:29:50.856 align:middle line:84%
Oh, well this is, we could
do a whole other interview

00:29:50.856 --> 00:29:52.057 align:middle line:90%
on just that.

00:29:52.057 --> 00:29:53.092 align:middle line:90%
Because, literally.

00:29:53.092 --> 00:29:54.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: We're going
to do that.

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:55.494 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: Okay.

00:29:55.494 --> 00:29:57.496 align:middle line:84%
You're like that one
let's talk about.

00:29:57.496 --> 00:30:01.200 align:middle line:84%
Cause literally what
happens is you take on,

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.568 align:middle line:84%
especially if you
don't acknowledge

00:30:02.568 --> 00:30:05.104 align:middle line:84%
that this is a capacity you have
and this is what you're able

00:30:05.104 --> 00:30:07.206 align:middle line:84%
to do and this is what
you're doing, you take on all

00:30:07.206 --> 00:30:09.642 align:middle line:84%
of their stuff, all of
the yuck in their world,

00:30:09.642 --> 00:30:12.912 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of times they wake up
the next day going, oh my god,

00:30:12.912 --> 00:30:14.513 align:middle line:84%
I feel so alive,
I feel so happy,

00:30:14.513 --> 00:30:15.614 align:middle line:90%
and you're like why do I feel

00:30:15.614 --> 00:30:17.983 align:middle line:84%
like I was just run
over by a train?

00:30:17.983 --> 00:30:19.084 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:30:19.084 --> 00:30:21.687 align:middle line:84%
That's when you have
that healing capacity.

00:30:21.687 --> 00:30:24.623 align:middle line:84%
And so, so everything
that brought up,

00:30:24.623 --> 00:30:26.325 align:middle line:84%
everywhere where you've done
it, everywhere where all

00:30:26.325 --> 00:30:28.594 align:middle line:84%
of you have done it,
everything that's still locked

00:30:28.594 --> 00:30:31.497 align:middle line:84%
into your body, can we start
the unlocking process now?

00:30:31.497 --> 00:30:32.932 align:middle line:84%
Can we destroy and
uncreate everything

00:30:32.932 --> 00:30:34.667 align:middle line:84%
that keeps it locked
into your body.

00:30:34.667 --> 00:30:37.002 align:middle line:84%
"Right and Wrong, Good
and Bad, POD, POC, All 9,

00:30:37.002 --> 00:30:39.271 align:middle line:90%
Shorts, Boys and Beyond."

00:30:39.271 --> 00:30:42.274 align:middle line:84%
That's got a bit of energy
to it, meaning probably a lot

00:30:42.274 --> 00:30:45.110 align:middle line:84%
of people out there have
done it, and so there's

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:47.646 align:middle line:84%
that one thing, okay,
so the energy of it,

00:30:47.646 --> 00:30:48.981 align:middle line:84%
about communicating
with your body,

00:30:48.981 --> 00:30:50.616 align:middle line:84%
noticing what makes
your body lighter,

00:30:50.616 --> 00:30:52.017 align:middle line:90%
noticing what makes it heavier.

00:30:52.017 --> 00:30:55.154 align:middle line:84%
Noticing that when you put on
certain clothes, your body goes,

00:30:55.154 --> 00:30:56.322 align:middle line:90%
[sigh] and it starts to sing.

00:30:56.322 --> 00:30:57.456 align:middle line:90%
You know? And feel more alive.

00:30:57.456 --> 00:30:58.958 align:middle line:84%
And you put on certain
clothes and it's like,

00:30:58.958 --> 00:31:00.225 align:middle line:90%
nobody should look at me now.

00:31:00.225 --> 00:31:02.127 align:middle line:84%
You know? Because there are
certain clothes you wear

00:31:02.127 --> 00:31:06.432 align:middle line:84%
where you, where it has the
effect of not making people want

00:31:06.432 --> 00:31:08.434 align:middle line:84%
to look at you, but want
to look away from you.

00:31:08.434 --> 00:31:09.835 align:middle line:84%
You know, on those days where
you don't want to be seen,

00:31:09.835 --> 00:31:10.936 align:middle line:90%
you wear a different outfit

00:31:10.936 --> 00:31:12.471 align:middle line:84%
than on those days you
do want to be seen.

00:31:12.471 --> 00:31:13.672 align:middle line:84%
Well what if every
day were a day

00:31:13.672 --> 00:31:14.907 align:middle line:84%
where your body would
like to be seen?

00:31:14.907 --> 00:31:16.775 align:middle line:84%
Because your body
loves the energy

00:31:16.775 --> 00:31:18.377 align:middle line:90%
that other people direct at it.

00:31:18.377 --> 00:31:20.145 align:middle line:84%
So you start looking for
what makes your body lighter,

00:31:20.145 --> 00:31:21.380 align:middle line:90%
what makes it heavier, okay?

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:22.915 align:middle line:84%
And what makes you
lighter and heavier.

00:31:22.915 --> 00:31:24.817 align:middle line:84%
And then also, you want
to start asking your body

00:31:24.817 --> 00:31:26.919 align:middle line:90%
for everything that concerns it.

00:31:26.919 --> 00:31:27.853 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Food.

00:31:27.853 --> 00:31:32.424 align:middle line:84%
>> D.H.: Food, clothing,
movement,

00:31:32.424 --> 00:31:33.926 align:middle line:84%
and one of the other
things you don't want

00:31:33.926 --> 00:31:36.061 align:middle line:84%
to do is you don't
want to exercise.

00:31:36.061 --> 00:31:37.496 align:middle line:90%
I know that sounds weird.

00:31:37.496 --> 00:31:41.233 align:middle line:84%
But if you think of the word
exorcise, remember that,

00:31:41.233 --> 00:31:43.369 align:middle line:84%
remember that movie
with Linda Blair?

00:31:43.369 --> 00:31:46.872 align:middle line:84%
Exactly. Projectile vomit while
your head is spinning around,

00:31:46.872 --> 00:31:47.906 align:middle line:90%
that's what your body hears

00:31:47.906 --> 00:31:48.807 align:middle line:84%
when it goes hey you
want to exercise?

00:31:48.807 --> 00:31:49.341 align:middle line:90%
It's not like no!

00:31:49.341 --> 00:31:50.342 align:middle line:90%
Don't leave!

00:31:50.342 --> 00:31:51.643 align:middle line:84%
You know? Cause it
thinks it's going

00:31:51.643 --> 00:31:53.178 align:middle line:90%
to kick you, the being, out.

00:31:53.178 --> 00:31:55.147 align:middle line:90%
So, but your body loves to move.

00:31:55.147 --> 00:31:56.281 align:middle line:90%
So you want to say hey, body,

00:31:56.281 --> 00:31:58.117 align:middle line:84%
what movement would
you like to do today?

00:31:58.117 --> 00:31:59.551 align:middle line:84%
You know? And it might be
dancing, it might be running,

00:31:59.551 --> 00:32:00.586 align:middle line:84%
it might be a walk
around the block,

00:32:00.586 --> 00:32:01.987 align:middle line:90%
it might be sex, who knows?

00:32:01.987 --> 00:32:03.722 align:middle line:84%
Body, what would you
like to wear today?

00:32:03.722 --> 00:32:05.391 align:middle line:84%
Body, what would you
like to eat today?

00:32:05.391 --> 00:32:08.894 align:middle line:84%
And if you're at a restaurant,
for example, and, and if, well,

00:32:08.894 --> 00:32:11.997 align:middle line:84%
okay, the restaurant example
is you're sitting there,

00:32:11.997 --> 00:32:14.767 align:middle line:84%
close your eyes, close your
eyes, close the menu, open,

00:32:14.767 --> 00:32:16.101 align:middle line:90%
open the menu, open your eyes,

00:32:16.101 --> 00:32:17.236 align:middle line:84%
and the first thing
your eyes focus

00:32:17.236 --> 00:32:19.238 align:middle line:84%
on is usually what
your body would like.

00:32:19.238 --> 00:32:20.039 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: That easy?

00:32:20.039 --> 00:32:20.873 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: That easy.

00:32:20.873 --> 00:32:22.207 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: How does that work?

00:32:22.207 --> 00:32:23.776 align:middle line:84%
>> D.H.: That, because your
body [laughter], I love it.

00:32:23.776 --> 00:32:25.711 align:middle line:84%
You're like, how is
it that it's easy?

00:32:25.711 --> 00:32:27.746 align:middle line:84%
What? I've been working
really hard to get this.

00:32:27.746 --> 00:32:29.815 align:middle line:90%
I know! Exactly!

00:32:29.815 --> 00:32:30.682 align:middle line:90%
It really is that easy.

00:32:30.682 --> 00:32:32.017 align:middle line:90%
How does it work?

00:32:32.017 --> 00:32:34.353 align:middle line:84%
Cause, once again, your body
communicates energetically.

00:32:34.353 --> 00:32:36.422 align:middle line:84%
Our body's have been
communicating with us

00:32:36.422 --> 00:32:38.657 align:middle line:84%
for so long and we have
not been listening,

00:32:38.657 --> 00:32:40.659 align:middle line:84%
that we've literally
got to retrain ourselves

00:32:40.659 --> 00:32:43.562 align:middle line:84%
to speak its language, cause
it literally speaks a language

00:32:43.562 --> 00:32:44.830 align:middle line:90%
of energy.

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:46.565 align:middle line:84%
So what you want to do is
realize your body speaks a

00:32:46.565 --> 00:32:49.768 align:middle line:84%
language of energy, that's one
way you can communicate with it,

00:32:49.768 --> 00:32:53.872 align:middle line:84%
and also, whatever is lighter
is what your body likes.

00:32:53.872 --> 00:32:55.074 align:middle line:84%
So when you go to
look at your closet

00:32:55.074 --> 00:32:56.975 align:middle line:84%
and go body what would
you like to wear today?

00:32:56.975 --> 00:32:59.278 align:middle line:84%
Whatever feels light, like,
ooh, kind of like a little kid,

00:32:59.278 --> 00:33:00.946 align:middle line:84%
you know, being excited,
like ooh,

00:33:00.946 --> 00:33:02.581 align:middle line:90%
that's what it wants to wear.

00:33:02.581 --> 00:33:05.551 align:middle line:84%
And if you go from there, like
let's say you're going on a,

00:33:05.551 --> 00:33:07.119 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, like a
worldwide trip or something.

00:33:07.119 --> 00:33:09.021 align:middle line:84%
You know, and you're going
to be gone a few weeks,

00:33:09.021 --> 00:33:11.256 align:middle line:84%
so you go body, what
would you like to take?

00:33:11.256 --> 00:33:13.659 align:middle line:84%
And I know it can sound weird,
because people are like, what,

00:33:13.659 --> 00:33:14.726 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to talk to my body?

00:33:14.726 --> 00:33:15.961 align:middle line:90%
Well, yeah.

00:33:15.961 --> 00:33:16.662 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:33:16.662 --> 00:33:17.563 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Talk louder!

00:33:17.563 --> 00:33:18.764 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: Loud or not!

00:33:18.764 --> 00:33:20.132 align:middle line:90%
It depends on how much you want

00:33:20.132 --> 00:33:22.034 align:middle line:84%
to make your friends think
you're really weird, you know?

00:33:22.034 --> 00:33:25.003 align:middle line:84%
[Laughing] Cause, I don't
usually do it out loud.

00:33:25.003 --> 00:33:26.905 align:middle line:90%
But I've developed this thing

00:33:26.905 --> 00:33:28.907 align:middle line:84%
where I let my body
tell me what it wants.

00:33:28.907 --> 00:33:32.277 align:middle line:84%
What it wants to wear, and,
and cause I travel a lot also,

00:33:32.277 --> 00:33:34.379 align:middle line:84%
and so I'll go through
my closet and go okay,

00:33:34.379 --> 00:33:37.082 align:middle line:84%
based on temperature, you know,
it's going be like okay, here,

00:33:37.082 --> 00:33:39.418 align:middle line:84%
so it is linen weather, is
it this weather, whatever?

00:33:39.418 --> 00:33:41.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm like okay body out of this,
cause here's the temperature,

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:44.089 align:middle line:84%
what is it that we're
going to want to wear?

00:33:44.089 --> 00:33:46.625 align:middle line:84%
And pick all those things
and then you're good to go,

00:33:46.625 --> 00:33:50.162 align:middle line:84%
and what happens is you put
it on and people look at you

00:33:50.162 --> 00:33:52.764 align:middle line:84%
and they're like, oh,
you look so nice today.

00:33:52.764 --> 00:33:54.333 align:middle line:84%
Why? Because your
body wanted to wear

00:33:54.333 --> 00:33:57.636 align:middle line:84%
that because it knew some
match would work there,

00:33:57.636 --> 00:33:59.071 align:middle line:84%
that would actually
make it work for you.

00:33:59.071 --> 00:34:00.172 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: That's awesome.

00:34:00.172 --> 00:34:01.740 align:middle line:84%
That's pretty handy,
especially for a woman,

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:03.408 align:middle line:84%
because we have quite
a challenge with that.

00:34:03.408 --> 00:34:05.310 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh no, there's
nothing to wear, there's nothing

00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:06.912 align:middle line:90%
to wear in that closet!

00:34:06.912 --> 00:34:08.280 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: Exactly!

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.548 align:middle line:84%
And then what you want to do,
when you go there's nothing

00:34:09.548 --> 00:34:12.151 align:middle line:84%
to wear, see if you say
there's nothing to wear,

00:34:12.151 --> 00:34:14.353 align:middle line:84%
your point of view
creates your reality.

00:34:14.353 --> 00:34:16.220 align:middle line:84%
Reality doesn't create
your point of view.

00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:17.322 align:middle line:84%
So when you say there's
nothing to wear,

00:34:17.322 --> 00:34:19.124 align:middle line:90%
that's exactly what you create.

00:34:19.124 --> 00:34:21.260 align:middle line:84%
Rather than that, when you
notice yourself saying there's

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:22.260 align:middle line:84%
nothing to wear good,
you know what?

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:24.028 align:middle line:90%
POC and POD all that.

00:34:24.028 --> 00:34:25.664 align:middle line:84%
What, body, what
do you want to wear

00:34:25.664 --> 00:34:26.932 align:middle line:90%
that I haven't looked at yet?

00:34:26.932 --> 00:34:29.301 align:middle line:84%
Cause a lot of times, and
here's the weirdest thing,

00:34:29.301 --> 00:34:31.436 align:middle line:84%
you'll have this outfit that's
been tucked away for three

00:34:31.436 --> 00:34:32.738 align:middle line:90%
and a half years, you know?

00:34:32.738 --> 00:34:36.275 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, you
find it, on one of those days

00:34:36.275 --> 00:34:38.075 align:middle line:84%
when you think there's nothing
to wear, you put it on and it's

00:34:38.075 --> 00:34:39.577 align:middle line:90%
like everybody goes oh my god,

00:34:39.577 --> 00:34:41.046 align:middle line:84%
that's such a beautiful
outfit, when did you get it?

00:34:41.046 --> 00:34:42.080 align:middle line:90%
And you're like,

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:44.550 align:middle line:84%
1982 [laughing], you
know what I mean?

00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:47.718 align:middle line:84%
But it looks great and it's
been hiding there forever

00:34:47.718 --> 00:34:50.956 align:middle line:84%
because you just forgot about it
and I know it sounds funny to,

00:34:50.956 --> 00:34:53.559 align:middle line:84%
you know, talk about real
practical stuff like clothing

00:34:53.559 --> 00:34:56.395 align:middle line:84%
and what you wear, but this
is also part of our lives.

00:34:56.395 --> 00:34:57.596 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: This is life, yeah.

00:34:57.596 --> 00:34:58.797 align:middle line:84%
>> D.H.: Yeah, and this is
the place where you want

00:34:58.797 --> 00:35:00.933 align:middle line:84%
to have tools too because
a lot of people think

00:35:00.933 --> 00:35:04.203 align:middle line:84%
that tools are only about
the big things, and no,

00:35:04.203 --> 00:35:05.871 align:middle line:84%
you want to have tools
every moment of your life

00:35:05.871 --> 00:35:07.940 align:middle line:84%
because the little
things accumulate.

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:10.008 align:middle line:84%
Little heaviness's, little
judgements, they accumulate

00:35:10.008 --> 00:35:12.711 align:middle line:84%
and they start growing, and then
they get a life of their own.

00:35:12.711 --> 00:35:16.048 align:middle line:84%
If you don't ever have
to add to that pile,

00:35:16.048 --> 00:35:17.583 align:middle line:84%
if your life is light
all the time,

00:35:17.583 --> 00:35:18.951 align:middle line:90%
or at least mostly all the time.

00:35:18.951 --> 00:35:21.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And if not, that
means it's not ours or just,

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:22.754 align:middle line:90%
it's not there to serve us.

00:35:22.754 --> 00:35:23.589 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: Exactly.

00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:24.957 align:middle line:90%
And there's a way to change it.

00:35:24.957 --> 00:35:27.326 align:middle line:84%
See if it's not light, if what
you're living is not light,

00:35:27.326 --> 00:35:28.694 align:middle line:90%
there's a way to change it.

00:35:28.694 --> 00:35:31.196 align:middle line:84%
That's what I really would like
people to get, really would

00:35:31.196 --> 00:35:34.266 align:middle line:84%
like them to know, is
there's a way to change that.

00:35:34.266 --> 00:35:36.468 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to live with
that heaviness anymore.

00:35:36.468 --> 00:35:38.237 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to live with
the depression, you don't have

00:35:38.237 --> 00:35:40.505 align:middle line:84%
to live with the body image
issues, you don't have

00:35:40.505 --> 00:35:41.940 align:middle line:90%
to live with the insecurity.

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:43.041 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to live

00:35:43.041 --> 00:35:44.309 align:middle line:84%
with thinking you're
a pile of poo anymore.

00:35:44.309 --> 00:35:45.911 align:middle line:90%
We don't, you know what I mean?

00:35:45.911 --> 00:35:48.013 align:middle line:84%
And I say that cause those are
all the things I was living

00:35:48.013 --> 00:35:49.348 align:middle line:90%
with 13 years ago.

00:35:49.348 --> 00:35:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's so funny because people
look at me now and they're

00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:53.518 align:middle line:90%
like oh, you're, really?

00:35:53.518 --> 00:35:55.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, yeah, really.

00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:58.891 align:middle line:84%
To the point where it
was overwhelming me.

00:35:58.891 --> 00:36:00.525 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to live that way.

00:36:00.525 --> 00:36:02.327 align:middle line:84%
The tools are available
to change it.

00:36:02.327 --> 00:36:03.262 align:middle line:90%
It's.

00:36:03.262 --> 00:36:04.396 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Every area
of our life.

00:36:04.396 --> 00:36:06.632 align:middle line:84%
>> D.H.: Yeah, and it
just what works for you.

00:36:06.632 --> 00:36:08.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Awesome.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.935 align:middle line:84%
I so enjoyed this conversation,
is there a last little thing

00:36:09.935 --> 00:36:13.405 align:middle line:84%
that you would like to leave us
with here, after this beautiful,

00:36:13.405 --> 00:36:16.642 align:middle line:84%
awesome, juiciness of yours,
I mean this is really great

00:36:16.642 --> 00:36:19.611 align:middle line:84%
because beyond those words, I
know that those videos go out

00:36:19.611 --> 00:36:21.546 align:middle line:84%
and it's energetic too
when there's something

00:36:21.546 --> 00:36:23.548 align:middle line:90%
that is communicated and shared.

00:36:23.548 --> 00:36:26.351 align:middle line:84%
I hear it's very practical,
so that's what I love;

00:36:26.351 --> 00:36:28.153 align:middle line:90%
I really enjoy that, thank you.

00:36:28.153 --> 00:36:31.623 align:middle line:84%
And, and, and there's, how does
it get any better than this?

00:36:31.623 --> 00:36:32.925 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: Yes.

00:36:32.925 --> 00:36:35.694 align:middle line:84%
That. And if, what I'd like
to say people out there is

00:36:35.694 --> 00:36:39.131 align:middle line:84%
if you could truly change
anything, think about what it is

00:36:39.131 --> 00:36:40.932 align:middle line:84%
in your life you thought
couldn't change and what

00:36:40.932 --> 00:36:42.934 align:middle line:84%
if you would actually
allow it to change?

00:36:42.934 --> 00:36:46.338 align:middle line:84%
And what if you realize
that you, truly being you,

00:36:46.338 --> 00:36:50.242 align:middle line:84%
are the gift and the
change this world requires?

00:36:50.242 --> 00:36:53.178 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And boom, boom,
boom this world changes.

00:36:53.178 --> 00:36:54.379 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: Yes.

00:36:54.379 --> 00:36:56.915 align:middle line:84%
And then, we can actually
create it as a planet

00:36:56.915 --> 00:37:00.652 align:middle line:84%
and a world we all like to live
on, rather than a place we feel

00:37:00.652 --> 00:37:04.089 align:middle line:84%
like we don't want to live on
rather than a place we feel

00:37:04.089 --> 00:37:06.758 align:middle line:84%
like we're not being able
to contribute and rather

00:37:06.758 --> 00:37:09.695 align:middle line:84%
than a place we feel we're
not being contributed to.

00:37:09.695 --> 00:37:13.231 align:middle line:84%
Truly, what if we could create
this planet as our home now?

00:37:13.231 --> 00:37:15.500 align:middle line:84%
Now just some outpost
where we've been stuck

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:17.069 align:middle line:90%
and we're waiting to get off.

00:37:17.069 --> 00:37:18.804 align:middle line:84%
And what if it's
up to us and what

00:37:18.804 --> 00:37:22.107 align:middle line:84%
if we truly have the
tools to make that happen.

00:37:22.107 --> 00:37:24.409 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Thank you so much
Dain, I really enjoyed it.

00:37:24.409 --> 00:37:25.610 align:middle line:90%
>> D.H.: Thank you Lilou.

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:26.578 align:middle line:90%
I have enjoyed it too.

00:37:26.578 --> 00:37:27.679 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:37:27.679 --> 00:37:28.914 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: How does
it get any better

00:37:28.914 --> 00:37:30.515 align:middle line:84%
than this my beautiful
