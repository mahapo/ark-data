[ Music ]

00:00:09.643 --> 00:00:11.045 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Hello, [inaudible].

00:00:11.045 --> 00:00:12.980 align:middle line:90%
Lilou here.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:13.848 align:middle line:90%
I'm on the road.

00:00:13.848 --> 00:00:15.248 align:middle line:90%
Today I'm in England in London.

00:00:15.248 --> 00:00:16.317 align:middle line:90%
It's sunny.

00:00:16.317 --> 00:00:18.285 align:middle line:84%
It's sunny in England
believe it or not.

00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:19.487 align:middle line:90%
The British are crazy.

00:00:19.487 --> 00:00:20.788 align:middle line:84%
>> Becky Walsh: We've
gone completely mad.

00:00:20.788 --> 00:00:22.857 align:middle line:84%
We're running around
without any clothes on.

00:00:22.857 --> 00:00:23.991 align:middle line:90%
It's really worrying.

00:00:23.991 --> 00:00:26.060 align:middle line:84%
Out there is a dangerous
place I can tell you.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.729 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there's many people that
look like lobsters just running

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:32.032 align:middle line:84%
around going like this:
"We're in the sun."

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:33.134 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: I think we're going

00:00:33.134 --> 00:00:34.902 align:middle line:84%
to have a good time
right now with Becky.

00:00:34.902 --> 00:00:37.104 align:middle line:84%
Becky is kind of
this [inaudible].

00:00:37.104 --> 00:00:40.241 align:middle line:84%
You have this humor
combined with intuition

00:00:40.241 --> 00:00:43.310 align:middle line:84%
and you're having a really
good time, aren't you?

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.878 align:middle line:90%
>> Becky Walsh: I am.

00:00:43.878 --> 00:00:44.578 align:middle line:90%
I'm loving it.

00:00:44.578 --> 00:00:45.746 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely great.

00:00:45.746 --> 00:00:48.415 align:middle line:84%
I think that there's
such a scary kind of idea

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:50.718 align:middle line:84%
about intuition: "Oh,
you know things about me

00:00:50.718 --> 00:00:51.785 align:middle line:84%
that you couldn't
possibly know."

00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:53.320 align:middle line:90%
If you don't mix it with humor,

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.588 align:middle line:84%
you're just going
to terrify people.

00:00:54.588 --> 00:00:58.192 align:middle line:84%
So it's much easier
to mix the two things.

00:00:58.192 --> 00:01:00.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: So when did you start

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.730 align:middle line:84%
to be interested
about this intuition?

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.031 align:middle line:84%
>> Becky Walsh: Well,
do you know --

00:01:04.031 --> 00:01:06.901 align:middle line:84%
actually, I think that this
comes back in childhood.

00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And it was something that
most people don't realize is

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.005 align:middle line:90%
that there's a very strong link

00:01:11.005 --> 00:01:13.874 align:middle line:84%
between the intuitive
mind and being dyslexic.

00:01:13.874 --> 00:01:17.678 align:middle line:84%
So I'm actually dyslexic, and
dyslexic is really someone

00:01:17.678 --> 00:01:19.747 align:middle line:84%
who has more skills in the
right hemisphere of the brain

00:01:19.747 --> 00:01:21.248 align:middle line:90%
than they have in the left.

00:01:21.248 --> 00:01:24.985 align:middle line:84%
So in the same way that
if you lost your eyesight,

00:01:24.985 --> 00:01:28.155 align:middle line:84%
one of the other five senses
might step up to compensate.

00:01:28.155 --> 00:01:31.158 align:middle line:84%
So in the same way that I'm
really terrible with maths,

00:01:31.158 --> 00:01:33.994 align:middle line:84%
physics, chemistry, spelling,
remembering people's names --

00:01:33.994 --> 00:01:36.129 align:middle line:84%
in fact, sometimes even
remembering the word for

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:39.800 align:middle line:84%
"spoon" -- because of that my
left hemisphere isn't working

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.302 align:middle line:90%
quite in the same way.

00:01:41.302 --> 00:01:43.470 align:middle line:84%
So my right hemisphere of
the brain is compensating

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.372 align:middle line:90%
for what's lacking in the left.

00:01:45.372 --> 00:01:48.375 align:middle line:84%
So really, what I discovered
about being intuitive is

00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:50.978 align:middle line:84%
that I would say things and
then -- in my childhood --

00:01:50.978 --> 00:01:52.980 align:middle line:84%
and then people would say,
"How did you know that?

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.181 align:middle line:84%
Well, you shouldn't
say things like that.

00:01:54.181 --> 00:01:55.783 align:middle line:84%
You're not allowed to
say things like that."

00:01:55.783 --> 00:01:57.651 align:middle line:84%
And so then you learn
to keep your mouth shut.

00:01:57.651 --> 00:01:58.885 align:middle line:90%
That's usually what happens.

00:01:58.885 --> 00:02:00.955 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: So when did you reopen

00:02:00.955 --> 00:02:03.791 align:middle line:84%
and fully were okay
with being that way?

00:02:03.791 --> 00:02:06.560 align:middle line:84%
Because this is a big
deal in this society.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.961 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Boys, boys.

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:09.396 align:middle line:90%
It's always about boys.

00:02:09.396 --> 00:02:12.166 align:middle line:84%
So when I was a teenager,
of course, there's guys

00:02:12.166 --> 00:02:13.500 align:middle line:90%
that you fancy in school.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.036 align:middle line:84%
And then of course, your female
friends are so interested

00:02:16.036 --> 00:02:17.671 align:middle line:84%
in when you say,
"He fancies you."

00:02:17.671 --> 00:02:18.906 align:middle line:90%
"Oh, no he doesn't."

00:02:18.906 --> 00:02:19.840 align:middle line:90%
"Yes, he does."

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.408 align:middle line:90%
"No, no. I don't think he does."

00:02:21.408 --> 00:02:24.011 align:middle line:84%
And then he asks her out and
they're like, "Oh my God.

00:02:24.011 --> 00:02:25.512 align:middle line:90%
How did you know?"

00:02:25.512 --> 00:02:29.316 align:middle line:84%
And so really, it was
me reading men when --

00:02:29.316 --> 00:02:32.586 align:middle line:84%
well, they weren't really men
-- me reading boys at school

00:02:32.586 --> 00:02:34.622 align:middle line:84%
and telling my female friends
what the boys were thinking

00:02:34.622 --> 00:02:35.756 align:middle line:90%
and what they were doing.

00:02:35.756 --> 00:02:39.126 align:middle line:84%
And that really sparked
it into becoming okay.

00:02:39.126 --> 00:02:42.329 align:middle line:84%
Whereas before it was spooky and
scary, and then it became okay

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.866 align:middle line:84%
that this person has
an insight into things

00:02:45.866 --> 00:02:47.835 align:middle line:84%
that other people don't
see as commonplace.

00:02:47.835 --> 00:02:50.104 align:middle line:84%
But I think most people
don't see it as commonplace

00:02:50.104 --> 00:02:51.639 align:middle line:90%
because they close it down.

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:55.074 align:middle line:84%
But we're all intuitive because
we all have a right hemisphere

00:02:55.074 --> 00:02:56.310 align:middle line:90%
of the brain.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.245 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: The title of
your book with Hay House?

00:02:58.245 --> 00:03:00.214 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: It's called  You
Do Know: Learning to Act

00:03:00.214 --> 00:03:02.683 align:middle line:84%
on Intuition Instantly
because I call myself an

00:03:02.683 --> 00:03:05.419 align:middle line:84%
"intuitive catalyst" and I
worked one-to-one with people

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:07.488 align:middle line:90%
who are stuck on something.

00:03:07.488 --> 00:03:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And to me "stuck" is a holding
point while you're waiting

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.292 align:middle line:90%
for more information.

00:03:11.292 --> 00:03:14.295 align:middle line:84%
And I use intuition to
provide that more information.

00:03:14.295 --> 00:03:16.730 align:middle line:84%
However, one of the things
that happens at the end

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.499 align:middle line:84%
of the consultation
is the person goes --

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:20.868 align:middle line:84%
I mean, apart from saying,
"Oh my God, you're amazing.

00:03:20.868 --> 00:03:21.502 align:middle line:90%
That was brilliant.

00:03:21.502 --> 00:03:22.202 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:22.936 align:middle line:90%
You've changed my life."

00:03:22.936 --> 00:03:24.738 align:middle line:90%
Well, sometimes.

00:03:24.738 --> 00:03:27.775 align:middle line:84%
They also say, "Do you
know, you've just confirmed

00:03:27.775 --> 00:03:29.510 align:middle line:90%
to me what I already knew."

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.879 align:middle line:84%
So I kind of guess
I've written a book

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:34.081 align:middle line:84%
to put my other business
out of business.

00:03:34.081 --> 00:03:35.649 align:middle line:90%
So maybe that's not so sensible.

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:38.018 align:middle line:84%
But I've written a book that
literally teaches people how

00:03:38.018 --> 00:03:39.720 align:middle line:84%
to do what I could do
in a one-to-one session

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.690 align:middle line:84%
for themselves so that
they become their own inner

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.458 align:middle line:90%
psychologist, they become aware

00:03:44.458 --> 00:03:47.127 align:middle line:84%
of when they're closing
themselves down and how

00:03:47.127 --> 00:03:49.296 align:middle line:84%
to open their heart to other
people because you know

00:03:49.296 --> 00:03:50.631 align:middle line:90%
who to trust and you know

00:03:50.631 --> 00:03:53.100 align:middle line:84%
who you can feel safe
with in the world.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.903 align:middle line:84%
And really, then in that way we
can come together in community

00:03:55.903 --> 00:03:57.805 align:middle line:84%
and solve a lot of the
issues and problems

00:03:57.805 --> 00:03:59.807 align:middle line:90%
that we have in the whole world.

00:03:59.807 --> 00:04:02.843 align:middle line:84%
So it really is a global
shift of consciousness

00:04:02.843 --> 00:04:06.246 align:middle line:84%
from the thinking mind
to the intuitive mind.

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:09.383 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Is it the same thing,
then, the first impression?

00:04:09.383 --> 00:04:12.019 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: It kind of -- when you
say "the first impression" it's

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:14.655 align:middle line:84%
because you have an instant
reaction to somebody:

00:04:14.655 --> 00:04:15.889 align:middle line:90%
I like them or I don't.

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:17.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, actually what's
happening there is fascinating.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.228 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Is this going to
be a great lover or not?

00:04:21.228 --> 00:04:22.029 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Yeah.

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:22.830 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.431 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah. That has happened.

00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:28.135 align:middle line:84%
And to my cost I've
overlooked that a few times.

00:04:28.135 --> 00:04:29.737 align:middle line:84%
Anyway. But what's
actually happening

00:04:29.737 --> 00:04:32.406 align:middle line:84%
when you meet somebody is
the solar plexus chakra,

00:04:32.406 --> 00:04:36.744 align:middle line:84%
which comes out of here, it kind
of frisks people for information

00:04:36.744 --> 00:04:38.979 align:middle line:84%
and brings that information
into the sacral chakra,

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.081 align:middle line:84%
which is about four fingers
below the belly button.

00:04:41.081 --> 00:04:44.885 align:middle line:84%
And the sacral chakra interprets
that information into the gut.

00:04:44.885 --> 00:04:47.054 align:middle line:84%
Now, we actually have
a brain in the gut.

00:04:47.054 --> 00:04:49.456 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually made of
some of the same matter

00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:50.791 align:middle line:90%
as the brain in our heads.

00:04:50.791 --> 00:04:53.093 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually a proper
brain -- that's not a metaphor;

00:04:53.093 --> 00:04:54.795 align:middle line:90%
we have a brain in the gut.

00:04:54.795 --> 00:04:58.365 align:middle line:84%
And so the gut brain
interprets on the gut reaction

00:04:58.365 --> 00:05:01.168 align:middle line:84%
to see whether or not we need
to run away from something.

00:05:01.168 --> 00:05:03.904 align:middle line:84%
So it's in charge of what
you might call the four Fs

00:05:03.904 --> 00:05:05.305 align:middle line:90%
that are in the brain.

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:07.975 align:middle line:84%
So the most common of the four
Fs we really understand is the

00:05:07.975 --> 00:05:09.910 align:middle line:90%
flight or fight response.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.279 align:middle line:84%
So we'll go, "I feel
it in my stomach;

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:14.281 align:middle line:84%
I need to move away
from that person.

00:05:14.281 --> 00:05:16.116 align:middle line:84%
That person's not
a good person."

00:05:16.116 --> 00:05:18.185 align:middle line:84%
So we'll have a gut-led
reaction.

00:05:18.185 --> 00:05:20.521 align:middle line:84%
And then quite often
our psychology will fill

00:05:20.521 --> 00:05:23.657 align:middle line:84%
in the blanks and say, "Oh,
they're really negative," or,

00:05:23.657 --> 00:05:25.059 align:middle line:84%
"Oh, they're really
awful person."

00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:27.828 align:middle line:84%
In actual fact they might just
remind you of your math teacher.

00:05:27.828 --> 00:05:30.064 align:middle line:84%
And it might be that your math
teacher was kind of, like,

00:05:30.064 --> 00:05:33.400 align:middle line:84%
rude to you at school, or made
you scared, or humiliated you.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.837 align:middle line:84%
So really, the gut instinct
can't always be trusted

00:05:36.837 --> 00:05:39.907 align:middle line:84%
because it's so linked
to our ego, and our fear,

00:05:39.907 --> 00:05:42.076 align:middle line:90%
and our psychology in that way.

00:05:42.076 --> 00:05:46.280 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, as the world
is made on polarities,

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.716 align:middle line:84%
it only makes sense that there
is a second form of intuition

00:05:49.716 --> 00:05:52.820 align:middle line:84%
because everything is
in a form of opposite.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.756 align:middle line:84%
So you have love on one side and
fear on the other, and up, down,

00:05:55.756 --> 00:05:56.890 align:middle line:90%
and north and south poles.

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.759 align:middle line:84%
So we have all of
these opposites.

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:03.063 align:middle line:84%
So one of my biggest revelations
was that in my teaching

00:06:03.063 --> 00:06:05.899 align:middle line:84%
of intuition I've just been
teaching about gut reaction.

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:08.068 align:middle line:84%
But there is a second form of
intuition, which is what I write

00:06:08.068 --> 00:06:09.536 align:middle line:90%
about in the book  You Do Know ,

00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:11.205 align:middle line:84%
which is the heart-led
intuition,

00:06:11.205 --> 00:06:14.274 align:middle line:84%
which is when you feel
expansive and really excited

00:06:14.274 --> 00:06:15.909 align:middle line:84%
about something,
especially boys.

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:19.313 align:middle line:84%
And so you have this heart-led,
"Yes, this is correct.

00:06:19.313 --> 00:06:21.081 align:middle line:84%
This is the right
thing for me to do."

00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:22.883 align:middle line:84%
And Caroline Myss
describes this as kind

00:06:22.883 --> 00:06:24.251 align:middle line:90%
of like living at altitude.

00:06:24.251 --> 00:06:27.688 align:middle line:84%
So it's fast, it's
fast-thinking,

00:06:27.688 --> 00:06:30.190 align:middle line:84%
it's not stressful
because you know.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.360 align:middle line:84%
So in actual fact, all of those
reactions that you're having

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.630 align:middle line:84%
in the gut, it's quite important
because when we have a fight

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:41.034 align:middle line:84%
or flight response, the blood
leaves the stomach area and goes

00:06:41.034 --> 00:06:42.870 align:middle line:84%
to the arms and legs, which
means that we are going

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.872 align:middle line:84%
to fight the saber-toothed
tiger or we're going to run

00:06:44.872 --> 00:06:45.806 align:middle line:90%
from the saber-toothed tiger.

00:06:45.806 --> 00:06:47.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's all over
fairly quickly:

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.709 align:middle line:90%
You're dead or you made it.

00:06:48.709 --> 00:06:51.044 align:middle line:90%
So there isn't a lot to do.

00:06:51.044 --> 00:06:54.548 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the modern world
we're stressed quite often.

00:06:54.548 --> 00:06:56.950 align:middle line:84%
It can be "There's
an email in my inbox.

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:58.118 align:middle line:90%
Flight, fight."

00:06:58.118 --> 00:06:59.853 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
blood having moved

00:06:59.853 --> 00:07:02.523 align:middle line:84%
from the stomach is then
going into the legs and arms.

00:07:02.523 --> 00:07:05.292 align:middle line:84%
Now it was doing something
really useful in the stomach:

00:07:05.292 --> 00:07:08.161 align:middle line:84%
It was actually helping
the digestive system,

00:07:08.161 --> 00:07:10.964 align:middle line:84%
which means that lots of people
get IBS and horrible reactions

00:07:10.964 --> 00:07:13.600 align:middle line:84%
to things because they're not
digesting food in the same way.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.971 align:middle line:84%
And also it's helping the
immune system do its function.

00:07:17.971 --> 00:07:21.241 align:middle line:84%
So really what I'm suggesting by
using our heart-led intuition --

00:07:21.241 --> 00:07:23.443 align:middle line:84%
and I say we can't turn
off the gut instinct

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:27.247 align:middle line:84%
and neither would I -- but you
can access the heart intuition

00:07:27.247 --> 00:07:30.551 align:middle line:84%
by becoming curious,
simply by becoming curious

00:07:30.551 --> 00:07:34.288 align:middle line:84%
about what you fear from the
gut, then you become curious,

00:07:34.288 --> 00:07:36.657 align:middle line:84%
and then your heart opens and
it starts to give you answers

00:07:36.657 --> 00:07:38.992 align:middle line:84%
that the gut alone
just can't give you.

00:07:38.992 --> 00:07:40.928 align:middle line:84%
And by being able to
use the two things

00:07:40.928 --> 00:07:45.165 align:middle line:84%
in combination we understand
what really is a hope's fear,

00:07:45.165 --> 00:07:48.001 align:middle line:84%
the fear of something in the
future that we haven't even come

00:07:48.001 --> 00:07:52.039 align:middle line:84%
across and probably never will,
and fear of "Yes, actually,

00:07:52.039 --> 00:07:53.106 align:middle line:90%
that is a saber-toothed tiger,

00:07:53.106 --> 00:07:54.741 align:middle line:84%
and you do actually
need to run."

00:07:54.741 --> 00:07:57.044 align:middle line:84%
So by working with the
heart-led intuition,

00:07:57.044 --> 00:07:58.912 align:middle line:84%
you're lowering your
stress levels,

00:07:58.912 --> 00:08:01.481 align:middle line:84%
you're helping the
immune system.

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:03.717 align:middle line:84%
And you're really expanding
from your heart instead

00:08:03.717 --> 00:08:05.953 align:middle line:84%
of using your head as your
logical thinking pattern

00:08:05.953 --> 00:08:08.322 align:middle line:90%
to make decisions all the time.

00:08:08.322 --> 00:08:09.723 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: So you live longer.

00:08:09.723 --> 00:08:10.657 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Yeah.

00:08:10.657 --> 00:08:13.193 align:middle line:84%
And look prettier,
which is true.

00:08:13.193 --> 00:08:14.928 align:middle line:84%
You live longer; you
haven't got stress

00:08:14.928 --> 00:08:16.563 align:middle line:90%
and worry lines quite as much.

00:08:16.563 --> 00:08:20.067 align:middle line:84%
So yeah. And you have much more
fun to do the thing in life

00:08:20.067 --> 00:08:23.003 align:middle line:84%
that you're supposed to be
doing, which is being happy.

00:08:23.003 --> 00:08:24.204 align:middle line:90%
You just forgot.

00:08:24.204 --> 00:08:26.473 align:middle line:84%
We forgot to be happy,
you know, because we think

00:08:26.473 --> 00:08:28.775 align:middle line:84%
that happiness comes at the
end of a whole list of jobs

00:08:28.775 --> 00:08:30.110 align:middle line:90%
and it really doesn't.

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:32.179 align:middle line:84%
It's like the whole list of
jobs will just keep coming.

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:35.983 align:middle line:84%
And strangely, when you
choose happiness, you know,

00:08:35.983 --> 00:08:37.784 align:middle line:90%
the jobs kind of disappear.

00:08:37.784 --> 00:08:39.886 align:middle line:84%
And when you have to make
decisions really quickly you're

00:08:39.886 --> 00:08:40.654 align:middle line:90%
like, "I know.

00:08:40.654 --> 00:08:42.022 align:middle line:90%
I know that's a decision.

00:08:42.022 --> 00:08:45.092 align:middle line:84%
I make that decision instead
of analyzing, and worrying,

00:08:45.092 --> 00:08:48.161 align:middle line:84%
and over-thinking, and getting"
-- as my mother would call it --

00:08:48.161 --> 00:08:50.631 align:middle line:90%
"your knickers in a twist."

00:08:50.631 --> 00:08:51.665 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: You British.

00:08:51.665 --> 00:08:52.833 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:08:52.833 --> 00:08:54.735 align:middle line:90%
How -- and imagination --

00:08:54.735 --> 00:08:57.504 align:middle line:84%
some people think it's their
imagination making things up

00:08:57.504 --> 00:09:00.841 align:middle line:84%
or dreaming; how do you
make the difference?

00:09:00.841 --> 00:09:02.476 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: Well, part of it
kind of is your imagination.

00:09:02.476 --> 00:09:05.679 align:middle line:84%
And I think that you can't
underestimate the amazingness

00:09:05.679 --> 00:09:07.014 align:middle line:90%
of your imagination.

00:09:07.014 --> 00:09:08.682 align:middle line:84%
So practically everything
that we're surrounded by,

00:09:08.682 --> 00:09:10.250 align:middle line:90%
perhaps apart from the flowers,

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:12.419 align:middle line:84%
came from somebody's
imagination.

00:09:12.419 --> 00:09:15.822 align:middle line:84%
So in a way the intuition
acts with the imagination.

00:09:15.822 --> 00:09:17.724 align:middle line:84%
They're like the
same cinema screen.

00:09:17.724 --> 00:09:20.227 align:middle line:84%
And by acting with the
imagination it gives us the

00:09:20.227 --> 00:09:23.430 align:middle line:84%
opportunity to create
amazing things.

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:25.432 align:middle line:84%
So the intuition gives
you the information,

00:09:25.432 --> 00:09:30.570 align:middle line:84%
plays it out on the imagination
chalkboard or video screen,

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.172 align:middle line:84%
and then you're able
to be creative

00:09:32.172 --> 00:09:37.277 align:middle line:84%
and start changing the world
for the better hopefully.

00:09:37.277 --> 00:09:40.013 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: But the intuition,
what is the difference?

00:09:40.013 --> 00:09:42.949 align:middle line:84%
How is it different between the
intuition and the imagination?

00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:45.052 align:middle line:90%
How do we know exactly for sure

00:09:45.052 --> 00:09:47.554 align:middle line:84%
that this is really
the intuition?

00:09:47.554 --> 00:09:49.756 align:middle line:90%
Are there some symptoms?

00:09:49.756 --> 00:09:50.791 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Yep, yep, yep.

00:09:50.791 --> 00:09:52.392 align:middle line:84%
So how you can tell
the difference is

00:09:52.392 --> 00:09:54.061 align:middle line:90%
by becoming curious.

00:09:54.061 --> 00:09:55.829 align:middle line:84%
And the curiosity,
if it's right,

00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:58.432 align:middle line:90%
it will feel open and expansive.

00:09:58.432 --> 00:10:00.634 align:middle line:84%
If it's your imagination,
it won't change.

00:10:00.634 --> 00:10:03.136 align:middle line:84%
But in actual fact,
there's quite a few tools

00:10:03.136 --> 00:10:05.539 align:middle line:90%
that people think is intuition.

00:10:05.539 --> 00:10:06.740 align:middle line:90%
For example, people think

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.341 align:middle line:84%
that your emotions
are your intuition,

00:10:08.341 --> 00:10:10.110 align:middle line:84%
or your imagination's
your intuition,

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:13.280 align:middle line:84%
or that one of the claires like
clairvoyance is your intuition.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.182 align:middle line:84%
But in actual fact,
they're all gateways

00:10:15.182 --> 00:10:17.250 align:middle line:90%
to access what you already know.

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:19.252 align:middle line:90%
So the intuition is received.

00:10:19.252 --> 00:10:21.521 align:middle line:84%
You already have the
intuition -- it's received --

00:10:21.521 --> 00:10:24.291 align:middle line:84%
it's finding ways of being
able to access that intuition.

00:10:24.291 --> 00:10:27.594 align:middle line:84%
And imagination's one
of the activation points

00:10:27.594 --> 00:10:31.031 align:middle line:84%
to read your intuition, to
know you're intuition rather

00:10:31.031 --> 00:10:32.966 align:middle line:84%
than it being just
your intuition.

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:35.202 align:middle line:84%
But you'll know the
difference between, you know --

00:10:35.202 --> 00:10:38.405 align:middle line:84%
so for example, if a Mack truck
goes past and you're in love

00:10:38.405 --> 00:10:40.607 align:middle line:84%
with a guy called Mack,
you're going to be going,

00:10:40.607 --> 00:10:41.675 align:middle line:90%
"It's a sign, it's a sign."

00:10:41.675 --> 00:10:43.110 align:middle line:90%
But then you go, "Okay."

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:45.078 align:middle line:84%
So you become curious about it,
and then you just go, "Yeah,

00:10:45.078 --> 00:10:47.781 align:middle line:84%
there's half a dozen
Mack trucks in the world.

00:10:47.781 --> 00:10:51.118 align:middle line:84%
It's really not -- that's
not my intuition at all.

00:10:51.118 --> 00:10:53.386 align:middle line:84%
Let go. Let go of
the Mack truck."

00:10:53.386 --> 00:10:57.424 align:middle line:84%
So then we can actually get back
into that feeling in your heart.

00:10:57.424 --> 00:10:58.425 align:middle line:90%
And you go, "Yeah, okay.

00:10:58.425 --> 00:11:00.360 align:middle line:84%
That's wishful thinking,
my imagination.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.162 align:middle line:90%
It's not my intuition."

00:11:02.162 --> 00:11:03.196 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:11:03.196 --> 00:11:04.664 align:middle line:84%
Because signs, we
see signs everywhere

00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:06.032 align:middle line:90%
when we want to, don't we?

00:11:06.032 --> 00:11:07.367 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Yeah, we do.

00:11:07.367 --> 00:11:09.436 align:middle line:84%
And I really feel that a lot
of the signs that we see --

00:11:09.436 --> 00:11:13.006 align:middle line:84%
if you think about how, I
mean, people read tarot cards

00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:15.375 align:middle line:84%
and they say, "Oh, this
tarot card is telling me."

00:11:15.375 --> 00:11:17.344 align:middle line:84%
Well, no, the tarot
card's not telling you.

00:11:17.344 --> 00:11:20.046 align:middle line:84%
The tarot card is giving you the
access to the right hemisphere

00:11:20.046 --> 00:11:21.948 align:middle line:84%
of your brain because
the right hemisphere

00:11:21.948 --> 00:11:23.517 align:middle line:84%
of the brain sees
things as a whole

00:11:23.517 --> 00:11:25.252 align:middle line:90%
and sees things in pictures.

00:11:25.252 --> 00:11:26.987 align:middle line:84%
So it gives access to the
right hemisphere of the brain,

00:11:26.987 --> 00:11:29.389 align:middle line:84%
which is, again, where the
intuition kind of comes

00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:31.391 align:middle line:84%
in rather than the
left hemisphere,

00:11:31.391 --> 00:11:33.326 align:middle line:90%
which sees things in parts.

00:11:33.326 --> 00:11:36.263 align:middle line:84%
So with the right hemisphere
having that knowing and all

00:11:36.263 --> 00:11:39.332 align:middle line:84%
of that information coming
in through that side,

00:11:39.332 --> 00:11:42.169 align:middle line:84%
then what we're doing is
we're able to see things

00:11:42.169 --> 00:11:43.937 align:middle line:84%
as a whole rather
than seeing it apart.

00:11:43.937 --> 00:11:45.405 align:middle line:84%
And that is really
what intuition is,

00:11:45.405 --> 00:11:47.073 align:middle line:90%
is seeing things as a whole.

00:11:47.073 --> 00:11:49.943 align:middle line:84%
But it's only through
accessing our intuition

00:11:49.943 --> 00:11:51.411 align:middle line:90%
through that mental concept.

00:11:51.411 --> 00:11:53.480 align:middle line:84%
We then have to turn it into
words, and that's usually

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.582 align:middle line:90%
when it gets a bit sabotaged.

00:11:55.582 --> 00:11:58.318 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: How does that
work in relationship?

00:11:58.318 --> 00:11:59.553 align:middle line:90%
Meeting the one?

00:11:59.553 --> 00:12:02.889 align:middle line:84%
I know that a lot of
single women out there --

00:12:02.889 --> 00:12:06.326 align:middle line:84%
lot of women are
single; men, too --

00:12:06.326 --> 00:12:09.262 align:middle line:84%
and they keep on
meeting some men,

00:12:09.262 --> 00:12:10.797 align:middle line:84%
have the intuition,
maybe not fully.

00:12:10.797 --> 00:12:14.201 align:middle line:84%
How does that play a
role in the singleship?

00:12:14.201 --> 00:12:15.535 align:middle line:90%
Is that something we can say?

00:12:15.535 --> 00:12:16.403 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: We can say that, yeah.

00:12:16.403 --> 00:12:17.504 align:middle line:90%
We can say that.

00:12:17.504 --> 00:12:19.206 align:middle line:84%
So I believe in the
right one for right now.

00:12:19.206 --> 00:12:22.375 align:middle line:84%
I believe that relationships
are our greatest learning tool.

00:12:22.375 --> 00:12:25.078 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not always
about, like, is he the one?

00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:26.213 align:middle line:84%
In other words, well,
you're not going to know

00:12:26.213 --> 00:12:28.782 align:middle line:84%
that until you're
85, 95 to see whether

00:12:28.782 --> 00:12:30.784 align:middle line:90%
or not it had the longevity.

00:12:30.784 --> 00:12:34.321 align:middle line:84%
But can it be the right one
for really developing your soul

00:12:34.321 --> 00:12:36.523 align:middle line:90%
and who you are as a person?

00:12:36.523 --> 00:12:38.692 align:middle line:84%
Because you only
know who you are

00:12:38.692 --> 00:12:41.027 align:middle line:84%
in relationship to
what you're not.

00:12:41.027 --> 00:12:42.629 align:middle line:90%
So then when you meet someone,

00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:45.632 align:middle line:84%
they can be a really great
catalyst in a relationship

00:12:45.632 --> 00:12:47.434 align:middle line:84%
for you really understanding
yourself.

00:12:47.434 --> 00:12:50.370 align:middle line:84%
Relationships are a great
understanding program.

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:52.772 align:middle line:84%
So really, the true
love that you find

00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:54.708 align:middle line:90%
in a relationship is self-love

00:12:54.708 --> 00:12:57.077 align:middle line:84%
if it's actually a
relationship that's working

00:12:57.077 --> 00:12:59.679 align:middle line:84%
because you see yourself in
relationships to somebody else.

00:12:59.679 --> 00:13:01.915 align:middle line:84%
But in regards to whether
or not somebody's going

00:13:01.915 --> 00:13:04.751 align:middle line:84%
to be a positive catalyst
for your self-love

00:13:04.751 --> 00:13:07.954 align:middle line:84%
or actually take away your
self-love because believe me,

00:13:07.954 --> 00:13:11.992 align:middle line:84%
it takes longer to find lost
self-esteem than a new love.

00:13:11.992 --> 00:13:14.527 align:middle line:84%
So we want to be careful with
our self-esteem because it's one

00:13:14.527 --> 00:13:18.298 align:middle line:84%
of our valuable assets; it's so,
so important to keep hold of.

00:13:18.298 --> 00:13:21.301 align:middle line:84%
So when we start going and
making excuses for people,

00:13:21.301 --> 00:13:24.371 align:middle line:84%
when we say things like,
"Oh, it's not his fault.

00:13:24.371 --> 00:13:26.072 align:middle line:84%
He's just come out of a
really bad relationship,"

00:13:26.072 --> 00:13:27.340 align:middle line:90%
or, "It's not her fault.

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:29.509 align:middle line:84%
She didn't have a really
great father," or [inaudible]

00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:33.513 align:middle line:84%
and then we're allowing
them to kind of abuse us

00:13:33.513 --> 00:13:35.482 align:middle line:84%
and make us feel
bad about ourselves.

00:13:35.482 --> 00:13:37.918 align:middle line:84%
So again, the gut instinct
will probably tell you avoid.

00:13:37.918 --> 00:13:40.754 align:middle line:84%
But then if you've been hurt
before, the gut instinct's going

00:13:40.754 --> 00:13:42.789 align:middle line:84%
to actually tell you
just to avoid members

00:13:42.789 --> 00:13:46.059 align:middle line:84%
of the opposite sex
completely across the board.

00:13:46.059 --> 00:13:51.097 align:middle line:84%
So then it's using the heart-led
intuition via the curiosity

00:13:51.097 --> 00:13:52.898 align:middle line:84%
to read whether or
not it's your fear

00:13:52.898 --> 00:13:54.167 align:middle line:84%
because you've been
hurt in the past.

00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:57.170 align:middle line:84%
That's saying, "Move
away," or it's blind,

00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:00.473 align:middle line:84%
desperate hope that's
telling you to move towards.

00:14:00.473 --> 00:14:01.675 align:middle line:90%
So just become curious.

00:14:01.675 --> 00:14:04.210 align:middle line:84%
And there's a great
test that you can do,

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:06.813 align:middle line:84%
which is write the name of
the person on a piece of paper

00:14:06.813 --> 00:14:09.249 align:middle line:84%
and then have a blank
piece of paper.

00:14:09.249 --> 00:14:12.218 align:middle line:84%
Fold them up, shake them around
a little bit so you can't tell

00:14:12.218 --> 00:14:15.555 align:middle line:84%
which is which, then stand up
straight -- really straight --

00:14:15.555 --> 00:14:18.124 align:middle line:84%
and put one of pieces of
paper over your heart.

00:14:18.124 --> 00:14:20.860 align:middle line:84%
Now you will either move forward
the piece of paper towards it,

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.329 align:middle line:84%
or you'll move away
from the piece of paper,

00:14:22.329 --> 00:14:23.863 align:middle line:90%
or you'll stay neutral.

00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:26.232 align:middle line:84%
If it's the piece of
paper with nothing on,

00:14:26.232 --> 00:14:28.435 align:middle line:84%
the chances are you'll
have no reaction.

00:14:28.435 --> 00:14:30.170 align:middle line:84%
If it's the piece of paper
with the person's name

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:32.973 align:middle line:84%
and you move forward towards
it, it means that they're kind

00:14:32.973 --> 00:14:35.642 align:middle line:84%
of good for you or your body
thinks they're good for you.

00:14:35.642 --> 00:14:38.878 align:middle line:84%
And if you move away from the
piece of paper, then you need

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:41.881 align:middle line:84%
to start to become very
curious and be very aware

00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:45.051 align:middle line:84%
of what reaction you're having
because that's your body saying,

00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:47.921 align:middle line:84%
"No, I'm not comfortable
with this."

00:14:47.921 --> 00:14:52.892 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Because the body, even
the heart, the body has this --

00:14:52.892 --> 00:14:56.696 align:middle line:84%
wants to -- is drawn towards --
that's part of the intuition,

00:14:56.696 --> 00:14:59.265 align:middle line:84%
too, because it sometimes
can be misleading.

00:14:59.265 --> 00:15:00.533 align:middle line:90%
We can be attracted, too,

00:15:00.533 --> 00:15:02.569 align:middle line:84%
but that's not really
the intuition playing its

00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:03.636 align:middle line:90%
role there.

00:15:03.636 --> 00:15:05.238 align:middle line:84%
Lot of things are
happening in the body.

00:15:05.238 --> 00:15:07.374 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: Well, I think that
sometimes you can look

00:15:07.374 --> 00:15:10.543 align:middle line:84%
into somebody's eyes and
it's like you recognize them.

00:15:10.543 --> 00:15:13.513 align:middle line:84%
There's something -- like,
there's a soul connection,

00:15:13.513 --> 00:15:15.582 align:middle line:90%
there's some kind of boom moment

00:15:15.582 --> 00:15:17.650 align:middle line:84%
where you go, "I
know this person."

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:20.487 align:middle line:84%
And I think when you have
those really intense kind

00:15:20.487 --> 00:15:22.856 align:middle line:84%
of reactions, you've
really got to pay attention.

00:15:22.856 --> 00:15:26.159 align:middle line:84%
It could be, you know -- you
could kind of think, "Well,

00:15:26.159 --> 00:15:29.763 align:middle line:84%
I paid attention to this
amazing reaction I had

00:15:29.763 --> 00:15:31.398 align:middle line:90%
and it didn't work out."

00:15:31.398 --> 00:15:33.466 align:middle line:84%
But what was the
connection that you had?

00:15:33.466 --> 00:15:36.302 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, I have to tell
you, I had a connection

00:15:36.302 --> 00:15:38.471 align:middle line:90%
like that with a guy in Dublin.

00:15:38.471 --> 00:15:40.907 align:middle line:84%
I was working in
Dublin as a speaker.

00:15:40.907 --> 00:15:43.410 align:middle line:84%
And we went for a
drink in a bar after.

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:45.812 align:middle line:84%
And I walked into the bar
and I had this huge reaction.

00:15:45.812 --> 00:15:47.714 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, the
guy's good-looking,

00:15:47.714 --> 00:15:51.217 align:middle line:84%
so it's not like I'm having huge
reactions over Mr. Ugly here.

00:15:51.217 --> 00:15:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And my friend was like,
"Stop looking at him."

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:55.455 align:middle line:90%
I was like, "I can't help it."

00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:56.656 align:middle line:84%
It's like, just this
[inaudible].

00:15:56.656 --> 00:15:58.825 align:middle line:90%
And it was across the whole bar.

00:15:58.825 --> 00:16:00.393 align:middle line:84%
Like, everyone in
the bar could see it.

00:16:00.393 --> 00:16:01.728 align:middle line:90%
It was tangible.

00:16:01.728 --> 00:16:04.097 align:middle line:84%
And so, of course, on the
way out I did the card flick.

00:16:04.097 --> 00:16:05.165 align:middle line:90%
Have you seen this before?

00:16:05.165 --> 00:16:06.966 align:middle line:84%
You go and you just
pass him your card.

00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:09.069 align:middle line:84%
So I did the card
flick on the way out.

00:16:09.069 --> 00:16:10.637 align:middle line:84%
Now, he tried to get
in touch with me.

00:16:10.637 --> 00:16:11.938 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, he
lived in Canada

00:16:11.938 --> 00:16:14.107 align:middle line:84%
so we couldn't have
actually been together.

00:16:14.107 --> 00:16:15.675 align:middle line:84%
We corresponded for
a little while.

00:16:15.675 --> 00:16:16.676 align:middle line:90%
Then all of a sudden there's all

00:16:16.676 --> 00:16:18.711 align:middle line:84%
of these things coming
up about Canada.

00:16:18.711 --> 00:16:20.280 align:middle line:90%
And you're like, "Okay.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:21.648 align:middle line:90%
So is this actually about him?

00:16:21.648 --> 00:16:24.384 align:middle line:84%
Or was this another thing
telling me that I need to go

00:16:24.384 --> 00:16:27.153 align:middle line:84%
to Canada because there's
something in Canada either

00:16:27.153 --> 00:16:29.722 align:middle line:90%
for my work or something else?"

00:16:29.722 --> 00:16:31.658 align:middle line:84%
And so then you start
to think, "Okay.

00:16:31.658 --> 00:16:35.428 align:middle line:84%
Well, that didn't work out, but
it was a catalyst to trigger me

00:16:35.428 --> 00:16:37.664 align:middle line:84%
into thinking about going to
Canada, one of the few places

00:16:37.664 --> 00:16:38.865 align:middle line:90%
in the world I've not been."

00:16:38.865 --> 00:16:41.734 align:middle line:84%
So next year I'm
going to Canada.

00:16:41.734 --> 00:16:43.970 align:middle line:84%
So maybe that wouldn't
have happened if it wasn't

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:46.005 align:middle line:84%
for this funny meeting
in a bar in Dublin.

00:16:46.005 --> 00:16:50.176 align:middle line:84%
So it's not always what we
think or hope it's about.

00:16:50.176 --> 00:16:53.179 align:middle line:84%
It can be something, a big,
big thing that's much bigger

00:16:53.179 --> 00:16:54.647 align:middle line:84%
than we could have
ever imagined.

00:16:54.647 --> 00:16:59.385 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Do you work
also with spirit guides?

00:16:59.385 --> 00:17:00.386 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: No, I don't.

00:17:00.386 --> 00:17:02.021 align:middle line:90%
I used to.

00:17:02.021 --> 00:17:07.961 align:middle line:84%
But what started to happen is --
you know we talk about oneness.

00:17:07.961 --> 00:17:10.597 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to be quite
a jump in what I'm saying.

00:17:10.597 --> 00:17:12.264 align:middle line:84%
I've actually written
an e-book about this

00:17:12.264 --> 00:17:14.634 align:middle line:90%
because it's such a huge jump.

00:17:14.634 --> 00:17:17.102 align:middle line:84%
But I used to really
believe in spirit guides --

00:17:17.102 --> 00:17:19.304 align:middle line:84%
I could feel them,
I talked to them,

00:17:19.304 --> 00:17:21.707 align:middle line:84%
I had all of these
connections but I can't tell --

00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:22.742 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Lots of friends?

00:17:22.742 --> 00:17:24.144 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: I had lots of
dead friends, yes.

00:17:24.144 --> 00:17:28.114 align:middle line:84%
But I kept asking this question:
"Well, if this is such a thing,

00:17:28.114 --> 00:17:29.382 align:middle line:90%
where are you guiding me?"

00:17:29.382 --> 00:17:31.251 align:middle line:84%
Like, where is spirit
guiding me?

00:17:31.251 --> 00:17:33.786 align:middle line:84%
And then I suddenly got to a
point where I understood it.

00:17:33.786 --> 00:17:36.222 align:middle line:84%
And I'll just try and
simplify it in this way:

00:17:36.222 --> 00:17:39.659 align:middle line:84%
It's as if you're
a drop in an ocean.

00:17:39.659 --> 00:17:41.828 align:middle line:84%
And in order to understand
that you're a drop in an ocean,

00:17:41.828 --> 00:17:43.763 align:middle line:84%
you have to elevate
yourself out of the ocean.

00:17:43.763 --> 00:17:46.833 align:middle line:84%
So in the sense, like,
become like rain to be able

00:17:46.833 --> 00:17:49.435 align:middle line:84%
to see the vastness,
and the divinity,

00:17:49.435 --> 00:17:51.838 align:middle line:84%
and the amazingness
of the ocean.

00:17:51.838 --> 00:17:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And then you go back to
being a drop in the ocean.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:59.212 align:middle line:84%
So you have everything that is
in the ocean in that one drop.

00:17:59.212 --> 00:18:03.483 align:middle line:84%
So if we change the word
"ocean" for "universe"

00:18:03.483 --> 00:18:06.686 align:middle line:84%
and interchange the word
"drop" for being you,

00:18:06.686 --> 00:18:09.689 align:middle line:84%
you have everything that's in
the universe inside of you.

00:18:09.689 --> 00:18:11.457 align:middle line:84%
So in actual fact,
there is no separation

00:18:11.457 --> 00:18:12.559 align:middle line:90%
between you and spirit.

00:18:12.559 --> 00:18:14.460 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, there
is no thick separation

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.529 align:middle line:90%
between you and spirit guides.

00:18:16.529 --> 00:18:18.631 align:middle line:84%
And I started to believe
that most of the guides

00:18:18.631 --> 00:18:22.735 align:middle line:84%
that I was talking to
were actually archetypes

00:18:22.735 --> 00:18:27.574 align:middle line:84%
of a higher element of myself
and not separate people.

00:18:27.574 --> 00:18:29.442 align:middle line:84%
But in actual fact what
they were trying to guide me

00:18:29.442 --> 00:18:31.678 align:middle line:90%
to is understanding oneness.

00:18:31.678 --> 00:18:34.614 align:middle line:84%
Rather than understanding,
"Oh, they're protecting me,"

00:18:34.614 --> 00:18:37.016 align:middle line:84%
it was actually understanding
that I actually have everything

00:18:37.016 --> 00:18:39.018 align:middle line:84%
that I need and they
were actually guiding me

00:18:39.018 --> 00:18:42.789 align:middle line:84%
into self-love because there's
no they and there's no us.

00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:44.924 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of a oneness.

00:18:44.924 --> 00:18:46.192 align:middle line:84%
But it's quite hard
to understand.

00:18:46.192 --> 00:18:49.028 align:middle line:84%
And I think understanding
spirit guides is fantastic

00:18:49.028 --> 00:18:51.865 align:middle line:84%
because it's one
step in the direction

00:18:51.865 --> 00:18:55.201 align:middle line:84%
of understanding consciousness,
but it is not the final step.

00:18:55.201 --> 00:18:58.371 align:middle line:84%
And when we get stuck on the
idea of guides, we get stuck

00:18:58.371 --> 00:19:01.341 align:middle line:84%
on the idea of a physical
world and the spirit world,

00:19:01.341 --> 00:19:04.310 align:middle line:84%
rather than getting
into the wholeness

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:06.312 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness itself.

00:19:06.312 --> 00:19:09.616 align:middle line:84%
So yes and no, if that
makes sense in order

00:19:09.616 --> 00:19:11.751 align:middle line:90%
to answer that question.

00:19:11.751 --> 00:19:19.225 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And how that
change of perception or of --

00:19:19.225 --> 00:19:23.329 align:middle line:84%
how did that change relating
to your guides this way?

00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:27.066 align:middle line:84%
What did it change in your own
practice or in your intuition?

00:19:27.066 --> 00:19:28.434 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: I stopped
giving my power away.

00:19:28.434 --> 00:19:31.471 align:middle line:84%
I stopped thinking that there
was something outside of me

00:19:31.471 --> 00:19:34.073 align:middle line:84%
that actually was going to guide
me, had all of the answers.

00:19:34.073 --> 00:19:35.708 align:middle line:84%
And by stopping giving
my power away,

00:19:35.708 --> 00:19:37.977 align:middle line:90%
I actually realized not just --

00:19:37.977 --> 00:19:39.712 align:middle line:84%
you know, this sounds like
a strange thing to say --

00:19:39.712 --> 00:19:42.882 align:middle line:84%
not how powerful I am,
how powerful we are.

00:19:42.882 --> 00:19:46.052 align:middle line:84%
I suddenly realized that we
have everything that we need.

00:19:46.052 --> 00:19:48.288 align:middle line:84%
And rather than actually giving
my power away to something

00:19:48.288 --> 00:19:51.658 align:middle line:84%
that was going to in
essence save me from my pain,

00:19:51.658 --> 00:19:54.127 align:middle line:84%
that was going to help me
avoid pain, that was going

00:19:54.127 --> 00:19:56.162 align:middle line:84%
to help me make no
bad decisions,

00:19:56.162 --> 00:19:57.897 align:middle line:90%
that was actually going to --

00:19:57.897 --> 00:20:02.402 align:middle line:84%
in actual fact, I suddenly
realized that I love my pain.

00:20:02.402 --> 00:20:04.404 align:middle line:84%
I love some of my
terrible decisions

00:20:04.404 --> 00:20:06.172 align:middle line:90%
because I've learned from them.

00:20:06.172 --> 00:20:07.173 align:middle line:90%
And I've grown.

00:20:07.173 --> 00:20:08.608 align:middle line:90%
And in actual fact,

00:20:08.608 --> 00:20:12.445 align:middle line:84%
every difficult thing I've ever
experienced, if you said, "Okay.

00:20:12.445 --> 00:20:14.447 align:middle line:90%
Well, we'll eradicate that,

00:20:14.447 --> 00:20:17.216 align:middle line:84%
we'll get in the  Doctor
Who  Tardis and we'll go back

00:20:17.216 --> 00:20:19.786 align:middle line:84%
in time, and we'll stop
that from happening."

00:20:19.786 --> 00:20:22.322 align:middle line:90%
I'd say, "No, I needed that."

00:20:22.322 --> 00:20:25.091 align:middle line:84%
And so in actual fact, then, why
do I need someone to guide me

00:20:25.091 --> 00:20:28.594 align:middle line:84%
from something that is actually
part of my life's calling

00:20:28.594 --> 00:20:31.431 align:middle line:84%
and my life's purpose is to
go through difficult times?

00:20:31.431 --> 00:20:34.534 align:middle line:84%
It's what we make of the
difficult times that define us

00:20:34.534 --> 00:20:37.470 align:middle line:84%
as human beings, is whether
or not you make it mean

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:40.006 align:middle line:84%
that it's weakened you or
whether or not you make it mean

00:20:40.006 --> 00:20:41.441 align:middle line:90%
that it strengthened you.

00:20:41.441 --> 00:20:45.645 align:middle line:84%
Now, that might make it sound
like I come from a privileged --

00:20:45.645 --> 00:20:47.513 align:middle line:84%
really never had anything
difficult ever happened

00:20:47.513 --> 00:20:48.915 align:middle line:90%
to me in my life.

00:20:48.915 --> 00:20:52.418 align:middle line:84%
I've had plenty of what would
be on paper difficult things.

00:20:52.418 --> 00:20:53.753 align:middle line:84%
I'm hugely grateful
for all of them.

00:20:53.753 --> 00:20:57.390 align:middle line:84%
So then are they
difficult now in hindsight?

00:20:57.390 --> 00:21:00.326 align:middle line:84%
And then the ones that I
don't feel I was successful

00:21:00.326 --> 00:21:02.161 align:middle line:90%
at I've rewritten.

00:21:02.161 --> 00:21:04.364 align:middle line:84%
So I've literally rewritten
some of the thoughts

00:21:04.364 --> 00:21:06.432 align:middle line:90%
that I have had about things.

00:21:06.432 --> 00:21:09.002 align:middle line:84%
Rather than saying, "This really
terrible thing happened to me,"

00:21:09.002 --> 00:21:10.703 align:middle line:90%
I now kind of, like, think, "Oh,

00:21:10.703 --> 00:21:14.307 align:middle line:84%
this really fascinating thing
happened to me that I needed,

00:21:14.307 --> 00:21:17.377 align:middle line:84%
especially for my clients
or to have an understanding

00:21:17.377 --> 00:21:18.811 align:middle line:90%
of the world at large."

00:21:18.811 --> 00:21:22.048 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I'm not into
avoiding pain and I'm not

00:21:22.048 --> 00:21:25.985 align:middle line:84%
into using intuition to avoid
pain; I'm into using intuition

00:21:25.985 --> 00:21:29.088 align:middle line:84%
to live an invigorated
and exciting life

00:21:29.088 --> 00:21:30.757 align:middle line:90%
that you're not scared of.

00:21:30.757 --> 00:21:32.925 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't -- because
I don't fear pain.

00:21:32.925 --> 00:21:34.927 align:middle line:84%
I'm kind of, like,
curious about it.

00:21:34.927 --> 00:21:38.965 align:middle line:84%
And then therefore, it
transforms the idea of pain

00:21:38.965 --> 00:21:43.202 align:middle line:84%
into being something so much
more beneficial to who you are

00:21:43.202 --> 00:21:45.805 align:middle line:84%
because it's only your
decision that it's painful.

00:21:45.805 --> 00:21:48.474 align:middle line:84%
And you can change
your mind about it.

00:21:48.474 --> 00:21:51.544 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: How do you in painful
moments use your intuition?

00:21:51.544 --> 00:21:54.180 align:middle line:84%
Is that easy to access,
or is it a bit harder?

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:56.816 align:middle line:84%
And do you have things to put
back yourself in the flow,

00:21:56.816 --> 00:21:58.684 align:middle line:90%
I guess, and be intuitive again?

00:21:58.684 --> 00:22:01.320 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: I think, you know, I love
throwing my toys out of the pram

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.388 align:middle line:90%
and having a right old moan.

00:22:02.388 --> 00:22:03.289 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm British.

00:22:03.289 --> 00:22:04.690 align:middle line:90%
We love moaning.

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:07.126 align:middle line:84%
So I'll throw my toys out of the
pram, I'll have a big old moan,

00:22:07.126 --> 00:22:10.696 align:middle line:84%
and I have what I call the
"24 hours I scream-a-thon"

00:22:10.696 --> 00:22:12.165 align:middle line:90%
where really I scream.

00:22:12.165 --> 00:22:13.433 align:middle line:90%
And I will be miserable.

00:22:13.433 --> 00:22:14.600 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:16.602 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, I never
go for the whole pint,

00:22:16.602 --> 00:22:20.506 align:middle line:84%
but I'll have a good
old freaking whinge.

00:22:20.506 --> 00:22:22.041 align:middle line:90%
I will whinge about things.

00:22:22.041 --> 00:22:24.343 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll snap
out of it and realize

00:22:24.343 --> 00:22:27.013 align:middle line:84%
that in actual fact I probably
should be feeling grateful

00:22:27.013 --> 00:22:29.649 align:middle line:84%
about it, but I just can't
right now and I will tomorrow.

00:22:29.649 --> 00:22:32.251 align:middle line:84%
And then I wake up in the
morning and I just go, "Oh yeah,

00:22:32.251 --> 00:22:33.286 align:middle line:90%
that was interesting."

00:22:33.286 --> 00:22:35.321 align:middle line:84%
It's just another
way of me expressing

00:22:35.321 --> 00:22:37.790 align:middle line:84%
that I can't get what I want
and I'm screaming about it.

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:40.092 align:middle line:90%
But in actual fact, I know

00:22:40.092 --> 00:22:42.562 align:middle line:84%
that the universe knows
what's good for me.

00:22:42.562 --> 00:22:45.398 align:middle line:84%
And when I stop screaming about
what I think is good for me

00:22:45.398 --> 00:22:47.166 align:middle line:90%
and get back into flow,

00:22:47.166 --> 00:22:50.102 align:middle line:84%
it's just me telling
that I'm not in flow.

00:22:50.102 --> 00:22:52.939 align:middle line:84%
But while you're not in flow,
you have to go with not being

00:22:52.939 --> 00:22:55.174 align:middle line:84%
in flow instead of, then,
fighting not being in flow

00:22:55.174 --> 00:22:56.843 align:middle line:84%
because then you're
doing twice the fighting

00:22:56.843 --> 00:22:58.077 align:middle line:90%
that you were doing before.

00:22:58.077 --> 00:23:00.079 align:middle line:84%
So one level of fighting
is enough.

00:23:00.079 --> 00:23:02.949 align:middle line:84%
So succumb to your screaming
inner child for 24 hours

00:23:02.949 --> 00:23:05.818 align:middle line:84%
and then just get the heck over
it and get on with your day.

00:23:05.818 --> 00:23:06.853 align:middle line:90%
It's much easier.

00:23:06.853 --> 00:23:07.954 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: I love it.

00:23:07.954 --> 00:23:11.858 align:middle line:90%
I'm having such a great time.

00:23:11.858 --> 00:23:13.860 align:middle line:90%
Oh my God.

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:15.161 align:middle line:90%
What else is in that book?

00:23:15.161 --> 00:23:16.696 align:middle line:90%
What else is important message

00:23:16.696 --> 00:23:19.298 align:middle line:84%
for to you get out
there these days?

00:23:19.298 --> 00:23:21.501 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: I think the biggest
message in the whole

00:23:21.501 --> 00:23:24.137 align:middle line:84%
of the book really takes
it out as far and as wide

00:23:24.137 --> 00:23:26.873 align:middle line:84%
as Albert Einstein saying
that we cannot continue

00:23:26.873 --> 00:23:30.009 align:middle line:84%
with the same level
of consciousness

00:23:30.009 --> 00:23:32.278 align:middle line:84%
that created the problems
that we've currently got.

00:23:32.278 --> 00:23:33.312 align:middle line:90%
And to me, that level

00:23:33.312 --> 00:23:35.615 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness is
the thinking mind.

00:23:35.615 --> 00:23:38.684 align:middle line:84%
And it's brilliant idea to
be able to kind of, like,

00:23:38.684 --> 00:23:42.088 align:middle line:84%
go into oneness or be in,
you know, like, the now,

00:23:42.088 --> 00:23:45.558 align:middle line:84%
or mindfulness, or brilliant
when you're in your bedroom.

00:23:45.558 --> 00:23:48.361 align:middle line:84%
It's great being an angel when
your feathers are not ruffled.

00:23:48.361 --> 00:23:51.197 align:middle line:84%
But human beings
are really annoying.

00:23:51.197 --> 00:23:52.165 align:middle line:90%
They are so annoying.

00:23:52.165 --> 00:23:53.399 align:middle line:90%
And they do things I don't like.

00:23:53.399 --> 00:23:55.101 align:middle line:90%
And how dare they?

00:23:55.101 --> 00:23:58.838 align:middle line:84%
And so by becoming curious
and intuitively reading

00:23:58.838 --> 00:24:02.508 align:middle line:84%
where people are coming
from, I can read and go, "Oh,

00:24:02.508 --> 00:24:04.677 align:middle line:84%
you're acting like that because
you're actually scared of me;

00:24:04.677 --> 00:24:08.848 align:middle line:84%
or I'm triggering you by my
behavior; or it's something

00:24:08.848 --> 00:24:11.684 align:middle line:84%
about me that reminds
you of someone you knew."

00:24:11.684 --> 00:24:15.221 align:middle line:84%
And rather than becoming an
actor in somebody else's story,

00:24:15.221 --> 00:24:18.124 align:middle line:84%
I can intuitively catch
myself and kind of go, "Okay.

00:24:18.124 --> 00:24:21.260 align:middle line:84%
You're being like this, which
is causing me to be like that.

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:23.629 align:middle line:84%
And if I can intuitively
stop being like that

00:24:23.629 --> 00:24:26.132 align:middle line:84%
because I know it's me
causing you being like that,

00:24:26.132 --> 00:24:27.567 align:middle line:90%
we can come together."

00:24:27.567 --> 00:24:30.069 align:middle line:84%
In actual fact, we could solve
all the problems in the world

00:24:30.069 --> 00:24:31.737 align:middle line:90%
by coming together in community.

00:24:31.737 --> 00:24:35.041 align:middle line:84%
And we don't because we
are secretly terrified

00:24:35.041 --> 00:24:36.609 align:middle line:90%
of other human beings.

00:24:36.609 --> 00:24:39.478 align:middle line:84%
And society allows you to
become even more terrified

00:24:39.478 --> 00:24:41.247 align:middle line:84%
by telling you how
awful they are.

00:24:41.247 --> 00:24:43.449 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that I find fascinating --

00:24:43.449 --> 00:24:45.985 align:middle line:84%
and I know that this is
very true in the UK --

00:24:45.985 --> 00:24:49.689 align:middle line:84%
that the crime rate over the
last 150 years has been going

00:24:49.689 --> 00:24:51.324 align:middle line:90%
down, and down, and down.

00:24:51.324 --> 00:24:54.727 align:middle line:84%
And the fear of crime has
been going up, and up, and up.

00:24:54.727 --> 00:24:55.928 align:middle line:90%
And what's unfortunate

00:24:55.928 --> 00:24:59.565 align:middle line:84%
about that is it makes
us lead very small lives.

00:24:59.565 --> 00:25:02.735 align:middle line:84%
And all of the things
that we hear on the news

00:25:02.735 --> 00:25:05.938 align:middle line:84%
that we just take
for granted is true.

00:25:05.938 --> 00:25:09.575 align:middle line:84%
If we used our intuition
we'd be like, "Yeah, no."

00:25:09.575 --> 00:25:11.344 align:middle line:84%
You know, I was listening
to the news the other day

00:25:11.344 --> 00:25:14.146 align:middle line:84%
and there was somebody
saying -- an expert --

00:25:14.146 --> 00:25:16.349 align:middle line:84%
who said that "The
probability of breast cancer

00:25:16.349 --> 00:25:18.618 align:middle line:84%
in women will have doubled
by the year blah-blah-blah."

00:25:18.618 --> 00:25:22.488 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, "Since when
was probability news?

00:25:22.488 --> 00:25:24.190 align:middle line:90%
You know, an expert has come

00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:27.193 align:middle line:84%
up with an assumption
based on something.

00:25:27.193 --> 00:25:28.861 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's brilliant."

00:25:28.861 --> 00:25:32.598 align:middle line:84%
And now, all of a sudden I'm in
the bathroom poking my left one,

00:25:32.598 --> 00:25:34.467 align:middle line:84%
trying to work out
whether or not --

00:25:34.467 --> 00:25:35.901 align:middle line:90%
and of course, what am I doing?

00:25:35.901 --> 00:25:37.503 align:middle line:90%
I'm manifesting.

00:25:37.503 --> 00:25:39.138 align:middle line:90%
Like, "Yeah, no."

00:25:39.138 --> 00:25:41.107 align:middle line:84%
So by becoming curious
I go, "Oh, yeah.

00:25:41.107 --> 00:25:42.608 align:middle line:84%
You were short of
a news story today.

00:25:42.608 --> 00:25:44.210 align:middle line:84%
Nothing was happening;
everyone was sun bathing

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:47.480 align:middle line:84%
in England wearing
very small Lycra pants.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:49.281 align:middle line:90%
And so nothing bad was happening

00:25:49.281 --> 00:25:50.583 align:middle line:84%
because everyone was
having a good time.

00:25:50.583 --> 00:25:53.052 align:middle line:84%
So you had to come up with
something to fill your hour,

00:25:53.052 --> 00:25:54.620 align:middle line:90%
so you came up with that.

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:55.988 align:middle line:90%
Oh, brilliant."

00:25:55.988 --> 00:26:00.726 align:middle line:84%
And of course, by understanding
with curiosity that whether

00:26:00.726 --> 00:26:02.762 align:middle line:84%
or not something is
true or not for you --

00:26:02.762 --> 00:26:05.731 align:middle line:84%
because it might not be true
for you that you're going

00:26:05.731 --> 00:26:07.633 align:middle line:84%
to get breast cancer, it
might not be true for you

00:26:07.633 --> 00:26:09.702 align:middle line:84%
that what you're eating is bad
for you, it might not be true

00:26:09.702 --> 00:26:11.804 align:middle line:84%
for you, you know,
all of these things --

00:26:11.804 --> 00:26:14.907 align:middle line:84%
knowing what is true for
you means that you can feel

00:26:14.907 --> 00:26:18.210 align:middle line:84%
so much less stress
and feel much happier.

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:20.713 align:middle line:84%
And again, when it
comes to relationships,

00:26:20.713 --> 00:26:22.381 align:middle line:84%
when you know what's
true for you,

00:26:22.381 --> 00:26:25.251 align:middle line:84%
when you know what you value
and where your values are,

00:26:25.251 --> 00:26:27.620 align:middle line:84%
and you use your values
as compass, then you know

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:31.190 align:middle line:84%
who to make friends with because
you know who resonates with you

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:33.025 align:middle line:84%
and you know who you
can connect with.

00:26:33.025 --> 00:26:36.595 align:middle line:84%
So really the book is kind
of like a peaceful revolution

00:26:36.595 --> 00:26:40.900 align:middle line:84%
from thinking to knowing but in
the world, not in your bedroom,

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:42.468 align:middle line:90%
not through meditation --

00:26:42.468 --> 00:26:45.638 align:middle line:84%
in the world because
curiosity is a meditation.

00:26:45.638 --> 00:26:47.373 align:middle line:90%
So you travel a lot.

00:26:47.373 --> 00:26:49.975 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. So it's like you know
when you go to a new place

00:26:49.975 --> 00:26:52.011 align:middle line:84%
and you're, like, looking at the
tops of buildings and you're,

00:26:52.011 --> 00:26:54.013 align:middle line:84%
like, looking at the cracks on
the pavement and you're going,

00:26:54.013 --> 00:26:55.981 align:middle line:84%
"This is really hot, and it's
England, and it's bizarre."

00:26:55.981 --> 00:26:57.683 align:middle line:84%
And then there, oh,
you're in another country

00:26:57.683 --> 00:26:59.852 align:middle line:84%
and it's freezing
cold or the smells

00:26:59.852 --> 00:27:00.986 align:middle line:90%
and things -- it's so different.

00:27:00.986 --> 00:27:01.721 align:middle line:90%
And you're curious.

00:27:01.721 --> 00:27:03.489 align:middle line:90%
And then if you notice

00:27:03.489 --> 00:27:05.458 align:middle line:84%
that people will help
you with your bag.

00:27:05.458 --> 00:27:07.326 align:middle line:84%
They will chat you up and
they'll flirt with you.

00:27:07.326 --> 00:27:09.495 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, "This
doesn't happen at home."

00:27:09.495 --> 00:27:11.564 align:middle line:84%
It's not that the
world has changed

00:27:11.564 --> 00:27:13.132 align:middle line:84%
and that you must go
traveling in order

00:27:13.132 --> 00:27:15.901 align:middle line:84%
to experience the beauty
of humanity; it's the fact

00:27:15.901 --> 00:27:18.237 align:middle line:84%
that you became beautiful
because you became curious.

00:27:18.237 --> 00:27:21.006 align:middle line:84%
And we're not curious
when we're at home.

00:27:21.006 --> 00:27:23.642 align:middle line:84%
And by being curious, all of
the things that we're kind

00:27:23.642 --> 00:27:25.811 align:middle line:90%
of looking for start to find us.

00:27:25.811 --> 00:27:29.815 align:middle line:84%
And it's just such a wonderful
thing to do in your hometown

00:27:29.815 --> 00:27:33.052 align:middle line:84%
because all of the love and
excitement that you experience

00:27:33.052 --> 00:27:35.454 align:middle line:84%
when you're out traveling
the world comes to you

00:27:35.454 --> 00:27:36.756 align:middle line:90%
because you're being curious.

00:27:36.756 --> 00:27:38.924 align:middle line:84%
You're becoming the
person who is the traveler,

00:27:38.924 --> 00:27:40.526 align:middle line:84%
but you're doing
it in your home.

00:27:40.526 --> 00:27:41.927 align:middle line:90%
It's lovely.

00:27:41.927 --> 00:27:45.431 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Protection, is there
anything as such as protection

00:27:45.431 --> 00:27:47.933 align:middle line:84%
that you feel you
need or call forth?

00:27:47.933 --> 00:27:50.236 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: This is one
of my pet [inaudible]

00:27:50.236 --> 00:27:53.839 align:middle line:84%
because it's the same thing
as when you're unhappy,

00:27:53.839 --> 00:27:55.841 align:middle line:90%
being unhappy about it.

00:27:55.841 --> 00:27:58.144 align:middle line:84%
So it's like when you believe
that you need protection,

00:27:58.144 --> 00:28:01.046 align:middle line:84%
then you are in the
consciousness of the energy

00:28:01.046 --> 00:28:04.784 align:middle line:84%
that you are in fear, and then
you're completely in alignment

00:28:04.784 --> 00:28:06.385 align:middle line:84%
with the idea that
you need protection.

00:28:06.385 --> 00:28:08.454 align:middle line:84%
Then therefore, you're open
to the thing that you need

00:28:08.454 --> 00:28:09.822 align:middle line:90%
to protect yourself against.

00:28:09.822 --> 00:28:11.090 align:middle line:90%
It's very interesting.

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:13.225 align:middle line:84%
There's a little
apple pip experiment

00:28:13.225 --> 00:28:16.128 align:middle line:84%
where you get some
pips from the inside

00:28:16.128 --> 00:28:17.997 align:middle line:84%
of an apple and let
them dry out.

00:28:17.997 --> 00:28:20.299 align:middle line:90%
Then you open a fresh apple --

00:28:20.299 --> 00:28:22.234 align:middle line:84%
it sounds like open
it like it's a jar.

00:28:22.234 --> 00:28:26.438 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, you slice open an apple
and you put the apple pips

00:28:26.438 --> 00:28:29.708 align:middle line:84%
on white paper about an
inch away from each other.

00:28:29.708 --> 00:28:31.777 align:middle line:84%
You'll start to see that the
healthy apple pips have kind of,

00:28:31.777 --> 00:28:34.814 align:middle line:84%
like, a white line around
them, like a circle.

00:28:34.814 --> 00:28:36.382 align:middle line:90%
And in sense you could say

00:28:36.382 --> 00:28:38.984 align:middle line:84%
that that's the energetic
aura of the apple pips.

00:28:38.984 --> 00:28:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And then, as you kind of,
like, rest your eyes and kind

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:43.155 align:middle line:84%
of just stare in
between the two of them,

00:28:43.155 --> 00:28:47.193 align:middle line:84%
you'll see a white line
going towards the drying

00:28:47.193 --> 00:28:49.995 align:middle line:84%
out apple pips from
the healthy apple pips.

00:28:49.995 --> 00:28:51.597 align:middle line:90%
So what this tells me --

00:28:51.597 --> 00:28:53.999 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Doing all those
interesting experiment,

00:28:53.999 --> 00:28:55.100 align:middle line:90%
aren't you?

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:56.368 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: I just have a
very scientific mind.

00:28:56.368 --> 00:28:58.404 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just never
willing to kind of, like,

00:28:58.404 --> 00:29:02.441 align:middle line:84%
take things at sort of
face value, which is why

00:29:02.441 --> 00:29:04.176 align:middle line:90%
in  You Do Know  it's all

00:29:04.176 --> 00:29:06.812 align:middle line:84%
about how this works,
not just it works.

00:29:06.812 --> 00:29:08.080 align:middle line:90%
It's how it works.

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:10.916 align:middle line:84%
I've copied it up with
neuroscience, and psychology,

00:29:10.916 --> 00:29:14.119 align:middle line:84%
and medical science, and pulled
all of these pieces together

00:29:14.119 --> 00:29:16.755 align:middle line:84%
to actually make a
very defined picture.

00:29:16.755 --> 00:29:20.125 align:middle line:84%
And so what the apple pip
experiment tells us is

00:29:20.125 --> 00:29:22.795 align:middle line:84%
that when we are, say for
example, visiting somebody

00:29:22.795 --> 00:29:25.464 align:middle line:84%
in hospital or we're with
a friend who's moaning --

00:29:25.464 --> 00:29:27.533 align:middle line:84%
welcome to England -- if we're
with a friend who's moaning

00:29:27.533 --> 00:29:30.636 align:middle line:90%
or things that are difficult,

00:29:30.636 --> 00:29:33.072 align:middle line:84%
we are actually giving
away our energy.

00:29:33.072 --> 00:29:34.640 align:middle line:84%
There's no such thing
as energy vampires.

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:35.975 align:middle line:90%
They're not sucking.

00:29:35.975 --> 00:29:38.410 align:middle line:84%
You know, we are actually
giving away our energy

00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:39.778 align:middle line:90%
with our own free will.

00:29:39.778 --> 00:29:41.046 align:middle line:84%
And then we walk
away and go, "My God,

00:29:41.046 --> 00:29:42.548 align:middle line:90%
that person's exhausting."

00:29:42.548 --> 00:29:45.951 align:middle line:84%
And in actual fact, it was us
that was allowing ourselves

00:29:45.951 --> 00:29:47.319 align:middle line:90%
to give away that energy.

00:29:47.319 --> 00:29:48.520 align:middle line:90%
So literally when we're talking

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:51.390 align:middle line:84%
about protection I
would say care less.

00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:53.359 align:middle line:90%
Stop caring.

00:29:53.359 --> 00:29:54.927 align:middle line:90%
If you stop caring about people,

00:29:54.927 --> 00:29:56.562 align:middle line:84%
then you'll stop
giving away your energy.

00:29:56.562 --> 00:29:58.831 align:middle line:84%
But good luck with that because
we're biologically designed

00:29:58.831 --> 00:29:59.965 align:middle line:90%
to care.

00:29:59.965 --> 00:30:02.101 align:middle line:84%
So the main thing is, is
how much are you caring?

00:30:02.101 --> 00:30:05.070 align:middle line:84%
How active is your solar plexus
frisking people for information

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:06.972 align:middle line:84%
to see if the world's
a scary place?

00:30:06.972 --> 00:30:10.075 align:middle line:84%
You know? So the more
we believe in ourselves,

00:30:10.075 --> 00:30:11.810 align:middle line:84%
the less our energy
can be drained.

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:14.713 align:middle line:84%
So the best form of protection
is believing in yourself

00:30:14.713 --> 00:30:16.649 align:middle line:84%
and not believing that you
need to turn around three times

00:30:16.649 --> 00:30:18.684 align:middle line:84%
and spit or cover
yourself in white light.

00:30:18.684 --> 00:30:21.520 align:middle line:84%
It's really just about knowing
in your heart, "I am okay,

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:23.489 align:middle line:84%
and the universe loves
me, and I am safe."

00:30:23.489 --> 00:30:25.457 align:middle line:84%
That's all you really
need to know.

00:30:25.457 --> 00:30:29.461 align:middle line:84%
And so putting on protection
actually says the opposite.

00:30:29.461 --> 00:30:29.962 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Brilliant.

00:30:29.962 --> 00:30:31.263 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:30:31.263 --> 00:30:34.166 align:middle line:84%
To close this conversation,
is there really a message

00:30:34.166 --> 00:30:36.969 align:middle line:84%
that is important
to you to share,

00:30:36.969 --> 00:30:39.271 align:middle line:90%
or to summarize, or to say?

00:30:39.271 --> 00:30:41.740 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: I think really --

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:46.812 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's a funny one
because I think it's --

00:30:46.812 --> 00:30:48.714 align:middle line:84%
I almost want to not say
anything because I want

00:30:48.714 --> 00:30:53.786 align:middle line:84%
to say believe in yourself, you
know, that you do know it's all

00:30:53.786 --> 00:30:56.322 align:middle line:84%
about knowing that
you are right,

00:30:56.322 --> 00:30:58.357 align:middle line:84%
and knowing that you have
everything that you need,

00:30:58.357 --> 00:30:59.725 align:middle line:84%
and knowing that you
don't really need to come

00:30:59.725 --> 00:31:02.828 align:middle line:84%
and see people like me
because -- but please do --

00:31:02.828 --> 00:31:06.932 align:middle line:84%
because all the answers are
already available to you.

00:31:06.932 --> 00:31:09.335 align:middle line:84%
So please stop worrying
about stuff, and stressing

00:31:09.335 --> 00:31:12.638 align:middle line:84%
about stuff, and put happiness
on the front of your agenda,

00:31:12.638 --> 00:31:16.508 align:middle line:84%
and put self-love at the
center of everything.

00:31:16.508 --> 00:31:18.844 align:middle line:90%
And really, by you doing that,

00:31:18.844 --> 00:31:20.646 align:middle line:84%
you'll make the world a
much, much, better place.

00:31:20.646 --> 00:31:21.246 align:middle line:90%
Believe me.

00:31:21.246 --> 00:31:22.514 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful.

00:31:22.514 --> 00:31:24.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Thank you for
bringing so much sunshine.

00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:25.284 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Thank you so much.

00:31:25.284 --> 00:31:26.952 align:middle line:90%
It's all me.

00:31:26.952 --> 00:31:28.887 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I created the
sunshine today.

00:31:28.887 --> 00:31:33.025 align:middle line:84%
Although everyone outside
is going, "It's too hot."

00:31:33.025 --> 00:31:33.792 align:middle line:90%
Oh well.

00:31:33.792 --> 00:31:34.793 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: It's wonderful.

00:31:34.793 --> 00:31:36.562 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Becky.

00:31:36.562 --> 00:31:37.963 align:middle line:84%
