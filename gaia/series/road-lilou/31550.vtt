>> Hello, my delicious
co-creators.

00:00:11.812 --> 00:00:13.614 align:middle line:90%
Lilou here for Gaiam TV.

00:00:13.614 --> 00:00:15.182 align:middle line:90%
Today, I'm in the Netherlands

00:00:15.182 --> 00:00:18.919 align:middle line:84%
in beautiful sunny Amsterdam
springtime here with Pim.

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:20.421 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:00:20.421 --> 00:00:21.922 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:00:21.922 --> 00:00:23.424 align:middle line:84%
>> Really good sitting
next to you.

00:00:23.424 --> 00:00:25.392 align:middle line:84%
I've heard so many beautiful
things about your story.

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:27.361 align:middle line:84%
I'm really excited
to share it with you.

00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:29.497 align:middle line:90%
Pim is a cardiologist-scientist

00:00:29.497 --> 00:00:32.199 align:middle line:84%
and he'd been really
looking very deep

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:34.235 align:middle line:90%
into the near-death experiences.

00:00:34.235 --> 00:00:37.571 align:middle line:84%
I'm really thrilled to talk
to you about this topic

00:00:37.571 --> 00:00:41.142 align:middle line:84%
and discover more because
it's still such a--

00:00:41.142 --> 00:00:44.512 align:middle line:84%
not a new phenomenon but
something that you're going

00:00:44.512 --> 00:00:46.947 align:middle line:84%
to tell us is more and
more explained by science.

00:00:46.947 --> 00:00:49.850 align:middle line:84%
You wrote many books
and journals,

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.352 align:middle line:90%
medical journals as well.

00:00:51.352 --> 00:00:52.853 align:middle line:84%
But this one was
your English one,

00:00:52.853 --> 00:00:55.489 align:middle line:90%
"Consciousness Beyond Life".

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.459 align:middle line:84%
So, wow, where do we
start in all this?

00:00:58.459 --> 00:01:02.229 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm really-- tell us
about when you first heard

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:04.331 align:middle line:90%
of near-death experience.

00:01:04.331 --> 00:01:06.433 align:middle line:90%
>> That's an interesting story.

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:13.307 align:middle line:84%
That was in '69 just starting
my training in cardiology,

00:01:13.307 --> 00:01:15.743 align:middle line:90%
and then I was working

00:01:15.743 --> 00:01:19.980 align:middle line:84%
in a hospital [inaudible]
Coronary Care Unit

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.882 align:middle line:90%
in Holland had started.

00:01:21.882 --> 00:01:28.923 align:middle line:84%
We always forget that 45 years
ago, in '67 before that time,

00:01:28.923 --> 00:01:31.559 align:middle line:84%
everybody died because of
cardiac arrest because a lot

00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:34.728 align:middle line:84%
of resuscitation techniques
like defibrillation

00:01:34.728 --> 00:01:37.331 align:middle line:84%
or external chest
massage were not possible.

00:01:37.331 --> 00:01:41.534 align:middle line:84%
So it was all new,
resuscitation, CPR.

00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:46.373 align:middle line:84%
So in '69, we had a
patient, 44 years old,

00:01:46.373 --> 00:01:49.443 align:middle line:84%
who had a cardiac arrest and
we started to resuscitate him

00:01:49.443 --> 00:01:54.281 align:middle line:84%
and we succeeded after several
defibrillations to get him back.

00:01:54.281 --> 00:01:58.152 align:middle line:84%
We-- resuscitated him and
we were very, very happy.

00:01:58.152 --> 00:02:01.689 align:middle line:84%
But the patient was
extremely disappointed.

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.359 align:middle line:84%
And he told me about gong
to eternal, seeing a light,

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:09.163 align:middle line:84%
seeing beautiful landscapes,
hearing beautiful music

00:02:09.163 --> 00:02:12.933 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't do anything with
it but I didn't forget it at all

00:02:12.933 --> 00:02:17.504 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't know that this kind
of experience had been mentioned

00:02:17.504 --> 00:02:20.874 align:middle line:84%
in old times, in all
cultures, and also religion.

00:02:20.874 --> 00:02:22.776 align:middle line:90%
So it was totally new for me.

00:02:22.776 --> 00:02:30.417 align:middle line:84%
But I was a young doctor and
specializing and only until '86,

00:02:30.417 --> 00:02:32.620 align:middle line:84%
I read the first book
about near-death experience

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.522 align:middle line:84%
by George Ritchie,
"Return From Tomorrow"

00:02:35.522 --> 00:02:37.725 align:middle line:84%
where he describes his
near-death experience

00:02:37.725 --> 00:02:41.495 align:middle line:84%
as a medical student
in '43 where he died

00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:44.231 align:middle line:84%
of double pneumonia and he
didn't get any antibiotics

00:02:44.231 --> 00:02:45.833 align:middle line:84%
because they were
not available yet.

00:02:45.833 --> 00:02:49.670 align:middle line:84%
So he died and he
was resuscitated.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.672 align:middle line:90%
Because of the nurse, he was--

00:02:51.672 --> 00:02:55.376 align:middle line:84%
his corpse was just
covered by a blanket.

00:02:55.376 --> 00:02:58.112 align:middle line:90%
And a nurse that was so--

00:02:58.112 --> 00:03:00.447 align:middle line:84%
didn't accepted this
young medical student died

00:03:00.447 --> 00:03:03.617 align:middle line:84%
so he persuaded the doctor
to give an injection right

00:03:03.617 --> 00:03:06.520 align:middle line:84%
into his heart, what was
quite uncommon in '43

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.857 align:middle line:84%
but he regained consciousness
after nine minutes,

00:03:09.857 --> 00:03:13.661 align:middle line:84%
then had an extremely
extensive near-death experience.

00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:15.763 align:middle line:90%
And as a medical doctor, he told

00:03:15.763 --> 00:03:18.332 align:middle line:84%
about this experience
at college.

00:03:18.332 --> 00:03:21.502 align:middle line:84%
And one of the medical
students was Raymond Moody.

00:03:21.502 --> 00:03:25.039 align:middle line:84%
So Raymond Moody was inspired by
this man as well and he started

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:27.441 align:middle line:84%
to do these studies about
near-death experience

00:03:27.441 --> 00:03:30.678 align:middle line:84%
and his book "Life After
Life" was published in '75

00:03:30.678 --> 00:03:33.447 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't read it,
I didn't know about it.

00:03:33.447 --> 00:03:36.949 align:middle line:84%
So when I read this book of--
by George Ritchie in '86,

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:39.386 align:middle line:84%
I just started to
interview my patients to ask

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:41.655 align:middle line:84%
if they could remember
something from the period

00:03:41.655 --> 00:03:43.791 align:middle line:84%
of cardiac arrest, from the
period of unconsciousness.

00:03:43.791 --> 00:03:46.327 align:middle line:84%
>> But what made that switch
because it's quite impressive

00:03:46.327 --> 00:03:49.496 align:middle line:84%
from the moment you were 0:03:48
before or at least, very,

00:03:49.496 --> 00:03:53.133 align:middle line:84%
in the scientific world, very
rigorous, very analytical

00:03:53.133 --> 00:03:55.636 align:middle line:84%
and there is something--
people, I guess,

00:03:55.636 --> 00:03:57.871 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people were starting
to report it more and more

00:03:57.871 --> 00:04:01.442 align:middle line:84%
but what-- like at some point,
there must have been something.

00:04:01.442 --> 00:04:04.978 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, for me it was
scientific curiosity

00:04:04.978 --> 00:04:06.780 align:middle line:84%
because it was totally
impossible

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.816 align:middle line:84%
that patients could
have memories

00:04:08.816 --> 00:04:10.351 align:middle line:84%
from the periods
of unconsciousness.

00:04:10.351 --> 00:04:13.120 align:middle line:84%
So, when I started to
ask patients in '86,

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.656 align:middle line:84%
within two years,
out of 50 patients

00:04:15.656 --> 00:04:17.690 align:middle line:84%
who had survived a
cardiac arrest in the past,

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.595 align:middle line:90%
12 patients told me about NDE.

00:04:21.595 --> 00:04:25.232 align:middle line:84%
And that was the moment that I
said, "Well, until that part,

00:04:25.232 --> 00:04:28.335 align:middle line:84%
there had only been
retrospective studies

00:04:28.335 --> 00:04:32.940 align:middle line:84%
and they all have-- were
very selective for what kind

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.875 align:middle line:90%
of patients they included.

00:04:34.875 --> 00:04:39.179 align:middle line:84%
And it was impossible to find
the medical circumstances

00:04:39.179 --> 00:04:42.082 align:middle line:84%
exactly back after
20 or 30 years.

00:04:42.082 --> 00:04:44.451 align:middle line:84%
So there were no,
until that time,

00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:48.422 align:middle line:84%
no really well-done
scientific studies

00:04:48.422 --> 00:04:52.559 align:middle line:84%
and there had been a series
that this kind of experiences,

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:55.562 align:middle line:84%
the near-death experience
were caused by lack of oxygen

00:04:55.562 --> 00:04:58.098 align:middle line:84%
in the brain or just
had a sedation--

00:04:58.098 --> 00:05:03.270 align:middle line:84%
side effect of drugs
or dreams or whatever.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.673 align:middle line:84%
But I couldn't believe
it, but the main thing was

00:05:06.673 --> 00:05:10.778 align:middle line:84%
that I was raised as an
old fashioned academic

00:05:10.778 --> 00:05:15.749 align:middle line:84%
and had learned that there's
always a materialistic

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:20.120 align:middle line:84%
explanation for things we
see and I always accepted

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.190 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness is just
a product of brain function.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.025 align:middle line:84%
But now when you
hear patients tell

00:05:25.025 --> 00:05:27.728 align:middle line:84%
about this enhanced
consciousness during cardiac

00:05:27.728 --> 00:05:31.965 align:middle line:84%
arrest, then the question
come, "How is it possible?"

00:05:31.965 --> 00:05:34.267 align:middle line:84%
because when consciousness
should be a product

00:05:34.267 --> 00:05:38.439 align:middle line:84%
of brain function, then they
shouldn't have any memory at all

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:40.908 align:middle line:84%
from those period
of cardiac arrest.

00:05:40.908 --> 00:05:43.477 align:middle line:90%
So then we started in '88

00:05:43.477 --> 00:05:46.447 align:middle line:84%
in ten Dutch hospitals a
prospective study in all--

00:05:46.447 --> 00:05:53.687 align:middle line:84%
in 344 consecutive patients who
survived cardiac arrest, and--

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:56.590 align:middle line:84%
which means that we asked
patients within several days

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.360 align:middle line:84%
after resuscitation if they
could remember something

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.862 align:middle line:90%
from the period

00:06:01.862 --> 00:06:03.497 align:middle line:84%
of unconsciousness
and they recalled.

00:06:03.497 --> 00:06:06.133 align:middle line:84%
And patients [inaudible] cardiac
arrest are called clinical

00:06:06.133 --> 00:06:09.436 align:middle line:84%
deaths which means
they are unconscious

00:06:09.436 --> 00:06:14.541 align:middle line:84%
because of no circulation,
no breathing, because of lack

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:16.043 align:middle line:90%
of oxygen in the brain.

00:06:16.043 --> 00:06:18.779 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that what we
called commonly a coma?

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:21.782 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a kind of coma
but coma is meant by--

00:06:21.782 --> 00:06:25.619 align:middle line:90%
mostly by a direct brain damage.

00:06:25.619 --> 00:06:30.057 align:middle line:84%
But I call it clinical death
because this is the first stage

00:06:30.057 --> 00:06:34.294 align:middle line:84%
of the process of dying and you
have to resuscitate within five

00:06:34.294 --> 00:06:37.030 align:middle line:84%
to 10 minutes, otherwise
people will die

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.032 align:middle line:84%
because of irreversible
damage to the brain.

00:06:39.032 --> 00:06:42.536 align:middle line:90%
So we have to be very fast.

00:06:42.536 --> 00:06:49.076 align:middle line:84%
At this time, the irreversible
period of unconsciousness.

00:06:49.076 --> 00:06:53.480 align:middle line:84%
But we know from other
studies that these patients--

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.383 align:middle line:84%
and we also note from
the clinical findings

00:06:56.383 --> 00:06:59.286 align:middle line:84%
within seconds patients
become unconscious

00:06:59.286 --> 00:07:01.355 align:middle line:90%
when the heart stops.

00:07:01.355 --> 00:07:04.691 align:middle line:84%
And-- but you mentioned
the blood flow

00:07:04.691 --> 00:07:06.827 align:middle line:84%
through the carotid
arteries, the blood flows

00:07:06.827 --> 00:07:08.395 align:middle line:84%
to zero [phonetic]
within one second.

00:07:08.395 --> 00:07:11.064 align:middle line:84%
There's no blood
going to the brain.

00:07:11.064 --> 00:07:14.735 align:middle line:84%
And there are no body reflexes
anymore which is a function

00:07:14.735 --> 00:07:17.004 align:middle line:90%
of the cortex of the brain.

00:07:17.004 --> 00:07:20.908 align:middle line:84%
There are no brain-- brainstem
reflexes anymore, the gag reflex

00:07:20.908 --> 00:07:23.911 align:middle line:84%
or corneal reflex of
why don't pupils do--

00:07:23.911 --> 00:07:26.380 align:middle line:90%
don't react to light anymore.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:27.881 align:middle line:90%
So the brain affects that.

00:07:27.881 --> 00:07:29.383 align:middle line:90%
The breathing has [inaudible].

00:07:29.383 --> 00:07:31.451 align:middle line:84%
The breathing center is
closest to the brainstem.

00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:34.788 align:middle line:84%
So we know those patients
have no brain function

00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:36.323 align:middle line:90%
at all within seconds.

00:07:36.323 --> 00:07:39.459 align:middle line:84%
And when-- there had been
studies done in animals and also

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:43.730 align:middle line:84%
in humans with the
registration of electroactivity

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:46.867 align:middle line:90%
of the cortex, the EEG.

00:07:46.867 --> 00:07:51.071 align:middle line:84%
And EEG is flat line
in 15 seconds.

00:07:51.071 --> 00:07:54.541 align:middle line:84%
So we know the clinical findings
and the measurements we can do

00:07:54.541 --> 00:07:57.344 align:middle line:84%
for the electroactivity
of the brain,

00:07:57.344 --> 00:07:58.845 align:middle line:90%
there's no activity at all.

00:07:58.845 --> 00:08:01.081 align:middle line:84%
There's no brain
function at all.

00:08:01.081 --> 00:08:05.385 align:middle line:84%
And in this period, people can
have enhanced consciousness

00:08:05.385 --> 00:08:10.090 align:middle line:84%
with self-identity, with
cognition, with memories

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:14.194 align:middle line:84%
from early childhood, with
meeting of deceased relatives,

00:08:14.194 --> 00:08:16.430 align:middle line:84%
with the possibility of
perception, from a position out

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:21.702 align:middle line:84%
or above the body, with
conscious return into the body

00:08:21.702 --> 00:08:25.272 align:middle line:90%
as well which is awful for them.

00:08:25.272 --> 00:08:27.541 align:middle line:90%
And, so what we tried to find

00:08:27.541 --> 00:08:31.011 align:middle line:84%
out if there could be an
explanation why people can have

00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:34.247 align:middle line:84%
this enhanced consciousness
because according

00:08:34.247 --> 00:08:36.717 align:middle line:84%
to our current medical
consult, it's not possible

00:08:36.717 --> 00:08:40.454 align:middle line:84%
because when the-- consciousness
is a product of brain function

00:08:40.454 --> 00:08:42.888 align:middle line:84%
and the brain functions
[inaudible] there shouldn't be

00:08:42.888 --> 00:08:44.391 align:middle line:90%
no consciousness at all.

00:08:44.391 --> 00:08:47.427 align:middle line:84%
So what we found in
this prospective study

00:08:47.427 --> 00:08:49.062 align:middle line:84%
which is still the
largest study ever--

00:08:49.062 --> 00:08:51.164 align:middle line:84%
prospective study even
done and the only study

00:08:51.164 --> 00:08:57.671 align:middle line:84%
with statistical analysis,
what we found that 18 percent

00:08:57.671 --> 00:09:02.209 align:middle line:84%
of the patients, 62 patients had
a clear memory of the periods

00:09:02.209 --> 00:09:04.678 align:middle line:84%
of unconsciousness having
near-death experience.

00:09:04.678 --> 00:09:08.682 align:middle line:84%
And 82 percent did not
have any memory at all.

00:09:08.682 --> 00:09:12.719 align:middle line:84%
And then when we compared
these two groups of patients,

00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:14.788 align:middle line:90%
there was no difference at all.

00:09:14.788 --> 00:09:17.457 align:middle line:84%
So the duration of cardiac
arrest if it was two minutes

00:09:17.457 --> 00:09:18.992 align:middle line:84%
or eight minutes
didn't matter at all.

00:09:18.992 --> 00:09:23.530 align:middle line:84%
Also the severity of anoxia
of the brain, lack of oxygen

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:25.032 align:middle line:84%
in the brain didn't
matter at all.

00:09:25.032 --> 00:09:28.502 align:middle line:84%
If they had been unconscious for
five minutes or for three weeks

00:09:28.502 --> 00:09:30.704 align:middle line:90%
in coma didn't matter at all.

00:09:30.704 --> 00:09:32.806 align:middle line:84%
If you have an induced
cardiac arrest

00:09:32.806 --> 00:09:35.175 align:middle line:84%
and electrophysiologic
stimulation studies

00:09:35.175 --> 00:09:38.645 align:middle line:84%
in the [inaudible],
they're always resuscitated

00:09:38.645 --> 00:09:42.049 align:middle line:84%
within 30 seconds,
didn't matter at all.

00:09:42.049 --> 00:09:44.918 align:middle line:90%
If they have pre-knowledge

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:48.455 align:middle line:84%
that you know these experiences
are possible didn't matter

00:09:48.455 --> 00:09:49.956 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:09:49.956 --> 00:09:51.625 align:middle line:84%
The different medication--
you give a lot of medication

00:09:51.625 --> 00:09:54.928 align:middle line:84%
but people are in coma
or have a complicated CPR

00:09:54.928 --> 00:09:57.164 align:middle line:90%
where they need intubation,

00:09:57.164 --> 00:10:00.434 align:middle line:84%
artificial respiration,
didn't matter at all.

00:10:00.434 --> 00:10:05.872 align:middle line:84%
Gender, religion, education,
didn't matter at all.

00:10:05.872 --> 00:10:11.111 align:middle line:84%
So what we found is that there
is no scientific explanation why

00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:13.680 align:middle line:84%
patients have this
kind of experience.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:17.617 align:middle line:84%
We could exclude psychological
explanation like fear

00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:20.320 align:middle line:84%
of death before the
arrest most of the case,

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.190 align:middle line:84%
pharmacological explanation,
there's the side effects

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:27.461 align:middle line:84%
of drugs, and we could exclude
physiological explanation,

00:10:27.461 --> 00:10:29.996 align:middle line:84%
lack of oxygen to the brain
but because all patients

00:10:29.996 --> 00:10:31.698 align:middle line:84%
of our study had
been unconscious

00:10:31.698 --> 00:10:33.400 align:middle line:90%
because of lack of oxygen.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:37.504 align:middle line:84%
Now, the 80 percent of those
patients reported an NDE.

00:10:37.504 --> 00:10:40.707 align:middle line:84%
So that was the first part of
the study, the prospective part

00:10:40.707 --> 00:10:44.244 align:middle line:84%
but we could exclude
all until that now--

00:10:44.244 --> 00:10:49.716 align:middle line:84%
that point, assumptions that
is experienced would be caused

00:10:49.716 --> 00:10:52.719 align:middle line:84%
by anoxia or by hallucinations
or whatever.

00:10:52.719 --> 00:10:54.421 align:middle line:90%
We could exclude it.

00:10:54.421 --> 00:10:55.989 align:middle line:84%
And the second part
of the study,

00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:58.191 align:middle line:84%
what we did was a
longitudinal study

00:10:58.191 --> 00:11:00.827 align:middle line:84%
where we interviewed all
survivors of cardiac arrest

00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:05.532 align:middle line:84%
to visit NDE after two
years and after eight years,

00:11:05.532 --> 00:11:07.334 align:middle line:84%
with a matched control
group of patients,

00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:11.238 align:middle line:84%
we had also survived cardiac
arrest with no memories at all.

00:11:11.238 --> 00:11:12.739 align:middle line:90%
And we did this study,

00:11:12.739 --> 00:11:15.442 align:middle line:84%
it was also the first
longitudinal study

00:11:15.442 --> 00:11:17.210 align:middle line:90%
with prospective design to see

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:21.181 align:middle line:84%
if the transformation you always
hear from patients with an NDE,

00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:25.185 align:middle line:84%
if it was due to the cardiac
arrest itself, but it could be--

00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:28.021 align:middle line:84%
you can't perhaps change
because you survived a cardiac

00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:29.523 align:middle line:90%
arrest or--

00:11:29.523 --> 00:11:31.024 align:middle line:90%
>> 'Cause you're alive, yeah.

00:11:31.024 --> 00:11:32.526 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, your alive, you're back
again, you had been dead and--

00:11:32.526 --> 00:11:34.694 align:middle line:84%
>> [Inaudible] you can be very
really grateful for that and all

00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:37.264 align:middle line:84%
of the sudden your view
of reality changes.

00:11:37.264 --> 00:11:39.766 align:middle line:84%
>> So you could be-- the
change could be the result

00:11:39.766 --> 00:11:43.403 align:middle line:84%
of your cardiac arrest or could
it be the result of the NDE.

00:11:43.403 --> 00:11:45.472 align:middle line:84%
Still for science it's
a problem when you talk

00:11:45.472 --> 00:11:47.908 align:middle line:84%
about subjective
experiences, how can you prove

00:11:47.908 --> 00:11:51.812 align:middle line:84%
that patient's view really
had this kind of experiences.

00:11:51.812 --> 00:11:54.681 align:middle line:84%
So when you do the
longitudinal study,

00:11:54.681 --> 00:11:57.317 align:middle line:90%
it's kind of objective part

00:11:57.317 --> 00:12:00.420 align:middle line:84%
because of transformation
you can objectify.

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.656 align:middle line:84%
And what we found
was only the patients

00:12:02.656 --> 00:12:05.058 align:middle line:84%
with NDE had this
classical transformation.

00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:07.060 align:middle line:90%
They lost the fear of death.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:10.397 align:middle line:84%
They had a belief in
personal survival after death.

00:12:10.397 --> 00:12:15.435 align:middle line:84%
They have a new life inside,
what is important in life

00:12:15.435 --> 00:12:21.107 align:middle line:84%
which is love, compassion,
first to yourself

00:12:21.107 --> 00:12:23.243 align:middle line:84%
to accept yourself is the
old all negative aspect,

00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:25.111 align:middle line:90%
this how to love.

00:12:25.111 --> 00:12:31.184 align:middle line:84%
And then unconditional love
and apathy towards other,

00:12:31.184 --> 00:12:35.255 align:middle line:84%
towards nature and towards
our endangered planet.

00:12:35.255 --> 00:12:39.092 align:middle line:84%
So they connected with everybody
else and that's the reason

00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:41.728 align:middle line:84%
that sometimes people
with NDE say,

00:12:41.728 --> 00:12:44.464 align:middle line:90%
"I had an experience of unity."

00:12:44.464 --> 00:12:45.966 align:middle line:90%
And this feeling

00:12:45.966 --> 00:12:48.468 align:middle line:84%
of interconnectedness is
always there after NDE

00:12:48.468 --> 00:12:52.272 align:middle line:84%
which I call an enhanced
intuitive sensitivity.

00:12:52.272 --> 00:12:54.007 align:middle line:84%
They are connected
with other people.

00:12:54.007 --> 00:12:56.443 align:middle line:84%
They are connected
with the planet.

00:12:56.443 --> 00:12:59.646 align:middle line:84%
And this last aspect,
they hardly ever talk

00:12:59.646 --> 00:13:02.816 align:middle line:84%
about it spontaneously, you
have to talk or to ask about it.

00:13:02.816 --> 00:13:06.586 align:middle line:84%
Because they are so overwhelmed
by it and so frightened by it

00:13:06.586 --> 00:13:10.557 align:middle line:84%
because you just feel
what other people think

00:13:10.557 --> 00:13:13.994 align:middle line:84%
or what other people feel or
you know he have a premonition

00:13:13.994 --> 00:13:15.795 align:middle line:90%
that someone will die.

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:18.465 align:middle line:90%
And after few weeks, people--

00:13:18.465 --> 00:13:22.802 align:middle line:84%
this man really dies and
it's impossible to know.

00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:25.538 align:middle line:84%
So they have this enhanced
intuitive sensitivity,

00:13:25.538 --> 00:13:28.842 align:middle line:84%
it's because they are
connected with aspect

00:13:28.842 --> 00:13:30.343 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness of others.

00:13:30.343 --> 00:13:33.313 align:middle line:84%
>> So how do you define
now this consciousness then

00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:35.548 align:middle line:84%
if it's not created
by the brain,

00:13:35.548 --> 00:13:38.318 align:middle line:84%
if it's separated,
if it's non-local.

00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:39.819 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:43.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah. At first, I don't
have a real good definition

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:47.694 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness because in so
many aspects of consciousness

00:13:47.694 --> 00:13:52.898 align:middle line:84%
but the main finding for--
and conclusion for us all is

00:13:52.898 --> 00:13:56.269 align:middle line:84%
that we have to discuss again
the never proven assumption

00:13:56.269 --> 00:13:59.205 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness is
product of brain function,

00:13:59.205 --> 00:14:01.741 align:middle line:84%
because when the brain
doesn't function at all,

00:14:01.741 --> 00:14:04.210 align:middle line:84%
people have this
enhanced consciousness.

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:08.181 align:middle line:84%
And in this, it has
consciousness, they have access

00:14:08.181 --> 00:14:14.187 align:middle line:84%
to the past where they are
connected also with thoughts

00:14:14.187 --> 00:14:16.189 align:middle line:84%
of other people in
the past as well.

00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:21.761 align:middle line:84%
They feel [inaudible] they
relive their whole life mostly

00:14:21.761 --> 00:14:25.432 align:middle line:84%
where they are with
a being of light--

00:14:25.432 --> 00:14:28.335 align:middle line:84%
of with the light which
is unconditional love

00:14:28.335 --> 00:14:33.106 align:middle line:84%
and also access to
knowledge, to wisdom,

00:14:33.106 --> 00:14:36.576 align:middle line:84%
do get all the answers
before you ask the questions.

00:14:36.576 --> 00:14:41.548 align:middle line:84%
It's-- they also can
have a flash forward

00:14:41.548 --> 00:14:43.383 align:middle line:90%
to see future events.

00:14:43.383 --> 00:14:47.454 align:middle line:84%
So they are in a realm,
in a dimension where time

00:14:47.454 --> 00:14:50.290 align:middle line:84%
and space doesn't
play a role anymore.

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:53.093 align:middle line:84%
Everything is at the
same moment there.

00:14:53.093 --> 00:14:56.663 align:middle line:84%
So they have a cardiac
arrest of two minutes.

00:14:56.663 --> 00:14:59.232 align:middle line:84%
You can talk for hours to
days about what happened

00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:02.836 align:middle line:84%
because everything
happened at the same time.

00:15:02.836 --> 00:15:05.438 align:middle line:84%
This is what you call
interconnectedness

00:15:05.438 --> 00:15:08.375 align:middle line:84%
and you can call it non-locality
because there is no time,

00:15:08.375 --> 00:15:12.379 align:middle line:84%
no space, everything
happens at the same moment.

00:15:12.379 --> 00:15:16.282 align:middle line:90%
And so for me, the conclusion is

00:15:16.282 --> 00:15:20.120 align:middle line:84%
that the brain doesn't
produce consciousness

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.323 align:middle line:84%
but the brain has a
facilitating function.

00:15:23.323 --> 00:15:26.426 align:middle line:84%
It makes it possible to
experience consciousness.

00:15:26.426 --> 00:15:28.395 align:middle line:84%
>> I like your analogy
with the internet,

00:15:28.395 --> 00:15:29.963 align:middle line:90%
on the terminal in the internet?

00:15:29.963 --> 00:15:31.464 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:15:31.464 --> 00:15:32.966 align:middle line:90%
So it's an interface.

00:15:32.966 --> 00:15:37.037 align:middle line:84%
So, when you have one billion
websites of the internet,

00:15:37.037 --> 00:15:39.205 align:middle line:84%
they're not produced
by your computer.

00:15:39.205 --> 00:15:42.375 align:middle line:84%
And when you are in
Australia or China or Europe

00:15:42.375 --> 00:15:47.881 align:middle line:84%
or United States, you can have
these one billion websites

00:15:47.881 --> 00:15:49.916 align:middle line:90%
always there.

00:15:49.916 --> 00:15:51.551 align:middle line:84%
But they're not produced
by your instrument

00:15:51.551 --> 00:15:53.720 align:middle line:84%
that you can even
change your website

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.221 align:middle line:90%
if you have access to it.

00:15:55.221 --> 00:15:57.190 align:middle line:90%
So it's a transceiver,

00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:01.261 align:middle line:84%
sender and transceiver
or interface website.

00:16:01.261 --> 00:16:03.530 align:middle line:84%
You can also compare
it with, let's say,

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:05.532 align:middle line:90%
your mobile telephone.

00:16:05.532 --> 00:16:08.535 align:middle line:84%
At this moment, there are 500
[inaudible] mobile telephone

00:16:08.535 --> 00:16:10.303 align:middle line:84%
calls, [inaudible]
they're always there

00:16:10.303 --> 00:16:13.773 align:middle line:84%
but you need an instrument
to receive it.

00:16:13.773 --> 00:16:17.143 align:middle line:84%
And so also like the television
set or the television camera.

00:16:17.143 --> 00:16:20.246 align:middle line:84%
You always-- a lot
of information

00:16:20.246 --> 00:16:23.850 align:middle line:84%
and call it an electromagnetic
waves but you need an instrument

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:26.686 align:middle line:84%
to receive it or an
instrument to send it to camera

00:16:26.686 --> 00:16:30.356 align:middle line:84%
or to receive it set-- and
when you put off your TV set,

00:16:30.356 --> 00:16:32.559 align:middle line:90%
the program is still there.

00:16:32.559 --> 00:16:37.464 align:middle line:84%
So, it's this consciousness
that's always there [inaudible]

00:16:37.464 --> 00:16:40.733 align:middle line:84%
sometime people where
is consciousness

00:16:40.733 --> 00:16:43.136 align:middle line:90%
when you are asleep.

00:16:43.136 --> 00:16:48.041 align:middle line:84%
It's still there but you
don't receive it in your body.

00:16:48.041 --> 00:16:52.745 align:middle line:84%
So, you need the instruments,
the brain and the body

00:16:52.745 --> 00:16:55.548 align:middle line:84%
to receive this what I
call waking consciousness

00:16:55.548 --> 00:16:59.886 align:middle line:84%
which is just an aspect of
this enhanced consciousness.

00:16:59.886 --> 00:17:02.155 align:middle line:84%
And there are different
levels of consciousness

00:17:02.155 --> 00:17:05.457 align:middle line:84%
but in the high level,
everything is connected,

00:17:05.457 --> 00:17:08.695 align:middle line:84%
everything is love,
everything is wisdom,

00:17:08.695 --> 00:17:11.831 align:middle line:84%
everything is acceptance,
everything is unity

00:17:11.831 --> 00:17:15.235 align:middle line:84%
and this kind of feeling they
keep when they come back.

00:17:15.235 --> 00:17:18.804 align:middle line:84%
So this enhanced intuitive
sensitivity is caused

00:17:18.804 --> 00:17:24.577 align:middle line:84%
by the threshold of
consciousness has been changed.

00:17:24.577 --> 00:17:27.179 align:middle line:84%
That means they don't
receive just channel one,

00:17:27.179 --> 00:17:29.883 align:middle line:84%
your own consciousness, but
they receive channel two, three,

00:17:29.883 --> 00:17:32.218 align:middle line:84%
four and five, the
consciousness of others.

00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:37.090 align:middle line:84%
So you receive from others
and you receive from nature.

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:39.492 align:middle line:84%
So you feel connected
with animals, with plants,

00:17:39.492 --> 00:17:41.561 align:middle line:90%
with flowers, with other people.

00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:43.062 align:middle line:90%
And this kind

00:17:43.062 --> 00:17:44.564 align:middle line:84%
of interconnectedness
is still there

00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:47.600 align:middle line:84%
and that's what I call
enhanced intuitive sensitivity.

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:51.871 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you looked into how
to access this consciousness

00:17:51.871 --> 00:17:56.743 align:middle line:84%
for all of us daily into how
we can all do that beyond the--

00:17:56.743 --> 00:17:59.145 align:middle line:84%
because some people want to live
a near-death experience and want

00:17:59.145 --> 00:18:01.247 align:middle line:84%
to be able to live
that but there is ways.

00:18:01.247 --> 00:18:02.982 align:middle line:90%
How can we connect to this?

00:18:02.982 --> 00:18:06.252 align:middle line:84%
How can we live from that
angle, or is that really

00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:07.887 align:middle line:90%
like a radical paradigm shift

00:18:07.887 --> 00:18:11.524 align:middle line:84%
that is needed before we can
even start to experience it?

00:18:11.524 --> 00:18:14.661 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I think a
lot of circumstances

00:18:14.661 --> 00:18:16.829 align:middle line:84%
that you can experience
this enhanced consciousness.

00:18:16.829 --> 00:18:20.900 align:middle line:84%
That can be medical
problems like cardiac arrest.

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:22.468 align:middle line:84%
You can have a fear-death
experience

00:18:22.468 --> 00:18:24.103 align:middle line:84%
where you have an
imminent traffic accident

00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:25.972 align:middle line:90%
or a mountaineering accident,

00:18:25.972 --> 00:18:28.074 align:middle line:84%
(inaudible) death 'cause
you think you're dying

00:18:28.074 --> 00:18:30.176 align:middle line:84%
and you can have this
kind of experiences.

00:18:30.176 --> 00:18:32.946 align:middle line:84%
You also can have it
in complicated birth

00:18:32.946 --> 00:18:35.682 align:middle line:90%
to young women, loss of blood.

00:18:35.682 --> 00:18:38.318 align:middle line:84%
You can have it in coma
through traffic accidents

00:18:38.318 --> 00:18:43.289 align:middle line:90%
or cerebral infarction.

00:18:43.289 --> 00:18:47.327 align:middle line:84%
You can have it by
really severe disease

00:18:47.327 --> 00:18:49.629 align:middle line:84%
but you can also have
it in meditation.

00:18:49.629 --> 00:18:52.031 align:middle line:90%
You can have it in isolation.

00:18:52.031 --> 00:18:55.635 align:middle line:90%
Shipwreck or lost in the desert.

00:18:55.635 --> 00:19:01.641 align:middle line:84%
Astronauts [inaudible] and other
astronauts had this kind of--

00:19:01.641 --> 00:19:04.677 align:middle line:84%
Lindenberg was flying
over the ocean in his own.

00:19:04.677 --> 00:19:06.679 align:middle line:90%
So isolation also can--

00:19:06.679 --> 00:19:12.285 align:middle line:84%
depression or existential
crisis give the same kinds

00:19:12.285 --> 00:19:13.786 align:middle line:90%
of experiences.

00:19:13.786 --> 00:19:15.421 align:middle line:90%
So meditation also.

00:19:15.421 --> 00:19:19.892 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think you can
induce this kind of experiences.

00:19:19.892 --> 00:19:23.997 align:middle line:84%
They only think-- some people
have this kind of experience

00:19:23.997 --> 00:19:29.335 align:middle line:84%
by LSD but most people have
horrifying hallucinations by it.

00:19:29.335 --> 00:19:33.373 align:middle line:84%
So but sometimes it can happen,
and sometimes people can have it

00:19:33.373 --> 00:19:37.510 align:middle line:84%
after DMT, Dimethyltryptamine
or Ayahuasca

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:39.979 align:middle line:84%
which people can
have this kind--

00:19:39.979 --> 00:19:42.682 align:middle line:84%
same kind experiences
with transformation

00:19:42.682 --> 00:19:46.586 align:middle line:84%
but it's not able-- they were
not able to induce this kind

00:19:46.586 --> 00:19:48.087 align:middle line:90%
of experiences at all.

00:19:48.087 --> 00:19:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And they're still in
the medical literature.

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:53.726 align:middle line:84%
People say we can just induce
it, we just can explain it

00:19:53.726 --> 00:19:55.928 align:middle line:90%
but it's not possible.

00:19:55.928 --> 00:19:58.765 align:middle line:84%
And even-- what is
very interesting aspect

00:19:58.765 --> 00:20:01.901 align:middle line:84%
of the near-death experience
is the out-of-body experience.

00:20:01.901 --> 00:20:03.836 align:middle line:84%
And this is important
also scientifically

00:20:03.836 --> 00:20:08.308 align:middle line:84%
because we can prove that if
people really perceive something

00:20:08.308 --> 00:20:09.909 align:middle line:84%
from a position out
and above their body,

00:20:09.909 --> 00:20:13.112 align:middle line:84%
and we can collaborate
the moment it happens.

00:20:13.112 --> 00:20:15.315 align:middle line:90%
>> That can be induced?

00:20:15.315 --> 00:20:16.916 align:middle line:90%
>> It cannot be induced.

00:20:16.916 --> 00:20:18.418 align:middle line:90%
>> The OBEs?

00:20:18.418 --> 00:20:19.919 align:middle line:90%
>> It can never be induced.

00:20:19.919 --> 00:20:24.957 align:middle line:84%
>> So I had this whole interview
with people that wrote on OBEs,

00:20:24.957 --> 00:20:27.560 align:middle line:84%
out-of-body experiences and
they were able to put themselves

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.762 align:middle line:84%
in that state and
then live that.

00:20:29.762 --> 00:20:32.131 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes. But let's say
in a medical literature

00:20:32.131 --> 00:20:34.867 align:middle line:84%
like Olaf Blanke from
Switzerland or De Ridder

00:20:34.867 --> 00:20:36.803 align:middle line:90%
from Belgium wrote articles

00:20:36.803 --> 00:20:39.072 align:middle line:84%
where they said we could
induce out-of-body experience

00:20:39.072 --> 00:20:40.573 align:middle line:90%
but they could not.

00:20:40.573 --> 00:20:43.443 align:middle line:84%
They could induce
bodily illusions

00:20:43.443 --> 00:20:47.413 align:middle line:84%
that people had a feeling
to be out of the body.

00:20:47.413 --> 00:20:50.183 align:middle line:84%
But they never induced and
read out-of-body experience

00:20:50.183 --> 00:20:53.686 align:middle line:84%
because veridical perception
from a position out and above,

00:20:53.686 --> 00:20:55.722 align:middle line:90%
it has never been induced.

00:20:55.722 --> 00:20:58.725 align:middle line:84%
But people can have spontaneous
out-of-body experiences.

00:20:58.725 --> 00:21:02.895 align:middle line:84%
About 50 percent of young
adults have this spontaneous

00:21:02.895 --> 00:21:07.600 align:middle line:84%
out-of-body experience at the
moment between awake and asleep.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.469 align:middle line:90%
But this is kind of normal.

00:21:09.469 --> 00:21:11.571 align:middle line:90%
It's not induced by it.

00:21:11.571 --> 00:21:15.475 align:middle line:84%
So you can have real out-of-body
experiences without any--

00:21:15.475 --> 00:21:17.844 align:middle line:90%
when it is not induced.

00:21:17.844 --> 00:21:20.113 align:middle line:84%
But-- or even medical
stimulation

00:21:20.113 --> 00:21:24.350 align:middle line:84%
or inhibition some centers
of the brain just give rise

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:28.921 align:middle line:84%
to bodily illusions but not
for out-of-body experiences.

00:21:28.921 --> 00:21:30.656 align:middle line:84%
And then it's appropriate
because they write it

00:21:30.656 --> 00:21:33.926 align:middle line:84%
in medical literatures so
the people believe this kind

00:21:33.926 --> 00:21:37.897 align:middle line:84%
of titles, but it's
a wrong definition.

00:21:37.897 --> 00:21:40.767 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is extraordinary
for us to know that--

00:21:40.767 --> 00:21:44.337 align:middle line:84%
so consciousness is here,
you would say all the time,

00:21:44.337 --> 00:21:48.274 align:middle line:84%
all around us were part of
it, it's with us so we could--

00:21:48.274 --> 00:21:50.676 align:middle line:84%
we could really-- we
could-- it's kind of--

00:21:50.676 --> 00:21:55.415 align:middle line:84%
it feels like when we start to
relax where we start to be aware

00:21:55.415 --> 00:21:57.583 align:middle line:90%
that there is, it is here.

00:21:57.583 --> 00:22:01.687 align:middle line:84%
>> By relaxation is a
good method to mindfulness

00:22:01.687 --> 00:22:05.058 align:middle line:84%
or meditation helps
you to change your mind

00:22:05.058 --> 00:22:07.060 align:middle line:90%
and to open your consciousness.

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:09.896 align:middle line:84%
But not everybody
is able to do it.

00:22:09.896 --> 00:22:11.998 align:middle line:84%
>> Or want to do it
or is opened to it.

00:22:11.998 --> 00:22:14.200 align:middle line:84%
Because your intellect
seems to be the brain,

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.402 align:middle line:84%
seems to be actually
quite a big barrier

00:22:16.402 --> 00:22:17.937 align:middle line:90%
to this-- this experience.

00:22:17.937 --> 00:22:19.439 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm sure it is.

00:22:19.439 --> 00:22:20.940 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sure it is.

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:23.109 align:middle line:84%
So there were two questions
before we started our study.

00:22:23.109 --> 00:22:28.414 align:middle line:84%
One, is there a biological
basis for consciousness at all?

00:22:28.414 --> 00:22:31.284 align:middle line:84%
We say no, there's no biological
basis for consciousness only

00:22:31.284 --> 00:22:34.187 align:middle line:84%
for our waking consciousness
because our brain

00:22:34.187 --> 00:22:37.156 align:middle line:84%
and body is an interface,
it's not (inaudible).

00:22:37.156 --> 00:22:39.625 align:middle line:84%
And the second is
is there a beginning

00:22:39.625 --> 00:22:41.661 align:middle line:84%
or will there ever be
an end to consciousness?

00:22:41.661 --> 00:22:43.162 align:middle line:90%
And I think no.

00:22:43.162 --> 00:22:45.898 align:middle line:84%
There's no beginning, no
end to-- it's infinite.

00:22:45.898 --> 00:22:49.135 align:middle line:84%
It's endless because
there's no beginning, no end.

00:22:49.135 --> 00:22:52.138 align:middle line:84%
Everything past or
future is available.

00:22:52.138 --> 00:22:53.673 align:middle line:90%
Everything is there.

00:22:53.673 --> 00:22:57.176 align:middle line:84%
So non-local consciousness
is always ever inside

00:22:57.176 --> 00:23:01.514 align:middle line:84%
and outside us and we just
perceive a small part of it.

00:23:01.514 --> 00:23:05.618 align:middle line:84%
And where you have this
enhanced intuition after NDE

00:23:05.618 --> 00:23:08.588 align:middle line:84%
or during it, then you have
access to far more aspects

00:23:08.588 --> 00:23:11.390 align:middle line:90%
of this non-local consciousness,

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:13.593 align:middle line:84%
what I call enhanced
intuitive sensitivity

00:23:13.593 --> 00:23:15.461 align:middle line:84%
where you can have
non-local perception,

00:23:15.461 --> 00:23:17.463 align:middle line:90%
what was called remote viewing.

00:23:17.463 --> 00:23:21.067 align:middle line:84%
You can have non-local
healing or distance.

00:23:21.067 --> 00:23:24.237 align:middle line:84%
So you can have this
non-local perturbation

00:23:24.237 --> 00:23:27.240 align:middle line:84%
which means matters change
because of consciousness

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:30.042 align:middle line:84%
and that's an interesting
aspect.

00:23:30.042 --> 00:23:34.514 align:middle line:84%
Neuroplasticity, which is that
the brain changes the structure

00:23:34.514 --> 00:23:38.985 align:middle line:84%
and the function because
it changes consciousness.

00:23:38.985 --> 00:23:42.555 align:middle line:84%
And it is well-known or
well-studied that you can change

00:23:42.555 --> 00:23:46.158 align:middle line:84%
in structure and the
function of the brain

00:23:46.158 --> 00:23:49.562 align:middle line:90%
by fMRI studies or PET scans.

00:23:49.562 --> 00:23:53.399 align:middle line:84%
For instance, in meditation,
long-term meditation gives rise

00:23:53.399 --> 00:23:55.835 align:middle line:84%
to permanent changes
in brain function.

00:23:55.835 --> 00:24:00.506 align:middle line:84%
The short-term meditation
gives as well also a change

00:24:00.506 --> 00:24:04.343 align:middle line:84%
in consciousness and
in brain function.

00:24:04.343 --> 00:24:11.984 align:middle line:84%
And placebo effect, where
you believe that you're--

00:24:11.984 --> 00:24:17.890 align:middle line:84%
you are receiving medication
that helps for your chronic pain

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:23.596 align:middle line:84%
or for depression or
for Parkinson disease.

00:24:23.596 --> 00:24:25.131 align:middle line:90%
People change.

00:24:25.131 --> 00:24:26.632 align:middle line:84%
Let's say we have
Parkinson disease.

00:24:26.632 --> 00:24:28.834 align:middle line:90%
They can move better.

00:24:28.834 --> 00:24:31.737 align:middle line:84%
There's more dopamine in
the brain just by the idea

00:24:31.737 --> 00:24:35.541 align:middle line:84%
that you get medication and you
see changes in brain function

00:24:35.541 --> 00:24:37.977 align:middle line:84%
by fMRI and PET scans
because you believe

00:24:37.977 --> 00:24:39.645 align:middle line:90%
that you are treated.

00:24:39.645 --> 00:24:42.515 align:middle line:84%
So the placebo effect
is very interesting

00:24:42.515 --> 00:24:48.154 align:middle line:84%
that you change your body by
changing your consciousness.

00:24:48.154 --> 00:24:49.822 align:middle line:90%
>> Is there such a good--

00:24:49.822 --> 00:24:51.424 align:middle line:90%
can we speak of levels

00:24:51.424 --> 00:24:54.827 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness or
of levels of NDEs.

00:24:54.827 --> 00:24:57.363 align:middle line:84%
Is there some kind of
classification of all of that

00:24:57.363 --> 00:24:59.932 align:middle line:84%
where it's starting to really
be rigorous from the work

00:24:59.932 --> 00:25:03.069 align:middle line:84%
that you have done and published
in (inaudible) to, you know,

00:25:03.069 --> 00:25:06.572 align:middle line:84%
what has happened and how
is it evolving right now.

00:25:06.572 --> 00:25:08.474 align:middle line:84%
>> Well the first thing is
there are more and more people

00:25:08.474 --> 00:25:11.477 align:middle line:84%
who are reporting NDEs because
of the modern techniques

00:25:11.477 --> 00:25:15.881 align:middle line:84%
of resuscitation and are better
possibilities to treat patients

00:25:15.881 --> 00:25:17.383 align:middle line:90%
with cerebral disease

00:25:17.383 --> 00:25:20.419 align:middle line:84%
like [inaudible]
diseases in the brain.

00:25:20.419 --> 00:25:21.921 align:middle line:90%
You can threat them better.

00:25:21.921 --> 00:25:26.292 align:middle line:84%
So you can-- you have more
and more people coming back

00:25:26.292 --> 00:25:30.896 align:middle line:84%
for dying, not from
death but from dying.

00:25:30.896 --> 00:25:34.333 align:middle line:84%
And-- so more and more people
are telling us but it has

00:25:34.333 --> 00:25:37.937 align:middle line:84%
to be reported in all
times in all cultures.

00:25:37.937 --> 00:25:40.606 align:middle line:84%
Let's say, Plato has
written an account

00:25:40.606 --> 00:25:42.942 align:middle line:84%
of a near-death experience
of the soldier Er.

00:25:42.942 --> 00:25:47.213 align:middle line:84%
But Plato has also written that
our temporary body is the--

00:25:47.213 --> 00:25:50.816 align:middle line:84%
is the keeper of
our eternal soul.

00:25:50.816 --> 00:25:52.318 align:middle line:90%
So it has been known always

00:25:52.318 --> 00:25:55.354 align:middle line:84%
and when you read the Hindu's
Upanishads or the Tibetan book

00:25:55.354 --> 00:25:58.190 align:middle line:84%
of the death or the
Egyptian book of the dead,

00:25:58.190 --> 00:26:00.092 align:middle line:90%
they all knew it already.

00:26:00.092 --> 00:26:02.128 align:middle line:90%
The shamans knew it already.

00:26:02.128 --> 00:26:03.629 align:middle line:90%
It's always there.

00:26:03.629 --> 00:26:07.333 align:middle line:84%
There is an eternal kind of
aspect of our consciousness

00:26:07.333 --> 00:26:13.406 align:middle line:84%
and we can have access
to-- when we open.

00:26:13.406 --> 00:26:18.044 align:middle line:84%
And I always tell
people that we have

00:26:18.044 --> 00:26:22.314 align:middle line:84%
to change our own consciousness
to change the world.

00:26:22.314 --> 00:26:24.750 align:middle line:90%
And it's all about love.

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:28.421 align:middle line:84%
And it's a wonderful quote
I received from a lady

00:26:28.421 --> 00:26:29.922 align:middle line:90%
with a near-death experience.

00:26:29.922 --> 00:26:32.358 align:middle line:84%
She said, "When the power
of love comes stronger

00:26:32.358 --> 00:26:35.394 align:middle line:84%
than our love for power,
our world will change."

00:26:35.394 --> 00:26:38.197 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's such
an important message

00:26:38.197 --> 00:26:40.466 align:middle line:84%
that we can learn from
people with an NDE.

00:26:40.466 --> 00:26:43.602 align:middle line:84%
It's all about love, but first
start to love yourself as well

00:26:43.602 --> 00:26:46.806 align:middle line:84%
which is hard enough,
and to accept others

00:26:46.806 --> 00:26:48.808 align:middle line:90%
and to accept yourself.

00:26:48.808 --> 00:26:51.310 align:middle line:84%
But I think, indeed there
are different levels

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:53.179 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness to
awaken consciousness.

00:26:53.179 --> 00:26:54.680 align:middle line:84%
You have a higher
[phonetic] consciousness

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:56.982 align:middle line:84%
and you have the highest
form which is light--

00:26:56.982 --> 00:27:01.454 align:middle line:84%
pure love, it's called defined
consciousness of the universe

00:27:01.454 --> 00:27:03.723 align:middle line:84%
or conscious-- whatever
you would call it.

00:27:03.723 --> 00:27:06.358 align:middle line:84%
I know this story of a
woman who was in the light

00:27:06.358 --> 00:27:09.295 align:middle line:84%
and there were deceased
relatives and a light beings

00:27:09.295 --> 00:27:12.498 align:middle line:84%
and she asked, "Is
the light God?"

00:27:12.498 --> 00:27:16.001 align:middle line:84%
And they answered, "The
light is the breath of God."

00:27:16.001 --> 00:27:18.304 align:middle line:84%
There's something
beyond what we--

00:27:18.304 --> 00:27:20.005 align:middle line:90%
beyond comprehension as well.

00:27:20.005 --> 00:27:21.507 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:27:21.507 --> 00:27:23.776 align:middle line:84%
It's beyond words,
beyond comprehension.

00:27:23.776 --> 00:27:25.778 align:middle line:84%
You can call it God or
whatever you would call him.

00:27:25.778 --> 00:27:27.913 align:middle line:84%
You can call him
Buddha or Brahma,

00:27:27.913 --> 00:27:29.782 align:middle line:84%
whatever you would call it,
it doesn't matter, Allah,

00:27:29.782 --> 00:27:31.317 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter,
it's beyond words,

00:27:31.317 --> 00:27:33.519 align:middle line:90%
it's beyond comprehension.

00:27:33.519 --> 00:27:35.020 align:middle line:90%
It's where--

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:36.522 align:middle line:84%
>> It's beyond classification
and labels.

00:27:36.522 --> 00:27:40.693 align:middle line:84%
>> And I don't-- want to try
it as well because it's--

00:27:40.693 --> 00:27:44.864 align:middle line:84%
we can feel it, we can have
(inaudible) knowing about it

00:27:44.864 --> 00:27:46.365 align:middle line:90%
but we cannot put it into words.

00:27:46.365 --> 00:27:49.068 align:middle line:84%
Plato already said that
the moment you put it

00:27:49.068 --> 00:27:52.438 align:middle line:84%
in two words, the
essence is lost.

00:27:52.438 --> 00:27:56.342 align:middle line:84%
It's also the near-death
experience is an affable

00:27:56.342 --> 00:28:00.279 align:middle line:84%
experience where they have
tried to find words for it then

00:28:00.279 --> 00:28:02.915 align:middle line:84%
after this-- but
it was different.

00:28:02.915 --> 00:28:04.416 align:middle line:90%
It was different.

00:28:04.416 --> 00:28:06.452 align:middle line:84%
I cannot really find
words for it.

00:28:06.452 --> 00:28:10.422 align:middle line:84%
>> And yet with your scientific
background in science asks

00:28:10.422 --> 00:28:15.961 align:middle line:84%
for rigor, is this-- or words
in precision and equations

00:28:15.961 --> 00:28:18.731 align:middle line:84%
and assumptions and
theories and--

00:28:18.731 --> 00:28:22.168 align:middle line:90%
but how does quantum mechanics?

00:28:22.168 --> 00:28:23.769 align:middle line:84%
I know that you have
kind of looked

00:28:23.769 --> 00:28:25.404 align:middle line:90%
into this type of science.

00:28:25.404 --> 00:28:27.573 align:middle line:84%
How does that answer--
does that answer for you,

00:28:27.573 --> 00:28:30.209 align:middle line:84%
does that really give
light, does that prove,

00:28:30.209 --> 00:28:31.911 align:middle line:84%
does that give a
scientific evidence?

00:28:31.911 --> 00:28:33.813 align:middle line:90%
Is that really the new science?

00:28:33.813 --> 00:28:36.248 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah. Well, I'm
very reluctant to talk

00:28:36.248 --> 00:28:38.617 align:middle line:90%
about scientific evidence

00:28:38.617 --> 00:28:41.320 align:middle line:84%
because I don't know
what evidence is.

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.389 align:middle line:90%
It's highly--

00:28:43.389 --> 00:28:46.091 align:middle line:84%
>> Some hardcore scientists
would disagree with you.

00:28:46.091 --> 00:28:47.593 align:middle line:90%
[laughs]

00:28:47.593 --> 00:28:50.462 align:middle line:84%
>> I know, but the problem
with consciousness is

00:28:50.462 --> 00:28:54.767 align:middle line:84%
that with our current
materialistic paradigm

00:28:54.767 --> 00:28:58.070 align:middle line:84%
where we have the materialistic
science where we just have

00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:06.245 align:middle line:84%
to objectify to duplicate and
to reproduce, we cannot do

00:29:06.245 --> 00:29:07.746 align:middle line:90%
which is consciousness.

00:29:07.746 --> 00:29:09.281 align:middle line:84%
You cannot measure
consciousness,

00:29:09.281 --> 00:29:12.885 align:middle line:84%
we cannot measure the content of
consciousness, we cannot prove

00:29:12.885 --> 00:29:14.587 align:middle line:84%
that someone is in
love, someone is--

00:29:14.587 --> 00:29:18.090 align:middle line:84%
we cannot prove that
someone is-- fears of things.

00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:22.061 align:middle line:84%
So we cannot prove the
subjective experiences we have.

00:29:22.061 --> 00:29:24.964 align:middle line:84%
We cannot prove about
consciousness at all.

00:29:24.964 --> 00:29:28.200 align:middle line:84%
We can do empirical
studies about consciousness,

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.702 align:middle line:90%
subjective experience like we--

00:29:29.702 --> 00:29:32.805 align:middle line:84%
did the empirical study
for near-death experiences.

00:29:32.805 --> 00:29:36.942 align:middle line:84%
We did the objective part by the
change or the transformation.

00:29:36.942 --> 00:29:39.511 align:middle line:90%
You can have a question list

00:29:39.511 --> 00:29:42.314 align:middle line:84%
and you can do objectify
this transformation

00:29:42.314 --> 00:29:46.652 align:middle line:84%
but you cannot prove
scientifically (inaudible)

00:29:46.652 --> 00:29:49.455 align:middle line:84%
materialistic side that
people have experiences.

00:29:49.455 --> 00:29:50.956 align:middle line:90%
That's the reason that lot

00:29:50.956 --> 00:29:54.760 align:middle line:84%
of scientists still say
consciousness is just

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.262 align:middle line:90%
an illusion.

00:29:56.262 --> 00:29:58.731 align:middle line:84%
We have just a brain
and that's it.

00:29:58.731 --> 00:30:02.067 align:middle line:90%
That's not my opinion anymore.

00:30:02.067 --> 00:30:04.637 align:middle line:84%
[laughs] So it's--
it's much more.

00:30:05.938 --> 00:30:10.376 align:middle line:90%
Quantum mechanics is an analogy.

00:30:10.376 --> 00:30:12.378 align:middle line:84%
It's not an explanation
for consciousness.

00:30:12.378 --> 00:30:15.681 align:middle line:84%
It's-- the analogy is that
what we hear from patients

00:30:15.681 --> 00:30:19.652 align:middle line:84%
who had a near-death experience
that they are real without time,

00:30:19.652 --> 00:30:22.521 align:middle line:84%
without space and
everything is interconnected.

00:30:22.521 --> 00:30:25.190 align:middle line:84%
This is what we know
as non-locality

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:31.797 align:middle line:84%
from quantum physics, that
every smallest part we know is

00:30:31.797 --> 00:30:35.501 align:middle line:84%
instantaneously interconnected
at a change where you--

00:30:35.501 --> 00:30:37.536 align:middle line:84%
one part changes the
other one as well.

00:30:37.536 --> 00:30:41.240 align:middle line:84%
But we also have learned
from quantum mechanics

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:43.108 align:middle line:90%
that the consciousness

00:30:43.108 --> 00:30:48.914 align:middle line:84%
of the scientist defines the
result of the experiment.

00:30:48.914 --> 00:30:52.184 align:middle line:84%
So we can prove that light
behaves as particles.

00:30:52.184 --> 00:30:54.586 align:middle line:84%
We can prove that
light behaves as waves.

00:30:54.586 --> 00:30:56.956 align:middle line:84%
Both is true but
just impossible.

00:30:56.956 --> 00:31:00.159 align:middle line:84%
So it's depending - it's
the complimentary aspect.

00:31:00.159 --> 00:31:05.698 align:middle line:84%
So it's-- our consciousness
defines what we will find.

00:31:05.698 --> 00:31:10.436 align:middle line:84%
And it's also about our
reality up here in this world.

00:31:10.436 --> 00:31:14.907 align:middle line:84%
We don't realize anymore
that the subjective reality

00:31:14.907 --> 00:31:18.444 align:middle line:84%
as we experience is just a
product of our consciousness,

00:31:18.444 --> 00:31:21.613 align:middle line:90%
of our state of consciousness.

00:31:21.613 --> 00:31:25.317 align:middle line:84%
So it's just a subjective
reality.

00:31:25.317 --> 00:31:27.252 align:middle line:90%
We produce our own reality.

00:31:27.252 --> 00:31:29.755 align:middle line:84%
When we are in love,
the world is wonderful.

00:31:29.755 --> 00:31:32.558 align:middle line:84%
When we're depressed,
the world is like hell

00:31:32.558 --> 00:31:34.426 align:middle line:90%
but it's still the same world.

00:31:34.426 --> 00:31:37.930 align:middle line:84%
So what we experience is defined
also by our consciousness.

00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:40.232 align:middle line:84%
So the quantum physics
is also important

00:31:40.232 --> 00:31:44.603 align:middle line:84%
because it has changed our total
world view, and it has taken 60

00:31:44.603 --> 00:31:47.473 align:middle line:90%
to 80 as that-- people accepted.

00:31:47.473 --> 00:31:50.642 align:middle line:90%
And so the Newtonian physics

00:31:50.642 --> 00:31:54.313 align:middle line:84%
where there's just
a local cause,

00:31:54.313 --> 00:31:58.717 align:middle line:84%
a local explanation is
still true for some aspects

00:31:58.717 --> 00:32:02.254 align:middle line:84%
of the micro (inaudible)
but for the real world is

00:32:02.254 --> 00:32:03.956 align:middle line:90%
totally changed.

00:32:03.956 --> 00:32:07.659 align:middle line:84%
What we believe it's
matter, it's vacuum,

00:32:07.659 --> 00:32:11.830 align:middle line:84%
it's 99.99 percent just
filled with information

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:13.966 align:middle line:90%
and with energy, it's emptiness.

00:32:13.966 --> 00:32:17.036 align:middle line:84%
What we sit here is
emptiness and it's so--

00:32:17.036 --> 00:32:20.472 align:middle line:84%
it's a totally different
world of idea

00:32:20.472 --> 00:32:22.908 align:middle line:84%
about the world as
we believe in.

00:32:22.908 --> 00:32:27.579 align:middle line:84%
It's just changing always and
it's just interconnected always.

00:32:27.579 --> 00:32:29.415 align:middle line:90%
>> Same way for our DNA.

00:32:29.415 --> 00:32:32.751 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole part of the
DNA that is actually very much

00:32:32.751 --> 00:32:36.522 align:middle line:90%
at the core of this phenomenon

00:32:36.522 --> 00:32:39.158 align:middle line:84%
or at least, it's
connected with--

00:32:39.158 --> 00:32:41.994 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I believe
and my concept is

00:32:41.994 --> 00:32:45.531 align:middle line:84%
that DNA is the interface
for aspects

00:32:45.531 --> 00:32:47.633 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness in each cell.

00:32:47.633 --> 00:32:53.505 align:middle line:84%
That we-- where we realize that
each second, 500,000 cells die,

00:32:53.505 --> 00:32:59.178 align:middle line:84%
and each day, 50 billion
cells die and are be replaced

00:32:59.178 --> 00:33:02.147 align:middle line:84%
but our body as whole
always functions,

00:33:02.147 --> 00:33:04.116 align:middle line:90%
is changing each second.

00:33:04.116 --> 00:33:06.652 align:middle line:84%
It's just everything
is interconnected.

00:33:06.652 --> 00:33:09.221 align:middle line:84%
You could call it a
morphogenetic consciousness,

00:33:09.221 --> 00:33:10.722 align:middle line:90%
whatever you would call it.

00:33:10.722 --> 00:33:13.358 align:middle line:84%
But this-- each cell is
connected also with a whole.

00:33:13.358 --> 00:33:16.795 align:middle line:84%
But you know that when
we are-- when there was--

00:33:16.795 --> 00:33:21.333 align:middle line:84%
the first egg cell experiments
all come together, the first--

00:33:21.333 --> 00:33:27.639 align:middle line:84%
the new being that has
a new DNA which is new

00:33:27.639 --> 00:33:32.244 align:middle line:84%
and after four cell
divisions, cells are changing

00:33:32.244 --> 00:33:37.516 align:middle line:84%
into heart cells, skin
cells, the eye, neuros,

00:33:37.516 --> 00:33:40.886 align:middle line:84%
but the structure of the
DNA is still the same.

00:33:40.886 --> 00:33:43.889 align:middle line:84%
But the function of
the DNA is changing.

00:33:43.889 --> 00:33:48.127 align:middle line:84%
Then the question is how can
the function of the DNA change?

00:33:48.127 --> 00:33:51.563 align:middle line:84%
Only by information
coming from outside.

00:33:51.563 --> 00:33:53.732 align:middle line:84%
This is also aspects
of consciousness.

00:33:53.732 --> 00:33:58.337 align:middle line:84%
Heredity is also an
aspect or consciousness.

00:33:58.337 --> 00:34:00.506 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that the--
and what we also know

00:34:00.506 --> 00:34:03.509 align:middle line:84%
from outside epigenetics
that influences

00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:07.479 align:middle line:84%
from outside are
genetically transferred.

00:34:07.479 --> 00:34:11.717 align:middle line:90%
So it's not that we are fixed

00:34:11.717 --> 00:34:15.554 align:middle line:84%
but we are changing also
the function of our DNA.

00:34:15.554 --> 00:34:19.324 align:middle line:84%
We were closing connections,
we are opening connections

00:34:19.324 --> 00:34:20.825 align:middle line:90%
because of our consciousness.

00:34:20.825 --> 00:34:24.095 align:middle line:84%
And this is also sub-conscious
but it is also conscious,

00:34:24.095 --> 00:34:26.564 align:middle line:84%
we can change and that is
perhaps our healing [phonetic]

00:34:26.564 --> 00:34:28.200 align:middle line:90%
capacity as well.

00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:31.236 align:middle line:84%
So we can change the
function of our DNA.

00:34:31.236 --> 00:34:32.738 align:middle line:90%
It's also an interesting aspect

00:34:32.738 --> 00:34:35.707 align:middle line:84%
that you hear sometimes
people talking about changes

00:34:35.707 --> 00:34:42.046 align:middle line:84%
in character after an organ
donation especially like heart

00:34:42.046 --> 00:34:45.284 align:middle line:84%
and heart transplantation
which means

00:34:45.284 --> 00:34:48.253 align:middle line:84%
that people have
received a living organ

00:34:48.253 --> 00:34:52.557 align:middle line:84%
and this living organ
is still the receptor

00:34:52.557 --> 00:34:56.093 align:middle line:84%
for the consciousness
of the deceased donor.

00:34:56.093 --> 00:35:01.567 align:middle line:84%
So they feel differences in
the character because if you--

00:35:01.567 --> 00:35:05.204 align:middle line:84%
receive aspects of the
consciousness of deceased donor

00:35:05.204 --> 00:35:09.174 align:middle line:84%
and that is to be understood
by the concept that the DNA

00:35:09.174 --> 00:35:12.878 align:middle line:84%
in each cell in this living
organ is still functioning

00:35:12.878 --> 00:35:15.480 align:middle line:84%
as a receptor of
the consciousness

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:16.982 align:middle line:90%
of the deceased donor.

00:35:16.982 --> 00:35:19.184 align:middle line:84%
>> I had this conversation with
Don Miguel Ruiz, I don't know

00:35:19.184 --> 00:35:22.287 align:middle line:84%
if you know him but he's the
author of the "Four Agreements",

00:35:22.287 --> 00:35:25.757 align:middle line:84%
the four Toltec agreements
and he had a heart transplant

00:35:25.757 --> 00:35:27.793 align:middle line:90%
for over 22-year-olds.

00:35:27.793 --> 00:35:29.294 align:middle line:90%
>> And did he change?

00:35:29.294 --> 00:35:30.796 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:35:30.796 --> 00:35:34.099 align:middle line:84%
He's always being loving and
all about the love and the heart

00:35:34.099 --> 00:35:37.769 align:middle line:84%
but it would be interesting
to ask him further

00:35:37.769 --> 00:35:40.239 align:middle line:84%
as he have memories
or things even

00:35:40.239 --> 00:35:42.941 align:middle line:84%
because he seems very
evolved already and very much

00:35:42.941 --> 00:35:44.443 align:middle line:90%
into the consciousness.

00:35:44.443 --> 00:35:46.712 align:middle line:84%
So, but at 22-year-old,
so he jokes about it now.

00:35:46.712 --> 00:35:48.213 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:35:48.213 --> 00:35:49.715 align:middle line:90%
Well that's--

00:35:49.715 --> 00:35:51.216 align:middle line:90%
>> Twenty-two-year-old woman.

00:35:51.216 --> 00:35:52.718 align:middle line:90%
[laughter]

00:35:52.718 --> 00:35:54.519 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, well, it's
interesting but so the concept

00:35:54.519 --> 00:35:56.555 align:middle line:84%
of the DNA has an
important and I mean,

00:35:56.555 --> 00:35:59.391 align:middle line:84%
we know that four percent
of the DNA has a role

00:35:59.391 --> 00:36:05.931 align:middle line:84%
in the making albumin et cetera,
sinks [phonetic] in the body

00:36:05.931 --> 00:36:08.967 align:middle line:84%
but 96 percent we don't
know the function,

00:36:08.967 --> 00:36:11.303 align:middle line:84%
and we call it "junk
DNA" but I don't believe

00:36:11.303 --> 00:36:14.139 align:middle line:90%
that nature makes junk.

00:36:14.139 --> 00:36:16.708 align:middle line:84%
This is the same
with the universe.

00:36:16.708 --> 00:36:18.744 align:middle line:84%
We know the four percent
of the universe is know

00:36:18.744 --> 00:36:21.313 align:middle line:90%
and 96 percent is still unknown.

00:36:21.313 --> 00:36:24.082 align:middle line:90%
It's dark matter, dark energy.

00:36:24.082 --> 00:36:25.851 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what it is
and what we have to accept

00:36:25.851 --> 00:36:30.022 align:middle line:84%
that there's still will be
mystery in the universe.

00:36:30.022 --> 00:36:31.823 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, there's still a lot.

00:36:31.823 --> 00:36:34.026 align:middle line:84%
I loved when we speak
of time and space--

00:36:34.026 --> 00:36:35.527 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:36:35.527 --> 00:36:37.029 align:middle line:84%
>> -- 'cause those
are definitely,

00:36:37.029 --> 00:36:38.530 align:middle line:84%
it seems like we
could be definitely--

00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:40.299 align:middle line:84%
so it's human concept, you
know, like we have deadlines

00:36:40.299 --> 00:36:42.768 align:middle line:84%
and there's time for this and
time for that and it was just--

00:36:42.768 --> 00:36:45.170 align:middle line:84%
there's so much stress
when really is there.

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:47.706 align:middle line:84%
You know, I love all these
conversations 'cause it opens

00:36:47.706 --> 00:36:49.841 align:middle line:90%
our mind to so much more.

00:36:49.841 --> 00:36:53.578 align:middle line:84%
We could really change our
reality right here right now.

00:36:53.578 --> 00:36:56.348 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel that things are
really evolving and changing

00:36:56.348 --> 00:36:59.952 align:middle line:84%
at this point that we're
even transforming physically?

00:36:59.952 --> 00:37:04.289 align:middle line:84%
Our brain-- you talked of
neuroplasticity, our heart seems

00:37:04.289 --> 00:37:06.758 align:middle line:84%
to be reopened connecting
through those experience,

00:37:06.758 --> 00:37:09.528 align:middle line:84%
through those stories, is it
really possible to evolve?

00:37:09.528 --> 00:37:12.698 align:middle line:84%
Could we really evolve
as human beings inside?

00:37:12.698 --> 00:37:17.669 align:middle line:84%
>> We could evolve as human
being always if you want to.

00:37:17.669 --> 00:37:20.839 align:middle line:84%
If you are open to it and
a problem is that a lot

00:37:20.839 --> 00:37:23.408 align:middle line:90%
of people are not open to it.

00:37:23.408 --> 00:37:26.345 align:middle line:84%
But it's-- I'm very positive
it's changing especially young

00:37:26.345 --> 00:37:27.846 align:middle line:90%
people are more [inaudible].

00:37:27.846 --> 00:37:30.148 align:middle line:84%
I lecture quite a lot
also for medical students.

00:37:30.148 --> 00:37:34.553 align:middle line:84%
They're far more open than
let's say my generation.

00:37:34.553 --> 00:37:37.823 align:middle line:84%
And I lectured to universities
to philosophy students,

00:37:37.823 --> 00:37:40.592 align:middle line:84%
psychology students,
they're far more open.

00:37:40.592 --> 00:37:44.730 align:middle line:84%
I lecture for hospitals and
hospices, they're far more open.

00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:47.733 align:middle line:84%
Nurses are far more open
than doctors and physicians.

00:37:47.733 --> 00:37:49.668 align:middle line:84%
And I admit it, I
think it's changing.

00:37:49.668 --> 00:37:53.538 align:middle line:90%
There's so much interest about--

00:37:53.538 --> 00:37:56.375 align:middle line:84%
in the scientific approach
of near-death experience

00:37:56.375 --> 00:37:59.644 align:middle line:84%
because when there's
a scientific basis

00:37:59.644 --> 00:38:01.146 align:middle line:90%
of our discussion.

00:38:01.146 --> 00:38:04.816 align:middle line:84%
And the main thing is when
consciousness is not produced

00:38:04.816 --> 00:38:07.486 align:middle line:84%
by the brain, where
does this come from?

00:38:07.486 --> 00:38:10.155 align:middle line:90%
How can we explain it?

00:38:10.155 --> 00:38:12.023 align:middle line:84%
There are more questions
than answers as always

00:38:12.023 --> 00:38:15.894 align:middle line:84%
but I think it's different
as we all learned but we--

00:38:15.894 --> 00:38:19.931 align:middle line:84%
that was teach to
us in university.

00:38:19.931 --> 00:38:21.433 align:middle line:90%
It's wrong, I think.

00:38:21.433 --> 00:38:22.934 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:38:22.934 --> 00:38:25.837 align:middle line:84%
>> You had a-- you received
the Lifetime Achievement Award

00:38:25.837 --> 00:38:27.339 align:middle line:90%
in New Delhi.

00:38:27.339 --> 00:38:30.776 align:middle line:84%
And how were-- how
are they over there?

00:38:30.776 --> 00:38:32.277 align:middle line:90%
>> Well--

00:38:32.277 --> 00:38:33.779 align:middle line:90%
>> What's happening in India?

00:38:33.779 --> 00:38:37.249 align:middle line:84%
>> As a joke, I would say, when
you have a near-death experience

00:38:37.249 --> 00:38:40.786 align:middle line:84%
in Western Europe,
you cannot talk about.

00:38:40.786 --> 00:38:44.289 align:middle line:90%
People don't listen to you.

00:38:44.289 --> 00:38:45.791 align:middle line:90%
So it's a trauma.

00:38:45.791 --> 00:38:47.959 align:middle line:90%
It's a spiritual crisis.

00:38:47.959 --> 00:38:53.865 align:middle line:84%
It's-- for years of depression,
loneliness, homesickness

00:38:53.865 --> 00:38:57.669 align:middle line:90%
for this beautiful experience.

00:38:57.669 --> 00:39:01.406 align:middle line:84%
We did a study in the
Netherlands with 84 patients

00:39:01.406 --> 00:39:05.911 align:middle line:84%
with an NDE with a mean interval
of 24 years between seven months

00:39:05.911 --> 00:39:07.979 align:middle line:90%
and 70 years after the NDE.

00:39:07.979 --> 00:39:13.618 align:middle line:84%
After 24 years, still half
of them were not able to talk

00:39:13.618 --> 00:39:15.787 align:middle line:90%
about their experience.

00:39:15.787 --> 00:39:18.190 align:middle line:84%
More than 50 percent of
the patient got a divorce

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:20.659 align:middle line:84%
because 0:39:17 it's
not the same person

00:39:20.659 --> 00:39:22.994 align:middle line:90%
as I was married before.

00:39:22.994 --> 00:39:26.264 align:middle line:84%
So it's such a change,
so it's a trauma.

00:39:26.264 --> 00:39:28.467 align:middle line:84%
But where you-- as
a joke in India,

00:39:28.467 --> 00:39:30.202 align:middle line:90%
you get your congratulations.

00:39:30.202 --> 00:39:32.804 align:middle line:84%
Well, because you have had
this and has consciousness,

00:39:32.804 --> 00:39:35.740 align:middle line:84%
and they're far more
open for it.

00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:38.944 align:middle line:84%
So I think this kind
of-- these countries,

00:39:38.944 --> 00:39:41.379 align:middle line:90%
its people don't have religion

00:39:41.379 --> 00:39:45.150 align:middle line:84%
but they live religion,
it's something else.

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:47.552 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you so much for
this delicious conversation.

00:39:47.552 --> 00:39:49.054 align:middle line:90%
I really enjoyed it.

00:39:49.054 --> 00:39:51.823 align:middle line:84%
I look forward connecting
more with you

00:39:51.823 --> 00:39:54.092 align:middle line:90%
and enjoying this beautiful day.

00:39:54.092 --> 00:39:55.594 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:39:55.594 --> 00:39:57.095 align:middle line:90%
>> You're welcome.

00:39:57.095 --> 00:39:58.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Much, much love my
delicious co-creators.

00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:00.232 align:middle line:84%
Hope you have enjoyed
this interview.

00:40:00.232 --> 00:40:03.335 align:middle line:84%
I'll be doing many other Gaiam
interviews around the world.

00:40:03.335 --> 00:40:05.537 align:middle line:84%
So I hope you're doing
fabulously and if you want
