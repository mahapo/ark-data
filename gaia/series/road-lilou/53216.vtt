00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU MACE: Hello, my
delicious co-creators.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.750 align:middle line:90%
Lilou here.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm in Montreal in beautiful
Quebec that is not snowy

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.820 align:middle line:84%
but actually it's still
quite cold with Jean-Charles.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:25.340 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.970 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN-CHARLES
CHABOT: Hello, Lilou.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:26.600 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.934 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: I'm very excited to
do this interview with you.

00:00:28.934 --> 00:00:29.558 align:middle line:90%
Very different.

00:00:29.558 --> 00:00:31.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: I'm very,
very excited as well.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.599 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Yeah, so you're
a hypnotherapist, right?

00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:34.640 align:middle line:90%
>>CHABOT: That's correct.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.515 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: But you're a
little bit specialized.

00:00:36.515 --> 00:00:40.400 align:middle line:84%
I want to discover your
entire world and everything

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.900 align:middle line:84%
that you because I think
hypnotherapy, as we had just

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.570 align:middle line:84%
discussed, actually
was malleable.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.859 align:middle line:84%
Scientists are more and
more interested into it.

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:51.400 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
research being done.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.170 align:middle line:84%
So I want to hear
everything about everything.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.400 align:middle line:84%
What is the most striking thing
to know about hypnotherapy,

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.500 align:middle line:90%
first of all?

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.380 align:middle line:10%
>>CHABOT: Well, basically
with hypnotherapy,

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.825 align:middle line:10%
you basically connect with
this person's unconscious.

00:01:03.825 --> 00:01:04.610 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.650 align:middle line:10%
So it's establishing
a communication

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.340 align:middle line:10%
with the unconscious
mind to make some changes

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.760 align:middle line:10%
to re-access information
from the past.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.020 align:middle line:10%
You can really help people.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.520 align:middle line:84%
There's, for example,
medical hypnosis

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.050 align:middle line:90%
or developmental hypnosis.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.510 align:middle line:90%
There's for fun stage hypnosis.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And there's also
therapy-- hypnotherapy.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.154 align:middle line:90%
So there's different aspects.

00:01:25.154 --> 00:01:26.820 align:middle line:84%
You can do a lot of
stuff with hypnosis.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.320 align:middle line:84%
But what's really
interesting for me

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.600 align:middle line:84%
is to access past lives or
the spiritual aspect of it

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.170 align:middle line:84%
because basically
I'm specialized

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.250 align:middle line:90%
in three aspects of hypnosis.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.125 align:middle line:90%
I do street hypnosis.

00:01:38.125 --> 00:01:40.041 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've
seen some of my videos.

00:01:40.041 --> 00:01:40.699 align:middle line:90%
No?

00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:41.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Street hypnosis?

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:42.364 align:middle line:90%
No, I have not.

00:01:42.364 --> 00:01:43.570 align:middle line:90%
>>CHABOT: Like, look at me.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.466 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm kidding.

00:01:44.466 --> 00:01:45.810 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CHABOT: So it's basically to
do hypnosis anywhere anytime.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.440 align:middle line:84%
I prefer to call it
impromptu hypnosis

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.290 align:middle line:84%
because it's to give people an
experience of what hypnosis is

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.690 align:middle line:84%
and to give positive
suggestions because there's

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.540 align:middle line:84%
a lot of misconceptions
about hypnosis.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.170 align:middle line:90%
A lot of misconceptions.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.670 align:middle line:84%
And basically why I
specialize in this

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.554 align:middle line:84%
is to become very good at it
because when you see clients

00:02:08.554 --> 00:02:10.720 align:middle line:84%
it may last an hour and a
half, two hours, sometimes

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.290 align:middle line:90%
three hours.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.810 align:middle line:84%
When you do in between
lives, hypnosis

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.820 align:middle line:84%
which we'll have
a chance to talk.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.279 align:middle line:84%
So you don't see
as many clients.

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:19.570 align:middle line:84%
But when you go in the streets
and you just meet people

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:20.890 align:middle line:84%
and you say, hey, do you
believe and in hypnosis?

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.349 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to try something?

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:23.640 align:middle line:90%
Usually it's a group of people.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.030 align:middle line:84%
We do stuff and then
they're convinced.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And it practices-- it
gives me practice for that.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.900 align:middle line:84%
So I specialize in what we
call impromptu hypnosis.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.400 align:middle line:90%
I also do hypnotherapy.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.590 align:middle line:84%
So using hypnosis to
help people get better.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.990 align:middle line:84%
It can have to do
with phobias, or it

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.710 align:middle line:84%
can be like stop
smoking, stuff like that.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.940 align:middle line:84%
It can be emotion,
like self confidence.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.100 align:middle line:84%
It can touch a lot
of different fields.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the
spiritual hypnosis side,

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.080 align:middle line:84%
which is my specialty
with past life

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.380 align:middle line:84%
and in between lives--
regression-- where we connect

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.890 align:middle line:84%
not only with what
happens in the past

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.280 align:middle line:84%
but where we go once
we, basically, die.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Why is it so important
to access our subconscious?

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.940 align:middle line:90%
What is there?

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.000 align:middle line:90%
What is stored?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.970 align:middle line:90%
What do you find out?

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.290 align:middle line:84%
Is that our connection to the
spiritual side of ourselves?

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CHABOT: Well, the
unconscious is very wide.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.700 align:middle line:84%
We could say, like,
there's the unconscious.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's different
authors using different terms.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.840 align:middle line:90%
You can have the unconscious.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.250 align:middle line:84%
Everything that is, for example,
like the functions of the heart

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.370 align:middle line:84%
beating, controlling
the cells, all of this.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.830 align:middle line:84%
Like, there's a part of us
controlling that in some ways.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.230 align:middle line:90%
There's an intelligence.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And there's a subconscious
we could say is, basically,

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.260 align:middle line:84%
the recorder of all
the programmings

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.930 align:middle line:84%
that we've had like if we've
had parents telling you,

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:44.940 align:middle line:90%
oh, your stupid.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:45.590 align:middle line:90%
You're no good.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:46.970 align:middle line:90%
You're this and that.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.240 align:middle line:84%
Then you record this as beliefs
as patterns or conditionings,

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.630 align:middle line:90%
which impacts your life.

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.340 align:middle line:84%
So hypnotherapy has a lot
to change concerning beliefs

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.290 align:middle line:84%
that we integrated
from society, media,

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.550 align:middle line:90%
parents when we're young.

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And then there's also
what is really interesting

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.570 align:middle line:84%
and that's why with Mario
Beauregard we're even gonna--

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.890 align:middle line:84%
there's a workshop that's going
to be based on this to help

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.130 align:middle line:84%
people use hypnosis to connect
with what we could call

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.680 align:middle line:84%
the higher self, the part of us
that knows everything about us,

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.370 align:middle line:84%
that knows everything about
this life and even other lives.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.190 align:middle line:84%
So we pull in the concept of
the soul, basically, which

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.640 align:middle line:84%
is real interesting and can
have a tremendous experience

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.885 align:middle line:84%
for people who
connect with that.

00:04:35.885 --> 00:04:39.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: What happens
during the hypnosis exactly?

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:46.220 align:middle line:84%
What allows this kind of
mental-- the running mind--

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.370 align:middle line:84%
to stop and to hear
something else?

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.960 align:middle line:84%
Even some other
voices or visions

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.130 align:middle line:84%
from the past, or past life
experience-- what allows that?

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CHABOT: We don't know.

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.580 align:middle line:90%
I mean, exactly how it works.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.440 align:middle line:90%
Like, there's a lot of studies.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.340 align:middle line:84%
We know that when people are
in a certain state of mind

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.434 align:middle line:84%
in hypnosis, the brain
wave changes, for example.

00:05:07.434 --> 00:05:09.100 align:middle line:84%
Like, there's going
to be a predominance

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.390 align:middle line:84%
of alpha and theta brain
waves over beta brain waves,

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:13.740 align:middle line:90%
generally speaking.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.110 align:middle line:84%
But what exactly
makes it such a--

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.840 align:middle line:84%
it works, its not
very clear yet.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.060 align:middle line:84%
But we kind of know what
to do for it to work.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.840 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.010 align:middle line:90%
The different techniques.

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.032 align:middle line:84%
But why it works exactly,
it's not really clear.

00:05:27.032 --> 00:05:28.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: So it's like
a big lab because I

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.320 align:middle line:84%
remember interviewing
Dolores Cannon.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And she was just keeping on
experiencing and receiving

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:34.850 align:middle line:90%
quite strange information.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:35.980 align:middle line:90%
Do you also receive that?

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CHABOT: Sometimes.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.734 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I do receive
really interesting-- I mean,

00:05:41.734 --> 00:05:43.150 align:middle line:84%
right now I don't
call it strange.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.150 align:middle line:84%
It's more like not
normal according

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.500 align:middle line:84%
to everybody's ways of
thinking because apparently

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.030 align:middle line:84%
the soul-- and that's what
Dolores Cannon comes out

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.250 align:middle line:84%
in her session, as
well-- is that we

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.160 align:middle line:90%
can incarnate on the Earth.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.130 align:middle line:84%
But there's also other
planets and stuff

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:01.730 align:middle line:84%
like that, which
happens sometimes

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:06.647 align:middle line:84%
that we have clients
from somewhere else.

00:06:06.647 --> 00:06:08.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: So what's
your understanding?

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:09.670 align:middle line:90%
I know this is a huge question.

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.315 align:middle line:84%
But on Gaiam TV,
there's a big community

00:06:12.315 --> 00:06:15.610 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of-- that
reads a lot, that

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:16.780 align:middle line:90%
views a lot of movies.

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.140 align:middle line:84%
They're really, really
connected and interested.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:23.490 align:middle line:84%
So what is your vision of
the universe, the cosmos?

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.840 align:middle line:84%
What is this life--
this reality?

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.190 align:middle line:90%
I know it's a huge question.

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.395 align:middle line:84%
But what is your portion that
you're really interested in

00:06:30.395 --> 00:06:32.710 align:middle line:84%
and keep on-- because
you must have discovered

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.300 align:middle line:84%
a lot through those
sessions and your studies

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.090 align:middle line:90%
and having clients.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.190 align:middle line:84%
>>CHABOT: Well basically,
it's really the understanding

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:47.330 align:middle line:84%
that even physical reality is
not as real as we think it is.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.700 align:middle line:84%
It's a projection of our
consciousness in some ways.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.570 align:middle line:84%
And what's really interesting
is the purpose behind all this.

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:59.270 align:middle line:84%
Like, for example, what we
could call the soul contract

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:00.540 align:middle line:90%
with a life mission.

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:01.650 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:04.120 align:middle line:84%
Because everything
that we experience,

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.150 align:middle line:84%
everything that we manifest
in our life or attract

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:11.130 align:middle line:84%
has something for us to learn
to either help to know ourselves

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:14.160 align:middle line:84%
better or to learn stuff
or to develop as a soul.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.690 align:middle line:84%
So the more I do
this work, the more

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:20.770 align:middle line:84%
I understand the
big scheme behind it

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.820 align:middle line:84%
all is really to grow
as a soul to understand

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.610 align:middle line:84%
the multiple facets
of who we are.

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:28.990 align:middle line:84%
So it's really about
the exploration

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.600 align:middle line:90%
of who we really are.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.800 align:middle line:84%
Like, you've heard
the saying we're not

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.220 align:middle line:84%
a human being having a
spiritual experience.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.830 align:middle line:84%
We're a spiritual being having
a human experience, which

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:45.250 align:middle line:84%
is exactly when I guide
people into having

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:47.630 align:middle line:84%
a hypnosis
experience, my goal is

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:49.610 align:middle line:84%
to connect them
with this reality.

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:51.590 align:middle line:84%
So that's not just
a rational belief

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:55.420 align:middle line:84%
that they experience from their
heart whether their true nature

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:59.340 align:middle line:84%
or who they were to help them
integrate all this to help them

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:03.230 align:middle line:84%
achieve their life
mission because I've

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:06.220 align:middle line:90%
done quite a lot of sessions.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that
really-- how do

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.600 align:middle line:84%
you say this-- really
had a big impact on me

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.400 align:middle line:84%
is that a lot of people sometime
at the end of their lives,

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.834 align:middle line:84%
sometimes they felt guilty
or, oh, what a waste of time

00:08:17.834 --> 00:08:19.750 align:middle line:84%
because they were aware
of their life mission.

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:22.090 align:middle line:84%
It was like, oh, once
again I did that mistake

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:26.110 align:middle line:84%
or once again-- and even today
when a nurses or other people

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:28.360 align:middle line:84%
accompany people at
the end of their lives,

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.200 align:middle line:90%
there's also a lot of regrets.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:34.480 align:middle line:84%
So for me, the more I did this,
I was like, OK, what can I--

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.751 align:middle line:84%
or how can I guide people
to access information that

00:08:36.751 --> 00:08:38.250 align:middle line:84%
are very important
in their lifetime

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:41.840 align:middle line:84%
so when the time will come
to leave this plane again

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.039 align:middle line:90%
they'll say good job?

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:47.400 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes it can
be to face fears

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.000 align:middle line:84%
or to dare to say something
or to be something

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.390 align:middle line:90%
or to just follow your dream.

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And there's many aspects
of the soul contract

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.540 align:middle line:90%
because-- oh, you go first.

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:00.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: I was going to say
so the incidence might not

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:02.800 align:middle line:90%
have happened in this lifetime.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.330 align:middle line:90%
It may be other lifetimes.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.415 align:middle line:84%
So maybe we have come--
because some people say,

00:09:06.415 --> 00:09:08.760 align:middle line:84%
oh, when you arrive as a
baby, everything is good.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:09.760 align:middle line:90%
Everything is all right.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And then, through
human experience,

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:13.500 align:middle line:90%
then there's those blockages.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And then disease
happen, what have you.

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:19.630 align:middle line:84%
But we can also inherit
a lot from other lives.

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:20.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CHABOT: Exactly.

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:24.430 align:middle line:84%
There's some events that happens
from other lifetimes that

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:25.150 align:middle line:90%
has an impact.

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:27.170 align:middle line:84%
Some fears, for
example, some phobias.

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:30.470 align:middle line:84%
Like I've had a Japanese
client, actually.

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:31.220 align:middle line:90%
He came to see me.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:32.700 align:middle line:90%
It was real interesting.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.610 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to do a
past life regression.

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:39.540 align:middle line:84%
But he was just saying, like, I
have this extreme fear of when

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:43.240 align:middle line:84%
you turn on a gas stove,
he said, I can not do this.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:46.610 align:middle line:90%
And then so we did a session.

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:50.984 align:middle line:84%
And at first I just asked to
go to the root of this fear

00:09:50.984 --> 00:09:52.150 align:middle line:90%
and there was nothing there.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:52.900 align:middle line:90%
We did the past life.

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.733 align:middle line:84%
And at the end, I asked
the unconscious mind

00:09:54.733 --> 00:09:57.380 align:middle line:84%
would it be appropriate to
access the root of this fear.

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.403 align:middle line:84%
And he went to another
past life where

00:09:59.403 --> 00:10:03.150 align:middle line:84%
he was-- like, there was a house
burning and stuff like this.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And he was giving a
lot of information.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And afterwards, the
fear was just gone.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.850 align:middle line:84%
Like, three days later, I was
sending him his MP3 because I

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:13.240 align:middle line:90%
record everything.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And then he was like,
it's really weird.

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:16.970 align:middle line:90%
It's really gone.

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:18.300 align:middle line:90%
There's no fear there.

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:22.250 align:middle line:84%
So it can help
relieve some fears,

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:23.880 align:middle line:84%
understand some
karmic relationships.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.150 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you have
someone in your life

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:29.370 align:middle line:84%
that's been really mean
to you in some ways.

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And you have a lot
of anger sometimes.

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And then you go on
the other side--

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:36.140 align:middle line:84%
although it's a
vibrational level.

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.239 align:middle line:84%
It's not really
another side, you know?

00:10:38.239 --> 00:10:39.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: It's not
behind the curtain?

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:40.779 align:middle line:90%
>>CHABOT: Yeah, exactly.

00:10:40.779 --> 00:10:41.710 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:46.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's where people go and
they access information finding

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:49.203 align:middle line:84%
out it was actually a
contract with that soul

00:10:49.203 --> 00:10:54.910 align:middle line:84%
to give them-- to have this
problematic or to be like this

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.050 align:middle line:84%
or to have sometimes a
father that didn't love them

00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:57.550 align:middle line:90%
and stuff.

00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:00.359 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, hm, what
are the benefits of that?

00:11:00.359 --> 00:11:02.900 align:middle line:84%
It's oh, well, because I'm going
to live this experience it's

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:05.740 align:middle line:84%
going to help me grow and
find more of my confidence

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:06.700 align:middle line:90%
within myself.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:10.391 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of things
that come when we do this.

00:11:10.391 --> 00:11:10.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:12.306 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: So when
we see blockages,

00:11:12.306 --> 00:11:15.560 align:middle line:84%
it's really a matter of
hypnosis or not to ask ourselves

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:16.810 align:middle line:90%
what are the benefits of this?

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:17.690 align:middle line:90%
Why am I going through this?

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:19.502 align:middle line:84%
Is there some questions
that we can already

00:11:19.502 --> 00:11:20.460 align:middle line:90%
start to ask ourselves?

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:21.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CHABOT: Exactly.

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:24.434 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's when some things,
like even in real life,

00:11:24.434 --> 00:11:26.850 align:middle line:84%
not in hypnosis, when some
things happen to us we can say,

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:30.390 align:middle line:90%
OK, what can I learn from this?

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:35.120 align:middle line:84%
Like, what does this
challenge enables

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.830 align:middle line:84%
me to learn about
myself that I would not

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:40.910 align:middle line:84%
have had the chance to learn
because we're creators.

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:43.080 align:middle line:84%
We give meaning to what
happens because that's

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.570 align:middle line:84%
what's really
interestingly, Lilou,

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:48.570 align:middle line:84%
is that even though--
like, the soul contract,

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:51.710 align:middle line:84%
there's some things that are
planned before we come here.

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:53.340 align:middle line:90%
For example, our parents.

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:54.590 align:middle line:90%
The body we're going to have.

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:55.090 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:58.600 align:middle line:84%
There's even sometimes
illnesses or some situations,

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.240 align:middle line:90%
stuff that happens.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.250 align:middle line:84%
But even though some
of this is planned,

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:06.630 align:middle line:84%
we have our free
will to give meaning

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:10.930 align:middle line:84%
to interpret what happens so we
can go through this experience.

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:13.582 align:middle line:84%
We have the free will to give
the meaning that we want.

00:12:13.582 --> 00:12:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
the learning comes

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.120 align:middle line:84%
from because you can have,
for example, an illness.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:21.784 align:middle line:84%
And you can live this
illness being a victim like,

00:12:21.784 --> 00:12:22.950 align:middle line:90%
oh my god, blah, blah, blah.

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.480 align:middle line:90%
What did I do to deserve this?

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.790 align:middle line:84%
And then you could have
a totally different

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:30.370 align:middle line:84%
interpretation of it and
say, OK, this is on my path.

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:32.960 align:middle line:84%
What does my soul-- What
can I learn through this

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:37.070 align:middle line:84%
to grow, to become stronger,
to understand myself more?

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And of course, and Bashar,
as I told you before,

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:42.570 align:middle line:90%
explained this very clearly.

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:45.190 align:middle line:84%
It's like, what you put
in is what you get back

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:48.530 align:middle line:84%
because the energy
that you put inside

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:51.870 align:middle line:84%
will define the result the
impact will have in your life.

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:53.990 align:middle line:84%
For example, he
gives the example

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:57.510 align:middle line:84%
of if you go for a
train and you miss it.

00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:59.661 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to-- you're
going to have your plane.

00:12:59.661 --> 00:13:00.660 align:middle line:90%
You're going to be fine.

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:02.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: I'm flying
back out to Europe.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.731 align:middle line:90%


00:13:05.731 --> 00:13:06.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to get it.

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:08.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: It really is a train.

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:12.670 align:middle line:84%
So you go to the train and
you miss it like five seconds.

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And you could have the
reaction and say, oh my god,

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:17.230 align:middle line:84%
this is so bad, it
always happens to me,

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:19.610 align:middle line:84%
and just be in this
state of negativity

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:24.890 align:middle line:84%
and really start to think
about what's going to happen

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:27.110 align:middle line:84%
and all the things
that are bad about it.

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:30.570 align:middle line:84%
Or you could just say,
OK, this happened.

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:35.160 align:middle line:84%
Even though I have no idea why,
that there is something there

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.610 align:middle line:84%
that's for my highest
good in some ways.

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:39.530 align:middle line:84%
And just remain open
and say, OK, maybe I'm

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:42.050 align:middle line:84%
going to meet someone that I
wouldn't have talked to that

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:44.270 align:middle line:84%
is going to open
up an opportunity.

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And you can clearly
see in this example,

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:49.034 align:middle line:84%
like, what you get back
is totally different

00:13:49.034 --> 00:13:50.700 align:middle line:84%
because your state
of mind is different.

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:53.370 align:middle line:84%
The way you observe the
environment is different.

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, like, it's all
about changing our beliefs--

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:00.120 align:middle line:84%
our lenses-- through
which we create reality

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.470 align:middle line:84%
because Bruce Lipton talks a
lot about biology of beliefs.

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:06.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
hypnotherapy-- spiritual

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:12.030 align:middle line:84%
hypnotherapy training
that I do is very based on

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:15.810 align:middle line:84%
this to really identify
beliefs, changing beliefs

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:18.450 align:middle line:84%
that changes our lens
because if I, for example, I

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:22.960 align:middle line:84%
believe I don't deserve to
be happy, whatever you try,

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.946 align:middle line:84%
if you have this belief
that's very strong,

00:14:24.946 --> 00:14:26.320 align:middle line:84%
there's going to
be a part of you

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:29.760 align:middle line:84%
will not be able
to-- to receive that.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:33.700 align:middle line:84%
Or even if someone says I
don't deserve to be loved.

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.950 align:middle line:84%
Even if you have a friend
that give you love,

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:38.490 align:middle line:84%
you will say, oh, he's
trying to trick me.

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:40.050 align:middle line:90%
You're not going to allow it in.

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:43.250 align:middle line:84%
So that's why it's all about
becoming aware of beliefs

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:46.780 align:middle line:84%
and changing them, which
is about like-- well,

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:51.310 align:middle line:84%
spiritual hypnotherapy and
also the in between lives

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:53.280 align:middle line:84%
spiritual hypnotherapy
that we do

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.710 align:middle line:84%
to get another point
of view, basically,

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:57.460 align:middle line:84%
on the experience
because we have the ego,

00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:01.200 align:middle line:84%
the physical self, and
then the higher self.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it just
changes 190 degree-- 180.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:09.850 align:middle line:84%
Because if you think that your
grandfather who-- God knows

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:11.797 align:middle line:84%
what-- did and you
had this anger.

00:15:11.797 --> 00:15:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And then you find
out and you feel it.

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:16.460 align:middle line:84%
It's not like someone telling
you, oh, your grandfather--

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:17.460 align:middle line:90%
like we experience it.

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:19.340 align:middle line:90%
You feel it.

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:21.650 align:middle line:90%
Inside it's just a big change.

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And what was anger
before, with a bit of time

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:29.060 align:middle line:84%
and understanding, it
even, at the highest level,

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:31.370 align:middle line:90%
there's no forgiveness needed.

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:33.150 align:middle line:84%
They just did their
part of the job.

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:35.790 align:middle line:84%
So there's even gratitude when
you reach that stage, which

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:38.040 align:middle line:84%
is really amazing
when you help someone

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.910 align:middle line:90%
to really understand that.

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:43.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Tell us about some
of the scientific research

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:50.600 align:middle line:84%
or the things being studied
to show how amazing-- how

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.287 align:middle line:90%
beneficial the hypnosis is.

00:15:52.287 --> 00:15:54.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CHABOT: Yeah, Well basically
with hypnosis, especially

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:58.400 align:middle line:84%
spiritual hypnotherapy,
there's not a lot done.

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:01.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most of the
research in the field

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:04.191 align:middle line:84%
has been done with
pain management.

00:16:04.191 --> 00:16:05.690 align:middle line:84%
That's why there's
a lot of doctors.

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:11.060 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of doctors--
like, Dr.Shelboney-- Iike

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:14.730 align:middle line:84%
anesthetist, who--
or dentist who

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:16.550 align:middle line:90%
learns hypnosis for the pain.

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:18.170 align:middle line:90%
And it works very well.

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:19.000 align:middle line:90%
So that's why.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.890 align:middle line:84%
But when we move in
the other fields,

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:24.300 align:middle line:84%
like more spiritual things,
there's not a lot of things.

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:26.091 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's real
interesting with Mario

00:16:26.091 --> 00:16:28.320 align:middle line:84%
because we're a bit
pioneers in that field.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:31.680 align:middle line:84%
We want to-- like I
mentioned to you yesterday,

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.270 align:middle line:84%
we did-- we plugged
in a EEG client

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:39.240 align:middle line:84%
with a little 20-- I
thing 19 or 21 electrodes.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And then we did a
past life regression.

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And we had a live between
lives or in between lives

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:46.570 align:middle line:84%
regression connecting
with a spiritual guide.

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And so we're gonna
see what happens.

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:51.510 align:middle line:84%
We want to see when
people access memories

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:54.240 align:middle line:84%
from present life
regarding their past life.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.059 align:middle line:90%
Is it similar?

00:16:55.059 --> 00:16:56.600 align:middle line:84%
Like, we're just
exploring right now.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.540 align:middle line:84%
We don't have anywhere--
because a lot of people,

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:03.850 align:middle line:84%
sometimes, they try to
say, OK, is hypnosis

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:05.380 align:middle line:90%
a state that we can measure?

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:07.390 align:middle line:90%
OK, this level of alpha.

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:09.510 align:middle line:90%
This level of theta.

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:11.910 align:middle line:84%
We don't see it
like this for now.

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:14.282 align:middle line:84%
For now we just explore
is there anything changing

00:17:14.282 --> 00:17:15.740 align:middle line:84%
because it happened
to me because I

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:17.760 align:middle line:84%
started doing some
research before.

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.839 align:middle line:84%
And I was doing with GSR--
you know what GSR is?

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:22.020 align:middle line:90%
Galvanic Skin Response.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:24.280 align:middle line:84%
What they use for
a lie detector.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:25.210 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And I was just
plugging the client

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:29.770 align:middle line:84%
and observing what
happens because when

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:33.090 align:middle line:84%
they have emotional
reactions because-- do

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:34.030 align:middle line:90%
you know how it works?

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:34.905 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: No, tell us.

00:17:34.905 --> 00:17:35.860 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:38.260 align:middle line:84%
>>CHABOT: It's
basically it measures

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:41.030 align:middle line:84%
the electrodermal
activity in the skin.

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:45.549 align:middle line:84%
So like lie detectors, when
you're really stressed,

00:17:45.549 --> 00:17:46.590 align:middle line:90%
well, it's going to peak.

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:48.380 align:middle line:84%
If you're relaxed,
it's gonna go down.

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:52.570 align:middle line:84%
So basically, I just wanted
to explore what happens.

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And also sometimes when
people have an emotion

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:57.841 align:middle line:84%
but they don't
physically show it.

00:17:57.841 --> 00:17:59.090 align:middle line:90%
Some people it's very obvious.

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:01.550 align:middle line:84%
Some people they
don't show it as much.

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:03.140 align:middle line:90%
So you can see it peak.

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:05.000 align:middle line:84%
So it really surprises
people because you

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.660 align:middle line:84%
go like-- you ask a question,
it just goes boom, and you say,

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:09.970 align:middle line:90%
so what's happening now?

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:11.410 align:middle line:90%
And they're like, what?

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:12.940 align:middle line:90%
How did they know that.

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:14.230 align:middle line:90%
So it's one way.

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:17.246 align:middle line:84%
But what was really
intresting is that-- And that

00:18:17.246 --> 00:18:18.620 align:middle line:84%
doesn't happen to
all the clients

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:22.550 align:middle line:84%
but it was significant
enough when I was-- when

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:25.220 align:middle line:84%
the person connected with a
spiritual guide, each time

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:27.420 align:middle line:84%
the guide was
answering a question,

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:31.224 align:middle line:84%
it was just peaking in a
way that is not normal.

00:18:31.224 --> 00:18:32.640 align:middle line:84%
No, it's not
something like this--

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.980 align:middle line:84%
The only way you can make
this is to either, like,

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:38.890 align:middle line:84%
pinch yourself or to create--
to intentionally do something.

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:40.610 align:middle line:90%
But it was really surprising.

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:44.980 align:middle line:84%
So there's like little
anecdotal experiences

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:46.530 align:middle line:84%
like this that are
very interesting.

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:48.931 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: What is
not-- What is it not?

00:18:48.931 --> 00:18:50.680 align:middle line:84%
You know, if we don't
know exactly what it

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.077 align:middle line:90%
is, what is it not?

00:18:52.077 --> 00:18:53.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CHABOT: That's a
very good question.

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:56.600 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing when
I meet clients is just

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.640 align:middle line:84%
to clarify what is
hypnosis, what it's not,

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.180 align:middle line:84%
and what do you
need for it to work?

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:03.090 align:middle line:84%
Like, what do you
need to understand?

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:05.700 align:middle line:84%
In hypnosis, you don't
lose consciousness.

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:06.200 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.116 align:middle line:90%
That's very important.

00:19:07.116 --> 00:19:10.340 align:middle line:84%
Some people-- they think
because of stage hypnosis,

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:14.980 align:middle line:84%
because of movies they see
people sometimes waking

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:17.190 align:middle line:84%
up and saying, oh my
god, what's happening?

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:19.760 align:middle line:84%
That's because there's amnesia
happening at the moment.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:22.370 align:middle line:84%
But when you interview
someone on stage

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:25.650 align:middle line:84%
and you ask them, so how was
it for you to be like this?

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And most people say, like,
I felt really normal.

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:31.220 align:middle line:84%
But there was just
something stronger

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:33.300 align:middle line:90%
making me do it in some ways.

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:33.800 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And when I do street
hypnosis, I have

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:37.960 align:middle line:84%
a lot of fun doing
this sometimes

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.940 align:middle line:84%
because I'm going
to take someone--

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:42.850 align:middle line:84%
even a skeptical person--
I'm going to do something

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:45.320 align:middle line:84%
very quickly, rapid
induction, eyes open, wide

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.210 align:middle line:84%
awake, OK, and they're
with their friends.

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:49.500 align:middle line:84%
And then I say,
OK, now honestly.

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:52.220 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe
you're hypnotised?

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And 80% of the time people
look a bit shy or embarrassed.

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:57.280 align:middle line:90%
Well, no, I don't think so.

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.095 align:middle line:90%
OK, now try to move your feet.

00:19:59.095 --> 00:19:59.720 align:middle line:90%
And they can't.

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.405 align:middle line:84%
I say like, sincerely,
you're not trying to fake it

00:20:02.405 --> 00:20:04.772 align:middle line:90%
or to please me or to play.

00:20:04.772 --> 00:20:05.730 align:middle line:90%
Can you move your feet?

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:06.370 align:middle line:90%
They can't.

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:07.340 align:middle line:90%
And do you feel hypnotised?

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:07.839 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:20:07.839 --> 00:20:08.640 align:middle line:90%
Why can't you?

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.070 align:middle line:90%
They say I don't know.

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:13.520 align:middle line:84%
So it's a-- I would say it's an
unconscious change of reality.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:16.525 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, like, it's
interesting with Anthony

00:20:16.525 --> 00:20:21.660 align:middle line:84%
Jacquin and Kevin Sheldrake
who did some research

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:24.650 align:middle line:84%
and they came up with
the automatic imagination

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:28.210 align:middle line:84%
model, which is basically
about understanding

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:32.410 align:middle line:84%
that, in hypnosis, your
unconscious is imagining things

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:33.270 align:middle line:90%
automatically.

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:33.770 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:38.160 align:middle line:84%
So if I say you cannot stand up,
even if consciously you think

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.670 align:middle line:84%
if you can't, there's a part
of you imagining that you

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:44.180 align:middle line:84%
can't and this part has more
strength than the conscious

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:48.840 align:middle line:84%
part because the unconscious
is much more powerful than

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:49.640 align:middle line:90%
the conscious mind.

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:51.181 align:middle line:84%
The imagination is
much more powerful

00:20:51.181 --> 00:20:52.520 align:middle line:90%
than the conscious mind.

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:53.910 align:middle line:90%
So that's one thing.

00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:55.970 align:middle line:90%
You don't lose consciousness.

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:59.640 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
remember what happens.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:02.205 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people
forget some parts.

00:21:02.205 --> 00:21:03.080 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it happens.

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:05.230 align:middle line:84%
But I record everything,
especially when

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:09.330 align:middle line:84%
we do spiritual past lives
so that they remember.

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:11.440 align:middle line:84%
When we do hypnotherapy,
it's not necessarily

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:14.440 align:middle line:84%
that we remember everything
because we want the unconscious

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:18.680 align:middle line:84%
mind just to take it
in and organize it.

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.250 align:middle line:90%
So there's this misconception.

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:23.570 align:middle line:90%


00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:26.880 align:middle line:84%
Basically, yeah, I would say
that these are the main--

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.620 align:middle line:84%
or that you lose
control that they

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:30.360 align:middle line:84%
can make you do
anything you want.

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:31.776 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Where
you're manipulated.

00:21:31.776 --> 00:21:32.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CHABOT: Yeah, exactly.

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:34.140 align:middle line:90%
And I say, yes, it's true.

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:35.015 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm just kidding.

00:21:35.015 --> 00:21:36.124 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:21:36.124 --> 00:21:37.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Give me your money.

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:37.685 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:21:37.685 --> 00:21:39.518 align:middle line:84%
>>CHABOT: But I tell
people-- I say, listen.

00:21:39.518 --> 00:21:43.500 align:middle line:84%
If it was true, all the
thieves would master hypnosis.

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:45.430 align:middle line:84%
We would see this every
day in the newspaper.

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:47.870 align:middle line:84%
Like, another one got
hypnotised to go--

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:49.790 align:middle line:84%
there's a part of
us that protects us.

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:50.560 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.920 align:middle line:84%
And when people say, well,
what about stage hypnosis?

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.290 align:middle line:90%
What about these people?

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:55.400 align:middle line:90%
First, they're volunteers.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.550 align:middle line:90%
They're not actors.

00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:59.270 align:middle line:84%
When people say, oh,
they were actors,

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:02.905 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing worse for
a hypnotherapist-- no,

00:22:02.905 --> 00:22:06.850 align:middle line:84%
a stage hypnotist to have actors
because people are bad actors.

00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:10.200 align:middle line:84%
It's much better to have three
good subjects than 10 people

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.450 align:middle line:84%
with seven trying to please
their friend or please you

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:12.949 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:22:12.949 --> 00:22:15.225 align:middle line:84%
So some people, they don't
even have a bad intention.

00:22:15.225 --> 00:22:17.960 align:middle line:84%
Like, they're not hypnotised
and the hypnotherapist--

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:21.120 align:middle line:84%
the hypnotist has to spot
them and thank you very much

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:22.130 align:middle line:90%
to keep the people.

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:23.560 align:middle line:90%
So they're real.

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:24.760 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:25.890 align:middle line:90%
And they're not acting.

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:28.080 align:middle line:84%
But they're volunteers
to go there.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.350 align:middle line:90%
They know they're safe.

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:31.262 align:middle line:84%
They know they're gonna--
They've heard that

00:22:31.262 --> 00:22:33.220 align:middle line:84%
they're probably going
to do some things funny,

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:34.649 align:middle line:90%
so they're fine with it.

00:22:34.649 --> 00:22:36.190 align:middle line:84%
But if you hypnotize
someone and say,

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:39.660 align:middle line:84%
OK, now give me your
money [BUZZER SOUND].

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:41.994 align:middle line:84%
Like there's a little red
alarm that's going to come up.

00:22:41.994 --> 00:22:44.076 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Because it's like
we can hear everything.

00:22:44.076 --> 00:22:45.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CHABOT: You can
hear everything, yeah.

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And even like, it's
really funny, Lilou.

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:49.580 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes when I
give suggestions, OK,

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:51.372 align:middle line:84%
next time your eyes
are going to open,

00:22:51.372 --> 00:22:53.580 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be impossible
for you to say your name.

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:55.627 align:middle line:84%
The more you're going
to try to say your name,

00:22:55.627 --> 00:22:56.960 align:middle line:90%
the less it's going to come out.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:57.970 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be really funny.

00:22:57.970 --> 00:22:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And when I say
this, I see people

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.310 align:middle line:90%
smiling like, yeah right.

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:02.620 align:middle line:90%
OK? [SNAP] Eyes open.

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:03.350 align:middle line:90%
Wide awake.

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:04.200 align:middle line:90%
So what's your name?

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.200 align:middle line:90%
And people go like-- OK?

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:10.700 align:middle line:84%
So even if you hear
everything, but you still

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:13.020 align:middle line:90%
have to want it to happen.

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:16.010 align:middle line:84%
As I tell people when I
brief them before, I say,

00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:20.830 align:middle line:84%
you have to want it to happen,
to be open for it to happen,

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:25.370 align:middle line:84%
but when I ask you
to try something,

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:27.826 align:middle line:84%
I want you to honestly try,
especially when I do research

00:23:27.826 --> 00:23:29.200 align:middle line:84%
because I don't
want people fake.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:29.950 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:32.330 align:middle line:84%
So they have to have on one
side, they want it to work.

00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:33.420 align:middle line:90%
They're open.

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:36.210 align:middle line:84%
But on the other side, when I
ask them to test-- for example,

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:39.470 align:middle line:84%
try to say your name or stand
up-- I want them to really try,

00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:41.500 align:middle line:90%
not to fake it.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:44.127 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Why does it
not work on some people?

00:23:44.127 --> 00:23:45.710 align:middle line:84%
>>CHABOT: That's a
very good question.

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:49.000 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of--
there's different factors.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.710 align:middle line:84%
Some people-- I mean,
trust is important.

00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:55.640 align:middle line:84%
To have a feeling of-- if the
person is afraid, for example.

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.020 align:middle line:90%
If they have misconception.

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:59.229 align:middle line:90%
For example, some people--

00:23:59.229 --> 00:24:01.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Because they could
be afraid to be hypnotized.

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:03.270 align:middle line:84%
That could be a first
fear right there.

00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:04.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CHABOT: Yeah, exactly.

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:08.330 align:middle line:84%
That's why the job
of a hypnotherapist

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:11.950 align:middle line:84%
is just to clarify all the
fears at the beginning.

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And you explain it and then you
ask them do you have any fears?

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:15.860 align:middle line:90%
Do you have anything?

00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:18.509 align:middle line:84%
Some people, for example,
I would clarify anything,

00:24:18.509 --> 00:24:20.300 align:middle line:84%
at the end I'll say,
OK, now are you ready?

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:22.150 align:middle line:90%
And they say, yeah.

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:25.100 align:middle line:84%
I said, I kind of feel
that there's something.

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:29.350 align:middle line:84%
So, my aunt told me, like,
it's related with the devil.

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, because
in religion there's stuff

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:33.980 align:middle line:84%
like-- of course,
it's not true--

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:38.640 align:middle line:84%
but it's been like-- hypnosis--
religion didn't like it.

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.320 align:middle line:90%
So you have to clarify this.

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:40.930 align:middle line:90%
It's fine.

00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:41.804 align:middle line:90%
They're totally safe.

00:24:41.804 --> 00:24:43.190 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:45.150 align:middle line:90%
So there's these fears.

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:46.926 align:middle line:84%
And some people,
sometimes they say, like,

00:24:46.926 --> 00:24:48.300 align:middle line:84%
they're afraid
that they're going

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:50.660 align:middle line:84%
to say things that
they don't want.

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.700 align:middle line:84%
You're in control
of what you share.

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:53.390 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:57.700 align:middle line:84%
Unless you give the suggestion,
like, in this direction.

00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:00.639 align:middle line:84%
But the way we work,
you just-- I ask people,

00:25:00.639 --> 00:25:02.055 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
be in a state were

00:25:02.055 --> 00:25:04.013 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
access to more information

00:25:04.013 --> 00:25:05.060 align:middle line:90%
that you normally have.

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:08.340 align:middle line:84%
But you always have the
freedom to share what you want.

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:11.647 align:middle line:84%
So if you access something,
it's too personal, it's fine,

00:25:11.647 --> 00:25:12.480 align:middle line:90%
keep it to yourself.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.646 align:middle line:84%
The important thing is that
you have it to yourself.

00:25:14.646 --> 00:25:17.090 align:middle line:84%
But when I do past
life regression

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:19.095 align:middle line:84%
and in between
lives, I ask people,

00:25:19.095 --> 00:25:21.430 align:middle line:84%
I say, like, I'm going to
ask you a lot of questions

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:23.309 align:middle line:84%
so that we record it
so that later on you're

00:25:23.309 --> 00:25:24.350 align:middle line:90%
going to have it for you.

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:26.489 align:middle line:84%
But if there's something
you want to keep,

00:25:26.489 --> 00:25:27.655 align:middle line:90%
that's totally fine for you.

00:25:27.655 --> 00:25:30.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Where is that
information stored,

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:34.150 align:middle line:84%
because some people talk about
akashic records to past life.

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:34.700 align:middle line:90%
Where is it?

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:36.010 align:middle line:90%
Is it in a cloud?

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:37.230 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:41.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CHABOT: I can say like the
cloud version of internet

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:42.040 align:middle line:90%
today?

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:46.200 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's connected with
the akashic memories.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:50.130 align:middle line:84%
As we know now or
what the science seems

00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:52.610 align:middle line:84%
to tell us about memory,
especially with Dr. Charbonnet,

00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:55.615 align:middle line:84%
like what he does
when people, like,

00:25:55.615 --> 00:25:58.610 align:middle line:84%
they are supposed to
be dead and they're out

00:25:58.610 --> 00:25:59.850 align:middle line:90%
and they access information.

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:02.420 align:middle line:84%
They see things so they
have-- and Mario Beauregard

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:05.162 align:middle line:84%
talks about it, as well--
they have a sense of identity.

00:26:05.162 --> 00:26:05.870 align:middle line:90%
They have memory.

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:07.590 align:middle line:90%
They have emotions.

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And then when they
come back-- so

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:11.756 align:middle line:84%
there was not one neuron that
was moving in their brain.

00:26:11.756 --> 00:26:12.880 align:middle line:90%
And they still have memory.

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:14.770 align:middle line:84%
They still have this
sense of identity.

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:17.690 align:middle line:84%
So it's as if a
part of you-- of us,

00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:21.790 align:middle line:84%
basically, is just a receiver
or access this information,

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:24.250 align:middle line:90%
which is not in our brain.

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:27.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Even for people
wanting to-- that are smoking

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:29.290 align:middle line:90%
and they want to stop smoking?

00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:32.680 align:middle line:84%
That's also an information
that is outside

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:36.320 align:middle line:84%
or could some be stored
in our body and others

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:38.990 align:middle line:90%
out depending on the issue?

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:42.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CHABOT: There's
nothing in the body.

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:44.482 align:middle line:90%
It's as if there's a--

00:26:44.482 --> 00:26:46.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: It's important
to talk about it.

00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:46.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CHABOT: Yeah, yea, yeah.

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:48.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: This is not
too clear for us.

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:51.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CHABOT: Yeah, it's a
field of consciousness.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.900 align:middle line:84%
And when you're open
to spirituality,

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:57.500 align:middle line:84%
you basically have this
framework that you want to use

00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:00.740 align:middle line:84%
people's-- let's call
them-- challenges.

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:06.200 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's stop smoking or
anything that they have like--

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:09.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, like
biting nails or whatever.

00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:09.840 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:11.450 align:middle line:84%
So you could do
work just with that.

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:14.180 align:middle line:84%
But I want to use
these challenges to act

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:16.560 align:middle line:84%
as a springboard in
their spiritual life

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:19.360 align:middle line:84%
so that the changes that
they're going to make

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:23.340 align:middle line:84%
is going to be really
helpful in others' fears.

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's a bit
where I would say

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:28.600 align:middle line:84%
the way I do hypnotherapy will
differ from other kinds of more

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:32.530 align:middle line:84%
classic kinds of hypnotherapy,
which they will say,

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:34.650 align:middle line:84%
for example, OK, if
you're a good subject,

00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:35.700 align:middle line:90%
now you're a non-smoker.

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:36.830 align:middle line:90%
You hate smoking.

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:37.730 align:middle line:90%
Tasting smoke is bad.

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:40.380 align:middle line:84%
You forgot you ever
smoked in your life, OK?

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:43.750 align:middle line:84%
With a very good subject, this
could work and could maybe even

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:45.470 align:middle line:90%
last a long time.

00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:49.450 align:middle line:84%
But from my point of view, my
perspective, every challenges

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:52.140 align:middle line:84%
we should grow from
this experience.

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:54.130 align:middle line:84%
So even when I do
hypnosis, I'm going

00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:56.790 align:middle line:84%
to ask the unconscious
mind to make it such

00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:59.920 align:middle line:84%
that it's going to be
easier to stop smoking

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:04.030 align:middle line:84%
but the individual will
have to put in the effort

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:06.890 align:middle line:84%
because when you put
effort, you feel proud.

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:09.060 align:middle line:84%
You connect with
resources inside of you,

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:11.840 align:middle line:84%
which are transferable to
other aspects of your life.

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:15.390 align:middle line:84%
So we want to help it but
we don't-- it's not a way

00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:17.810 align:middle line:84%
of, like, programming
and deprogramming

00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:19.390 align:middle line:90%
and reprogramming.

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:22.400 align:middle line:84%
It's just really to
help in an organic way

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:25.120 align:middle line:84%
to connect with what's
important-- all the resources--

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.440 align:middle line:84%
so that they make the change
and that they feel proud

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.595 align:middle line:90%
about themselves.

00:28:28.595 --> 00:28:30.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: There's
still free will.

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:36.080 align:middle line:84%
>>CHABOT: There is still free
will and they're responsible.

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:40.000 align:middle line:84%
It's not like sometimes people
come and say, OK, talk to me.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.800 align:middle line:84%
You know, I want to get
rid of this problem.

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:44.220 align:middle line:90%
Go do the job.

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:45.340 align:middle line:90%
Go in my brain.

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:47.270 align:middle line:84%
I don't care what
you do, just do it.

00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:47.960 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And I don't work like
this because it's

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.470 align:middle line:90%
a interactive process.

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:53.970 align:middle line:90%
It's a dance.

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:56.600 align:middle line:84%
And people have to be
involved in the process

00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:58.260 align:middle line:90%
and do the action plans.

00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:02.030 align:middle line:84%
Like, we do stuff and then
they have a spiritual practice

00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:04.670 align:middle line:84%
or they put in
action some things

00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:06.300 align:middle line:90%
to really integrate the change.

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:08.480 align:middle line:84%
So it's a feedback--
like we say, OK,

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:13.508 align:middle line:84%
how did it go-- to help
people be more complete.

00:29:13.508 --> 00:29:14.762 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, basically.

00:29:14.762 --> 00:29:16.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: What is
your personal story

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:18.131 align:middle line:90%
that brought you to hypnosis?

00:29:18.131 --> 00:29:19.557 align:middle line:90%
>>CHABOT: Ah.

00:29:19.557 --> 00:29:20.390 align:middle line:90%
That's a long story.

00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:22.556 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: What is your growth
to spiritual awakening?

00:29:22.556 --> 00:29:24.346 align:middle line:90%
>>CHABOT: OK.

00:29:24.346 --> 00:29:28.264 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Have you always been
interested by these topics?

00:29:28.264 --> 00:29:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CHABOT: Actually,
when I was 16,

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:32.290 align:middle line:90%
I had an out of body experience.

00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:35.800 align:middle line:84%
I was really interested
about-- well,

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:38.830 align:middle line:84%
I had a friend who talked
to me about spiritual stuff.

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:42.490 align:middle line:84%
Like, Ramtha was the first
book I read awhile ago.

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And then "De Memoire
D'Essenien" from Daniel Meurois,

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:48.780 align:middle line:90%
which is an amazing book.

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:50.617 align:middle line:84%
So then I was doing
out of body experience.

00:29:50.617 --> 00:29:52.450 align:middle line:84%
I was like, oh my god,
I have to learn this.

00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:56.270 align:middle line:84%
I went to get a
book, and I studied,

00:29:56.270 --> 00:30:00.000 align:middle line:84%
I practiced a technique
during the whole day,

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.610 align:middle line:90%
and it happened in the night.

00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:04.520 align:middle line:84%
So I actually left
my body and saw--

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:07.930 align:middle line:84%
and which was really interesting
is that when I left my body,

00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:10.620 align:middle line:84%
I had the feeling-- usually
I would have been like,

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:11.860 align:middle line:90%
oh my god, this is cool.

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:13.150 align:middle line:90%
You know, you're 16 years old.

00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:17.510 align:middle line:84%
But I felt more like an
expansion of the mind

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:20.200 align:middle line:84%
as I was more myself
outside than inside.

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the thought was
like, huh, I'm aware of it now.

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:25.110 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't like, oh, cool.

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And then I went to the
kitchen, went through the door.

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
different from a dream.

00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:32.580 align:middle line:84%
Like, when people
say, well, how do

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:34.492 align:middle line:84%
you know it's not--
When you experience it,

00:30:34.492 --> 00:30:35.700 align:middle line:90%
it's like apples and oranges.

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:36.290 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:38.000 align:middle line:90%
It's really clear.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And then at some point I was
rehearsing a visualization.

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:44.940 align:middle line:84%
Basically, I didn't
drink all day.

00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:45.530 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And I was visualizing
drinking water.

00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:50.660 align:middle line:84%
And when I drink water
to remember myself,

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:53.780 align:middle line:84%
that I am to become aware
so that I'm out of the body

00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:55.830 align:middle line:84%
so that was like the
gist of the technique.

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:58.790 align:middle line:84%
So it's as if like, by
default, I went in the kitchen,

00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:03.140 align:middle line:84%
I went to the glass of
water, but when I drank,

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:06.300 align:middle line:84%
I got beamed up in some
kind of astral hospital

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:09.615 align:middle line:90%
where I met beings.

00:31:09.615 --> 00:31:11.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Who did you meet?

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:13.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CHABOT: No, it was
just like light beings

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:16.040 align:middle line:90%
or really wise beings.

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And there was like
some kind of doctor

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:21.099 align:middle line:84%
who-- I don't really
usually tell this.

00:31:21.099 --> 00:31:21.890 align:middle line:90%
Keep this a secret.

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:23.506 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:31:23.506 --> 00:31:26.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: This is a great
community to share it with.

00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CHABOT: Yeah, and
what I remember was he

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:33.149 align:middle line:84%
kind of had bigger
eyes in some ways.

00:31:33.149 --> 00:31:34.690 align:middle line:84%
But he was telling
me a lot of stuff.

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And he was telling me stuff
about my mom would be sick.

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And just a lot of stuff,
which was really interesting

00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:44.050 align:middle line:90%
because my mom wasn't sick.

00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And the next morning--
the ambulance.

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:47.440 align:middle line:90%
We had to call the ambulance.

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.745 align:middle line:90%
So there was a--

00:31:48.745 --> 00:31:50.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: So the timing
was pretty perfect.

00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:54.270 align:middle line:84%
That often happens with
those kind of paranormal

00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:57.350 align:middle line:84%
or whatever we call
it but anyway, you

00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:59.654 align:middle line:84%
know a different
kind of experience.

00:31:59.654 --> 00:32:01.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CHABOT: So that's
why, basically, it's

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:03.990 align:middle line:84%
this experience that-- at
16 years old-- I understood,

00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:08.380 align:middle line:84%
which like for me today, I
don't remember the whole thing.

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:11.360 align:middle line:84%
But it just opened
up inside of me

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:14.840 align:middle line:84%
knowing that there's much
more out there than what

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:17.920 align:middle line:90%
seems to be the case.

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.405 align:middle line:90%
There's other dimensions.

00:32:19.405 --> 00:32:24.544 align:middle line:84%
Other ways of-- Other levels
of realities, basically.

00:32:24.544 --> 00:32:26.585 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: That's pretty
young to be aware of that.

00:32:26.585 --> 00:32:27.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CHABOT: Yeah.

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:28.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: What did
you do with it then?

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:31.940 align:middle line:84%
Did you start studying
or you curiosity was--

00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:34.080 align:middle line:84%
>>CHABOT: Well
actually, this kind of

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:40.099 align:middle line:84%
triggered a really intense
desire to learn about humans.

00:32:40.099 --> 00:32:41.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Everything
about everything.

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:45.110 align:middle line:84%
>>CHABOT: Yeah, but what
really interested me the most

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:48.490 align:middle line:84%
and I did my thesis on this--
my master's degree thesis--

00:32:48.490 --> 00:32:49.870 align:middle line:90%
on interpersonal change.

00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:50.710 align:middle line:90%
How we change.

00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:54.610 align:middle line:84%
How human beings evolve
different paradigms of change.

00:32:54.610 --> 00:32:59.361 align:middle line:84%
And this is where when I did
literature [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:32:59.361 --> 00:32:59.860 align:middle line:90%
literature?

00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:01.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Mm, that's one that--

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:04.070 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:04.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: A review!

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:06.695 align:middle line:84%
>>CHABOT: A review like
when you do research,

00:33:06.695 --> 00:33:08.380 align:middle line:84%
you just read a lot
of stuff, basically.

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:09.670 align:middle line:90%
So in the literature.

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And there were some, of course,
articles about hypnosis being

00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:15.940 align:middle line:84%
an interesting
modality to change.

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And then-- like
very short story.

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:21.040 align:middle line:84%
And then later on
after my master's, I

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:23.580 align:middle line:84%
was in China for five years
doing corporate training,

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:26.310 align:middle line:84%
teaching presentation skills,
confidence building skills,

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:28.620 align:middle line:84%
and stuff like that,
communication skills.

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
integrating in hypnosis.

00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:34.730 align:middle line:84%
But I hadn't had any
training, formal training.

00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:36.550 align:middle line:84%
So when I was in
Beijing, I decided

00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:39.570 align:middle line:84%
to do my first
training in California.

00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:42.570 align:middle line:84%
And this is where, even though
it was a normal hypnotherapy

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:46.040 align:middle line:84%
training, the
teacher-- the trainer--

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:48.800 align:middle line:84%
basically was also doing
spiritual hypnotherapy

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:50.340 align:middle line:90%
to connect with the soul.

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:51.670 align:middle line:90%
And it was real interesting.

00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:53.230 align:middle line:90%
It was Cal Bannon.

00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:57.442 align:middle line:84%
And what's really interesting
about Cal is that all his life

00:33:57.442 --> 00:33:59.400 align:middle line:84%
he was just the normal
clinical hypnotherapist.

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:02.570 align:middle line:84%
He wouldn't talk about guides
or past lives and all this.

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And then about eight
years later-- in 2008

00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:09.500 align:middle line:84%
anyway-- he started to
be famous, didn't care,

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.250 align:middle line:84%
and then he started
to say, you know what?

00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:15.020 align:middle line:84%
When I did hypnotherapy,
I used to go back

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:17.909 align:middle line:84%
before the incarnation
to go back in because

00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:22.436 align:middle line:84%
if you have a problem so you go
back even before and say, OK,

00:34:22.436 --> 00:34:23.969 align:middle line:90%
what can we learn from this?

00:34:23.969 --> 00:34:25.807 align:middle line:84%
Was there a reason for
this or blah, blah,

00:34:25.807 --> 00:34:29.810 align:middle line:84%
blah to go get some
learnings about the mission.

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:32.139 align:middle line:84%
So that's where I was
like, oh interesting.

00:34:32.139 --> 00:34:34.100 align:middle line:84%
And then I learned
Michael Newton's work.

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:34.600 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:38.429 align:middle line:84%
So I started to, basically,
train with all the big guys

00:34:38.429 --> 00:34:41.060 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the Newton
Institute, Brian Wise, Dolores

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:44.340 align:middle line:84%
Cannon, and went to Tom
Silver at some point.

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:49.320 align:middle line:84%
And I just went to study all
the golden nuggets, basically,

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:53.320 align:middle line:84%
and just created my own approach
and started teaching people

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:54.642 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:34:54.642 --> 00:34:56.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: What's
still, to this day,

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:59.850 align:middle line:84%
the most surprising thing
about this whole adventure?

00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:02.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CHABOT: The most
surprising thing?

00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:03.665 align:middle line:90%
I mean, each time--

00:35:03.665 --> 00:35:04.815 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: That you're
still like, just, wow.

00:35:04.815 --> 00:35:07.180 align:middle line:84%
>>CHABOT: I mean, just
yesterday, Lilou, you know,

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:12.290 align:middle line:84%
when you have a client
which connects with a guide

00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:14.870 align:middle line:84%
and just has this really
strong vibrational energy

00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:15.580 align:middle line:90%
and telling him.

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:20.745 align:middle line:84%
And you see the client is just
like really-- what's the word?

00:35:20.745 --> 00:35:22.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Emotional?

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.630 align:middle line:90%
>>CHABOT: Moved; touched.

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:25.290 align:middle line:90%
And it really integrates.

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:28.470 align:middle line:84%
Like, Mario, Joanne
his wife was there.

00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:29.220 align:middle line:90%
The cameramen.

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:31.230 align:middle line:90%
We were all like chills.

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:34.770 align:middle line:84%
Like there's really stuff
that's-- each time for me

00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:36.540 align:middle line:90%
it's becoming normal.

00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:37.040 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:39.080 align:middle line:84%
But when I see or
what will impress

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:44.900 align:middle line:84%
me is also always stuff like
from more evolved beings

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:47.310 align:middle line:84%
or people coming sometimes
from other planets-- a bit

00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:48.510 align:middle line:90%
similar to Dolores Cannon.

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:49.600 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't happen often.

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:51.340 align:middle line:84%
But when it happens
it's like, huh.

00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:54.490 align:middle line:84%
Especially it's like, when it's
really normal people like you

00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:57.420 align:middle line:84%
and me and they're like,
whoa, what was that?

00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:58.677 align:middle line:90%
Did I imagine that?

00:35:58.677 --> 00:36:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And then we do another
session and they just

00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:03.530 align:middle line:90%
give a lot of details and stuff.

00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:06.687 align:middle line:84%
And what's important
when people say, well,

00:36:06.687 --> 00:36:07.770 align:middle line:90%
how do you know it's true?

00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:09.230 align:middle line:90%
How do you know it's not?

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:12.640 align:middle line:84%
And I tell people, on one
level, the important thing

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:15.070 align:middle line:84%
is that there's
a reason why this

00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:17.040 align:middle line:90%
happened and not something else.

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And what's important is to
learn from it because even

00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:22.150 align:middle line:84%
if the mind just
created a metaphor

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:26.320 align:middle line:84%
to help you release a fear or
do something that helps you

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:28.260 align:middle line:90%
and you're better, who cares?

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:28.760 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:33.480 align:middle line:84%
But I did have some clients, of
course, that we went on Google

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:38.540 align:middle line:84%
and checked out some information
and really interesting stuff.

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:40.310 align:middle line:84%
Like, I mean, I
could talk about this

00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:44.320 align:middle line:84%
but it's real interesting
when you verify information

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:45.620 align:middle line:90%
and the person is like, whoa.

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:46.120 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:48.020 align:middle line:84%
It's like stuff
like he was living

00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:49.694 align:middle line:90%
in a-- Just a quick example.

00:36:49.694 --> 00:36:50.360 align:middle line:90%
Do we have time?

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:50.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Mm hm.

00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:51.040 align:middle line:90%
>>CHABOT: Yeah?

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:51.540 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:58.205 align:middle line:84%
Quick example, this guy was
living in a village in France.

00:36:58.205 --> 00:37:04.200 align:middle line:84%
It was Chapelle-Glain which is
like 1,000 people or something.

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:04.955 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:37:04.955 --> 00:37:06.830 align:middle line:84%
And it was really
interesting because the guy

00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:08.150 align:middle line:90%
before, he was really stressed.

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:12.546 align:middle line:84%
He was like, I'm not afraid
of what I'm going to access.

00:37:12.546 --> 00:37:14.170 align:middle line:84%
It's I'm afraid it's
not going to work.

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:15.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, everybody says that.

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:16.380 align:middle line:90%
You're fine.

00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:17.540 align:middle line:84%
You know, just follow
the suggestions.

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:18.687 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be good.

00:37:18.687 --> 00:37:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And the guy was a
really good subject.

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And he was like in-- So all
the information, his wife, five

00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:28.160 align:middle line:84%
kids, everything was
coming really quickly.

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And he was calling it
though Chapelle-Glain.

00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:34.217 align:middle line:84%
And then we found it
was Chapelle-Glain.

00:37:34.217 --> 00:37:36.050 align:middle line:84%
The church-- he looked
at the church and was

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:38.290 align:middle line:84%
like, oh my god, this
is really familiar.

00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:42.830 align:middle line:84%
The next lifetime he was like
an American Indian person.

00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And I said what's the
name of the tribe?

00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:48.880 align:middle line:84%
He said, Swampy Cree,
which he never heard.

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:51.520 align:middle line:84%
He said, but our tipis
are not like triangular.

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:53.810 align:middle line:84%
They were a bit
like round shapes.

00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:59.150 align:middle line:84%
So afterwards we go on Google,
and we find Swampy Cree's.

00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:00.620 align:middle line:90%
And he was looking at it.

00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:05.440 align:middle line:84%
So when you verify stuff
like this, it's interesting.

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:09.530 align:middle line:84%
But for me, the most
interesting is the healing

00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:13.895 align:middle line:84%
or the liberation that really
happens when we do this work.

00:38:13.895 --> 00:38:17.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Even on pains
or physical problems?

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:19.270 align:middle line:90%
>>CHABOT: It happens sometimes.

00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:20.144 align:middle line:90%
It happens sometimes.

00:38:20.144 --> 00:38:22.310 align:middle line:84%
Like, we're never
going to advertise it

00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:23.610 align:middle line:90%
or we can't say that we heal.

00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:26.570 align:middle line:84%
It's just sometimes that
people are free, sometimes,

00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:28.610 align:middle line:90%
from problems.

00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:31.377 align:middle line:84%
But I would never
recommend that someone--

00:38:31.377 --> 00:38:32.710 align:middle line:90%
like, for me, it's a compliment.

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Like if you have an illness,
you stay with your doctor,

00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:36.150 align:middle line:90%
you do this.

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:37.770 align:middle line:84%
But you can do this
as a complement

00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:40.780 align:middle line:84%
to help you understand it
and change your view of it--

00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:42.520 align:middle line:90%
your understanding of it.

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:44.210 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes, yeah,
I did have people

00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:49.220 align:middle line:84%
who had pain and then something
just-- like for example--

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:50.930 align:middle line:90%
like a really big knee pain.

00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:51.530 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And then I was like, with
the guides, sometimes

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:54.149 align:middle line:90%
it's really interesting.

00:38:54.149 --> 00:38:56.900 align:middle line:84%
You just ask the guides, is
there something you can do?

00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:57.850 align:middle line:90%
And they say, sure.

00:38:57.850 --> 00:39:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And the guy said, OK, I just
feel this energy on my knee

00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:02.370 align:middle line:90%
and I see images.

00:39:02.370 --> 00:39:04.040 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, oh,
what kind of images?

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:07.710 align:middle line:84%
He said there's images of money,
of this person, of that person,

00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:09.350 align:middle line:84%
like, and then we
can make clinks

00:39:09.350 --> 00:39:11.720 align:middle line:84%
like memories, cellular
memory or something.

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And afterward, he was
moving like, whoa.

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:19.390 align:middle line:84%
The pain is gone in some
way, so stuff happens.

00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:23.000 align:middle line:84%
Like, reality is really
more complex and beautiful,

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.800 align:middle line:84%
and I would even dare to
say-- maybe not magical--

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:29.570 align:middle line:84%
but in some way there's
really something that's

00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:32.270 align:middle line:84%
really fascinating
about all this.

00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:37.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Last little thing-- on
autohypnosis, self- hypnosis.

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:39.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CHABOT: Yeah, self-hypnosis.

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:40.740 align:middle line:90%
For me, I had an illness.

00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:42.390 align:middle line:84%
So I used self-hypnosis
to really--

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:45.800 align:middle line:84%
it was supposed to
be incurable illness.

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:46.830 align:middle line:90%
Scleroderma.

00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And I really used it,
basically,-- self-hypnosis--

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:54.240 align:middle line:90%
to help get better basically.

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:55.560 align:middle line:90%
So there's different ways.

00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:57.870 align:middle line:84%
You could go see a
hypnotherapist who

00:39:57.870 --> 00:40:02.700 align:middle line:84%
does a session with you and
then gives you a way to go back.

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:04.170 align:middle line:84%
Or you can practice
it by yourself.

00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:06.370 align:middle line:84%
There's different books
or different things

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:10.196 align:middle line:84%
you can say or do inside
of you to get in the state

00:40:10.196 --> 00:40:11.820 align:middle line:84%
and then you can do
some visualization,

00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:14.580 align:middle line:90%
which is extremely powerful.

00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:16.969 align:middle line:84%
Like, the neuro science
of visualization.

00:40:16.969 --> 00:40:19.260 align:middle line:84%
The brain doesn't make a
difference between what's real

00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:20.210 align:middle line:90%
and imagined.

00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:22.120 align:middle line:90%
So there's this aspect.

00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:23.860 align:middle line:90%
Or it can be affirmations.

00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:26.690 align:middle line:84%
There can be like, to
connect with the feeling,

00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:30.359 align:middle line:84%
I stress the emphasis on
really feeling and Bashar talks

00:40:30.359 --> 00:40:32.650 align:middle line:84%
about this really clearly,
which is really interesting.

00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:36.520 align:middle line:84%
He said, the visualization,
it doesn't really matter.

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:39.810 align:middle line:84%
The visualization is
basically a pretext

00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:42.970 align:middle line:84%
to feel the emotion
of what it will

00:40:42.970 --> 00:40:45.400 align:middle line:84%
be like when you're
healed; when you're good.

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And then your higher
self takes this feeling

00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:53.870 align:middle line:84%
and then finds ways to
manifest this in some ways.

00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:56.450 align:middle line:84%
But self-hypnosis is
really interesting.

00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
I would recommend.

00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:03.070 align:middle line:84%
Even if you have an operation,
hypnosis before the operation

00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:04.570 align:middle line:84%
and afterwards to
help with healing.

00:41:04.570 --> 00:41:06.970 align:middle line:84%
I did stuff for
people close to me.

00:41:06.970 --> 00:41:09.050 align:middle line:90%
And MP3s.

00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:11.920 align:middle line:10%
MP3s is a really
good way to just

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:15.470 align:middle line:10%
to learn to be guided
because the biggest

00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:18.660 align:middle line:10%
difficulty with
self-hypnosis is,

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:21.620 align:middle line:10%
if you don't do it with
anything, it's possible.

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:22.990 align:middle line:10%
You know, I've done it.

00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:25.660 align:middle line:10%
But it's just a part of
you has to guide yourself

00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:27.660 align:middle line:10%
and a part of you has
to have the experience.

00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:28.890 align:middle line:90%
You have to keep track.

00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:30.170 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'm doing this.

00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:32.480 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, if you have a
hypnotherapist or MP3, you

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:34.050 align:middle line:84%
just-- you don't
have to guide it.

00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:35.025 align:middle line:90%
You just follow.

00:41:35.025 --> 00:41:35.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Relax, sure.

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:38.130 align:middle line:84%
>>CHABOT: You just relax,
follow suggestions.

00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:39.213 align:middle line:90%
That's all you have to do.

00:41:39.213 --> 00:41:40.570 align:middle line:90%
So it's all possible.

00:41:40.570 --> 00:41:42.606 align:middle line:90%
It's just different options.

00:41:42.606 --> 00:41:44.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Last little
thing that you

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:50.250 align:middle line:84%
want to leave us with or
just a call to action or just

00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:52.230 align:middle line:84%
something that you
think is important?

00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:56.440 align:middle line:84%
A message for people
watching that's-- you know.

00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:59.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CHABOT: A message
for people watching?

00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:01.389 align:middle line:90%
Well, I would say--

00:42:01.389 --> 00:42:03.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Like to
encourage us in our lives?

00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:06.540 align:middle line:84%
You know, sometimes life
can be a little challenging!

00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:09.310 align:middle line:84%
So is there a word of
wisdom for us today?

00:42:09.310 --> 00:42:11.090 align:middle line:90%
>>CHABOT: Oh, a little pressure.

00:42:11.090 --> 00:42:12.884 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:42:12.884 --> 00:42:13.925 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Some channeling!

00:42:13.925 --> 00:42:16.140 align:middle line:90%
Just bring it on!

00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:18.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CHABOT: I mean, for me it
just comes back, I would say,

00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:24.230 align:middle line:84%
to really realizing that
we're a special being having

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:25.390 align:middle line:90%
a human experience.

00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And whatever happens
in our lives,

00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:30.220 align:middle line:90%
nothing can make us feel bad.

00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:32.690 align:middle line:84%
There's no events,
there's no person

00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:34.150 align:middle line:90%
that can make us feel bad.

00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:35.000 align:middle line:90%
We interpret.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.630 align:middle line:84%
We give meaning to
what's happening

00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:38.020 align:middle line:90%
and that's our free will.

00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:44.290 align:middle line:84%
And to really have this self
awareness to develop this--

00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:49.000 align:middle line:84%
when something happens to say,
OK, this is-- thank you life.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.490 align:middle line:90%
Even if it's really difficult.

00:42:50.490 --> 00:42:52.040 align:middle line:84%
When you say, OK,
there's something

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:53.520 align:middle line:90%
that I can learn from this.

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:57.100 align:middle line:84%
And you just realize that,
basically, whatever happens,

00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:58.177 align:middle line:90%
you're in control.

00:42:58.177 --> 00:42:59.010 align:middle line:90%
You know, happiness.

00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:01.360 align:middle line:84%
If you're in control
of how you interpret,

00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:03.980 align:middle line:84%
how you give meaning
to things, you're

00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:06.640 align:middle line:84%
going to stop to
try to change people

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:10.910 align:middle line:84%
or to just be happy if
you have this or if that.

00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:15.260 align:middle line:84%
So I would say to really to
develop this self awareness

00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:17.080 align:middle line:90%
that we give the meaning.

00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And the meaning that we give
will determine the effect

00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:20.950 align:middle line:90%
that we give back.

00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
it really starts

00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:24.316 align:middle line:90%
to be really interesting.

00:43:24.316 --> 00:43:25.690 align:middle line:84%
