00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.890 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Hello, my
juicy co-creators.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:18.620 align:middle line:90%
Lilou here.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.610 align:middle line:10%
I'm in beautiful, sunny
Miami with Simran.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.790 align:middle line:10%
I'm so happy to see you
and meet you in person.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.120 align:middle line:10%
Oh my god, this is going to
be an extraordinary video.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.980 align:middle line:10%
I feel it.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.660 align:middle line:10%
I felt it this
morning, you know?

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.350 align:middle line:84%
When I put my hand on my
heart, I just knew that.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.110 align:middle line:90%
I got even emotional.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.330 align:middle line:90%
I got some tears of joy.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.920 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for
flying from Texas here

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.420 align:middle line:90%
to beautiful Florida.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.650 align:middle line:90%
We're on Ocean Drive.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:41.490 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Simran.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.660 align:middle line:84%
>> SIMRAN SINGH: Oh, thank you
for being the original creative

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.230 align:middle line:90%
rebel.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.938 align:middle line:84%
And all the signs
showed up this morning.

00:00:45.938 --> 00:00:47.670 align:middle line:84%
There were 11's and
22's everywhere.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.160 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: [LAUGHS] So we're
going to speak of living

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.440 align:middle line:90%
an enlightened journey.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.380 align:middle line:84%
You're the author of "Your
Journey to Enlightenment,"

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.000 align:middle line:84%
"Conversations
with the Universe."

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.070 align:middle line:90%
You have the magazine "11:11."

00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.790 align:middle line:90%
You travel.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:00.940 align:middle line:90%
You're on the road.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:01.750 align:middle line:90%
You love it.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:02.690 align:middle line:90%
I saw your TEDx.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:03.830 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.480 align:middle line:90%
I love this girl already.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.730 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.022 align:middle line:84%
So what is this
enlightened living?

00:01:11.022 --> 00:01:12.980 align:middle line:10%
>> SINGH: You know,
everyone's wanting to go up

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.320 align:middle line:10%
into the ethers or have
enlightenment handed to them

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.969 align:middle line:10%
by someone else
outside of themselves.

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:19.760 align:middle line:10%
And what I have discovered
through my life,

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.718 align:middle line:10%
and I'm sure you have
discovered through diving

00:01:21.718 --> 00:01:23.650 align:middle line:10%
into your passions
and your heart,

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.610 align:middle line:10%
is that enlightenment
is something

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.520 align:middle line:10%
that is a self-induced process.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.290 align:middle line:10%
It's a self-illumination
process.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.590 align:middle line:10%
It is something that we have to
invite and invoke and embody.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.580 align:middle line:10%
Because we're meant
to be on planet Earth.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.790 align:middle line:10%
We're not meant to be
floating in the stars.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.890 align:middle line:10%
That is part of
who we are, but we

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.490 align:middle line:10%
are meant to be here
grounded in the essence

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.990 align:middle line:10%
that we are, creating from
that creative essence.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.500 align:middle line:10%
Because we are the sons
and daughters of the divine

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.340 align:middle line:10%
here to express
creative capacity.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.032 align:middle line:10%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:01:50.032 --> 00:01:53.160 align:middle line:10%
So how would you summarize
this enlightenment?

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.520 align:middle line:10%
So we're all entitled
to it, right?

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.400 align:middle line:10%
>> SINGH: Yes.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.775 align:middle line:10%
>> LILOU: And then what does
it look like on a day-to-day

00:01:58.775 --> 00:01:59.660 align:middle line:10%
basis?

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.670 align:middle line:10%
>> SINGH: Enlightenment to me
is our ability to understand,

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.600 align:middle line:10%
first and foremost,
that we're all masters.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.650 align:middle line:10%
Every single one of us
is a master walking.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.949 align:middle line:10%
The misrepresentation
about mastery

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.480 align:middle line:10%
is that a master is someone
with miracles all around them

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.751 align:middle line:10%
all the time.

00:02:13.751 --> 00:02:14.750 align:middle line:10%
But that's not a master.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:15.990 align:middle line:10%
That would be too easy.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.890 align:middle line:10%
A master is someone that has
the obstacles in their life

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.160 align:middle line:10%
but understands how to
navigate through them

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.930 align:middle line:10%
and creates despite those
obstacles in their life.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.640 align:middle line:10%
That is true mastery.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.270 align:middle line:10%
And when we step into
that and we understand

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.870 align:middle line:10%
that when we dive
into our shadows

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.060 align:middle line:10%
and we dive into the difficulty
that shows up in life

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.500 align:middle line:10%
and we merge the fear and the
love, the dark and the light

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.830 align:middle line:10%
and that we allow it to be
in the now fully present with

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.960 align:middle line:10%
emotion, that's where we
tap into enlightenment,

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.650 align:middle line:10%
because we're understanding
that we're not just human.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.610 align:middle line:10%
This is a physical space suit.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.890 align:middle line:10%
We're not even spiritual beings
having a human experience.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.100 align:middle line:10%
I don't believe that.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.850 align:middle line:10%
Because if we were
spiritual beings having

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.790 align:middle line:10%
a human experience,
then when we die,

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.060 align:middle line:10%
we're just as separate
as we are now.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.950 align:middle line:10%
So there must be
something beyond that.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.460 align:middle line:10%
I believe we are experience
experiencing itself.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.540 align:middle line:10%
And enlightenment is
fully embodying and living

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.980 align:middle line:10%
as experience in each and
every moment of every day.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.370 align:middle line:10%
>> LILOU: I love when you say
in the TED talk or even just

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.857 align:middle line:10%
the title of your first
book, "Conversations with

00:03:17.857 --> 00:03:20.190 align:middle line:10%
the Universe," that we're
always, actually we're always,

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.240 align:middle line:10%
always having a conversation
with the universe.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.290 align:middle line:90%
Tell us more.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.290 align:middle line:90%
So there are signs, huh?

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.222 align:middle line:84%
There's things
that happen to us.

00:03:26.222 --> 00:03:27.680 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot that
happened to you.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.388 align:middle line:84%
I want to get into
your story after that,

00:03:29.388 --> 00:03:31.450 align:middle line:84%
because my goodness
did you ever go

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:32.974 align:middle line:84%
through the dark
night of the soul.

00:03:32.974 --> 00:03:35.390 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: Well, I think that
that's why I wrote this book.

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for
writing "Conversations

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.079 align:middle line:84%
with the Universe" is because
I realized I didn't trust life.

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.245 align:middle line:90%
I didn't trust the universe.

00:03:41.245 --> 00:03:42.910 align:middle line:90%
I didn't trust God.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.220 align:middle line:90%
I didn't trust other people.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.240 align:middle line:84%
Most of all, I
didn't trust myself.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to
build that trust.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.975 align:middle line:84%
And how that came
in is discovering

00:03:49.975 --> 00:03:52.100 align:middle line:84%
that there were signs,
symbols, and synchronicities

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.460 align:middle line:84%
showing up, but not just passing
them by when they showed up,

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.210 align:middle line:90%
starting to really look at them.

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is each
and every one of us

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.780 align:middle line:84%
gets signs all of the
time, all day long.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.670 align:middle line:84%
We are each just as special
as the other and not so.

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.800 align:middle line:10%
And we have to understand
that if we just simply

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.350 align:middle line:10%
look at what's going
on in our lives

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.650 align:middle line:10%
from the people to the
pets to the children

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.790 align:middle line:10%
to the experiences, the
obstacles, and the challenges,

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.660 align:middle line:10%
they're all just
messages showing us

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.890 align:middle line:10%
who we are so that we can
grow and move beyond them.

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:23.950 align:middle line:10%
And that's how I began
the journey of discovering

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.062 align:middle line:10%
the messages show up everywhere.

00:04:26.062 --> 00:04:28.270 align:middle line:10%
>> LILOU: How can we not
interpret when something bad

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.810 align:middle line:10%
happens to us, like a big
challenge, how can we not say,

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.100 align:middle line:10%
I'm not good enough, I'm not
worth it, here we are again,

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.610 align:middle line:10%
this is not for me, this
is for those two ladies,

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.080 align:middle line:10%
this is not me here?

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.990 align:middle line:10%
>> SINGH: Yeah.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.610 align:middle line:10%
We're asking the
wrong questions.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.490 align:middle line:10%
Because usually when something
bad happens, Lilou, people go,

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.610 align:middle line:10%
why is this happening to me?

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.770 align:middle line:10%
Why did this take
place in my life?

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:49.920 align:middle line:10%
What did I do wrong?

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.980 align:middle line:10%
Instead of, where is that in me?

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.300 align:middle line:10%
Because if we say, where
is that challenge in me

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.540 align:middle line:10%
or where is that
terrorism in me or where

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.950 align:middle line:10%
is that idol that I like
in me, then all of a sudden

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.440 align:middle line:10%
we become at one with it
rather than that's that thing

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.640 align:middle line:10%
I didn't want to happen and I'm
over here trying to avoid it.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.310 align:middle line:90%
Instead, we merge with it.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And when we merge with it,
we discover our commonality,

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.710 align:middle line:84%
and then we find the gift
that's actually inside of it.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.590 align:middle line:84%
And it will be a
message and a gift.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:18.470 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:23.290 align:middle line:84%
It's hard when we see anger
in another one or criticism

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.020 align:middle line:90%
and to be with that negativity.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.352 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes a lot of us prefer
to escape or rage back.

00:05:29.352 --> 00:05:31.810 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: Well, then we're
going to stay in our victimhood.

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.518 align:middle line:84%
Because the easiest
thing to do right now

00:05:33.518 --> 00:05:35.640 align:middle line:84%
is to project onto
another person.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.160 align:middle line:84%
But if we can truly look at
everything as simply a message,

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.040 align:middle line:84%
then we're going to discover
that it's all actually us.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.390 align:middle line:84%
I tell people you're
not on a journey.

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:46.080 align:middle line:90%
You are the journey.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.630 align:middle line:90%
You're not in the world.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.950 align:middle line:10%
You are every piece and part
of the world showing up.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.150 align:middle line:10%
You are experience
experiencing itself,

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.500 align:middle line:10%
and everything outside of
you is you showing you you.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.560 align:middle line:10%
There really is
nothing out there.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.620 align:middle line:10%
As real as it feels and it
looks, there's nothing there.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:03.890 align:middle line:10%
There's only you.

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.230 align:middle line:10%
And you've created
this dynamic play

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:10.180 align:middle line:10%
to show you your full capacity,
from its dark to its light.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.485 align:middle line:10%
So when you embrace that,
that's enlightenment.

00:06:13.485 --> 00:06:16.050 align:middle line:10%
>> LILOU: Do you think we all
need to go through the dark

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:20.000 align:middle line:10%
night of the soul like you did
or the suffering to feel this

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.910 align:middle line:10%
enlightenment or to be
that connected to life?

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.500 align:middle line:10%
>> SINGH: I don't think we
have to, but I think we choose

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.510 align:middle line:10%
to because we love a good story.

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:30.500 align:middle line:10%
We're each a sacred--

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.709 align:middle line:10%
>> LILOU: You got a good one.

00:06:31.709 --> 00:06:33.124 align:middle line:10%
>> SINGH: I got a
really good one.

00:06:33.124 --> 00:06:34.680 align:middle line:10%
We are each a
sacred text walking.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.920 align:middle line:10%
We are no different
than any other holy book

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.300 align:middle line:10%
that has been written.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.060 align:middle line:10%
We are a sacred text, in that we
each possess pearls of wisdom.

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.370 align:middle line:10%
We also each possess story.

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.460 align:middle line:10%
And there's some stuff
that's been made up,

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.840 align:middle line:10%
because we're good at
making up some stuff,

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.910 align:middle line:10%
and that's what creates
the sacred story

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.600 align:middle line:10%
of the hero or the heroine.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.380 align:middle line:10%
And that's what we
really came here for.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.180 align:middle line:10%
We want to see
ourselves as ugly so

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.830 align:middle line:10%
that we can discover our beauty.

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.610 align:middle line:10%
We want to feel weak so
that we know our power.

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.680 align:middle line:10%
We can't know something
unless we know the opposite.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.340 align:middle line:10%
>> LILOU: So we're talking
here of also being vulnerable

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.320 align:middle line:10%
to what's so, what's happening,
even when we have those dark

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.810 align:middle line:10%
moments or the anger comes
up, being OK with that.

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:15.534 align:middle line:90%
Is that part of the practices?

00:07:15.534 --> 00:07:17.950 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: I think that's the
step into the golden age that

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:19.720 align:middle line:90%
has not been taken before.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:20.890 align:middle line:90%
We've been wearing masks.

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:22.560 align:middle line:84%
We've been trying to
run from our pain.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.800 align:middle line:84%
We've been trying to run
from the truth of all

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.720 align:middle line:84%
the negativity
that we've created

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.740 align:middle line:84%
or the lowness that we
have found ourselves in

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.957 align:middle line:84%
and trying to cover that
up with other things.

00:07:31.957 --> 00:07:33.540 align:middle line:84%
We've been trying
to fill ourselves up

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.940 align:middle line:84%
with everything outside of us
rather than diving into us.

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.320 align:middle line:10%
And if instead we
allow ourselves

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.290 align:middle line:10%
to understand that it's all
beautiful, that it's all here

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:45.750 align:middle line:10%
for the taking and the
celebration, that actually is

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:49.450 align:middle line:10%
those dark moments in
life that create us,

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:52.700 align:middle line:10%
that's where the ember, the
fire of the light starts,

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.350 align:middle line:10%
and that is where the contract
has been made so that we can

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.480 align:middle line:10%
create that beautiful
sacred story

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.200 align:middle line:10%
and then discover
that we are actually

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.660 align:middle line:10%
the divine presence walking.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.120 align:middle line:10%
Each and every one
of us is a piece

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:06.320 align:middle line:10%
of the divine that holds a
unique genius that is here

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.550 align:middle line:10%
to be expressed and experienced.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:12.540 align:middle line:10%
And when we have the courage
to dive into that unique genius

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:14.990 align:middle line:10%
and share it with the world,
like you do with all the work

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:15.910 align:middle line:10%
that you do--

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:16.350 align:middle line:10%
>> LILOU: Thank you.

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:17.990 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: --then we
ripple out in the world,

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:19.290 align:middle line:90%
and it affects other people.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:21.110 align:middle line:84%
But we have to do
it for us first,

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:22.570 align:middle line:90%
because we're the only one here.

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:24.747 align:middle line:90%
And only then can it ripple out.

00:08:24.747 --> 00:08:26.330 align:middle line:10%
>> LILOU: How do you
call that moment,

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.377 align:middle line:10%
that turning point or
that tipping point moment?

00:08:29.377 --> 00:08:30.710 align:middle line:10%
Is there such a thing, actually?

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:32.409 align:middle line:10%
Is it very--

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:35.360 align:middle line:10%
>> SINGH: A lot of writers talk
about things being a tipping

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.870 align:middle line:10%
point or a turning point.

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:39.530 align:middle line:84%
To me, that's still
putting it on the outside.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:42.190 align:middle line:84%
I see it as a churning
point, and that

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:43.450 align:middle line:90%
takes place on the inside.

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:45.050 align:middle line:84%
Just like milk
can become butter,

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:47.600 align:middle line:84%
it happens because of the
agitation and the churning that

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.480 align:middle line:84%
takes place, everything
that supposedly is going on

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.780 align:middle line:84%
in our world or in our lives is
actually that agitation place

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:58.180 align:middle line:84%
so that we start to realize
I feel tight in my skin,

00:08:58.180 --> 00:08:59.640 align:middle line:90%
I do feel uncomfortable.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.085 align:middle line:84%
There's something inside
of me that's constricting,

00:09:02.085 --> 00:09:03.820 align:middle line:84%
and it's not trying
to make me smaller.

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:06.860 align:middle line:84%
It trying to get me to realize
that there's something bigger

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:10.220 align:middle line:84%
inside of me that will no
longer fit in the identity, ego,

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:12.140 align:middle line:84%
and personality
that I've built up.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.420 align:middle line:84%
You can't keep
spirit in a bottle.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:15.750 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we each are.

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And when we step into the full
essence of the spiritual play

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.260 align:middle line:84%
that we are, then
all of a sudden

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.486 align:middle line:84%
we dive into the unknown self
rather than the known self.

00:09:24.486 --> 00:09:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And that makes
all the difference

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.480 align:middle line:84%
in the world in
terms of our bliss

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.490 align:middle line:90%
and our joy and our happiness.

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:32.410 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: When you say unknown,
that's really the journey that

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:37.340 align:middle line:84%
you're on now, not really
knowing and opening up yourself

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:38.547 align:middle line:90%
to this guidance?

00:09:38.547 --> 00:09:39.130 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: Yes.

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:42.170 align:middle line:84%
When I left my 18-year
arranged marriage a year

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:45.150 align:middle line:84%
and a half ago, I
realized who I was

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.360 align:middle line:84%
had taken me as
far as I could go.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.180 align:middle line:84%
I was almost in the same
place I was seven years ago,

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.180 align:middle line:84%
except seven years ago I was
on my prayer room floor broken,

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:55.610 align:middle line:84%
wounded, crying, and
shattered, having gone

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:57.840 align:middle line:84%
through tremendous
pain, betrayal,

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:01.330 align:middle line:84%
and trying to make people love
me that just didn't want to.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And so at this point in my
life, I realized I've grown.

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:05.000 align:middle line:90%
I've healed.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000 align:middle line:84%
I've created "11:11 Magazine"
and "11:11 Talk Radio,"

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.230 align:middle line:84%
I share gifts with
the world, and I'm

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:12.470 align:middle line:90%
very content and peaceful.

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:14.570 align:middle line:90%
But I write about the bliss.

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:16.240 align:middle line:84%
I write about if you
do what you love,

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.960 align:middle line:84%
the bliss follows,
the abundance follows,

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.720 align:middle line:84%
everything in your world is
the way it's supposed to be.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.082 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, where is that?

00:10:22.082 --> 00:10:23.290 align:middle line:90%
That hasn't shown up.

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:24.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy.

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:24.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm content.

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:26.720 align:middle line:84%
I could continue
my life this way.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.260 align:middle line:90%
But where's that bliss?

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.310 align:middle line:90%
I need to know where that is.

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And so my known self would
never figure that out.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.740 align:middle line:90%
I had to dive into the unknown.

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:37.960 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is people think
the unknown is the scary place

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.440 align:middle line:90%
that the boogieman lives.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.470 align:middle line:84%
They think something bad's
going to happen in that unknown.

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:44.730 align:middle line:84%
What they don't
realize is the unknown

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:48.120 align:middle line:84%
is our greater divine self that
rests outside of here, that

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.165 align:middle line:84%
actually conspires
on our behalf.

00:10:50.165 --> 00:10:54.730 align:middle line:84%
It is all of life conspiring to
give us exactly what we want,

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:57.087 align:middle line:84%
but we have to dive
into that unknown

00:10:57.087 --> 00:10:58.295 align:middle line:90%
to discover it for ourselves.

00:10:58.295 --> 00:10:59.010 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:10:59.010 --> 00:10:59.520 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: Yeah.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.880 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: We've been building
our life around security, huh?

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:02.630 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: Exactly.

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:03.910 align:middle line:90%
And it's hard to leave that.

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:06.500 align:middle line:84%
I left a marriage where there
was nothing but security.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.410 align:middle line:90%
I walked away from everything.

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that
the Rebel Road Tour

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.700 align:middle line:84%
that I'm on right now, which is
a one-woman show that I put on

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:16.000 align:middle line:84%
that I don't plan, that
nothing was planned,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.190 align:middle line:84%
nothing was controlled,
and I spontaneously show up

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:21.870 align:middle line:84%
and I sing, do humor, and speak,
things I've never done before

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:24.330 align:middle line:84%
because I've locked myself
in my home for 44 years

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:27.990 align:middle line:84%
as a shy hermit, the
reason that's so powerful

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:31.160 align:middle line:84%
is because I found
the fountain of youth.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.217 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Well, tell us.

00:11:32.217 --> 00:11:34.550 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: I actually look
younger today than I have ever

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:36.180 align:middle line:90%
looked in my entire life.

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's because I've
allowed myself to dive fully

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:43.130 align:middle line:84%
into a passion and
very OK understanding

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:45.270 align:middle line:84%
that I have no clue
what I'm doing.

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:48.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sitting here as a
teacher or a guru for anyone.

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be
a teacher or a guru.

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:52.690 align:middle line:84%
What I am sitting
here is as an example,

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:54.770 align:middle line:84%
and that's what the
world needs now,

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:57.570 align:middle line:84%
people willing to be
examples of courage that

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:00.380 align:middle line:84%
are willing to step out there
and be who they've never been

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:03.780 align:middle line:84%
so that they inspire themselves,
so that they enlighten

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:05.900 align:middle line:84%
themselves, so
that they discover

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:09.579 align:middle line:84%
what that little child within
them always wanted to do.

00:12:09.579 --> 00:12:11.120 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people come
up to me and I'm

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:14.730 align:middle line:84%
sure come up to you, Lilou,
and say, you have such courage.

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:17.200 align:middle line:84%
You have such courage
with what you do.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.760 align:middle line:84%
But what they
don't understand is

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.920 align:middle line:84%
courage is not the
opposite of fear.

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.740 align:middle line:84%
Courage is the
opposite of conformity.

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.790 align:middle line:84%
Too many people have conformed
to their lives, conformed

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:29.540 align:middle line:84%
to the restrictions that life
places on them or society

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.810 align:middle line:84%
tells them they have
to live as, and that's

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:33.180 align:middle line:90%
why they're not happy.

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:34.710 align:middle line:84%
They've settled,
and they're living

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:37.540 align:middle line:84%
with all the different excuses
that we make up in life that we

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.987 align:middle line:84%
don't even realize are the
excuses that keep us back.

00:12:39.987 --> 00:12:42.570 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: What was keeping you
back back then in your marriage

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:44.430 align:middle line:90%
and in your life?

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:46.850 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: I had some of the
excuses that most people have,

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:50.210 align:middle line:84%
things like I can't do that,
I'm a single mom with two kids.

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:52.830 align:middle line:84%
I can't do that, my
family won't understand.

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:54.530 align:middle line:84%
Now that I've left
this marriage,

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:56.050 align:middle line:90%
how am I going to do the money?

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:57.440 align:middle line:90%
I've got debt.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.890 align:middle line:90%
We make up all those things.

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:00.289 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how to speak.

00:13:00.289 --> 00:13:01.330 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how to sing.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:02.770 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how to do comedy.

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:05.330 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I'm not pretty enough,
smart enough, good enough.

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:06.370 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I'm too old.

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:07.600 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I'm too young.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.480 align:middle line:84%
These are all the
excuses we use just

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.980 align:middle line:84%
to not step fully into the
thing that we most want to do.

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.890 align:middle line:84%
But we don't realize
that we're keeping

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:19.300 align:middle line:84%
those paradigms in place
because we're not stepping out.

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.780 align:middle line:84%
If we would step
out, then life as we

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:23.440 align:middle line:84%
desire it would
actually show up.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.920 align:middle line:84%
And you're living proof of
that with what you do, yes?

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:30.150 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: It seems so real,
those money problems and all

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:32.420 align:middle line:90%
those excuses that we have.

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And trusting this
invisible, intangible thing

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:39.536 align:middle line:90%
that we can't see is a big step.

00:13:39.536 --> 00:13:40.660 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: It's a huge step.

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:42.730 align:middle line:84%
But we all say I
want the miracles.

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:44.170 align:middle line:90%
I want to believe in this.

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:46.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to set my intentions.

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:47.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do all of this.

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:52.010 align:middle line:84%
If instead you understood
you are gods walking,

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:55.330 align:middle line:84%
you are pieces of
the divine-- and what

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:58.802 align:middle line:84%
right do you have to hold
back the divine from fully

00:13:58.802 --> 00:13:59.760 align:middle line:90%
expressing through you?

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.370 align:middle line:90%
What right do any of us have?

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:03.640 align:middle line:84%
I think that's really
arrogant that we

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:07.740 align:middle line:84%
think we can decide
to not fully express,

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:09.780 align:middle line:84%
because that is what
is being asked of us.

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And then we want to understand
why marriages aren't working

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:15.620 align:middle line:84%
or why our jobs
are not fulfilling

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:18.060 align:middle line:84%
or why the economy and
the health care system

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.110 align:middle line:84%
and everything else
is breaking down.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:22.030 align:middle line:84%
It's because it's
trying to get you

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:24.750 align:middle line:84%
up and out of this conformity
that you've locked yourself

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:25.650 align:middle line:90%
into.

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:27.810 align:middle line:84%
Because life knows
you're more, and it's

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:29.890 align:middle line:84%
trying to get you to
see that you're more.

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:32.860 align:middle line:84%
But until you decide
I'm willing to step

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:35.400 align:middle line:84%
into it despite the
fear, I'm willing to step

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.660 align:middle line:84%
into it despite the excuses,
I'm willing to step into it

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:42.040 align:middle line:84%
to see if I truly can trust the
universe, you'll never know.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:43.415 align:middle line:84%
And what you're
going to discover

00:14:43.415 --> 00:14:45.250 align:middle line:84%
is the universe
has got your back.

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:47.750 align:middle line:84%
Every sign and
symbol will show up

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:49.830 align:middle line:90%
to keep guiding you on your way.

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:51.940 align:middle line:90%
But a conversation takes two.

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is
the universe sends us

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:57.220 align:middle line:84%
the signs and the symbols,
but then we say, um,

00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:00.242 align:middle line:84%
could you send me another symbol
so I can make sure I got it?

00:15:00.242 --> 00:15:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And then we get the next
symbol, and it's like,

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.100 align:middle line:90%
OK, send me one more.

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:04.560 align:middle line:84%
I need to get one
more symbol just

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.500 align:middle line:84%
to make sure I know
what you're telling me.

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:10.110 align:middle line:84%
If instead we would stop in the
moment that we get the symbol

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:11.710 align:middle line:84%
and close our eyes
and take a breath

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:14.640 align:middle line:84%
and see what we're really
thinking about in that moment

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.220 align:middle line:84%
and follow our heart
as opposed to our head,

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:20.700 align:middle line:84%
step out of logicalness,
step out of practicality,

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:23.890 align:middle line:84%
follow the heart, that
is the communication back

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:27.230 align:middle line:84%
in conversation that lets
the universe know to send you

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:29.510 align:middle line:84%
the next symbol, the next
sign, the next doorway,

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:31.110 align:middle line:90%
the next opportunity.

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:32.710 align:middle line:90%
And then it will send you those.

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And then you are to take
another step, large or small,

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:38.280 align:middle line:84%
but some step to
be a conversation.

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.880 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise there's only
one person talking or one

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.720 align:middle line:84%
being talking, and
that's the universe.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.130 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:45.710 align:middle line:10%
That fear, though,
sometimes it's

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:49.300 align:middle line:10%
difficult to know the difference
between the fear and the heart

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:51.420 align:middle line:10%
talking or the
intuition and all that.

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:52.690 align:middle line:10%
How do you know?

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:55.950 align:middle line:10%
Because we can feel
guilty or this and that.

00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:58.100 align:middle line:10%
Some things come up.

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:00.770 align:middle line:10%
>> SINGH: I tell people if
you truly want to know what

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:04.100 align:middle line:10%
the truth is, every time you
have to have a discussion with

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:06.960 align:middle line:10%
yourself or go into the
mind about something,

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.660 align:middle line:10%
if you will disconnect the
brain by closing your eyes,

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:12.730 align:middle line:10%
take a deep breath, and then
ask that question to yourself,

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:15.630 align:middle line:10%
and the very first answer that
comes to mind is the truth

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:16.170 align:middle line:10%
of you.

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:17.360 align:middle line:90%
It will always happen.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.290 align:middle line:84%
It will never fail
you, because you

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:21.230 align:middle line:84%
have an inherent
wisdom within you.

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:22.860 align:middle line:90%
We all have that.

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:26.390 align:middle line:84%
The problem is we're walking
around as talking heads,

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:28.280 align:middle line:84%
and we need to drop
from here down.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.450 align:middle line:84%
If we close our eyes,
close off the brain,

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:32.390 align:middle line:84%
and listen to the
heart and the gut,

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:34.560 align:middle line:84%
we're going to get
every answer we want.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And then the
universe will supply

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.850 align:middle line:84%
the responses to
open those doors.

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:40.860 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen
that in our lives.

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:43.450 align:middle line:84%
We've each leapt out
on full faith and trust

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:46.740 align:middle line:84%
to know that I don't have
everything I need to do this,

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:49.750 align:middle line:84%
but there's a calling inside
of me that will not stop,

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:51.760 align:middle line:90%
and I'm going to do this anyway.

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.255 align:middle line:84%
And let me let the
universe help me.

00:16:54.255 --> 00:16:56.370 align:middle line:84%
Let me let the
universe assist me.

00:16:56.370 --> 00:17:00.940 align:middle line:84%
This is a time about allowing,
not willing, not trying,

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:02.130 align:middle line:90%
not toiling.

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:06.880 align:middle line:84%
This is all about now allowing
the universe to fully unfold.

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:10.260 align:middle line:84%
And I think for most of us we've
been trying to drive the car,

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.790 align:middle line:84%
and we've told the
universe, source, or God

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:15.599 align:middle line:84%
to sit in the passenger seat
and telling it where to go.

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:18.246 align:middle line:84%
Instead, we need to move over
and let the universe drive.

00:17:18.246 --> 00:17:20.579 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Even though if it
feels like we're blindfolded

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:23.000 align:middle line:90%
and can't see anything?

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.379 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: We're blind anyway.

00:17:24.379 --> 00:17:25.369 align:middle line:90%
We're blind anyway.

00:17:25.369 --> 00:17:28.540 align:middle line:84%
We're all blind, dumb, and deaf
as we walk through this life.

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:30.650 align:middle line:84%
That's why we have no
idea what we're doing.

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:33.710 align:middle line:84%
So if we're already
that, then we

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:37.250 align:middle line:90%
can't worry about messing up.

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
the biggest thing.

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:42.420 align:middle line:84%
People are too concerned
about making a mistake.

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:44.220 align:middle line:90%
What if there are no mistakes?

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:45.860 align:middle line:90%
What if there's no wrong turns?

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:48.130 align:middle line:84%
What if you can't
possibly do it wrong

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:50.900 align:middle line:84%
but every single step,
regardless of your choice,

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:53.230 align:middle line:84%
actually takes you
to exactly where you

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:56.870 align:middle line:84%
need to go for either the
next training or the purpose

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:58.380 align:middle line:90%
that you were intended to be?

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And there really is only
one purpose in life,

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:04.760 align:middle line:84%
and that is to have
experience experience itself.

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:06.660 align:middle line:84%
That is the only
purpose for all of us,

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:11.100 align:middle line:84%
to be constant creative capacity
and to live as children.

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.160 align:middle line:84%
We've forgotten
how children are.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's what your journey to
enlightenment really focuses on

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:19.970 align:middle line:84%
is teaching us how to play
and go back into that essence

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:22.720 align:middle line:84%
that children have, because
they're natural manifestors.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.910 align:middle line:90%
They live in the now.

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:25.497 align:middle line:90%
They know how to do that.

00:18:25.497 --> 00:18:26.330 align:middle line:90%
And we've forgotten.

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:28.150 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:30.840 align:middle line:90%
My goodness.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:35.210 align:middle line:84%
Is there practical things
that we can do, for you, even,

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:36.510 align:middle line:90%
about healing ourselves?

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:37.945 align:middle line:90%
Is there some practice to heal?

00:18:37.945 --> 00:18:41.670 align:middle line:84%
Or is it just really just
continuing to remember this

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:43.507 align:middle line:90%
and to trust, trust, trust?

00:18:43.507 --> 00:18:45.840 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: We talked about the
fountain of youth earlier.

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:50.597 align:middle line:84%
And I really see myself, I
see you, as a creative rebel.

00:18:50.597 --> 00:18:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's why this is
called the Rebel Road

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:54.280 align:middle line:90%
tour that I'm on this year.

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:56.770 align:middle line:84%
The creative rebel
fully understands

00:18:56.770 --> 00:19:00.100 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing to save, fix,
or heal on the outside, not one

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:00.690 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:02.148 align:middle line:84%
None of us are
supposed to do that.

00:19:02.148 --> 00:19:04.790 align:middle line:84%
Because it's all divine,
so it can heal itself.

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:06.400 align:middle line:84%
There's also nothing
to save, fix,

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:09.010 align:middle line:90%
or heal in here for any of us.

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:10.200 align:middle line:90%
It's all divine.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.040 align:middle line:90%
It can shift at any moment.

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:15.870 align:middle line:84%
What we are to do is to dive
into our hearts and our guts

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:18.100 align:middle line:84%
and really tap into that
dream that we've always

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:20.460 align:middle line:84%
wanted that we've never
allowed ourselves.

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And when we do that, the
unique genius bubbles up

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:26.160 align:middle line:84%
from each one of us,
and that inspiration

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:29.170 align:middle line:84%
is going to solve the pains
and the ills of the world,

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:31.010 align:middle line:84%
because it's going
to be inspired,

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:32.510 align:middle line:84%
rather than what
we're trying to do,

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:33.850 align:middle line:90%
which is think up the solutions.

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:36.030 align:middle line:84%
We can't think our
way out of this,

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:38.150 align:middle line:84%
because we thought
our way into it.

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:39.530 align:middle line:90%
But we can inspire.

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:42.490 align:middle line:84%
We can breathe life into
ourselves and, in turn,

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:44.700 align:middle line:84%
bring life into the
world around us.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's going
to create the change.

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:48.855 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Tell us
about this number 11.

00:19:48.855 --> 00:19:49.630 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: Yes.

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: What is
this about for you?

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:54.880 align:middle line:84%
Because I love-- I don't
know you-- and please,

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:57.460 align:middle line:84%
there is underneath
comments, and we

00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:59.880 align:middle line:84%
can have these conversations
about the number 11.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And this conversation
is awesome.

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:03.620 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:08.377 align:middle line:84%
I just keep on seeing the
3/11, 9/11, 11/11 everywhere.

00:20:08.377 --> 00:20:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: This is how I
discovered that there were

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:11.620 align:middle line:90%
conversations.

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:13.650 align:middle line:84%
When I was at my
point seven years ago

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:16.580 align:middle line:84%
where life completely shattered,
everything broke apart,

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:19.900 align:middle line:84%
and I had my break down so
that life could break through,

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:21.970 align:middle line:84%
the universe started
sending me 11's, 1:11's

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:24.851 align:middle line:84%
and 11:11's 25 to
30 times a day.

00:20:24.851 --> 00:20:26.100 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what they meant.

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:27.516 align:middle line:84%
They just showed
up on everything,

00:20:27.516 --> 00:20:29.670 align:middle line:84%
from trains and
bulldozers and buses

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:33.470 align:middle line:84%
to store receipts, addresses,
license plates, everything.

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:35.721 align:middle line:84%
And by the end of the fourth
week, I got really angry,

00:20:35.721 --> 00:20:38.178 align:middle line:84%
and I said, either tell me what
you want with these numbers

00:20:38.178 --> 00:20:39.030 align:middle line:90%
or make them stop.

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the first issue
of "11:11 Magazine" downloaded.

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:45.690 align:middle line:84%
That's when I was told to
create it, to do this now.

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:47.540 align:middle line:84%
You will heal and
others will heal.

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:52.279 align:middle line:84%
But I also got the download that
11 is the gateway of mastery

00:20:52.279 --> 00:20:53.820 align:middle line:84%
and that there are
millions of people

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:55.250 align:middle line:90%
around the world that see it.

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And it is a symbol
that's showing up

00:20:56.750 --> 00:21:00.190 align:middle line:84%
to usher us to understand
that there's not just physical

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:03.680 align:middle line:84%
but there's spiritual, to move
out of negative into positive,

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:07.490 align:middle line:84%
to understand that there's much
more to this world that is real

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:12.180 align:middle line:84%
that is actually beyond what
we see that is the illusion.

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:16.840 align:middle line:84%
And so as I began saying my
yes to doing this magazine,

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:18.930 align:middle line:84%
I started to realize
there are many other ways

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:20.770 align:middle line:90%
that the universe speaks to us.

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:23.640 align:middle line:84%
See, we don't realize that
our pets and their ailments

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:26.730 align:middle line:84%
are actually trying to show us
where we've blocked ourselves

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:27.860 align:middle line:90%
in our own thinking.

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:31.040 align:middle line:84%
Our children go through
specific experiences

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:33.340 align:middle line:84%
in their lives at the
exact age that we're

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:36.210 align:middle line:84%
supposed to go back and look
at our own life for that very

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:39.030 align:middle line:84%
same emotional
issue to clear it.

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:41.330 align:middle line:84%
That's how they show up
to teach us something.

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:44.920 align:middle line:84%
Our homes, our cars, they
are each us showing us

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:47.130 align:middle line:84%
something when something
happens to them.

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And if we start to ask
those questions that I

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.330 align:middle line:84%
talk about in "Conversations
with the Universe,"

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:54.460 align:middle line:84%
where is that in me, what
is this trying to show me

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:57.140 align:middle line:84%
about me, what is
the gift inside of me

00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:59.790 align:middle line:84%
that is trying to be released
that has been dormant,

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:02.910 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden we clean and
clear this inner landscape

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:05.340 align:middle line:84%
and shift our outer
landscape and discover

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:06.880 align:middle line:90%
more of our divine presence.

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we will move
more and more into the presence

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:11.990 align:middle line:84%
of now where we're not
living in the future,

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:14.330 align:middle line:84%
we're not living in the
past, we rid ourselves

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:16.600 align:middle line:84%
of all fear and
anxiety and depression,

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.670 align:middle line:84%
and we truly are
present in the moment.

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:22.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we get the
world to truly show up and work

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:24.691 align:middle line:84%
on our behalf and
things line up.

00:22:24.691 --> 00:22:28.830 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: So in summary, when
we see on the clock this number

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:31.020 align:middle line:84%
11, what should we
say to ourselves?

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:32.950 align:middle line:84%
Or what is the
opportunity right there?

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:34.910 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: To stop that
second, close your eyes,

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:35.727 align:middle line:90%
take a breath--

00:22:35.727 --> 00:22:37.060 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Even if we're driving?

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:37.870 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: Not if you're driving.

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:38.870 align:middle line:90%
Just settle into your heart.

00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:39.300 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: It happens, no?

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:39.860 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: It does.

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:42.040 align:middle line:84%
Settle into your heart, and
look at what you're just

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.679 align:middle line:90%
thinking about in that moment.

00:22:43.679 --> 00:22:45.220 align:middle line:84%
Because the universe
is trying to let

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:47.380 align:middle line:84%
you know that thought
is an important thought,

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:49.970 align:middle line:84%
but I want you to follow
your heart, not your head.

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:53.454 align:middle line:84%
I'd also like to add that if
you're not seeing the 11's

00:22:53.454 --> 00:22:54.745 align:middle line:90%
there's nothing wrong with you.

00:22:54.745 --> 00:22:56.120 align:middle line:84%
You might start after
this interview--

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:57.130 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Thank you
for adding that.

00:22:57.130 --> 00:22:59.310 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: --because it tends
to happen that after you hear

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:00.710 align:middle line:90%
about it, you start seeing it.

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:03.430 align:middle line:84%
But if you're not seeing it,
you are seeing something.

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:04.790 align:middle line:90%
And that's the key.

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:06.850 align:middle line:84%
There's messages in
all kinds of ways,

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:08.900 align:middle line:84%
and we all have our
own individual dialect

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:10.620 align:middle line:90%
that we can start to learn.

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:12.270 align:middle line:84%
But first we have
to become aware

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:14.890 align:middle line:84%
that the universe is
actually speaking to us,

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:17.940 align:middle line:84%
that we are each special
enough that the universe would

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:21.880 align:middle line:84%
speak directly to
each one of us.

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:27.290 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: There is
no intention to say?

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:30.060 align:middle line:90%
Do you sometimes ask for things?

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:32.300 align:middle line:90%
Do you just cruise?

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:34.490 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: I always ask out loud.

00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And I tell people when I
show up in front of them

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:38.950 align:middle line:84%
that I'm actually a
conversation with the universe

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:40.440 align:middle line:90%
in front of you right now.

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.200 align:middle line:84%
My name's Simran, and
its deepest meaning

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.830 align:middle line:84%
means from the
lips of the divine

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:46.390 align:middle line:90%
to the ears of the divine.

00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:49.580 align:middle line:84%
From the lips of the divine
to the ears of the divine.

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:53.030 align:middle line:84%
From the lips of the divine
to the ears of the divine.

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:55.500 align:middle line:84%
Because we are each
the divine walking.

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And so for something to
actually manifest or occur,

00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:59.390 align:middle line:90%
we have to speak it.

00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:01.810 align:middle line:84%
We have to put the
energy out there.

00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:04.070 align:middle line:84%
What we end up doing
is we speak our ills.

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:05.060 align:middle line:90%
We speak our doubts.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:06.360 align:middle line:90%
We speak our pains.

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.272 align:middle line:84%
But how many of us
speak our dreams?

00:24:08.272 --> 00:24:09.230 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: We curse too.

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:09.855 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: Yeah.

00:24:09.855 --> 00:24:12.430 align:middle line:84%
How many of us say, I want to
be this, I want to do this,

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:14.050 align:middle line:90%
and we speak it out loud?

00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:15.880 align:middle line:84%
Because the only way
the divine of you

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.820 align:middle line:84%
can hear what you want
is if you speak it.

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And it has to be heard
by you because you

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:22.460 align:middle line:90%
are the divine walking.

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's probably the hardest
concept for people to get

00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:27.530 align:middle line:90%
is that they are actually God.

00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:30.100 align:middle line:84%
They are actually the
universe or source.

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:31.930 align:middle line:84%
So once you can
get to that place

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:35.430 align:middle line:84%
where you realize it's not
just a spark in my heart,

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:38.030 align:middle line:84%
I am actually that,
you are actually

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:40.640 align:middle line:84%
that, every person
I meet is actually

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:42.930 align:middle line:84%
that, then all of
a sudden we start

00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:45.730 align:middle line:84%
to realize why compassion
and empathy and oneness start

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:46.690 align:middle line:90%
to form.

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:48.930 align:middle line:84%
Because how can
you do that to God

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:52.622 align:middle line:84%
when you originally would have
thought that just a person?

00:24:52.622 --> 00:24:54.200 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: It's so beautiful.

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.826 align:middle line:84%
And as children
are passing by here

00:24:56.826 --> 00:24:58.450 align:middle line:84%
because we're really
close to the beach

00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:00.150 align:middle line:84%
and there is Ocean
Drive, they're

00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:03.520 align:middle line:90%
just smiling and so cute.

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:04.560 align:middle line:90%
They are it, huh?

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.197 align:middle line:84%
So it's going back
to this playfulness.

00:25:06.197 --> 00:25:06.780 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: Yes.

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:07.280 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.810 align:middle line:84%
In "Your Journey
to Enlightenment,"

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:11.490 align:middle line:84%
I talk about how first
we have to really get

00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:14.480 align:middle line:84%
to radical honesty about the way
we've put ourselves in bondage

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:16.920 align:middle line:84%
and servitude and how
we've replicated society

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:19.340 align:middle line:84%
and become the Stepford
human, and then I

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:22.930 align:middle line:84%
moved into the invocations
and invitations to dive

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:24.346 align:middle line:90%
back into the child.

00:25:24.346 --> 00:25:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing
I've discovered

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.560 align:middle line:84%
with my own 3-year-old
and 12-year-old,

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:29.840 align:middle line:84%
but specifically my
3-year-old right now,

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:34.110 align:middle line:84%
is they're so present to their
feeling and their expression.

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:36.230 align:middle line:84%
When you see a
child, they can be

00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:39.550 align:middle line:84%
in a full-out tantrum for two
or three minutes, and then

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:41.960 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden an
airplane will fly by

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:44.450 align:middle line:84%
and they will be up
cruising the grounds

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:46.660 align:middle line:84%
like an airplane
giggling and laughing.

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:48.650 align:middle line:84%
They don't carry
anything with them.

00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:50.350 align:middle line:84%
If they're on a
playground, they're

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:53.590 align:middle line:84%
not sliding down the slide
fully immersed in the slide

00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:55.845 align:middle line:84%
and then see the merry-go-round
and pick up the slide

00:25:55.845 --> 00:25:57.220 align:middle line:84%
and put it on
their back and then

00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:58.830 align:middle line:90%
go play on the merry-go-round.

00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:00.260 align:middle line:90%
But that's what we do.

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:01.954 align:middle line:84%
We have an
experience, and rather

00:26:01.954 --> 00:26:04.120 align:middle line:84%
than leaving the experience,
feeling the experience,

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:06.480 align:middle line:84%
and moving on to the next
one, we pick it up and put it

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:09.045 align:middle line:84%
on our backs and we carry
it to the next thing.

00:26:09.045 --> 00:26:10.670 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
things that children

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:12.940 align:middle line:84%
come in teaching us
right from the beginning,

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:15.170 align:middle line:84%
and those are the essences
that I talk about.

00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:18.120 align:middle line:10%
If we just tap into
those 12 essences,

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:21.440 align:middle line:10%
we return to the child,
we return to play,

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.240 align:middle line:10%
we return to lightening up.

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:26.150 align:middle line:10%
We have forgotten who
we are because we've

00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:27.310 align:middle line:10%
gotten too serious.

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:29.630 align:middle line:10%
We've gotten way too serious
about life and everything

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:30.130 align:middle line:10%
in life.

00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:33.270 align:middle line:10%
Even our spirituality, we've
made it way too serious.

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:35.430 align:middle line:10%
And if we can
understand that there's

00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:38.690 align:middle line:10%
a seventh sense
beyond intuition,

00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:40.291 align:middle line:10%
it is the sense
of humor, and that

00:26:40.291 --> 00:26:41.915 align:middle line:10%
is the one that leads
to enlightenment.

00:26:41.915 --> 00:26:42.970 align:middle line:10%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:43.788 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: Yeah.

00:26:43.788 --> 00:26:45.246 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: You're
Indian originally.

00:26:45.246 --> 00:26:46.200 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: Yes.

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:49.350 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: I'm sure some of
us and I'm thinking, yeah,

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:49.885 align:middle line:90%
it's easy.

00:26:49.885 --> 00:26:51.250 align:middle line:90%
You were born in this.

00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:52.962 align:middle line:90%
You've got that.

00:26:52.962 --> 00:26:54.670 align:middle line:84%
But you were not always
like this, right?

00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:57.947 align:middle line:84%
You grew up in different
states in the United States--

00:26:57.947 --> 00:26:58.530 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: Yes.

00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:01.470 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: --and you
really went the other way,

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:04.900 align:middle line:84%
like workaholic and
this and that, right?

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:07.450 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: Oh, the universe
has a huge sense of humor.

00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:09.720 align:middle line:84%
It really knows how to
create a practical joke.

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:13.390 align:middle line:84%
I was planted in the Bible Belt
South, Indian woman preaching

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:15.450 align:middle line:84%
spirituality in the
Bible Belt South.

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:18.450 align:middle line:84%
What's a bigger joke
than that, right?

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:20.230 align:middle line:84%
But I did all the
things that most of us

00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:24.760 align:middle line:84%
do, people please, try to
numb out in some sort of way.

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:27.340 align:middle line:84%
Workaholism was my
way to numb out.

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there's one
commonality between all of us.

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:34.330 align:middle line:84%
None of us want to feel pain,
and we each want to be loved.

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:35.940 align:middle line:84%
But until we get
to the place where

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:38.430 align:middle line:84%
we're fully able to
give love to ourselves,

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:40.390 align:middle line:84%
we'll keep creating
the place that we

00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:41.890 align:middle line:90%
become the walking dead.

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And life has to
crash at some point,

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:45.770 align:middle line:90%
if that's the road were on.

00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:47.140 align:middle line:90%
But that too is light.

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:48.730 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't
see light in light.

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:50.420 align:middle line:90%
You have to have the dark.

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And so when that happens,
we then start the rise.

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And we rise into
love in a way where

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:58.420 align:middle line:84%
we start to discover
how to treat ourselves,

00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:01.337 align:middle line:84%
how to carry ourselves,
how to honor ourselves.

00:28:01.337 --> 00:28:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens,
the rest of the world

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:04.724 align:middle line:90%
starts to do the same.

00:28:04.724 --> 00:28:07.140 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: From the moment you
made that decision and there

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:12.930 align:middle line:84%
was this change and the prayer
and the signs of the 11's, did

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:14.770 align:middle line:90%
it evolve?

00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:17.970 align:middle line:84%
How did it evolve, this
journey, from really starting

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:20.205 align:middle line:84%
to see those symbols
to where you are now?

00:28:20.205 --> 00:28:22.890 align:middle line:90%


00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:25.830 align:middle line:84%
You can tell us, if you
want, where you're at now.

00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:30.810 align:middle line:84%
It's quite an example of how to
just trust and be with what's

00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:33.270 align:middle line:90%
so and all is well, you know?

00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:33.970 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: Yes.

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:37.850 align:middle line:84%
When I had my initial time
on my prayer room floor,

00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:40.120 align:middle line:84%
I realized that
something had to change.

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:42.750 align:middle line:84%
And the common denominator in
my life where all the pain was

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:43.870 align:middle line:90%
was me.

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:45.910 align:middle line:84%
So I was the one
that had to shift.

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And the five questions that
I stipulate in "Conversations

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:52.320 align:middle line:84%
with the Universe" are how
I began to live my life.

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.820 align:middle line:84%
Every single thing that
showed up in my world,

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:57.110 align:middle line:84%
I just chose to
believe that's me.

00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:57.690 align:middle line:90%
That's me.

00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:00.250 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's good,
bad, or ugly, it's me.

00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:02.300 align:middle line:84%
So if it's me,
where is it in here?

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:06.130 align:middle line:84%
And until I find how I do that
to myself or someone else,

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:08.350 align:middle line:84%
I will not stop this
cleaning and clearing.

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And over the course
of my life, I

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:13.550 align:middle line:84%
began cleaning so much
of my interior landscape

00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:15.510 align:middle line:84%
that doors just
opened automatically,

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:17.700 align:middle line:84%
things happened
automatically, because that's

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:19.340 align:middle line:90%
the magical way of the universe.

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:23.780 align:middle line:84%
The more we align to our truth,
the more truth gives us back.

00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:27.650 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: When you say
clearing, you clear it?

00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:28.640 align:middle line:90%
You speak out?

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.750 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: Yes, feeling
it, mostly feeling it.

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:34.010 align:middle line:84%
For me, I was so numbed out
I wouldn't feel anything.

00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:37.320 align:middle line:84%
I had not ever cried in my
life until I was 38 years old.

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:39.190 align:middle line:84%
That was the first
time I ever cried.

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to get in touch
with what emotion even was,

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:44.280 align:middle line:90%
and it took time.

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:47.570 align:middle line:84%
And I allowed myself that
time to dive into the shadows,

00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:51.150 align:middle line:84%
to dive into the pain, to
really sit and immerse in that.

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:54.480 align:middle line:84%
Because children understand
that that's beautiful too.

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:57.510 align:middle line:84%
They full-out experience
it, but we don't.

00:29:57.510 --> 00:30:00.440 align:middle line:84%
So I decided I'm going to
full-out experience all of it.

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:03.350 align:middle line:84%
Because the only way it can get
out of you is to experience it.

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:06.000 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise we suppress it
and push it back down.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And then it stays with us,
recreating reincarnations

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:12.040 align:middle line:84%
of the same experiences
again and again and again.

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.840 align:middle line:90%
And so that's what I did.

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And when I finally got the
courage to leave my marriage

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:20.920 align:middle line:84%
and this Rebel Road idea
came, the spontaneity

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:24.780 align:middle line:84%
of getting on stage not
having any clue what I'm doing

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:28.740 align:middle line:84%
and not being perfect-- the
very first show that I went to

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:31.935 align:middle line:84%
in DC, I forgot the
verses of two songs.

00:30:31.935 --> 00:30:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And I just stood there
and let the music play

00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:35.518 align:middle line:84%
and told the audience
I've just forgotten

00:30:35.518 --> 00:30:38.790 align:middle line:84%
the verses of two songs, because
that was all I knew how to do.

00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:42.040 align:middle line:84%
It was me being intimate and
vulnerable and authentic.

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
that show, five people

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:45.530 align:middle line:84%
came up and said the
same thing to me.

00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:48.490 align:middle line:84%
But one in particular is the
one that I remember the most.

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:50.410 align:middle line:84%
She was an opera
singer, and she had

00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:52.820 align:middle line:84%
been invited to tour the
world four times by four

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:54.760 align:middle line:84%
different companies,
and she turned them

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.600 align:middle line:90%
down each and every time.

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I want to thank
you for what you're doing.

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:02.000 align:middle line:84%
It has inspired me greatly,
because my greatest fear

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.460 align:middle line:84%
was that I would
forget the words.

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And you've just shown
me how to do that.

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:08.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go be an opera
singer and tour the world.

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And I have had more stories
of different situations

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:14.120 align:middle line:84%
because I was willing to be
real and willing to show people

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:15.860 align:middle line:84%
we're not supposed
to have it perfect.

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:17.370 align:middle line:84%
I didn't need to
know how to sing,

00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:19.350 align:middle line:84%
because by the end
of 66 shows, I'd

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:20.700 align:middle line:90%
figure out how to sing, right?

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:23.440 align:middle line:84%
It's experience
experiencing itself.

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:26.240 align:middle line:84%
So get off this perfection
bandwagon or thinking

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:28.330 align:middle line:84%
that you have to get it
right before you start.

00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:30.140 align:middle line:90%
I believe in quality.

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:32.030 align:middle line:84%
But right now we
are in an age that

00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:35.010 align:middle line:84%
is more about experience
and expression.

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:37.200 align:middle line:84%
Before that, the age
was not about that.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.130 align:middle line:84%
It was about
accomplishment, attainment.

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:41.310 align:middle line:90%
We are now about experience.

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:43.240 align:middle line:90%
And experience has no agenda.

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.600 align:middle line:90%
It has no outcome.

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:46.580 align:middle line:84%
It's not about filling
up a bunch of seats,

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:49.520 align:middle line:84%
selling a bunch of products,
or filling up a bank account.

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:53.930 align:middle line:84%
Experience is about filling you
up, standing in your own seat,

00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:57.240 align:middle line:84%
and finding the abundance and
wealth that you possess inside.

00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.500 align:middle line:90%
That's where we are now.

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.610 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:06.570 align:middle line:84%
You have to tell us about the RV
story and the graphic designer

00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:07.836 align:middle line:90%
before that--

00:32:07.836 --> 00:32:09.450 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: Yes.

00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:13.410 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: --and also that you
decided to turn off the prices

00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:14.810 align:middle line:90%
on your website.

00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:18.520 align:middle line:84%
Those are really big
bold stories, three

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:21.190 align:middle line:84%
beautiful examples, I think,
and you probably have some more,

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:22.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure.

00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:25.500 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: I have six months'
worth of full-out sign symbol

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:27.840 align:middle line:84%
stories that I've been
creating a show with.

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And I have received
guidance lately

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:31.130 align:middle line:90%
to change how I do things.

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:32.920 align:middle line:84%
I've always given
"11:11 Magazine" away

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:34.790 align:middle line:84%
and the radio show
away, but now I'm

00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:38.470 align:middle line:84%
being guided to give it all
away in a way that people choose

00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:40.350 align:middle line:84%
the value of it,
rather than me saying,

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:41.910 align:middle line:84%
this is how much
it's going to be.

00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:44.770 align:middle line:84%
It's to help shift this
economic paradigm that we're in,

00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:47.120 align:middle line:84%
to start to say there are
other forms of exchange

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.330 align:middle line:84%
and there are new ways
for us to do things,

00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:50.740 align:middle line:84%
but we each have
to take the step

00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:53.750 align:middle line:84%
of being that example for
the world to really change.

00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:57.469 align:middle line:84%
As I began this Rebel Road
tour, I got the vision

00:32:57.469 --> 00:32:59.010 align:middle line:84%
that everything was
going to show up,

00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:01.970 align:middle line:84%
the RV, that I would be
invited to 66 cities,

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:05.320 align:middle line:84%
that I was not to plan it, to
control it, to do anything.

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:08.540 align:middle line:84%
And three weeks before I
was to leave in September,

00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:10.010 align:middle line:90%
an RV appeared.

00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:12.560 align:middle line:84%
One week before I was
supposed to leave we

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:15.455 align:middle line:84%
already had 42 places
that had invited me.

00:33:15.455 --> 00:33:16.080 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:18.405 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to say
this is with two children.

00:33:18.405 --> 00:33:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: I have two children,
a 3-year-old and a 12-year-old.

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:21.490 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Single mom.

00:33:21.490 --> 00:33:22.290 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: Yes.

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:23.900 align:middle line:84%
We have been in a
little Petri dish

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:28.550 align:middle line:84%
in this 1991 refurbished RV
that is 31 foot by 7 foot.

00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:30.690 align:middle line:84%
There's been five of
us living in there.

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And talk about a Petri dish
to discover relationship

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:36.500 align:middle line:84%
and to discover how
we interact truly.

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:38.170 align:middle line:90%
But isn't that what life is?

00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:39.670 align:middle line:84%
We're not supposed
to run from that.

00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:41.470 align:middle line:84%
We're supposed to dive
into it, because that's

00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:43.080 align:middle line:84%
where you become
self-realized, where

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:44.910 align:middle line:84%
you see when your
shadows are triggered.

00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing what you
discover about yourself

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:49.350 align:middle line:90%
when you're in small quarters.

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing to discover
how little we really need,

00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:54.240 align:middle line:90%
how little.

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.685 align:middle line:84%
We live in such excess,
and we don't need to.

00:33:56.685 --> 00:33:57.310 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:33:57.310 --> 00:33:59.520 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: And so there've
been things like that.

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:01.480 align:middle line:84%
But I will share one
really profound story,

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:02.620 align:middle line:90%
just to show people--

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:06.220 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: As we have the
Miami music in the background.

00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:07.696 align:middle line:90%
And they're dancing.

00:34:07.696 --> 00:34:09.480 align:middle line:84%
I wish I could turn
the camera around.

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:10.980 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: Because
that's who we are,

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:14.920 align:middle line:84%
signs and symbols showing
up right now, right?

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:19.300 align:middle line:84%
But as I was on the road, when
we just left South Carolina,

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:22.070 align:middle line:84%
we got within two hours, and
I had to fill up with gas.

00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:24.199 align:middle line:84%
And the RV wouldn't
crank back up,

00:34:24.199 --> 00:34:25.792 align:middle line:90%
and so I had to be jump-started.

00:34:25.792 --> 00:34:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And we got to the next
campground to spend the night.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.800 align:middle line:84%
The next morning
we were to leave,

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:31.530 align:middle line:90%
and the RV wouldn't start again.

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:34.460 align:middle line:84%
So we had to go to a
station to get it worked on.

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:37.030 align:middle line:84%
While I was there, the
gentleman there in Fayetteville,

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:39.730 align:middle line:84%
North Carolina, the
largest murder capital

00:34:39.730 --> 00:34:41.560 align:middle line:84%
in the United States
right now, wanted

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:43.070 align:middle line:84%
to know what the
word rebel meant.

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:44.929 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
question that word.

00:34:44.929 --> 00:34:46.820 align:middle line:84%
And so I explained
to them about there

00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:48.770 align:middle line:84%
being no fight outside,
no fight inside.

00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:50.739 align:middle line:84%
This is about peace,
love, and oneness.

00:34:50.739 --> 00:34:52.719 align:middle line:84%
And they fixed my
RV and found out

00:34:52.719 --> 00:34:54.989 align:middle line:84%
it was a piece
called the solenoid.

00:34:54.989 --> 00:34:58.040 align:middle line:84%
The solenoid is a communication
box between the ignition

00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.126 align:middle line:84%
and the engine of
a vehicle, so it

00:35:00.126 --> 00:35:02.000 align:middle line:84%
tells the engine when
you've inserted the key

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.125 align:middle line:90%
and you've cranked it up.

00:35:03.125 --> 00:35:05.770 align:middle line:84%
I was expecting a
$600 or $700 bill.

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:07.920 align:middle line:84%
It was not exactly how I
wanted to start this tour,

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:09.630 align:middle line:90%
but it was what it was.

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:12.760 align:middle line:84%
And so when they finished,
the mechanic came to the door

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:16.230 align:middle line:84%
and he handed me $200
and a business card.

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:18.090 align:middle line:84%
And he said, the person
you were speaking

00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:20.940 align:middle line:84%
to about the word rebel was the
owner of this establishment.

00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:23.110 align:middle line:84%
He's completely inspired
by what you're doing.

00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:25.250 align:middle line:84%
He's waiving all
charges for fixing this.

00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:28.420 align:middle line:84%
He wants to donate
$200 to your cause,

00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:30.052 align:middle line:90%
and here's his business card.

00:35:30.052 --> 00:35:31.510 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at
the business card--

00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:33.250 align:middle line:84%
now Lilou, if you
had seen these men,

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:36.000 align:middle line:84%
these were burly man with
grizzly beards, sweaty,

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.530 align:middle line:90%
with oil on them.

00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:40.680 align:middle line:84%
His name was Jim
Souls, S-O-U-L-S,

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:43.590 align:middle line:84%
and there was a pair of angel
wings on the top of his card.

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:45.790 align:middle line:84%
Look at how the
universe provides.

00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:47.520 align:middle line:84%
So we left there and
went to DC, where

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:48.811 align:middle line:90%
the first show was going to be.

00:35:48.811 --> 00:35:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And I got to the campground,
went inside to the office,

00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:53.760 align:middle line:84%
came back out, and
the RV wouldn't crank.

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:55.620 align:middle line:84%
So I had to get it
jump-started again.

00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:57.820 align:middle line:84%
We got to our parking
place, I turned

00:35:57.820 --> 00:35:59.310 align:middle line:84%
it off, tried to
turn it back on.

00:35:59.310 --> 00:36:00.130 align:middle line:90%
It wouldn't crank.

00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:02.650 align:middle line:84%
So I said, universe, what
is you're trying to tell me?

00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:05.350 align:middle line:84%
I know I'm supposed to create
every show spontaneously.

00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:08.830 align:middle line:84%
What's the message you're
trying to get me to understand?

00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:12.650 align:middle line:84%
So I sat down, I took a breath,
and the first word that came in

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:13.700 align:middle line:90%
was solenoid.

00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:17.590 align:middle line:84%
So I sat there and I said,
solenoid, solenoid, solenoid,

00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:19.710 align:middle line:84%
solenoid, silly
noise, silly noise.

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:21.060 align:middle line:90%
Silly noise?

00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:23.360 align:middle line:84%
Is it the silly noise
that's all around us

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.600 align:middle line:84%
and the silly noise
that's inside of us that

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:28.130 align:middle line:84%
keeps us stopping and starting
and stopping and starting

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:29.660 align:middle line:90%
so we don't live our dreams?

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:31.200 align:middle line:84%
If that's the
message that you're

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:34.430 align:middle line:84%
trying to get across to the
audience, please let the RV

00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:35.280 align:middle line:90%
crank.

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And I got in the
driver's seat, and the RV

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:40.420 align:middle line:84%
cranked and cranked
every show, every step

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:42.090 align:middle line:90%
of the way for the first leg.

00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:46.060 align:middle line:84%
Now a lot of people would
say, OK, that's a coincidence.

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:47.175 align:middle line:90%
It just was a loose wire.

00:36:47.175 --> 00:36:48.550 align:middle line:84%
Something kind of
happened there.

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:50.570 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Oh, you've got
many of those, though.

00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:52.840 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: But when we
left on the second leg,

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:55.750 align:middle line:84%
I spoke to you earlier about a
personal issue that I'm going

00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:58.230 align:middle line:84%
through, and I happened to
stop by my parents' home,

00:36:58.230 --> 00:37:01.590 align:middle line:84%
and they said something to me
that kind of got me a little

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:02.570 align:middle line:90%
jittery inside.

00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'm the kind of person
that 99% of the time I'm

00:37:05.330 --> 00:37:06.780 align:middle line:90%
in my happy place.

00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:09.180 align:middle line:84%
But all the way back to
Charleston to pack up the RV,

00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:11.360 align:middle line:84%
I was just feeling really
uncomfortable and jittery

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:13.750 align:middle line:84%
and the stories were
going in my mind.

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And I get there, we pack up
the RV, get ready to leave,

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:18.520 align:middle line:90%
the RV won't crank.

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And so I try 12 more
times, not even a click.

00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:23.310 align:middle line:84%
So I get in the car
and I tell the kids

00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:27.020 align:middle line:84%
and I tell my assistant, Tuck
we were going to go to a hotel.

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:29.050 align:middle line:84%
I'll get this fixed
tomorrow, and we'll leave.

00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:31.085 align:middle line:84%
I'm about to put the
key in the ignition,

00:37:31.085 --> 00:37:33.060 align:middle line:90%
and I go, silly noise.

00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:34.920 align:middle line:84%
Oh my gosh, Tuck,
it's the silly noise.

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.230 align:middle line:90%
I need to go try the RV again.

00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:39.174 align:middle line:84%
And I got in the RV,
and I said I'm not

00:37:39.174 --> 00:37:41.090 align:middle line:84%
buying into those things
I heard this morning.

00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:42.714 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting rid of
all that silly noise

00:37:42.714 --> 00:37:45.694 align:middle line:84%
because I know the
truth of this situation.

00:37:45.694 --> 00:37:47.610 align:middle line:84%
I put the key in the
ignition, the RV cranked,

00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:49.250 align:middle line:90%
and it has cranked ever since.

00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:52.670 align:middle line:84%
What if we are at that connected
to everything in our reality

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:54.040 align:middle line:90%
and we don't even realize it?

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:56.070 align:middle line:84%
What if everything
is simply there

00:37:56.070 --> 00:37:59.090 align:middle line:84%
to play with us, to be
messages and communications

00:37:59.090 --> 00:38:01.140 align:middle line:90%
and work on our behalf?

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:02.250 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:04.584 align:middle line:84%
When I was in retail-- I
was in retail for 30 years--

00:38:04.584 --> 00:38:07.000 align:middle line:84%
and there was this woman that
would walk through the door.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.290 align:middle line:84%
She had the most gorgeous
curly hair I'd ever seen.

00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:10.272 align:middle line:90%
The sun would shine.

00:38:10.272 --> 00:38:11.480 align:middle line:90%
It would go right through it.

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:13.636 align:middle line:84%
The angels would
sing, [SINGING] ahhh.

00:38:13.636 --> 00:38:15.760 align:middle line:84%
And I would just fall in
love with this curly hair.

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:17.660 align:middle line:84%
And I had very,
very straight hair.

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And there was one day
that she walked in

00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:21.690 align:middle line:90%
and the light hit it just right.

00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:24.310 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I will
to have curly hair.

00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:25.922 align:middle line:84%
The next morning I
woke up with this.

00:38:25.922 --> 00:38:27.130 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Are you kidding me?

00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:29.809 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: What if we can change
everything and we just don't--

00:38:29.809 --> 00:38:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: The women who
are listening, oh my god.

00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:33.810 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: But that
is what has happened.

00:38:33.810 --> 00:38:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
want people to get.

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.400 align:middle line:90%
You are masters.

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:37.980 align:middle line:90%
You are gods walking.

00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:40.730 align:middle line:84%
The sacred texts
all tell you this,

00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:43.490 align:middle line:84%
but we just need to know it and
believe it and allow ourselves

00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:44.480 align:middle line:90%
this playground.

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:45.950 align:middle line:90%
This is not an earth school.

00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:47.810 align:middle line:84%
It's not obstacles
and challenges.

00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:50.070 align:middle line:90%
It's a playground.

00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And we are meant to dive
into the dark night.

00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote a song that's
absolutely beautiful

00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:57.270 align:middle line:84%
that speaks about
that dark night.

00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:58.266 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Are you
going to sing for us?

00:38:58.266 --> 00:38:59.710 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: I'd be happy
to if you want me to.

00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:00.680 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yay.

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:01.410 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: Would you like me to?

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:02.045 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:39:02.045 --> 00:39:02.586 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: OK.

00:39:02.586 --> 00:39:04.937 align:middle line:90%


00:39:04.937 --> 00:39:06.145 align:middle line:90%
I have to do this a cappella.

00:39:06.145 --> 00:39:07.860 align:middle line:90%
We'll see how this works.

00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:15.580 align:middle line:10%
[SINGING] Contracts come, lives
intertwine, anger, sadness,

00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:18.170 align:middle line:10%
grief, and resentment.

00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:24.270 align:middle line:10%
A soul curriculum we must
all learn in our own time.

00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:30.230 align:middle line:10%
Sing your song out loud
while creating your story.

00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:35.670 align:middle line:10%
A spiritual journey,
a human experience.

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:45.750 align:middle line:10%
There are no mistakes, no
mistakes in all this glory,

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:50.070 align:middle line:10%
in all this glory.

00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:55.345 align:middle line:84%
All seems lost when
you look in the mirror.

00:39:55.345 --> 00:39:56.580 align:middle line:90%
Hope is gone.

00:39:56.580 --> 00:40:00.870 align:middle line:84%
Let yourself fall
to hear the call.

00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:06.360 align:middle line:84%
This is the beginning
where we learn to belong.

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:09.570 align:middle line:90%
A life wrought with separation?

00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:15.930 align:middle line:84%
No, it's preparation,
leading you,

00:40:15.930 --> 00:40:22.160 align:middle line:84%
guiding you to who you
are, to who you really are.

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:28.410 align:middle line:84%
In a moment you'll awaken
to your soul's true call.

00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:34.066 align:middle line:84%
Dark night of the soul,
it's a place where we grow.

00:40:34.066 --> 00:40:38.710 align:middle line:84%
Dark nights, dark nights,
dark nights to behold.

00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:43.910 align:middle line:84%
It's the soul's
path to the light.

00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:49.555 align:middle line:84%
In the darkest night
find your gold.

00:40:49.555 --> 00:40:52.340 align:middle line:90%


00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:55.470 align:middle line:90%
Find your gold.

00:40:55.470 --> 00:41:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Victim, villain, saint, then
sinner, the pebbles and rocks,

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.810 align:middle line:90%
the boulders do rise.

00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:10.530 align:middle line:84%
In the moment of your surrender,
you shall give in to surprise,

00:41:10.530 --> 00:41:15.770 align:middle line:84%
and then you'll have the
chance to discover the winner.

00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:20.810 align:middle line:84%
A hero's journey,
learn to let go.

00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:26.570 align:middle line:84%
Let it go to find
you are the infinite.

00:41:26.570 --> 00:41:29.770 align:middle line:90%
It's just a show.

00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:32.100 align:middle line:90%
Fall to the ground.

00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:34.330 align:middle line:90%
Cry your tears.

00:41:34.330 --> 00:41:36.350 align:middle line:90%
Say your prayer.

00:41:36.350 --> 00:41:38.890 align:middle line:90%
Dive into your fears.

00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:44.550 align:middle line:84%
It's the road of every human
soul, the path of all time,

00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:50.030 align:middle line:84%
to begin this journey believing
we are deaf, dumb, and blind.

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:53.582 align:middle line:84%
In the land of
opposites, burning

00:41:53.582 --> 00:41:58.600 align:middle line:84%
as an ember, you will
learn to shine where you'll

00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:04.970 align:middle line:84%
find what is mine is yours,
what is yours is mine.

00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:10.780 align:middle line:84%
Dark night of the soul,
it's a place where we grow.

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:15.050 align:middle line:84%
Dark nights, dark nights,
dark nights to behold.

00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:20.130 align:middle line:84%
It's the soul's
path to the light.

00:42:20.130 --> 00:42:25.794 align:middle line:84%
In the darkest night,
find your gold.

00:42:25.794 --> 00:42:28.510 align:middle line:90%


00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:31.630 align:middle line:90%
Find your gold.

00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:34.040 align:middle line:90%
Now that was six voice lessons.

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:35.750 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know how to sing.

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:37.470 align:middle line:90%
I've lost my voice three times.

00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And each time I've lost my
voice, it's gotten stronger.

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And over the course--
I've now done 48 shows,

00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:47.730 align:middle line:84%
and my voice has gotten
stronger and stronger.

00:42:47.730 --> 00:42:51.190 align:middle line:84%
The lesson is here is we
don't have to be perfect.

00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:53.230 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to get
it right, that I've

00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:56.280 align:middle line:84%
gained far more through the
experience of discovering

00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:59.270 align:middle line:84%
my courage, my confidence,
my ability to have gifts

00:42:59.270 --> 00:43:01.150 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't even
know that I had.

00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And in doing that,
in being the example

00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:05.240 align:middle line:84%
of that to other
people, there are

00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:07.030 align:middle line:84%
fires inside of
people that are being

00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:09.100 align:middle line:90%
lit up all over this country.

00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're here to
do is just do it for ourselves.

00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:14.880 align:middle line:90%
My nickname is Simi.

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:16.780 align:middle line:90%
Simi, see-me.

00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:19.470 align:middle line:84%
I had to do this for the little
girl that has hidden away

00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:22.180 align:middle line:90%
for 44 years behind four walls.

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:25.870 align:middle line:84%
I had to get out on stage
and tour the country for me

00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:28.600 align:middle line:90%
so that I would see me.

00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And in doing that,
it is allowing others

00:43:31.110 --> 00:43:33.246 align:middle line:84%
to see that they
can see themselves.

00:43:33.246 --> 00:43:34.870 align:middle line:10%
And that's the truth
of why we're here,

00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:38.260 align:middle line:10%
to discover who we are,
to love ourselves enough,

00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:40.380 align:middle line:10%
and to be willing
to stand in that

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:43.590 align:middle line:10%
so that that world that
appears so real outside also

00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:45.040 align:middle line:10%
can ripple out and do the same.

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:47.280 align:middle line:10%
>> LILOU: Mmm.

00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:49.140 align:middle line:10%
[SIGHS] This felt really good.

00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:52.120 align:middle line:10%
Thank you so much, Simran,
for this beautiful interview,

00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:56.410 align:middle line:10%
for pouring out your heart with
beautiful emotions and love.

00:43:56.410 --> 00:43:57.760 align:middle line:10%
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:59.690 align:middle line:10%
>> SINGH: Oh, thank you
for the opportunity.

00:43:59.690 --> 00:44:01.523 align:middle line:10%
And I just think that
what you've been doing

00:44:01.523 --> 00:44:04.660 align:middle line:10%
is amazing, just the example
that you're setting for people

00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:09.300 align:middle line:10%
and allowing people to
understand it just is the yes.

00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:12.390 align:middle line:10%
It's just the yes that we need
to do, and we need to all dive

00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:13.166 align:middle line:10%
into our passions.

00:44:13.166 --> 00:44:14.540 align:middle line:10%
And then you can
live their lives

00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:17.260 align:middle line:10%
that we're living, full of
bliss and happiness and joy.

00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:20.362 align:middle line:10%
The things that I really do
write about actually do happen.

00:44:20.362 --> 00:44:21.320 align:middle line:10%
>> LILOU: I'm inspired.

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:22.710 align:middle line:10%
Thank you.

00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:28.070 align:middle line:10%
Big, big kisses to all of you
beautiful gods and goddesses.

00:44:28.070 --> 00:44:29.080 align:middle line:10%
>> SINGH: That's right.

00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:31.270 align:middle line:10%
We are in love all of the time.

00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:33.150 align:middle line:10%
We are with love
all of the time.

00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:34.930 align:middle line:10%
We are of love all of the time.

00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:38.520 align:middle line:10%
We're just here to be as love
in every step that we take.

00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:39.427 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:44:39.427 --> 00:44:40.260 align:middle line:10%
>> LILOU: Thank you.

00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:40.890 align:middle line:10%
>> SINGH: Thank you.

00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:42.090 align:middle line:10%
>> LILOU: Big, big kisses.

00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:42.590 align:middle line:10%
Much love.

00:44:42.590 --> 00:44:43.376 align:middle line:10%
Bye bye.

00:44:43.376 --> 00:44:45.120 align:middle line:10%
>> SINGH: Bye.

00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:53.767 align:middle line:90%
