00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.486 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.486 --> 00:00:13.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Hello, my
juicy co-creators!

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.540 align:middle line:84%
Lilou here in
beautiful-- actually,

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.590 align:middle line:90%
rainy, a little bit-- Miami.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.630 align:middle line:84%
But we're hoping that we'll be
able to do this interview fully

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.340 align:middle line:90%
before it rains.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.420 align:middle line:10%
I'm excited to meet you, Blaire.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.110 align:middle line:10%
I mean actually,
your nickname or how

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.860 align:middle line:10%
you go by is really The Love
Guru Blaire, is that right?

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:31.776 align:middle line:10%
>>BLAIRE ALLISON: Yep.

00:00:31.776 --> 00:00:33.341 align:middle line:10%
Call me by my name,
The Love Guru.

00:00:33.341 --> 00:00:33.840 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.423 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Yeah.

00:00:34.423 --> 00:00:36.879 align:middle line:10%
So you're really all about
relationship and helping

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:38.170 align:middle line:10%
others finding their true love?

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.090 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: Yeah.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.345 align:middle line:10%
This is what I was born to do.

00:00:40.345 --> 00:00:41.550 align:middle line:10%
It's my divine mission.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.175 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: How did you know
this was your divine mission?

00:00:43.175 --> 00:00:44.591 align:middle line:10%
Because I know a
lot of people out

00:00:44.591 --> 00:00:47.410 align:middle line:10%
there are really looking
for-- to serve the planet.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.270 align:middle line:10%
Especially on Gaiam
TV, a lot of people

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.600 align:middle line:10%
are interested, and spiritual,
and want to learn more.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.492 align:middle line:10%
But how did you know
this was your calling?

00:00:54.492 --> 00:00:56.950 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: You know, you hear
a lot of stories about people

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.240 align:middle line:10%
go out and looking for it.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.520 align:middle line:10%
I always knew I was
here for something big.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.720 align:middle line:10%
And I was always interested
in love and relationships.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.030 align:middle line:10%
So I don't know where
the two connected.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.940 align:middle line:10%
I think I was just always in
the love relationship field.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.760 align:middle line:10%
I've always had different jobs
in the love relationship field.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.530 align:middle line:10%
I've always been helping
people with their relationships

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.410 align:middle line:10%
or looking for love.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.960 align:middle line:10%
So it evolved.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.520 align:middle line:10%
But I think you know.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.220 align:middle line:10%
You know what you're here to do.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.114 align:middle line:10%
You have to just tap into
your heart, that knowing.

00:01:25.114 --> 00:01:27.780 align:middle line:10%
You don't need to go out and ask
people what are you here to do.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.154 align:middle line:10%
It's what comes
naturally to you.

00:01:29.154 --> 00:01:32.942 align:middle line:10%
What are you naturally
interested in?

00:01:32.942 --> 00:01:34.400 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: What is
true love for you?

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.890 align:middle line:10%
How do you define true love?

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.320 align:middle line:10%
So that we know, all of
us know, if we're actually

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.920 align:middle line:10%
in a true love relationship
or kind of look

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.576 align:middle line:10%
forward to this true
love relationship.

00:01:45.576 --> 00:01:46.450 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: True love.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.080 align:middle line:10%
God, someone hasn't said
that term to me in a while.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.695 align:middle line:10%
You know, I guess I kind
of look at true love as,

00:01:53.695 --> 00:02:01.120 align:middle line:10%
like, innocent, sweet,
maybe fairy tale-type love.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.360 align:middle line:10%
True love, I don't know.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.597 align:middle line:10%
I think that love comes
in and out of your life,

00:02:04.597 --> 00:02:06.180 align:middle line:10%
and you connect with
different people,

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.590 align:middle line:10%
and you have love with them.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.520 align:middle line:10%
And true love.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.020 align:middle line:10%
That makes me think that there's
one person forever and ever

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.040 align:middle line:10%
for you, and I
don't believe that.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.120 align:middle line:10%
I've learned different.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.580 align:middle line:10%
I've gone from that
sweet and innocent love

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.860 align:middle line:10%
to deeper understanding-- at
least my path, my journey.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.935 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: I think this is part
of, nowadays, how life goes.

00:02:27.935 --> 00:02:30.270 align:middle line:10%
That we will have
few relationships.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.020 align:middle line:10%
The forever after is no longer--
it's a little bit harder

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.190 align:middle line:10%
these days with our lives,
to have this one life

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.989 align:middle line:10%
relationship, one lifetime.

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.030 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: You know what?

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.440 align:middle line:10%
I think that in the past, that
was old paradigm thinking.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.500 align:middle line:10%
That you find one person
and you stick it out.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.660 align:middle line:10%
And I think that
that still holds

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.000 align:middle line:10%
true as a possibility
for us now,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.470 align:middle line:10%
as far as that you
do a life partner.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.460 align:middle line:10%
I think that you can
have a life partner.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.790 align:middle line:10%
But you need to clear
through your karma first.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.730 align:middle line:10%
You need to go
through the soulmates.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.710 align:middle line:10%
I've connected
with my twin flame.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.420 align:middle line:10%
You need to go
through these things.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.670 align:middle line:10%
You need to learn the lessons.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.840 align:middle line:10%
You need to become the person
who you are in your power,

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.240 align:middle line:10%
clearing those
relationship patterns.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.330 align:middle line:10%
And then you find
your life partner,

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.440 align:middle line:10%
and you can create this
divine relationship,

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.480 align:middle line:10%
this divine union, that
you're both in this path

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.980 align:middle line:10%
of growing and learning.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.150 align:middle line:10%
If you have a partner that's
not on the same learning

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.210 align:middle line:10%
path as you, it's
very difficult.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.760 align:middle line:10%


00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.600 align:middle line:10%
So a person forever and ever,
I think that that never really

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.140 align:middle line:10%
was.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.180 align:middle line:10%
I think that that
was a human kind

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.992 align:middle line:10%
of forcing that people
put on each other.

00:03:40.992 --> 00:03:41.950 align:middle line:10%
Because you're growing.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.283 align:middle line:10%
We're evolving too much,
especially in this day and age.

00:03:44.283 --> 00:03:46.660 align:middle line:10%
We're evolving too much.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.010 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Let's talk about
this twin flame soulmate.

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.950 align:middle line:10%
I just want to
gain clarification,

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.670 align:middle line:10%
a bit of clarity on this.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.070 align:middle line:10%
What is the difference between
soulmate and twin flames?

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.370 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: Yeah, that's
a great question.

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:01.310 align:middle line:10%
Soulmate.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.390 align:middle line:10%
We have millions and
millions of soulmates.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:05.430 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Friends?

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.096 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: Well yeah,
it can be friends.

00:04:07.096 --> 00:04:08.290 align:middle line:10%
It can even be animals.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.912 align:middle line:10%
It can be your
mom or-- you know,

00:04:09.912 --> 00:04:11.870 align:middle line:10%
you can have a soulmate
relationship with them.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.495 align:middle line:10%
But we'll talk about
love relationships

00:04:13.495 --> 00:04:15.170 align:middle line:10%
because we like
talking about love.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.798 align:middle line:10%
Love Guru.

00:04:15.798 --> 00:04:16.589 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Love Guru.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.250 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: Yeah.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.220 align:middle line:10%
So you can connect with a
lot of different soulmates

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.590 align:middle line:10%
in a relationship, dating them.

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.510 align:middle line:10%
And the relationship
can be fantastic.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:29.550 align:middle line:10%
You guys can get along.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.380 align:middle line:10%
It could be perfect, or it
can be kind of turbulent.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.180 align:middle line:10%
And that's been my experience.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.330 align:middle line:10%
It's been great one minute
and then turbulent the next.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.500 align:middle line:10%
And there's things for you
that you need to learn.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.110 align:middle line:10%
They have gifts for you.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.340 align:middle line:10%
There's lessons for you
to pick up along the way.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.590 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: But we say soulmate
because there's this soul

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.040 align:middle line:10%
connection beforehand,
before we're here on Earth.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.290 align:middle line:84%
There's this kind of
agreement to help us evolve?

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.084 align:middle line:84%
Is that what really
a soulmate is about?

00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:53.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Yeah.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.305 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we travel the
world in soul groups.

00:04:56.305 --> 00:04:58.980 align:middle line:90%


00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.620 align:middle line:84%
So you reincarnate with these
same people that you agree,

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.280 align:middle line:84%
OK, let me teach you how
to stand in your power.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And in order for
you to learn that,

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.934 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to maybe
treat you like crap.

00:05:10.934 --> 00:05:12.100 align:middle line:90%
Can I say these things here?

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.683 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yeah.

00:05:12.683 --> 00:05:13.530 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: OK.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.500 align:middle line:84%
I have a little bit
of a dirty mouth.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, I'm a different
type of spiritual teacher.

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:25.180 align:middle line:84%
So I enjoy my human
experience, too.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.750 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, you have things
to learn from them.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's not going to be
all rosy relationship.

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:32.810 align:middle line:90%
So that's the soulmate.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.280 align:middle line:90%
We'll just keep it real simple.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.360 align:middle line:84%
The twin flame is the
pinnacle of relationships,

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.435 align:middle line:90%
the highest of high.

00:05:39.435 --> 00:05:42.290 align:middle line:90%


00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.550 align:middle line:84%
When I connected
with my twin flame,

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.230 align:middle line:90%
my guides were cheering for me.

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:48.640 align:middle line:90%
They were like, you did it.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.110 align:middle line:84%
I saw my angels and guides
clapping, saluting me.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't even something
that I was searching for.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.370 align:middle line:10%
So the twin flame-- I think
the purpose of the twin flame

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.680 align:middle line:10%
is to get you on the path
doing your divine mission.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.110 align:middle line:10%
I think it's also to finally
clear all the relationship

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:06.480 align:middle line:10%
patterns that you have.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.920 align:middle line:10%
Now with that
said, not everybody

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.230 align:middle line:10%
uses a twin flame like that.

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.130 align:middle line:10%
Not everybody grows
through a twin flame.

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.110 align:middle line:10%
Not everybody heals through it.

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.080 align:middle line:10%
I did because I'm really
into learning my lessons

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.320 align:middle line:10%
and advancing.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:17.820 align:middle line:10%
Hi.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.450 align:middle line:10%
Are you looking for
your twin flame?

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:20.820 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: You want to
play with us, don't you?

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:21.380 align:middle line:10%
You're starting to scrape.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:21.960 align:middle line:10%
Bye bye.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:22.960 align:middle line:10%
This is my friend's cat.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.740 align:middle line:10%
Look how cute this is.

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.110 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: So that's the
basic overview of it.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.010 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: I had a feeling
that the twin flame sometimes

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.320 align:middle line:10%
was really something impossible.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:39.970 align:middle line:10%
So passionate, or so
unlimited, and so really wild

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.880 align:middle line:10%
divine union, that it could be
really hard to actually have

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.260 align:middle line:10%
all the different
elements in this lifetime

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.500 align:middle line:10%
to be with that
person physically.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.840 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: It is a
fantastic relationship.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.930 align:middle line:10%
But with that fantastic, it is
the absolute best relationship

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:59.120 align:middle line:10%
that you could ever imagine, and
it's also absolutely the worst

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.160 align:middle line:10%
relationship you
could ever imagine.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.580 align:middle line:10%
I really went through hell.

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:04.480 align:middle line:10%
Can I say that?

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.570 align:middle line:10%
I don't know.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.340 align:middle line:10%
Checking in with you.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:08.235 align:middle line:10%
Can I say--

00:07:08.235 --> 00:07:09.110 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Be yourself.

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.262 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: --whatever?

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:10.250 align:middle line:10%
I could be uncensored?

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:10.550 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Yeah.

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.850 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: Yeah.

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:11.640 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: We're on the internet.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.130 align:middle line:10%
That's the beautiful thing here.

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:13.200 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: OK.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.130 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: I mean, I don't
think Gaiam censors.

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:15.750 align:middle line:10%
We'll see.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:16.075 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: OK.

00:07:16.075 --> 00:07:16.400 align:middle line:10%
Beep.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.483 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: It might go beep.

00:07:17.483 --> 00:07:19.554 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: Love Guru,
dirty mouth, beep.

00:07:19.554 --> 00:07:20.240 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: That would
be quite funny.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:20.906 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: Yeah.

00:07:20.906 --> 00:07:23.580 align:middle line:10%


00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.352 align:middle line:10%
I went through absolute hell
in that relationship too.

00:07:27.352 --> 00:07:30.440 align:middle line:10%
It was like a twilight
zone, that we would have,

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.870 align:middle line:10%
again, so fantastic feeling.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:37.340 align:middle line:10%
But in order for us to
maintain that, then he

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.030 align:middle line:10%
was going to have
to be able-- maybe

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.110 align:middle line:10%
this sounds conceited,
or ego, or whatever--

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:45.510 align:middle line:10%
but he was going to have to keep
the pace with me, because I was

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:47.470 align:middle line:10%
so hardcore let me
heal through this.

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:48.180 align:middle line:90%
I saw through it.

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.150 align:middle line:84%
I've been studying
relationships my whole life.

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.540 align:middle line:84%
I knew this was karma
stuff to work through.

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.360 align:middle line:84%
I knew this was
highlighting my childhood

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.150 align:middle line:90%
wounds, that I needed to heal.

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:58.630 align:middle line:90%
And I was working at it.

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And things were being
highlighted for him

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.310 align:middle line:84%
that he just didn't really
want to be looking at.

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:03.726 align:middle line:84%
He didn't think
it was a big deal.

00:08:03.726 --> 00:08:05.180 align:middle line:90%
He thought I should get over it.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And we were having two
different experiences.

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:09.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: So not that easy.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Terribly hard.

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:11.890 align:middle line:90%
Terribly hard.

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:13.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: You told me it was
a twin flame relationship.

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:14.096 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Yeah.

00:08:14.096 --> 00:08:17.044 align:middle line:90%


00:08:17.044 --> 00:08:18.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: What is the
name for the lovey-dovey,

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:23.210 align:middle line:84%
beautiful, easy, no problem,
everything goes perfectly OK,

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:23.710 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:24.860 align:middle line:90%
Is there one for that one?

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:27.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Ha ha, none of them.

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:28.960 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.180 align:middle line:90%
That's my evil laugh.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.140 align:middle line:90%
It's true, it's true.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.799 align:middle line:84%
What happens is you get to
have a lovey-dovey great

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:35.909 align:middle line:90%
relationship.

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:37.210 align:middle line:90%
Again, this is my belief.

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:38.830 align:middle line:10%
This is what I've experienced.

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:40.940 align:middle line:10%
And again, with seeing
with my students too.

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:43.640 align:middle line:10%
When you heal
yourself, when you've

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.310 align:middle line:10%
gone through the
healing, then you

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:47.220 align:middle line:10%
can have the
lovey-dovey great stuff.

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.930 align:middle line:10%
And what that means--
no compromising.

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:51.720 align:middle line:10%
You know, we have
out in our society

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.830 align:middle line:10%
these false beliefs
that you need

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:57.180 align:middle line:10%
to compromise in a relationship,
that no one's perfect.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.060 align:middle line:10%
These are things
that keep us down.

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:00.640 align:middle line:10%
These are things
that keep us small.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.270 align:middle line:10%
These are things that keep
us from not believing, not

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:06.590 align:middle line:10%
dreaming, that we can have
a perfect relationship.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:09.260 align:middle line:10%
So for example, the
twin flame thing.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.290 align:middle line:10%
Whenever something
would go wrong,

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:13.940 align:middle line:10%
my twin flame would say
to me, well, Blaire,

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:15.550 align:middle line:10%
no relationship's perfect.

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:17.870 align:middle line:10%
You don't see couples
fighting behind the scenes,

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:19.490 align:middle line:10%
and you need to compromise.

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:21.650 align:middle line:10%
And I hated whenever
somebody would say this,

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:23.730 align:middle line:10%
and I knew it wasn't the truth.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:28.870 align:middle line:10%
But this was the patterning
that we bring down with us.

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:30.935 align:middle line:10%
So unless you heal that
stuff, unless you realize

00:09:30.935 --> 00:09:33.060 align:middle line:10%
that's an illusion. we can
create whatever we want;

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:34.640 align:middle line:10%
we're powerful beings.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.140 align:middle line:84%
We can have a
great relationship,

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:39.314 align:middle line:84%
but both parties need
to be on the same belief

00:09:39.314 --> 00:09:41.230 align:middle line:84%
that we want to have a
fantastic relationship.

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:43.150 align:middle line:90%
We're going to work towards it.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.235 align:middle line:84%
Working towards it
means healing ourselves.

00:09:45.235 --> 00:09:46.250 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Yeah.

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:50.534 align:middle line:10%
What are the components
of this healing process?

00:09:50.534 --> 00:09:52.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Yeah,
that's a good question.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.200 align:middle line:90%
What are the components?

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:58.319 align:middle line:90%


00:09:58.319 --> 00:09:58.860 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: To heal.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I guess at
some point we have

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:05.030 align:middle line:90%
to stop seeing outside of us.

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:07.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a lot of people say,
talk about this mirror thing.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.880 align:middle line:84%
Like if there's something that
we're annoyed about the person,

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.910 align:middle line:84%
or in relationship, that means
we have that to deal with.

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:14.780 align:middle line:90%
Do you see it?

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.290 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: Yeah,
I agree with that.

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:19.380 align:middle line:10%
But I never really connected
with that mirror thing.

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:20.380 align:middle line:10%
Just something about it.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:20.921 align:middle line:10%
I don't know.

00:10:20.921 --> 00:10:22.990 align:middle line:10%
However anyone explained
it, I was like, what?

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:25.220 align:middle line:10%
You know?

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:28.710 align:middle line:10%
So the way that I do it,
or the most, I guess,

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:31.270 align:middle line:10%
simplest way to break
it down is just,

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:33.955 align:middle line:10%
if you're having a
problem, you want

00:10:33.955 --> 00:10:35.280 align:middle line:10%
to start thinking about it.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.420 align:middle line:10%
Why is this happening?

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:37.640 align:middle line:10%
You want to journal about it.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.190 align:middle line:10%
You want to just
keep asking yourself

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:41.860 align:middle line:10%
a lot of questions of
why this is happening.

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:43.340 align:middle line:10%
And you want to seek out help.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.430 align:middle line:10%
I mean, throughout
these years, I've

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:47.360 align:middle line:10%
been studying
spirituality hardcore

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.820 align:middle line:10%
with a teacher since 1999.

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:53.640 align:middle line:10%
And then I got deep into
healing work in 2005.

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.120 align:middle line:10%
And then that was
on a regular basis.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.546 align:middle line:10%
I heard about healing before
and I was studying it,

00:10:58.546 --> 00:10:59.920 align:middle line:10%
but I didn't really
understand it

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.769 align:middle line:10%
the way that I did until I
was working with this one

00:11:02.769 --> 00:11:04.060 align:middle line:10%
teacher that came into my life.

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:06.610 align:middle line:10%
And it was one after the
next that I went deep

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:11.090 align:middle line:10%
for years into
just looking at-- I

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:13.770 align:middle line:10%
think it's spoken about a lot as
far as these childhood wounds.

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:17.710 align:middle line:10%
But we really do get wounded
when we're growing up

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:21.050 align:middle line:10%
and we don't realize the
unconscious ways that we're

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:21.915 align:middle line:10%
acting.

00:11:21.915 --> 00:11:23.640 align:middle line:10%
And our relationships
affect everything.

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.431 align:middle line:10%
It just comes out in
our love relationships

00:11:25.431 --> 00:11:28.920 align:middle line:10%
and we're upset about it then,
that's when we seek help.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.970 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: It started to
rain a little bit now.

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:34.604 align:middle line:10%
This is going to be fine.

00:11:34.604 --> 00:11:38.060 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: I think it's
just a little drizzle.

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:38.560 align:middle line:10%
It is.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:39.070 align:middle line:10%
We get this.

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:40.790 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: You're a
Miami lady, I can tell.

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:41.580 align:middle line:10%
I'm the French.

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:42.760 align:middle line:10%
You know, Parisian.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:43.335 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:11:43.335 --> 00:11:44.668 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: Are you afraid or no?

00:11:44.668 --> 00:11:45.206 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: No.

00:11:45.206 --> 00:11:46.170 align:middle line:90%
Let's go into it, then.

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:47.200 align:middle line:90%
Let's go into it.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:47.860 align:middle line:90%
Let's heal.

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:49.950 align:middle line:90%
Lets heal the rain thing.

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:52.736 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: It's cleansing.

00:11:52.736 --> 00:11:53.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Oh my god.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:56.330 align:middle line:84%
So where were we
with this healing?

00:11:56.330 --> 00:12:01.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, talking of healing,
the water falling from the sky.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.220 align:middle line:84%
How do you see
healing, then, with all

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.590 align:middle line:90%
your different experiences?

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:08.430 align:middle line:84%
Is it really about
healing our past?

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:11.145 align:middle line:90%
Is it energetic?

00:12:11.145 --> 00:12:12.860 align:middle line:84%
What is the healing
that you think

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:19.310 align:middle line:84%
is necessary in a relationship
to be free and fulfilled?

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:21.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Well, I'm
an emotional healer.

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:22.640 align:middle line:90%
That's my specialty.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:27.490 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm speaking
with somebody,

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:29.980 align:middle line:84%
I can tell if they're
single, or in a relationship,

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:32.920 align:middle line:84%
or if they are
having heartache--

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:37.190 align:middle line:84%
you know, anger, sadness,
restoring that inner heart.

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:38.920 align:middle line:90%
Those things don't go away.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.320 align:middle line:84%
When we get out
of a relationship,

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:44.660 align:middle line:84%
a lot of times singles tend
to think that if they're

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:48.070 align:middle line:84%
dating again, if
they're being out there,

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:51.150 align:middle line:84%
or they got rid of all the
person's stuff or whatever,

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:54.070 align:middle line:84%
that then they're OK
and they're better.

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:55.650 align:middle line:84%
But that stuff
stores in your heart.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:58.760 align:middle line:90%


00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:02.640 align:middle line:84%
That's not some fantasy
energetic whatever thing.

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:03.580 align:middle line:90%
That's real.

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:04.610 align:middle line:90%
It's in your heart.

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:06.660 align:middle line:84%
You're still carrying
that heaviness.

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:12.610 align:middle line:84%
So unless you look at that,
and unless you heal that stuff,

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:15.950 align:middle line:84%
you're going to just spiritually
attract-- those cats.

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:18.392 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
spiritually attract

00:13:18.392 --> 00:13:20.600 align:middle line:84%
the same type of partner,
that the same kind of stuff

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.670 align:middle line:90%
is going to happen to you again.

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:23.253 align:middle line:84%
You're going to just
keep on repeating

00:13:23.253 --> 00:13:25.370 align:middle line:84%
those same unhealthy
relationship patterns that's

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:28.450 align:middle line:84%
going to just keep on adding
more and more to that pain.

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:30.635 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: So until
it's healed-- I mean,

00:13:30.635 --> 00:13:33.010 align:middle line:84%
most of the time, what you're
saying is that we escape,

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:37.890 align:middle line:84%
or we find something else to
do, or we change relationships,

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:39.475 align:middle line:90%
but the problem is still there.

00:13:39.475 --> 00:13:40.680 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Yeah, totally.

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, I
think most of our society

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:49.490 align:middle line:84%
is like that because there is so
much kind of pride in moving on

00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:50.850 align:middle line:90%
and you should just get over it.

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:54.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think people don't really
like seeing people mourning,

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:55.090 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:57.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you get
out of a relationship

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.200 align:middle line:84%
and it was going on
for a couple years,

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.450 align:middle line:84%
it's going to probably
take you a couple of years

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:03.390 align:middle line:90%
to get over that relationship.

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:05.620 align:middle line:90%
But are you OK with that?

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.310 align:middle line:84%
Are you OK going through
healing for a couple of years?

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And then what about the
peer pressure around you?

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:12.620 align:middle line:84%
Your family members
or your friends

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:14.360 align:middle line:84%
saying, "Oh, you
should get over it."

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.880 align:middle line:84%
That's the biggest distress
that you can do to people.

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:20.310 align:middle line:90%
That's harming them more.

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:22.271 align:middle line:84%
And also, you have to
actively be healing.

00:14:22.271 --> 00:14:24.770 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you just sit on
your couch and you do nothing,

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:25.853 align:middle line:90%
you feel bad for yourself.

00:14:25.853 --> 00:14:27.380 align:middle line:90%
This is an active process.

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:30.870 align:middle line:84%
Both manifesting and healing
are active processes.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:33.020 align:middle line:84%
You don't just sit
around and it happens.

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:35.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Is there
some that, like,

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:40.280 align:middle line:84%
not to do in a relationship,
or things really to avoid,

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:43.810 align:middle line:84%
or pitfalls, or things
like that to just avoid

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:47.894 align:middle line:90%
in relationships for it to work?

00:14:47.894 --> 00:14:49.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: I mean,
that reminds me

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:51.400 align:middle line:90%
of advice that people put up.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.020 align:middle line:84%
You read in a magazine
top 10 things not

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.680 align:middle line:84%
to do in your
relationship, you know?

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:59.900 align:middle line:84%
With all of my stuff, it
always goes deeper than that.

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.500 align:middle line:84%
The one thing that I would say
is like the number one don't,

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.900 align:middle line:84%
is that if there is
something that you're

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:08.660 align:middle line:84%
unhappy with in a relationship,
if there's some kind of thing

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.349 align:middle line:84%
that-- you have to
tap into yourself.

00:15:10.349 --> 00:15:12.390 align:middle line:84%
So you need to have some
silence, some down time,

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:14.920 align:middle line:84%
to know how you're feeling
inside your body, what's

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.090 align:middle line:84%
going on in your
heart and your gut.

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And again, a lot of people
are not silent enough

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:21.635 align:middle line:90%
to be able to connect with that.

00:15:21.635 --> 00:15:24.010 align:middle line:84%
So if you're feeling like
something's a little bit funny,

00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:25.426 align:middle line:84%
you're not really
liking something

00:15:25.426 --> 00:15:27.970 align:middle line:84%
that your partner's doing or
someone you're dating is doing,

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:30.780 align:middle line:90%
you need to pull back, OK?

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:32.760 align:middle line:84%
So you don't go into
that relationship

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:35.390 align:middle line:84%
and you don't try to talk it
over with them, at least not

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:36.330 align:middle line:90%
right then.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:37.670 align:middle line:90%
You don't try to work it out.

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:39.420 align:middle line:84%
You don't keep on
moving full speed ahead.

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:42.630 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people do this
when they're dating.

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:46.260 align:middle line:84%
They see how, I don't
know, the guy or the girl

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:51.700 align:middle line:84%
is maybe slow at texting you,
or taking a long time to ask you

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:53.470 align:middle line:84%
out on a date,
or-- I don't know.

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:56.850 align:middle line:84%
This is the crazy
stuff that goes on.

00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:57.980 align:middle line:90%
So this might be happening.

00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:00.650 align:middle line:84%
And if this doesn't
feel comfortable to you,

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:02.960 align:middle line:84%
you don't go pursue
the guy or the girl.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.370 align:middle line:84%
You don't go ask them
why they're doing that.

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:06.620 align:middle line:90%
Your heart knows.

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:09.650 align:middle line:84%
You pull back and you
say, do I want to create

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:10.720 align:middle line:90%
a relationship like this?

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.220 align:middle line:84%
Am I feeling
comfortable about this?

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:13.480 align:middle line:90%
Is something a little shady?

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:15.330 align:middle line:84%
For me, it's always
like, is it shady?

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:17.510 align:middle line:84%
If it's a little shady,
then you pull back

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:21.630 align:middle line:84%
and you say let me go into this
relationship with eyes wide

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:25.250 align:middle line:84%
open rather than let me just
let me give love a chance

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:26.790 align:middle line:90%
and jump right in.

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:29.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: How can we really
speak to our soul or spirit

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:30.530 align:middle line:90%
to know what's right?

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:33.260 align:middle line:84%
Is it more the place to
go that you recommend

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.920 align:middle line:84%
since you're a spiritual
love counselor, we could say?

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:37.880 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Yeah.

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, I call myself a spiritual
teacher and an intuitive heart

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.620 align:middle line:90%
healer.

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:45.950 align:middle line:84%
That's a title that
spirit gave me as well.

00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:48.110 align:middle line:84%
Love guru they gave me,
and intuitive heart healer,

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:49.480 align:middle line:90%
they gave me that title too.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:52.720 align:middle line:90%


00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.070 align:middle line:84%
See, we live in
such a busy world.

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:57.500 align:middle line:84%
People have cell phones,
they're constantly texting,

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.458 align:middle line:84%
they're constantly on
email, they're constantly

00:16:59.458 --> 00:17:00.440 align:middle line:90%
surfing the internet.

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.230 align:middle line:84%
Talking on the
phone while walking,

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:05.560 align:middle line:84%
while driving, while
this, while that.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:09.440 align:middle line:84%
The nature today is just
busyness, busyness, busyness.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:12.521 align:middle line:84%
So if you're in the habit of
constantly going, going, going,

00:17:12.521 --> 00:17:14.270 align:middle line:84%
you're never going to
hear your intuition.

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:16.020 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
know how you're feeling.

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:18.569 align:middle line:84%
It's just going to be more and
more chaos and drama going on

00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:19.319 align:middle line:90%
in your life.

00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:21.540 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to be able
to hear clearly at all.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:25.550 align:middle line:84%
So you need to first take steps
to just slow down your day.

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:28.180 align:middle line:84%
At a certain time, you
turn off the computer.

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:31.020 align:middle line:84%
At a certain time,
you turn off the TV.

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:33.736 align:middle line:84%
At a certain time,
you're just in silence.

00:17:33.736 --> 00:17:34.860 align:middle line:90%
That's, like, the hardcore.

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:36.710 align:middle line:90%
That's hardcore.

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:38.920 align:middle line:84%
Everybody might not
be there just yet.

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.740 align:middle line:90%
But you put the phone away.

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:42.220 align:middle line:90%
You turn it off.

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:43.590 align:middle line:90%
You don't text all the time.

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:45.322 align:middle line:90%
You do one thing at a time.

00:17:45.322 --> 00:17:46.780 align:middle line:84%
You constantly are
asking yourself,

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:48.750 align:middle line:90%
how do I feel about this?

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:50.020 align:middle line:90%
How am I feeling right now?

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:51.280 align:middle line:90%
It might sound a little cooky.

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:54.565 align:middle line:84%
But us spiritual people,
we like this stuff, right?

00:17:54.565 --> 00:17:55.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: You're here.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.370 align:middle line:90%
You're part of here.

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:59.240 align:middle line:84%
This video is part of this
community that is spiritual,

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:04.280 align:middle line:84%
so we can really go into the
real spiritual conversation

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:05.200 align:middle line:90%
or relationship.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:08.050 align:middle line:84%
Because it feels like we have so
much guidance inside, you know?

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:10.255 align:middle line:84%
That our soul is
constantly guiding us

00:18:10.255 --> 00:18:13.550 align:middle line:84%
as to what's the best for
us or the best relationship.

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the ego, and
then there's this personality,

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:18.644 align:middle line:84%
and then there's this
stuff from our childhood

00:18:18.644 --> 00:18:20.310 align:middle line:84%
that comes in-between
and sometimes it's

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:21.770 align:middle line:90%
hard to know which voice is who.

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:23.660 align:middle line:84%
So the silence, you're
saying, is best.

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:25.872 align:middle line:90%
Is there other stuff?

00:18:25.872 --> 00:18:27.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Let's not
make it complicated.

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:29.050 align:middle line:90%
It's the silence.

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:34.411 align:middle line:84%
And if you keep on-- You have to
look at yourself as two people,

00:18:34.411 --> 00:18:34.910 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:37.290 align:middle line:84%
It's me outside in the
world, and then it's

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:41.750 align:middle line:84%
me, the little girl in me, or
just the feeling part of me,

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:43.410 align:middle line:90%
the tender part of me.

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And I have conversations
with myself.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.700 align:middle line:84%
When I was coming down
here connecting with you,

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:50.980 align:middle line:84%
I was like, Blaire,
how are you feeling?

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:53.410 align:middle line:84%
I was giving myself
a little pep talk.

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:55.080 align:middle line:90%
I was calming myself down.

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.610 align:middle line:90%
You know, whatever it is.

00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And you have to be there
to soothe yourself.

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:02.030 align:middle line:84%
So that's another thing
that you have to, like,

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:03.900 align:middle line:90%
actively be talking to yourself.

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:07.300 align:middle line:84%
How are you feeling
about this relationship?

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:10.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: I find that sometimes
we're not too connected

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:11.730 align:middle line:90%
or love ourselves enough.

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:13.290 align:middle line:84%
Like for example,
recently I just

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:15.410 align:middle line:84%
bought myself this
ring as a commitment

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:16.910 align:middle line:90%
to myself to connect.

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:21.300 align:middle line:84%
Like no matter what, I am
committed to this relationship.

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.074 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that the first
one to start on?

00:19:23.074 --> 00:19:24.490 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Yeah,
that's fantastic.

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:25.400 align:middle line:90%
That's the first one.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:26.920 align:middle line:90%
That's the forever one.

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.620 align:middle line:90%
That's the forever one.

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:33.720 align:middle line:84%
When people say true love
or the one, it's yourself.

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.230 align:middle line:90%
You are the number one.

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:38.540 align:middle line:84%
We are so programmed to go
out there looking for someone

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:41.090 align:middle line:84%
that we're looked at maybe
as losers or pathetic

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:44.710 align:middle line:84%
if we're single, like
something's wrong with us.

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:47.960 align:middle line:84%
Maybe something's wrong with
some singles if they're single,

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:50.925 align:middle line:84%
but if you're, again, if
you're on this spiritual path,

00:19:50.925 --> 00:19:53.300 align:middle line:84%
and you're healing yourself,
and you're examining things,

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.200 align:middle line:90%
there's nothing wrong with you.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.930 align:middle line:84%
You're getting to
know yourself better.

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:59.090 align:middle line:84%
That means when you
get into a partnership,

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:00.235 align:middle line:90%
you bring more of you.

00:20:00.235 --> 00:20:01.320 align:middle line:90%
You know who you are.

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.890 align:middle line:90%
You're more powerful.

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:04.680 align:middle line:90%
It's great feeling powerful.

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.080 align:middle line:90%
It's great knowing who you are.

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.185 align:middle line:90%
That's how you feel power.

00:20:07.185 --> 00:20:10.950 align:middle line:90%


00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:13.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: And on the
loving ourselves,

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:15.530 align:middle line:84%
is there some
things that you-- is

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:17.040 align:middle line:90%
it part of healing our heart?

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.670 align:middle line:84%
Because I know you speak a lot
of the healing of the heart.

00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:20.940 align:middle line:90%
Is that where it is?

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:24.400 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of suck or there
is some kind of bad memories

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.840 align:middle line:90%
there?

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:26.599 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Well--

00:20:26.599 --> 00:20:28.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Is it about
loving ourselves

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:29.690 align:middle line:84%
when we talk of
healing of the heart?

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:30.880 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Yeah,
that's definitely

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.032 align:middle line:90%
an act of loving yourself.

00:20:32.032 --> 00:20:33.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's what you're
here on Earth to do,

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:35.952 align:middle line:90%
is you're here to heal yourself.

00:20:35.952 --> 00:20:37.410 align:middle line:84%
And then you're
here to live it up.

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:39.319 align:middle line:84%
Then you're here to,
like, really enjoy life

00:20:39.319 --> 00:20:40.860 align:middle line:84%
because you're seeing
things clearly.

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:44.087 align:middle line:84%
You're not seeing things
jaded by what other people say

00:20:44.087 --> 00:20:45.920 align:middle line:84%
that you should be doing
or living your life

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:48.520 align:middle line:84%
or you're not seeing it
through the wounding,

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:52.704 align:middle line:84%
through your childhood,
or past lives stuff.

00:20:52.704 --> 00:20:54.370 align:middle line:84%
But loving yourself
is really important.

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:55.030 align:middle line:90%
That's the concept.

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:56.920 align:middle line:84%
I keep on going deeper
and deeper with that.

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.766 align:middle line:90%
That's a lifelong learning.

00:20:59.766 --> 00:21:01.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: And the more
we love ourselves,

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.100 align:middle line:84%
and the more we
heal those parts,

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.360 align:middle line:84%
then, there's nothing--
is there something for us

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:08.422 align:middle line:84%
to do about attracting
this true love?

00:21:08.422 --> 00:21:10.380 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Yeah, there's
active steps on there.

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:11.504 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you're asking?

00:21:11.504 --> 00:21:13.160 align:middle line:84%
There's active steps
to do it, yeah.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:17.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I was
looking for this myself,

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:21.040 align:middle line:84%
because I always say I'm my
first student, and God, spirit,

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.720 align:middle line:90%
the universe guided me first.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.840 align:middle line:90%
I was looking in 2004--

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Tell us about
your whole story in 2004.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.745 align:middle line:90%
It's quite juicy.

00:21:29.745 --> 00:21:32.200 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Yeah, it is juicy.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:35.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's quite
mystical and spiritual

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:37.270 align:middle line:90%
on how things developed.

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:39.850 align:middle line:84%
I was always helping people
with their love lives.

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:41.940 align:middle line:84%
Back then I called
myself a dating coach.

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:44.200 align:middle line:84%
Again, it was very kind
of one dimensional type

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.689 align:middle line:90%
of thing, surface level.

00:21:45.689 --> 00:21:46.480 align:middle line:90%
But I was doing it.

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.330 align:middle line:84%
I was helping other
people getting success.

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:50.520 align:middle line:84%
But I could not get
it right for myself.

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And it was really
pissing me off.

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:55.740 align:middle line:84%
And I would have these kind
of, like, fights with God.

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:57.960 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't fighting me back,
but I was fighting him.

00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:01.580 align:middle line:90%
I was like, what's going on?

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:04.070 align:middle line:84%
You gave me the gift
of being a love guru.

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:05.352 align:middle line:90%
This is what you call me.

00:22:05.352 --> 00:22:06.810 align:middle line:84%
You tell me this
is what I'm to do.

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:08.070 align:middle line:84%
But meanwhile, I
can't get it right.

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:08.970 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:09.730 align:middle line:90%
And I hate this.

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:11.932 align:middle line:90%
And help me now.

00:22:11.932 --> 00:22:12.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: I said now.

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:16.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Yeah, I'm really
tough with my spirit friends,

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:17.200 align:middle line:90%
I call them.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And so I got this idea one day
after-- I was meditating a lot,

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:27.890 align:middle line:84%
and I had gone to a workshop
that we were meditating a lot.

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And I got this idea that I
was going to put up a website.

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:33.534 align:middle line:84%
And I called it "Marry Blaire,"
like will you marry me?

00:22:33.534 --> 00:22:34.075 align:middle line:90%
Marry Blaire.

00:22:34.075 --> 00:22:36.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm Blaire.

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:39.267 align:middle line:84%
And I put on it that it's time
for Blaire to get married.

00:22:39.267 --> 00:22:40.600 align:middle line:90%
It's time for me to get married.

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.280 align:middle line:90%
Do you know my husband?

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And it was just supposed
to be for friends

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:46.780 align:middle line:90%
and family, a private thing.

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:48.774 align:middle line:90%
And I put on some pictures.

00:22:48.774 --> 00:22:50.690 align:middle line:84%
This is what I'll look
when I meet my husband.

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:53.520 align:middle line:84%
This is what I'll look
when my husband kisses me,

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:55.090 align:middle line:90%
when he asks me to marry him.

00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:57.865 align:middle line:84%
And I just did it real fun
because that's how I am.

00:22:57.865 --> 00:23:00.840 align:middle line:84%
Just kind of, like,
goofy and stuff, playful.

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: It was 10 years ago?

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:04.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Yeah,
it's been a while.

00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:06.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: You look like your 20s.

00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:08.569 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Everyone always--
yeah, I always hear that.

00:23:08.569 --> 00:23:09.860 align:middle line:90%
I keep on getting younger, too.

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:12.820 align:middle line:84%
I don't count my age anymore
because-- that's another thing.

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:13.403 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Nice.

00:23:13.403 --> 00:23:16.210 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: We're living in,
like, a timeless era, too.

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:19.380 align:middle line:90%
So I put a countdown clock.

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:22.020 align:middle line:84%
I found an HTML code to
put a countdown clock.

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And I said I want to be
engaged by December, which

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:27.990 align:middle line:84%
was six months from that time,
because I knew my parents would

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:30.180 align:middle line:84%
look at the website and
laugh, and say, "Oh, you're

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.560 align:middle line:84%
so funny, Blaire," and
then just forget about it.

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted them to take
me serious that I'm looking,

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:36.520 align:middle line:84%
you're going to help me,
you're going to do it.

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:37.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm not doing it anymore.

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: So how long
did you give yourself?

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:41.160 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: It was six months.

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:44.580 align:middle line:84%
But right away, the
website went viral.

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:46.090 align:middle line:84%
This was before
things went viral.

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:48.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, like, a lot
of things go viral.

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:51.270 align:middle line:84%
This was before that
age, before that time.

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:54.316 align:middle line:84%
And it got passed around
all around in the US,

00:23:54.316 --> 00:23:55.440 align:middle line:90%
all around other countries.

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.610 align:middle line:90%
I was in The New York Times.

00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:58.790 align:middle line:90%
I was on MSNBC, CNN.

00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And people were interviewing
me and I got loads of emails,

00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:03.665 align:middle line:84%
like I'm in the
same boat as you.

00:24:03.665 --> 00:24:04.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking for my husband.

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:06.010 align:middle line:90%
I can't find him.

00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:07.362 align:middle line:90%
Or, like, you're such a loser.

00:24:07.362 --> 00:24:08.820 align:middle line:84%
Why are you putting
up that website

00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:09.861 align:middle line:90%
looking for your husband?

00:24:09.861 --> 00:24:11.910 align:middle line:90%
You can't find him yourself?

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:15.320 align:middle line:84%
People were getting all
different types of reactions.

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:18.756 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was
instead of giving up on love,

00:24:18.756 --> 00:24:20.505 align:middle line:84%
because I was exhausted
from all the dates

00:24:20.505 --> 00:24:22.630 align:middle line:84%
I did, now all these
people were watching me

00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:25.910 align:middle line:84%
and I felt like I had
to provide for them.

00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:29.300 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to show them that I can
find love, that they could too.

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:31.044 align:middle line:84%
So it was, like, a
bigger reason now.

00:24:31.044 --> 00:24:32.210 align:middle line:90%
So I started working harder.

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:33.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: It's a lot
of pressure, yeah?

00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:35.636 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Yeah, I was under
a lot of pressure then.

00:24:35.636 --> 00:24:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And I started going to
one singles event a week,

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:40.280 align:middle line:84%
and I started going on
a blind date a week.

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.960 align:middle line:90%
And it was just craziness.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: In Miami
or in New York?

00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:46.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: I was up
in New Jersey then.

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:48.640 align:middle line:10%
And I was exhausted.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:52.820 align:middle line:10%
And I said to God, I can't
do dating like this anymore.

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:54.657 align:middle line:10%
This is what I wanted
to leave behind.

00:24:54.657 --> 00:24:57.240 align:middle line:10%
I said I know you didn't put me
out in front of the public eye

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.730 align:middle line:10%
to see me fail.

00:24:58.730 --> 00:24:59.610 align:middle line:10%
Show me the way.

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:01.810 align:middle line:10%
What's going on here?

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:04.450 align:middle line:10%
I know I'm here for
something bigger.

00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:09.039 align:middle line:10%
And then God started
giving me ideas, again,

00:25:09.039 --> 00:25:11.330 align:middle line:10%
which now I call the spiritual
way to attract the want.

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:13.220 align:middle line:10%
It's one of things that I teach.

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:16.950 align:middle line:10%
And they started giving
me steps of things to do.

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:19.720 align:middle line:10%
And it was a little,
simple, easy things

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.670 align:middle line:10%
that I just thought
were fun or funny.

00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And I would do them
and they worked.

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:27.290 align:middle line:84%
And two months into that,
so it was a month later,

00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:29.030 align:middle line:84%
I attracted my
first soulmate just

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:31.130 align:middle line:84%
walking in the street
in New York City.

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:31.770 align:middle line:90%
He turned.

00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:32.435 align:middle line:90%
Our eyes met.

00:25:32.435 --> 00:25:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
connection there.

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:34.720 align:middle line:90%
We started dating.

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:38.550 align:middle line:10%
And that ever since then,
it's been easy street for me

00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:41.280 align:middle line:10%
as far as, like, I know
how to attract the one now.

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:42.490 align:middle line:10%
I can do it like that.

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:43.620 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: So what was
that tipping point?

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:45.960 align:middle line:10%
What was the thing that you told
yourself that all of a sudden,

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:48.376 align:middle line:10%
you were in this new paradigm,
and all of a sudden, things

00:25:48.376 --> 00:25:49.170 align:middle line:10%
start clicking?

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:51.050 align:middle line:10%
Because it seems like
it works like that.

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:54.174 align:middle line:10%
All of a sudden, we take a stand
for ourselves, and then boom.

00:25:54.174 --> 00:25:54.840 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: Yeah.

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.080 align:middle line:10%
Well, yeah.

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.230 align:middle line:10%
That's what it is.

00:25:57.230 --> 00:26:01.200 align:middle line:84%
You need to be-- One of
the things is that you need

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:04.967 align:middle line:84%
to be committed to what you
want, and then you declare it.

00:26:04.967 --> 00:26:07.550 align:middle line:84%
So one of the big things for me
was, like, I was always afraid

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:08.924 align:middle line:84%
of telling people
I wanted to get

00:26:08.924 --> 00:26:11.660 align:middle line:84%
married because we have
this thing that you

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:13.322 align:middle line:90%
don't want to scare guys off.

00:26:13.322 --> 00:26:14.530 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'm ready to get married.

00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:17.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is not the
world I live in anymore.

00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:19.930 align:middle line:84%
But some of my
students come to me

00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:21.690 align:middle line:84%
and they still have
the fear there.

00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:24.096 align:middle line:90%


00:26:24.096 --> 00:26:25.720 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes it's a
little bit hard for me

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.350 align:middle line:10%
to understand because
that's just so in the past.

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:28.020 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: It's interesting.

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:30.000 align:middle line:10%
When there's no fear
attached to something,

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.910 align:middle line:10%
we can pretty much
go away with anything

00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:34.529 align:middle line:10%
or say anything we want
because we're free from it.

00:26:34.529 --> 00:26:35.070 align:middle line:10%
So who cares?

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:35.736 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: Yeah.

00:26:35.736 --> 00:26:37.620 align:middle line:10%
Because you've stepped
into your power.

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:39.080 align:middle line:10%
That's what it is.

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.980 align:middle line:90%
So I declared it.

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And because I started
going around saying yes,

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:45.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking for my husband.

00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:46.490 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I want to get married.

00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:48.760 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I want to find the one.

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:50.870 align:middle line:90%
God was like, OK, Blaire.

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:52.161 align:middle line:90%
Now you'll get the answer.

00:26:52.161 --> 00:26:52.910 align:middle line:90%
And what happened?

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:54.250 align:middle line:90%
Well, I surrendered, right?

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:56.820 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that the thing that
we hear all the time?

00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:57.760 align:middle line:90%
You surrender.

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:00.584 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: But we can
go into obsession.

00:27:00.584 --> 00:27:01.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Yeah.

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:05.490 align:middle line:10%
I mean, you have to kind of
mix it between the working

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:08.060 align:middle line:10%
at it, the action,
and the surrendering.

00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:11.900 align:middle line:10%
It's like a fine dance.

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.780 align:middle line:10%
So it all came
together from there.

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:17.410 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: And the one
soulmate, another soulmate.

00:27:17.410 --> 00:27:19.080 align:middle line:10%
So we spoke of
soulmates earlier.

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:24.350 align:middle line:10%
And you said it kind of
propels your in your evolution,

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:27.990 align:middle line:10%
in your love evolution, I guess.

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:29.340 align:middle line:10%
Did you meet your husband?

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:31.464 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: I met my husband,
who was my twin flame.

00:27:31.464 --> 00:27:33.190 align:middle line:90%
I married him.

00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:36.250 align:middle line:84%
What happened was, was when I
started meeting the soulmates,

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:38.420 align:middle line:84%
things started going
really quickly for me

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:41.690 align:middle line:84%
because I started picking
up the lessons really quick.

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:43.800 align:middle line:84%
Because again, once
you're onto this,

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.105 align:middle line:84%
you're going into the
relationship not like,

00:27:46.105 --> 00:27:48.560 align:middle line:84%
oh, this is forever and ever--
which you hope for that,

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:50.110 align:middle line:90%
it's not like you're jaded.

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:52.320 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying,
again, if something

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:55.280 align:middle line:84%
goes a little bit
shady, then you're like,

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.400 align:middle line:90%
OK, let me pull back.

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:58.260 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if I want this.

00:27:58.260 --> 00:27:59.570 align:middle line:90%
You take the lesson.

00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:02.110 align:middle line:84%
You get your points like a
little game-- ding, ding, ding.

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:03.170 align:middle line:90%
And then you move on.

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:04.410 align:middle line:90%
You step up a level.

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:06.950 align:middle line:84%
You upgrade the type of
partner you're looking for.

00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:08.830 align:middle line:84%
At least this has
been the game for me.

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:11.470 align:middle line:84%
You upgrade the person
that you're looking for.

00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:12.740 align:middle line:90%
You attract a new person.

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:16.160 align:middle line:84%
So as soon as I dated that guy,
I got out of the relationship.

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:18.470 align:middle line:84%
Within the next
month or whatever,

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:19.960 align:middle line:90%
I attracted another soulmate.

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:21.515 align:middle line:90%
It was just bam, bam, bam, bam.

00:28:21.515 --> 00:28:24.510 align:middle line:90%


00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And then, so after I was through
with some of these soulmates,

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:30.190 align:middle line:84%
and I was in a long-term
relationship, which

00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:32.760 align:middle line:84%
is the longest I've ever been,
which was a year and a half.

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:34.551 align:middle line:84%
Which maybe is not so
long for some people,

00:28:34.551 --> 00:28:37.200 align:middle line:84%
but for me it was very
long at that time.

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.170 align:middle line:90%
I got out of that relationship.

00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't upset like I
was with other relationships

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:43.920 align:middle line:84%
because I had
found my true self.

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:46.580 align:middle line:90%
I found my real one, myself.

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I went
deeper into my healing.

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:53.350 align:middle line:84%
So then for three years after
that-- was it three years?

00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:54.910 align:middle line:90%
I went into deep healing.

00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's where my new
healer came in, my teacher.

00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:59.250 align:middle line:90%
We went deep into that stuff.

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And I just kept on
uncovering more and more.

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.820 align:middle line:84%
Then I said, OK I'm ready
for a partner again.

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:05.210 align:middle line:90%
I started doing my method.

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:08.190 align:middle line:84%
Because the thing is, is when
you learn the spiritual way

00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:11.225 align:middle line:84%
to attract the one, you're
never having the fear

00:29:11.225 --> 00:29:13.350 align:middle line:84%
that you're not going to
be able to find a partner.

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:14.140 align:middle line:90%
People break up.

00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:15.090 align:middle line:90%
People get divorced.

00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:16.256 align:middle line:90%
People cheat on one another.

00:29:16.256 --> 00:29:17.360 align:middle line:90%
Who knows what happens?

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:19.762 align:middle line:84%
You can't control
someone else's path.

00:29:19.762 --> 00:29:20.970 align:middle line:90%
But you don't have that fear.

00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:22.960 align:middle line:84%
You don't feel like you're
stuck in a relationship,

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:25.020 align:middle line:84%
that you have to settle
for things or compromise,

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:27.910 align:middle line:84%
because you know how to attract
a new partner if you want it.

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:30.770 align:middle line:84%
You know that this is
an unlimited universe.

00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:34.090 align:middle line:84%
So I attracted my
twin flame, which

00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:36.270 align:middle line:84%
we were both on
vacation in Florida.

00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:38.380 align:middle line:84%
He was from England,
I was from New Jersey.

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:41.145 align:middle line:84%
I mean, imagine meeting a
man from another country.

00:29:41.145 --> 00:29:42.520 align:middle line:84%
You're flying all
over the place,

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:45.810 align:middle line:84%
but this is not the
usual for most people.

00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:47.740 align:middle line:84%
But we were both
there on vacation.

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:49.310 align:middle line:90%
It was his last day.

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:51.600 align:middle line:90%
I got guided by my angels.

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And my guides
said, why don't you

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:55.114 align:middle line:84%
go hang out at this
hotel pool and pretend

00:29:55.114 --> 00:29:56.030 align:middle line:90%
like you're a tourist?

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:57.404 align:middle line:84%
And I never went
there pretending

00:29:57.404 --> 00:29:58.690 align:middle line:90%
like I was a tourist.

00:29:58.690 --> 00:29:59.830 align:middle line:90%
And that's how we met.

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:02.410 align:middle line:90%
We connected, and we hit it off.

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And a month later, he flew up
to New York City to visit me.

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:11.172 align:middle line:84%
And that was how that
relationship developed.

00:30:11.172 --> 00:30:12.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Do you
want me to propose?

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:13.535 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: You want me
to tell you-- [LAUGHS]

00:30:13.535 --> 00:30:13.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yeah.

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:15.955 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't see any
rings, so I wanted to know.

00:30:15.955 --> 00:30:16.621 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: Yeah.

00:30:16.621 --> 00:30:19.042 align:middle line:10%
I'm done with that relationship.

00:30:19.042 --> 00:30:20.500 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: How long
was the marriage?

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:21.730 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: Very short.

00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:22.290 align:middle line:10%
Very short.

00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:23.250 align:middle line:10%
A couple of months.

00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:28.020 align:middle line:10%
We were in a relationship for I
think it was a year and a half.

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:29.780 align:middle line:10%
I kind of, like,
lost count right now.

00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:31.910 align:middle line:10%
But we got married
towards I would

00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:35.850 align:middle line:10%
say the end of our relationship
because at that point,

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:37.330 align:middle line:10%
there was deep love between us.

00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:38.800 align:middle line:10%
There were problems I noticed.

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:40.300 align:middle line:10%
He didn't notice
the problems, or he

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:42.550 align:middle line:10%
didn't want to
see them, or what.

00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:44.200 align:middle line:10%
But it was the only
solution for us

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.040 align:middle line:10%
because we needed
his green card.

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:47.700 align:middle line:10%
We needed to be together.

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:50.269 align:middle line:10%
I wasn't going to move
to England at that time.

00:30:50.269 --> 00:30:51.560 align:middle line:10%
He was going to move over here.

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:52.870 align:middle line:10%
He needed to work.

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:57.550 align:middle line:10%
And for me, being my human
self, being fearful also,

00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:00.220 align:middle line:10%
I wasn't expanded enough to
think OK, well, maybe there's

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:01.550 align:middle line:10%
other ways that this can work.

00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:03.530 align:middle line:10%
I said, let's give
this a chance.

00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:05.090 align:middle line:10%
We'll get married.

00:31:05.090 --> 00:31:08.260 align:middle line:10%
And I said to him, we're
going to see how this goes.

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:11.450 align:middle line:10%
So it wasn't like a hardcore
commitment, I guess.

00:31:11.450 --> 00:31:13.929 align:middle line:10%
But I wanted to
give us a chance.

00:31:13.929 --> 00:31:14.512 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Yeah.

00:31:14.512 --> 00:31:15.845 align:middle line:10%
And you wanted to have the ring.

00:31:15.845 --> 00:31:16.595 align:middle line:10%
You got it.

00:31:16.595 --> 00:31:18.532 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: I got the ring.

00:31:18.532 --> 00:31:19.990 align:middle line:10%
But now I don't
want a ring at all.

00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:22.280 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: But it's interesting
that there was this fantasy.

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:24.750 align:middle line:10%
And then once it was done, it
was probably very different

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:26.020 align:middle line:10%
than what you would
have expected.

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:27.145 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: It was terrible.

00:31:27.145 --> 00:31:28.344 align:middle line:10%
It was terrible.

00:31:28.344 --> 00:31:30.510 align:middle line:10%
It was, like, it was the
worst thing, being married.

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:32.490 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I liked
being married as far

00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:34.260 align:middle line:10%
as I liked having a partner.

00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:36.880 align:middle line:10%
But he was at a
different pace than me

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:38.750 align:middle line:10%
with my spiritual
growth and healing.

00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:40.360 align:middle line:90%
He did not want to be doing it.

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:41.829 align:middle line:90%
I was hardcore doing it.

00:31:41.829 --> 00:31:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And what happens when you
have a match like that?

00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:47.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, one person expands
past the other person.

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And then you're kind of
pulling along this thing.

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:52.230 align:middle line:10%
And it's terrible.

00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:53.410 align:middle line:10%
So I had to let it go.

00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:54.270 align:middle line:10%
That was it.

00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:57.600 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: A lot of people know
jealousy in a relationship.

00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:00.494 align:middle line:10%
What is your
recommendation for that?

00:32:00.494 --> 00:32:02.430 align:middle line:10%
Especially with the
distance like that,

00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:04.456 align:middle line:10%
because you probably
were distance.

00:32:04.456 --> 00:32:06.330 align:middle line:10%
But even though if you
were not experiencing,

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:07.630 align:middle line:10%
how do you go with that?

00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:09.950 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of women,
I feel, have intuition,

00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:11.572 align:middle line:90%
and we have that in us.

00:32:11.572 --> 00:32:13.030 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we
don't know if it's

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:15.880 align:middle line:84%
our paranoiac side,
or unhealed side,

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:17.880 align:middle line:84%
or if it's really, truly
something there that we

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:20.474 align:middle line:90%
should follow a bit more on.

00:32:20.474 --> 00:32:21.140 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Yeah.

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:23.056 align:middle line:84%
You could definitely
play games with yourself,

00:32:23.056 --> 00:32:25.860 align:middle line:84%
being like is that my intuition
or is something really going

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:26.710 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:29.120 align:middle line:10%
I think if you're
feeling jealous,

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:31.330 align:middle line:10%
I would say that
something's going on.

00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:33.690 align:middle line:10%
I would say that
something's going on.

00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:35.890 align:middle line:10%
You know, again this is
why it's so helpful for you

00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:38.300 align:middle line:10%
to team up with a
healer or a teacher

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:40.480 align:middle line:10%
to have an expanded
view of things.

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:41.257 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Oh!

00:32:41.257 --> 00:32:42.340 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: You're a wild--

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:44.288 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Crazy cat.

00:32:44.288 --> 00:32:45.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Oh my God.

00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:47.054 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: OK.

00:32:47.054 --> 00:32:48.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: OK, back to this.

00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:51.788 align:middle line:90%


00:32:51.788 --> 00:32:53.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Did you see that jump?

00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:53.946 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the cat just
jumped, boom boom!

00:32:53.946 --> 00:32:55.071 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: I didn't see it.

00:32:55.071 --> 00:32:55.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:58.070 align:middle line:90%
I have to watch the replay.

00:32:58.070 --> 00:33:01.926 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: In slow motion, bluff!

00:33:01.926 --> 00:33:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Yeah,
so the jealousy.

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:05.941 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's really important
to have an outside view

00:33:05.941 --> 00:33:08.440 align:middle line:84%
because then you're going to
know if it's your insecurities,

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:10.460 align:middle line:84%
if it's your wounding,
if something else

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:11.850 align:middle line:90%
is going on here.

00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:13.410 align:middle line:84%
But I think that
you usually have

00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:15.930 align:middle line:90%
good reason for the jealousy.

00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:18.260 align:middle line:84%
It might be something
that your partner's doing.

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:20.430 align:middle line:84%
I used to have a
friend that used

00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:23.920 align:middle line:84%
to always attract
very jealous girls.

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And he would say, I'm
so innocent about it.

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.960 align:middle line:84%
Why is it happening
to me all the time?

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, number one, he
was cheating on them.

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And number two, he was
doing other shady things.

00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:36.367 align:middle line:84%
So he was making his
partners feel insecure,

00:33:36.367 --> 00:33:37.200 align:middle line:90%
and he was cheating.

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.223 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't even a good guy.

00:33:39.223 --> 00:33:40.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yeah.

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:41.940 align:middle line:90%
Say it, yeah.

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:45.050 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: So they were feeling
jealous for good reason,

00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:45.550 align:middle line:10%
you know?

00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:47.040 align:middle line:10%
So they weren't imagining it.

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:48.030 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Yeah, yeah.

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:50.470 align:middle line:10%
You have to take it,
validation, a little bit more,

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:53.090 align:middle line:10%
I feel, because women are
very-- and men, too-- but we're

00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:54.320 align:middle line:10%
very intuitive, all of us.

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:56.074 align:middle line:10%
And more and more these days.

00:33:56.074 --> 00:33:56.740 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: Yeah.

00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:59.810 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: So we can
follow that voice.

00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:00.940 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: You have to.

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:03.000 align:middle line:10%
You're your own best friend.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.880 align:middle line:10%
If you are betraying yourself
and selling yourself out

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:08.872 align:middle line:10%
for a guy or a girl,
saying-- because that's

00:34:08.872 --> 00:34:10.909 align:middle line:10%
what I did in my twin
flame relationship,

00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:12.679 align:middle line:10%
which was a pattern
that went back years

00:34:12.679 --> 00:34:13.679 align:middle line:10%
and years and years ago.

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:14.780 align:middle line:10%
And this is generations.

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:18.260 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I help people
heal generational stuff,

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:20.639 align:middle line:10%
that wounding that
goes passed down.

00:34:20.639 --> 00:34:23.560 align:middle line:10%
So with my relationship--
and I teach

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.520 align:middle line:10%
a lot from my
relationships because I've

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:26.540 align:middle line:10%
been through a lot.

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:31.050 align:middle line:10%
So I was not listening--

00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:31.800 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Your mom.

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:32.545 align:middle line:10%
Your mom was--

00:34:32.545 --> 00:34:35.400 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: Well, I was not
listening to my intuition.

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:36.860 align:middle line:10%
I was not honoring myself.

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:40.940 align:middle line:10%
Instead, I was loving him
more, loving our relationship

00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:43.690 align:middle line:10%
more than I was loving myself.

00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:44.304 align:middle line:10%
So I was--

00:34:44.304 --> 00:34:45.095 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: So common.

00:34:45.095 --> 00:34:46.840 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: --betraying myself.

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:49.429 align:middle line:10%
And that's something
that, a patterning

00:34:49.429 --> 00:34:52.178 align:middle line:10%
that I always saw my mom.

00:34:52.178 --> 00:34:53.719 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's a little
bit hard for me

00:34:53.719 --> 00:34:56.750 align:middle line:10%
to be speaking 100%
about her experience.

00:34:56.750 --> 00:35:00.560 align:middle line:10%
But the way that I interpret
it was that she always

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:03.230 align:middle line:10%
put other people before her.

00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:05.480 align:middle line:10%
She would always put my
father's needs before hers,

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:07.300 align:middle line:10%
make sure that my
father was happy

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:09.664 align:middle line:10%
before she was taking
care of, before she

00:35:09.664 --> 00:35:10.580 align:middle line:10%
was totally fulfilled.

00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:13.530 align:middle line:10%
Again, that's my experience
of her relationship.

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:15.720 align:middle line:10%
So that's what I
did in my marriage.

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:19.670 align:middle line:10%
I made sure that my husband
at the time was happy.

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:23.650 align:middle line:10%
He was having a hard
adjustment to being in America.

00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:25.870 align:middle line:10%
And it was lots of
cultural things.

00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:27.550 align:middle line:10%
And he wasn't working-- sorry.

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:29.780 align:middle line:10%
He wasn't working
at the time, too.

00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:32.420 align:middle line:10%
So he was under a lot of stress.

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:33.210 align:middle line:10%
Well, I was too.

00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:34.640 align:middle line:10%
I was in graduate school.

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:38.830 align:middle line:10%
I was adjusting to living
with him and the relationship.

00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:42.130 align:middle line:10%
But I wanted to make sure
he was more OK than I was.

00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:44.290 align:middle line:10%
That was my job,
just like my mom.

00:35:44.290 --> 00:35:46.710 align:middle line:10%
That stuff's healed now
thanks to my twin flame,

00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:48.800 align:middle line:10%
through the healing
through that.

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:49.550 align:middle line:10%
That's the beauty.

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:51.216 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: To make your
relationship work,

00:35:51.216 --> 00:35:52.890 align:middle line:10%
we do have to put ourself first?

00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:54.490 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: Always.

00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:55.250 align:middle line:10%
Always.

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:56.920 align:middle line:10%
That's not love
when you're, like,

00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:00.740 align:middle line:10%
trying to take
care of-- it's not.

00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:01.740 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: We think it is.

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:02.406 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: Yeah.

00:36:02.406 --> 00:36:03.710 align:middle line:10%
I mean, that's what we're told.

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:05.630 align:middle line:10%
Again, it's the wounding
that's passed down.

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:08.430 align:middle line:10%
It's the false beliefs
that are passed down.

00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:10.140 align:middle line:10%
You have to put yourself first.

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:11.680 align:middle line:10%
It's not a selfish thing.

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:13.630 align:middle line:10%
It's not a wrong thing.

00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:17.250 align:middle line:10%
Too many people lose
themselves in relationships.

00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:21.660 align:middle line:10%
And that's making your whole
world that guy or that girl.

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:23.510 align:middle line:10%
And that's you loving
the relationship more

00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:25.170 align:middle line:10%
than yourself.

00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:27.420 align:middle line:10%
You're number one
always and forever.

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:28.260 align:middle line:10%
You're number one.

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:29.160 align:middle line:10%
Your life.

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:31.800 align:middle line:10%
Do it.

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:32.910 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Thank you.

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:34.950 align:middle line:10%
Is there another
little thing that you

00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:37.380 align:middle line:10%
want to leave us with to
end this conversation?

00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:40.140 align:middle line:10%
I thank you for being so
straightforward in who

00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:41.190 align:middle line:10%
you are and spontaneous.

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:43.070 align:middle line:10%
This is inspiring
by itself, just

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:45.080 align:middle line:10%
to see you being in action.

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:45.622 align:middle line:10%
So thank you.

00:36:45.622 --> 00:36:46.496 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: Thank you.

00:36:46.496 --> 00:36:47.050 align:middle line:10%
I love it.

00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:48.000 align:middle line:10%
I love this stuff.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.930 align:middle line:10%
I could talk about it forever.

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:51.910 align:middle line:10%
Final notes.

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:54.210 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: A little final
note for all of us

00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:55.255 align:middle line:10%
in relationship or not.

00:36:55.255 --> 00:36:56.088 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: Pressure.

00:36:56.088 --> 00:36:57.250 align:middle line:90%
Pressure.

00:36:57.250 --> 00:36:59.603 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Love guru, what's our--

00:36:59.603 --> 00:37:00.490 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: I don't--

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:01.615 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Channel something.

00:37:01.615 --> 00:37:02.475 align:middle line:90%
Come on, right now.

00:37:02.475 --> 00:37:03.100 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: God.

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:04.060 align:middle line:90%
Come on, my guides.

00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:05.420 align:middle line:90%
Bring it to me.

00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:06.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Bring it to her.

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:09.140 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Tell me.

00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:10.070 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:11.920 align:middle line:90%
I think it's just heal yourself.

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:12.810 align:middle line:90%
Work on that.

00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:13.610 align:middle line:90%
It's worth it.

00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Go through the darkness
to get to the light.

00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:17.870 align:middle line:84%
There's a light at
the end of the tunnel.

00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And once you heal yourself,
the world is yours.

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:23.160 align:middle line:84%
You can create
anything you want.

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:25.390 align:middle line:84%
You could have
anything you want.

00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:26.830 align:middle line:90%
That's the truth.

00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:30.182 align:middle line:84%
That's the era I'm moving into
now and I'm so excited for it

00:37:30.182 --> 00:37:31.390 align:middle line:90%
because I've done my healing.

00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:32.130 align:middle line:90%
I've completed it.

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:33.480 align:middle line:84%
You can complete
your healing, too.

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:35.980 align:middle line:84%
People do it for years and years
and never get done with it.

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:36.915 align:middle line:90%
You can complete it.

00:37:36.915 --> 00:37:38.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Thank you, Blaire.

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:38.890 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: You're welcome.

00:37:38.890 --> 00:37:39.509 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:37:39.509 --> 00:37:41.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Big big
kisses to all of you

00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:42.464 align:middle line:90%
juicy co-creators out there.

00:37:42.464 --> 00:37:44.130 align:middle line:84%
Hope you have enjoyed
this conversation.

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:46.650 align:middle line:10%
Don't hesitate to add some
little comments underneath.

00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:48.900 align:middle line:10%
I send you much,
much love from Miami.

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:50.380 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: Yes, bye.

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:52.450 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Much love.

00:37:52.450 --> 00:38:02.067 align:middle line:90%
