[ Music ]

00:00:10.277 --> 00:00:12.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Hello my
[inaudible] graders Lilou here.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.617 align:middle line:84%
I am here in London
today with Joseph, hello.

00:00:16.617 --> 00:00:18.586 align:middle line:84%
>> Joseph Clough: Thank you
ever so much for having me here.

00:00:18.586 --> 00:00:21.755 align:middle line:84%
I'm so-I've been waiting
for this for so long now.

00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:24.458 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: You are the author-I'm
delighted you say that.

00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:25.826 align:middle line:90%
Oh my goodness.

00:00:25.826 --> 00:00:28.195 align:middle line:84%
You're in your 30's, you're
the author-you're 30 years old,

00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:30.297 align:middle line:84%
you just turned 30
and you're the author

00:00:30.297 --> 00:00:34.635 align:middle line:84%
of "Be Your Potential" and
you've been doing this work

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:36.303 align:middle line:90%
since you were 18 really.

00:00:36.303 --> 00:00:41.909 align:middle line:84%
You're already a master hypnos,
how do you call that, PNL?

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:43.978 align:middle line:84%
>> Joseph Clough:
NLP and hypnosis.

00:00:43.978 --> 00:00:45.146 align:middle line:90%
That's what I did.

00:00:45.146 --> 00:00:46.547 align:middle line:90%
That's what I do.

00:00:46.547 --> 00:00:49.817 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: That's so what you do
and I'm really looking forward

00:00:49.817 --> 00:00:52.720 align:middle line:84%
to talking about potential
because I feel it's,

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.524 align:middle line:84%
this is what this life is
about, living our potential.

00:00:56.524 --> 00:00:58.893 align:middle line:90%
How big is this potential?

00:00:58.893 --> 00:01:00.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Joseph Clough: Well
it's really unlimited.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.897 align:middle line:84%
I mean we are unlimited
in what we can do

00:01:02.897 --> 00:01:05.099 align:middle line:84%
and what we can be
and what we can have.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:08.068 align:middle line:84%
It's usually about just bring
our attention to our potential.

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:11.505 align:middle line:84%
When we do that, things start to
change so it's really unlimited.

00:01:11.505 --> 00:01:13.741 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So when you
say put our attention

00:01:13.741 --> 00:01:16.911 align:middle line:84%
on our potential,
where, where is that?

00:01:16.911 --> 00:01:18.145 align:middle line:90%
Is there a location?

00:01:18.145 --> 00:01:19.280 align:middle line:90%
Is there?

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.548 align:middle line:84%
>> Joseph Clough: Well
I'd really say that it's

00:01:20.548 --> 00:01:23.384 align:middle line:84%
about being conscious, conscious
living, being conscious

00:01:23.384 --> 00:01:26.587 align:middle line:84%
of what's happening right now
in this moment in our behaviors,

00:01:26.587 --> 00:01:29.557 align:middle line:84%
our beliefs, what kind
of mindsets we're having.

00:01:29.557 --> 00:01:30.824 align:middle line:90%
When we become conscious

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:33.827 align:middle line:84%
of maybe some things not
[inaudible] or saying is wrong,

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:35.095 align:middle line:90%
we can then make a change

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:37.397 align:middle line:84%
and put our attention
where we're heading.

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:39.900 align:middle line:84%
When we do that we start
to live our potential.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.803 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So your book,
your story, how does,

00:01:42.803 --> 00:01:44.305 align:middle line:90%
at first, how did it started?

00:01:44.305 --> 00:01:46.373 align:middle line:84%
What is your background
before we go

00:01:46.373 --> 00:01:48.576 align:middle line:84%
into the different
techniques that you,

00:01:48.576 --> 00:01:51.111 align:middle line:84%
that you would like
to offer to us?

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:54.581 align:middle line:84%
What, what's your story because
it's at a pretty young age

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:56.183 align:middle line:90%
when you went into this.

00:01:56.183 --> 00:01:57.585 align:middle line:84%
>> Joseph Clough: Yeah, I mean
if we go even further back

00:01:57.585 --> 00:02:00.154 align:middle line:84%
from that, ever since
I was a child I used

00:02:00.154 --> 00:02:01.655 align:middle line:90%
to be so unconfident.

00:02:01.655 --> 00:02:04.124 align:middle line:84%
I used to blush; I was like
a professional blusher.

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:09.028 align:middle line:84%
I'd get red all the time and I
really struggled with confidence

00:02:09.028 --> 00:02:12.399 align:middle line:84%
and low self-esteem, all the
way through up to my teens,

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:15.336 align:middle line:84%
and then at 18 years old I
decided that something had

00:02:15.336 --> 00:02:17.872 align:middle line:84%
to change and only I
could make that change.

00:02:17.872 --> 00:02:19.073 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And you
made the decision?

00:02:19.073 --> 00:02:22.076 align:middle line:84%
Nobody else in your
surroundings said something?

00:02:22.076 --> 00:02:24.445 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: Well my Dad
said well, he could see

00:02:24.445 --> 00:02:25.913 align:middle line:84%
that something wasn't
quite right

00:02:25.913 --> 00:02:28.215 align:middle line:84%
so then he said well why don't
you go in a hypnosis course,

00:02:28.215 --> 00:02:31.418 align:middle line:84%
which was very interesting,
it's very foreign to me

00:02:31.418 --> 00:02:35.623 align:middle line:84%
but he practiced it as a hobby,
and his intention was just

00:02:35.623 --> 00:02:38.826 align:middle line:84%
to get some head space, just
to take a week out and just see

00:02:38.826 --> 00:02:40.526 align:middle line:90%
where I'm heading in my life.

00:02:40.526 --> 00:02:42.863 align:middle line:84%
And at that point I
had to make a decision.

00:02:42.863 --> 00:02:45.232 align:middle line:84%
I had to decide that
something had to change

00:02:45.232 --> 00:02:46.533 align:middle line:84%
and only I could
make that change.

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:48.969 align:middle line:84%
I had to instigate
the first steps.

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:52.973 align:middle line:84%
So I took the leap, went on
this hypnosis course at 18

00:02:52.973 --> 00:02:56.110 align:middle line:84%
and I remember driving, it was
actually based in Scarborough

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.581 align:middle line:84%
in England, it was quite
North, and I traveled up there

00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:03.584 align:middle line:84%
on this big journey and on the
way back I thought this is what

00:03:03.584 --> 00:03:04.652 align:middle line:90%
I want to do.

00:03:04.652 --> 00:03:06.387 align:middle line:84%
I realized that I can
connect to myself;

00:03:06.387 --> 00:03:09.423 align:middle line:84%
I can help people
connect with themselves

00:03:09.423 --> 00:03:10.924 align:middle line:84%
and really make powerful
changes.

00:03:10.924 --> 00:03:14.762 align:middle line:84%
It's always there and I knew
that because I had issues,

00:03:14.762 --> 00:03:18.032 align:middle line:84%
and I let go of big issues like
low self-esteem and blushing

00:03:18.032 --> 00:03:21.969 align:middle line:84%
and self-consciousness, but if
I can do it anyone can do it.

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:25.372 align:middle line:84%
It's all there within us we
just have to make it happen.

00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:27.408 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So that's like the
potential is already there

00:03:27.408 --> 00:03:29.410 align:middle line:90%
but what's blocking us then?

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.811 align:middle line:90%
What was blocking you?

00:03:30.811 --> 00:03:33.747 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: I would probably put
it down to life's experiences.

00:03:33.747 --> 00:03:36.784 align:middle line:84%
You know life happens
to us, stuff happens,

00:03:36.784 --> 00:03:42.122 align:middle line:84%
and when it hits us we try to
react to the best that we can

00:03:42.122 --> 00:03:44.892 align:middle line:84%
but usually when life happens
or big stuff happens we're

00:03:44.892 --> 00:03:50.130 align:middle line:84%
under stress, so we make certain
decisions based on stress,

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.234 align:middle line:84%
so we're not very clear
minded and because

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:57.371 align:middle line:84%
of experience we then
start to get programmed

00:03:57.371 --> 00:03:58.605 align:middle line:90%
into having bad behaviors.

00:03:58.605 --> 00:04:01.208 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there's a
great hypnotherapist,

00:04:01.208 --> 00:04:02.876 align:middle line:84%
it was called Dr.
Milton Erickson.

00:04:02.876 --> 00:04:04.078 align:middle line:90%
Do you know him at all?

00:04:04.078 --> 00:04:06.847 align:middle line:84%
Well he ultimately said
that patients are patients

00:04:06.847 --> 00:04:09.216 align:middle line:84%
because they're out to
[inaudible] themselves.

00:04:09.216 --> 00:04:12.553 align:middle line:84%
They've been programmed
by life's experiences.

00:04:12.553 --> 00:04:14.655 align:middle line:84%
And even take it further
these days when you think

00:04:14.655 --> 00:04:18.559 align:middle line:84%
of like society or the
magazines, the news,

00:04:18.559 --> 00:04:22.629 align:middle line:84%
of how we should be, we've got
to look a certain way and it's

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:26.133 align:middle line:84%
like we start to
live by experience

00:04:26.133 --> 00:04:28.702 align:middle line:84%
or by what people say
we should be like,

00:04:28.702 --> 00:04:30.571 align:middle line:90%
so we become disconnected.

00:04:30.571 --> 00:04:33.474 align:middle line:84%
So being our potential
is ultimate connecting

00:04:33.474 --> 00:04:36.710 align:middle line:84%
to a truest you that there is,
like the source of who you are,

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.612 align:middle line:84%
your true beingness
and when you come

00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:42.082 align:middle line:84%
from that place you make
any change that you desire,

00:04:42.082 --> 00:04:45.719 align:middle line:84%
and that's when the
magic really happens.

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:47.054 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: [inaudible]
when we're not confident

00:04:47.054 --> 00:04:49.857 align:middle line:84%
or when there's those
fears and these troubles,

00:04:49.857 --> 00:04:51.791 align:middle line:90%
we lose this confidence.

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:52.626 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:04:52.626 --> 00:04:54.261 align:middle line:90%
We can't just be.

00:04:54.261 --> 00:04:56.697 align:middle line:90%
There's so much panic and fears.

00:04:56.697 --> 00:04:59.767 align:middle line:84%
I remember losing my job
here in London years ago

00:04:59.767 --> 00:05:01.535 align:middle line:84%
and then finding myself
without any money.

00:05:01.535 --> 00:05:03.537 align:middle line:90%
The panic was so intense.

00:05:03.537 --> 00:05:04.571 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it?

00:05:04.571 --> 00:05:06.407 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: That's life
experience isn't it?

00:05:06.407 --> 00:05:08.609 align:middle line:84%
It just happens and
sometimes when we are

00:05:08.609 --> 00:05:12.112 align:middle line:84%
in stress we make certain
decisions about ourselves.

00:05:12.112 --> 00:05:16.950 align:middle line:84%
Say for example if I was
in London at that time

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.153 align:middle line:84%
and I lost my job, I could
come out with the belief

00:05:19.153 --> 00:05:20.988 align:middle line:84%
that well obviously
I'm not good enough.

00:05:20.988 --> 00:05:22.556 align:middle line:90%
I'm not worthy.

00:05:22.556 --> 00:05:24.224 align:middle line:84%
I'm never going to
able to get a good job

00:05:24.224 --> 00:05:25.993 align:middle line:84%
or I can't have the
great relationship,

00:05:25.993 --> 00:05:29.730 align:middle line:84%
so through that stress we can
make decisions about ourselves

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.166 align:middle line:90%
on a personal identity level.

00:05:32.166 --> 00:05:35.135 align:middle line:84%
So that's when issues can
really come into play and then

00:05:35.135 --> 00:05:38.972 align:middle line:84%
that can become a habit,
so it becomes-when you have

00:05:38.972 --> 00:05:40.541 align:middle line:84%
that consistent negative
thoughts

00:05:40.541 --> 00:05:44.078 align:middle line:84%
or beliefs system it becomes
ingrained in our neurology.

00:05:44.078 --> 00:05:47.314 align:middle line:84%
So through life experiences
we can get programmed

00:05:47.314 --> 00:05:48.682 align:middle line:90%
to have issues.

00:05:48.682 --> 00:05:50.317 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So you're saying we're
programmed and there's a way

00:05:50.317 --> 00:05:53.687 align:middle line:84%
to deprogram ourselves
and recreate,

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:56.190 align:middle line:84%
like some people say,
new Neuro pathways.

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.524 align:middle line:90%
Is that what's happening?

00:05:57.524 --> 00:06:01.428 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what's actually on
the physical level happening.

00:06:01.428 --> 00:06:02.830 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.600 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: Sure, so if for example
we have an issue in our life.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.168 align:middle line:84%
Let's just say someone
had low self-esteem.

00:06:08.168 --> 00:06:09.837 align:middle line:90%
I don't feel worthy.

00:06:09.837 --> 00:06:11.738 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Most of us I
guess on some levels.

00:06:11.738 --> 00:06:13.040 align:middle line:90%
[Laughing]

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.308 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: I think it's probably
one of the biggest things

00:06:14.308 --> 00:06:16.577 align:middle line:84%
out there isn't it, where
we don't feel good enough,

00:06:16.577 --> 00:06:19.746 align:middle line:84%
we don't feel worthy and
we have this experience,

00:06:19.746 --> 00:06:22.015 align:middle line:84%
and we have that for a
continued amount of time.

00:06:22.015 --> 00:06:23.750 align:middle line:84%
Our thoughts become
trained that way and that's

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.419 align:middle line:84%
where the Neuro networks
start to kind

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:27.387 align:middle line:84%
of fire off the same
type of connections.

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:30.958 align:middle line:84%
Even physically your body feels
low when you're depressed.

00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:34.495 align:middle line:84%
So once you start to make
a change and you can do

00:06:34.495 --> 00:06:37.364 align:middle line:84%
that by many ways
by just learning,

00:06:37.364 --> 00:06:39.867 align:middle line:84%
getting your unconscious mind
to learn new ways of being.

00:06:39.867 --> 00:06:42.903 align:middle line:84%
Let's consider this
for a second.

00:06:42.903 --> 00:06:46.707 align:middle line:84%
What is the intention
behind not feeling worthy

00:06:46.707 --> 00:06:47.940 align:middle line:90%
or not good enough?

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.109 align:middle line:90%
Because I believe everything

00:06:49.109 --> 00:06:51.011 align:middle line:84%
that we have inside has
a positive intention

00:06:51.011 --> 00:06:52.613 align:middle line:90%
as to why we have it.

00:06:52.613 --> 00:06:54.781 align:middle line:84%
Now to me something like
not being good enough is

00:06:54.781 --> 00:06:57.985 align:middle line:84%
like a protection mechanism
because if I try to go

00:06:57.985 --> 00:07:02.256 align:middle line:84%
for that job and I fail
again or I get sacked again,

00:07:02.256 --> 00:07:04.258 align:middle line:84%
that's too much stress for
me to bear to it's better

00:07:04.258 --> 00:07:06.360 align:middle line:90%
to stay in my comfort zone.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.195 align:middle line:90%
So therefore, my body thinks,

00:07:08.195 --> 00:07:10.097 align:middle line:84%
my mind thinks it's
better to be where I am.

00:07:10.097 --> 00:07:11.431 align:middle line:90%
It's a safe way of being.

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:13.901 align:middle line:84%
It's a safer way of being
than being out there.

00:07:13.901 --> 00:07:18.605 align:middle line:84%
So that's the reason as to why
the mind will keep these issues

00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:20.607 align:middle line:90%
on a mind, body, cell level.

00:07:20.607 --> 00:07:21.808 align:middle line:90%
But once we start

00:07:21.808 --> 00:07:23.277 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Then intention
would be to protect.

00:07:23.277 --> 00:07:27.514 align:middle line:84%
What would be the intention
of-what is the positive

00:07:27.514 --> 00:07:29.983 align:middle line:90%
intention then behind that?

00:07:29.983 --> 00:07:31.818 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: I would say
it's protection.

00:07:31.818 --> 00:07:35.255 align:middle line:84%
It keeps us from going out there
and experiencing that again.

00:07:35.255 --> 00:07:37.558 align:middle line:84%
I mean if you think of like
saying another example would be

00:07:37.558 --> 00:07:38.725 align:middle line:90%
like a phobia.

00:07:38.725 --> 00:07:40.027 align:middle line:90%
Why do people have phobias?

00:07:40.027 --> 00:07:41.428 align:middle line:90%
It's a protection mechanism.

00:07:41.428 --> 00:07:44.097 align:middle line:84%
It's like the body thinks there
something to be scared there.

00:07:44.097 --> 00:07:45.365 align:middle line:90%
And you think of anxiety,

00:07:45.365 --> 00:07:47.234 align:middle line:84%
we think of all the things
we don't want to happen

00:07:47.234 --> 00:07:50.904 align:middle line:84%
because we try to-you could
say that preplan all things

00:07:50.904 --> 00:07:54.741 align:middle line:84%
which could go wrong so if it
does happen we've got a strategy

00:07:54.741 --> 00:07:58.745 align:middle line:84%
to deal with it, so everything
has a positive intention

00:07:58.745 --> 00:08:00.914 align:middle line:84%
but when you connect
to that intention,

00:08:00.914 --> 00:08:03.617 align:middle line:84%
let go of the behavior and come
up with a new way of being,

00:08:03.617 --> 00:08:06.286 align:middle line:84%
then we've really
started to make changes.

00:08:06.286 --> 00:08:10.357 align:middle line:84%
And when we do that that's
when the mind and body starts

00:08:10.357 --> 00:08:12.192 align:middle line:90%
to reconnect in a new way.

00:08:12.192 --> 00:08:15.295 align:middle line:84%
So have the thoughts, have the
beliefs, have the resources,

00:08:15.295 --> 00:08:17.965 align:middle line:90%
the behaviors and then over time

00:08:17.965 --> 00:08:21.401 align:middle line:84%
that becomes the new
constant way of being

00:08:21.401 --> 00:08:23.403 align:middle line:84%
and we're still being
safe as well.

00:08:23.403 --> 00:08:25.439 align:middle line:90%
I mean really think about it.

00:08:25.439 --> 00:08:26.907 align:middle line:90%
If you had absolute self-worth

00:08:26.907 --> 00:08:29.309 align:middle line:84%
and you felt absolutely
good enough

00:08:29.309 --> 00:08:33.580 align:middle line:84%
and you felt absolutely whole
and aligned, that's a safe way

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:34.580 align:middle line:90%
of being in the world.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.349 align:middle line:90%
That's when we feel safe.

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:39.786 align:middle line:84%
So when we change our thoughts
and we make those kinds

00:08:39.786 --> 00:08:42.989 align:middle line:84%
of changes then we're
going to be safer

00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:44.523 align:middle line:90%
than ever having that old issue.

00:08:44.523 --> 00:08:48.195 align:middle line:84%
So in doing that, there's real
safety but with happiness too.

00:08:48.195 --> 00:08:52.165 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So in a situation like
losing a job what could be the,

00:08:52.165 --> 00:08:57.137 align:middle line:84%
the fears are there, the panic
starts, what could be the things

00:08:57.137 --> 00:09:00.807 align:middle line:84%
that we tell ourselves or the
work that you suggest to do in,

00:09:00.807 --> 00:09:02.476 align:middle line:84%
to open the potential
right there?

00:09:02.476 --> 00:09:04.511 align:middle line:84%
Because I guess it's
moment by moment,

00:09:04.511 --> 00:09:06.613 align:middle line:90%
in the moment when it happens.

00:09:06.613 --> 00:09:09.549 align:middle line:84%
As soon as possible to see
that this is happening,

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:11.918 align:middle line:84%
this is going on, the
vicious circle is on.

00:09:11.918 --> 00:09:15.122 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: Ideally it would be
great to be able to consider

00:09:15.122 --> 00:09:17.691 align:middle line:84%
that in the moment but
it is very hard isn't it?

00:09:17.691 --> 00:09:19.660 align:middle line:90%
All this stuff is happening.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:24.164 align:middle line:84%
But the key is that most people
think that that is what life is.

00:09:24.164 --> 00:09:27.968 align:middle line:84%
We go for experiences; we
make these types of decisions.

00:09:27.968 --> 00:09:29.569 align:middle line:84%
If I was-when I was
writing the book

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:33.373 align:middle line:84%
"Be Your Potential" I was just
writing it and this quote came

00:09:33.373 --> 00:09:35.642 align:middle line:84%
to my mind which I just
thought of and it was

00:09:35.642 --> 00:09:38.245 align:middle line:84%
"Rather being a product to
the life", say the product

00:09:38.245 --> 00:09:41.214 align:middle line:84%
of your experience, say the
product of your experience

00:09:41.214 --> 00:09:44.084 align:middle line:84%
in the job or losing a job
or a relationship going wrong

00:09:44.084 --> 00:09:46.353 align:middle line:84%
or an addiction, "Rather
than being a product

00:09:46.353 --> 00:09:49.523 align:middle line:84%
of life allow life to
be a product of you".

00:09:49.523 --> 00:09:52.626 align:middle line:84%
So everything you see in
your world becomes a product

00:09:52.626 --> 00:09:55.696 align:middle line:84%
of what you've created in
the most empowering way.

00:09:55.696 --> 00:09:59.332 align:middle line:84%
So when you make that decision,
the I'm going to be the cause

00:09:59.332 --> 00:10:01.902 align:middle line:84%
of my results, I'm going
to take responsibility,

00:10:01.902 --> 00:10:03.537 align:middle line:84%
rather pushing outside
my awareness

00:10:03.537 --> 00:10:07.140 align:middle line:84%
and say oh it was my bosses
fault, I didn't like that person

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:09.042 align:middle line:84%
or I didn't, it was
my relationship

00:10:09.042 --> 00:10:12.679 align:middle line:84%
or it was my ex-partners fault
or it's the economy right now,

00:10:12.679 --> 00:10:15.415 align:middle line:84%
that's why I can't do
anything, rather pushing outside

00:10:15.415 --> 00:10:18.685 align:middle line:84%
of our awareness we've got
to take ownership over it.

00:10:18.685 --> 00:10:21.588 align:middle line:84%
We've got to take responsibility
and when we do that's

00:10:21.588 --> 00:10:24.691 align:middle line:84%
when change happens, because
now we're changing the direction

00:10:24.691 --> 00:10:26.093 align:middle line:90%
of the flow.

00:10:26.093 --> 00:10:28.895 align:middle line:84%
Rather than it just happening
to us we're allowing it to go

00:10:28.895 --> 00:10:31.431 align:middle line:84%
and be pushed out into
the world and reality.

00:10:31.431 --> 00:10:33.400 align:middle line:90%
So therefore we're in charge.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.470 align:middle line:84%
As soon as we make that decision
we're on the right step.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:39.005 align:middle line:84%
That's the first step
and then we've got to put

00:10:39.005 --> 00:10:40.640 align:middle line:84%
out attention where
it needs to be.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.009 align:middle line:90%
So what do we really want?

00:10:43.009 --> 00:10:45.479 align:middle line:84%
How could we learn from
this, which once learned,

00:10:45.479 --> 00:10:47.848 align:middle line:84%
the very nature of that
learning will allow me

00:10:47.848 --> 00:10:49.382 align:middle line:90%
to grow as a person.

00:10:49.382 --> 00:10:53.720 align:middle line:84%
So despite how bad
maybe that event was,

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.322 align:middle line:84%
what can I really
learn from this?

00:10:55.322 --> 00:10:58.325 align:middle line:84%
And when I get the learning
from it, therefore I'm growing

00:10:58.325 --> 00:11:01.695 align:middle line:84%
as a person, that keeps me
safe and therefore I don't need

00:11:01.695 --> 00:11:05.265 align:middle line:84%
that limiting belief or that
conflict because I'm learning

00:11:05.265 --> 00:11:07.701 align:middle line:84%
and that means my body's
being safer than ever as well.

00:11:07.701 --> 00:11:10.937 align:middle line:84%
So it's really about evolving
ourselves and learning

00:11:10.937 --> 00:11:14.141 align:middle line:84%
from experiences so
we then grow from them

00:11:14.141 --> 00:11:15.976 align:middle line:90%
and get better because of it.

00:11:15.976 --> 00:11:20.647 align:middle line:84%
I mean just for another
example, my blushing back then,

00:11:20.647 --> 00:11:23.650 align:middle line:84%
my low self-esteem was
the best thing ever.

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:26.419 align:middle line:90%
Now back at the time, terrible,

00:11:26.419 --> 00:11:30.090 align:middle line:84%
but because of that
situation happening and then

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:32.759 align:middle line:84%
because of my learning
from it it's allowed me

00:11:32.759 --> 00:11:34.327 align:middle line:90%
to do what I do now.

00:11:34.327 --> 00:11:36.296 align:middle line:84%
If I didn't have it I wouldn't
be doing what I'm doing.

00:11:36.296 --> 00:11:37.998 align:middle line:84%
I'd be doing the job
that I really disliked

00:11:37.998 --> 00:11:39.499 align:middle line:90%
when I was 18 years old.

00:11:39.499 --> 00:11:41.234 align:middle line:84%
I would have just
been that person.

00:11:41.234 --> 00:11:43.437 align:middle line:84%
So I can be thankful
sometimes for the issues.

00:11:43.437 --> 00:11:46.973 align:middle line:84%
I mean maybe because when
you had your experience

00:11:46.973 --> 00:11:49.376 align:middle line:84%
with your job, it's
allowed you to be able

00:11:49.376 --> 00:11:53.213 align:middle line:84%
to share all this information
to millions around the world

00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:55.749 align:middle line:84%
and think about how many people
you've empowered personally.

00:11:55.749 --> 00:11:58.752 align:middle line:84%
Now that's amazing and therefore
we can sometimes feel a bit

00:11:58.752 --> 00:12:05.058 align:middle line:84%
grateful for having gone through
to pass onto others as well.

00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:11.498 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: How does
that link with the NLP,

00:12:11.498 --> 00:12:13.700 align:middle line:90%
Neuro Linguistic Programming?

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:15.402 align:middle line:84%
Is that right, because
in England a lot

00:12:15.402 --> 00:12:16.870 align:middle line:90%
of people talk about it.

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:19.873 align:middle line:84%
This is not really a topic
that I've covered that much.

00:12:19.873 --> 00:12:22.108 align:middle line:90%
Here and there a little bit but,

00:12:22.108 --> 00:12:25.912 align:middle line:84%
but all week here I mean
this topic keeps on coming

00:12:25.912 --> 00:12:28.815 align:middle line:84%
up so why are the British
so crazy about this?

00:12:28.815 --> 00:12:30.650 align:middle line:90%
Tell us. All around the world,

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:34.154 align:middle line:84%
I know but here I remember
hearing the founder

00:12:34.154 --> 00:12:35.822 align:middle line:84%
of this didn't he
come to London?

00:12:35.822 --> 00:12:37.357 align:middle line:90%
Is he still alive?

00:12:37.357 --> 00:12:41.261 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: Yeah it was created by
two people, Richard Bandler

00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:45.999 align:middle line:84%
and John Grinder, and yeah
Richard Bandler is more

00:12:45.999 --> 00:12:47.701 align:middle line:90%
well-known I think.

00:12:47.701 --> 00:12:49.035 align:middle line:84%
He's got a lot more
stuff out there

00:12:49.035 --> 00:12:51.304 align:middle line:84%
at the moment although Grinder
does lots of great things

00:12:51.304 --> 00:12:54.875 align:middle line:84%
as well, but ultimately
they modeled people.

00:12:54.875 --> 00:12:57.210 align:middle line:84%
So by modeled I mean they
learned from the best

00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:00.146 align:middle line:84%
of the best, like they
learned from Gregory Bateson.

00:13:00.146 --> 00:13:04.017 align:middle line:84%
He was a great man and just
learning about information

00:13:04.017 --> 00:13:05.552 align:middle line:90%
about how the world is.

00:13:05.552 --> 00:13:07.754 align:middle line:84%
Also they learned
from Virginia Satir

00:13:07.754 --> 00:13:10.557 align:middle line:84%
who was a great psychotherapist
and they also learned

00:13:10.557 --> 00:13:13.426 align:middle line:84%
from Dr. Milton Erickson
who was a hypnotherapist.

00:13:13.426 --> 00:13:18.198 align:middle line:84%
And they realized that there's
many forms of therapeutic change

00:13:18.198 --> 00:13:22.435 align:middle line:84%
which we can learn from which
once maybe combined learn from

00:13:22.435 --> 00:13:26.873 align:middle line:84%
and kind of integrated can
allow us to make changes.

00:13:26.873 --> 00:13:29.676 align:middle line:84%
So NLP stands for Neuro
Linguistic Programming

00:13:29.676 --> 00:13:32.979 align:middle line:84%
and to me it's like well,
we're communicating back

00:13:32.979 --> 00:13:34.814 align:middle line:90%
to our own conscious mind.

00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:36.583 align:middle line:90%
I mean it's really another way.

00:13:36.583 --> 00:13:38.985 align:middle line:84%
If you could change
consciously you would right?

00:13:38.985 --> 00:13:43.323 align:middle line:84%
If you had an issue in your life
like anxiety or fears or doubts,

00:13:43.323 --> 00:13:46.459 align:middle line:84%
if you could consciously
change you would be able

00:13:46.459 --> 00:13:48.628 align:middle line:90%
to do it just like that.

00:13:48.628 --> 00:13:51.765 align:middle line:84%
But if you cannot it must mean
your unconscious mind is running

00:13:51.765 --> 00:13:53.099 align:middle line:90%
the issue.

00:13:53.099 --> 00:13:56.803 align:middle line:84%
So therefore NLP and things
like hypnosis or some forms

00:13:56.803 --> 00:13:59.873 align:middle line:84%
of psychology is working with
the unconscious minds as well.

00:13:59.873 --> 00:14:02.309 align:middle line:84%
So you gain the conscious
and the unconscious

00:14:02.309 --> 00:14:04.945 align:middle line:84%
and therefore you're being
connected as a whole and that's

00:14:04.945 --> 00:14:07.480 align:middle line:84%
where change begins
to happen as well.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.282 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So there
is-you go backwards.

00:14:09.282 --> 00:14:13.386 align:middle line:84%
What is the technique
[inaudible] you actually rewind?

00:14:13.386 --> 00:14:15.288 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it something like
that in the process?

00:14:15.288 --> 00:14:18.358 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: There are a few processes
like that but personally

00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:19.492 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: You practice it yeah.

00:14:19.492 --> 00:14:21.294 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: It's about
changing the now.

00:14:21.294 --> 00:14:23.730 align:middle line:84%
Life's happened,
experiences happened

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:26.333 align:middle line:84%
and we can always know
why things happen.

00:14:26.333 --> 00:14:30.537 align:middle line:84%
We can analyze so many things
until we're a professional

00:14:30.537 --> 00:14:33.206 align:middle line:84%
and why we have the problem,
but we still keep them.

00:14:33.206 --> 00:14:35.475 align:middle line:84%
So to me it's about
changing the now.

00:14:35.475 --> 00:14:38.311 align:middle line:84%
If you change your thoughts now,
if you change your beliefs now

00:14:38.311 --> 00:14:41.414 align:middle line:84%
by learning from it and
making those powerful changes,

00:14:41.414 --> 00:14:46.252 align:middle line:84%
by putting your thoughts to
the resources that you want

00:14:46.252 --> 00:14:49.155 align:middle line:84%
and learn in general, you're
going to change the now

00:14:49.155 --> 00:14:50.457 align:middle line:90%
and therefore your future.

00:14:50.457 --> 00:14:53.927 align:middle line:84%
And also in the now you
change how you see the past.

00:14:53.927 --> 00:14:55.362 align:middle line:84%
Because we can't
change the past,

00:14:55.362 --> 00:14:57.230 align:middle line:84%
we can only change our
relationship to it,

00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:01.801 align:middle line:84%
so by changing the now I think
that's the most powerful aspect

00:15:01.801 --> 00:15:05.438 align:middle line:84%
because the now becomes
the new, the new past

00:15:05.438 --> 00:15:07.607 align:middle line:84%
and therefore the new
direction where we're heading.

00:15:07.607 --> 00:15:10.677 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Yeah because there
is only now, this eternal now.

00:15:10.677 --> 00:15:12.345 align:middle line:90%
I love it when people say that.

00:15:12.345 --> 00:15:14.614 align:middle line:84%
This eternal now because
it's happening all the time

00:15:14.614 --> 00:15:17.150 align:middle line:84%
but you say the present
moment, it's gone.

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:17.984 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: That's right.

00:15:17.984 --> 00:15:19.919 align:middle line:90%
It's really the past isn't it?

00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:23.556 align:middle line:84%
I mean yeah, living in the now
is just the most powerful thing.

00:15:23.556 --> 00:15:26.526 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So not thinking
of the future, not,

00:15:26.526 --> 00:15:30.096 align:middle line:84%
no setting goals anymore because
I know you mentioned this.

00:15:30.096 --> 00:15:33.400 align:middle line:84%
I saw on your website from
previous, setting goals

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.135 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning of
the year but you're not

00:15:35.135 --> 00:15:37.037 align:middle line:90%
so much about that huh?

00:15:37.037 --> 00:15:38.405 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: No, here's
my view on things.

00:15:38.405 --> 00:15:41.241 align:middle line:84%
I love living in the
now but we also live

00:15:41.241 --> 00:15:43.443 align:middle line:90%
in a real time based world.

00:15:43.443 --> 00:15:47.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean today I had to
be here at some time.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.681 align:middle line:90%
If I was just living

00:15:48.681 --> 00:15:51.017 align:middle line:84%
in the moment I'm probably just
wandering around London still

00:15:51.017 --> 00:15:52.519 align:middle line:84%
because I'm just living
purely in the moment,

00:15:52.519 --> 00:15:55.622 align:middle line:84%
which would be wonderful but I'd
miss this wonderful opportunity.

00:15:55.622 --> 00:16:01.061 align:middle line:84%
So realistically we live in the
now but we also live in time.

00:16:01.061 --> 00:16:03.630 align:middle line:90%
So how can we develop a balance?

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:05.265 align:middle line:84%
And I've personally
thought of a,

00:16:05.265 --> 00:16:08.201 align:middle line:84%
what I think is a powerful
way of getting both.

00:16:08.201 --> 00:16:11.604 align:middle line:84%
Now imagine that when you
wake up in the morning,

00:16:11.604 --> 00:16:14.007 align:middle line:84%
we can do the whole be
grateful because we know

00:16:14.007 --> 00:16:17.177 align:middle line:84%
when we're grateful we
set our emotional states,

00:16:17.177 --> 00:16:20.647 align:middle line:84%
but if you were to maybe
rehearse how you'd like your day

00:16:20.647 --> 00:16:23.716 align:middle line:84%
to go, so you see in your mind,
you paint wonderful pictures

00:16:23.716 --> 00:16:27.120 align:middle line:84%
of what you'd like to do,
which is like your future

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.855 align:middle line:90%
so you're planning your future,

00:16:28.855 --> 00:16:32.058 align:middle line:84%
and in the evening you
review your day by learning.

00:16:32.058 --> 00:16:34.327 align:middle line:84%
So you think what can
I learn from my day?

00:16:34.327 --> 00:16:35.528 align:middle line:90%
So we're dealing with the past.

00:16:35.528 --> 00:16:39.065 align:middle line:84%
So we've got future
and past all covered

00:16:39.065 --> 00:16:41.601 align:middle line:84%
and then throughout the day,
in this time based world,

00:16:41.601 --> 00:16:44.771 align:middle line:84%
every hour or so we take two
or three minutes to just be

00:16:44.771 --> 00:16:48.408 align:middle line:84%
in the moment, to be in our
experience, to notice a space

00:16:48.408 --> 00:16:51.945 align:middle line:84%
between each other, to be able
to take in the wonderful colors

00:16:51.945 --> 00:16:54.280 align:middle line:84%
or the wonderful
sounds, and by doing

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:58.351 align:middle line:84%
so we're covering the past,
the future and the now

00:16:58.351 --> 00:17:01.988 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's the
great way of living in time

00:17:01.988 --> 00:17:03.690 align:middle line:90%
but also living in the now.

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:07.060 align:middle line:84%
So really preplanning your
future in the morning,

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:11.030 align:middle line:84%
learning from your day and
then being in the moment,

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:14.067 align:middle line:84%
therefore you've got
that wonderful flow.

00:17:14.067 --> 00:17:19.304 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And how do you see
goals or dreams or desires

00:17:19.304 --> 00:17:20.840 align:middle line:84%
or things that you
want to manifest?

00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:24.577 align:middle line:84%
How do you view that
coming into our experience?

00:17:24.577 --> 00:17:29.849 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: Well to me goals are
suggestions to our mind and body

00:17:29.849 --> 00:17:32.452 align:middle line:84%
and the universe or
whatever it may be.

00:17:32.452 --> 00:17:35.121 align:middle line:84%
When we paint the wonderful
pictures of our desired outcomes

00:17:35.121 --> 00:17:37.924 align:middle line:90%
or our goal or our mission

00:17:37.924 --> 00:17:41.961 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it may be,
wonderful, perfect.

00:17:41.961 --> 00:17:44.798 align:middle line:84%
What I would suggest is though
when you have those goals

00:17:44.798 --> 00:17:47.734 align:middle line:84%
that we act upon them as well
because sometimes we get stuck

00:17:47.734 --> 00:17:52.005 align:middle line:84%
in wishful thinking like
now this might not resonate

00:17:52.005 --> 00:17:54.841 align:middle line:84%
with everyone because I know
a lot of people love the law

00:17:54.841 --> 00:17:59.445 align:middle line:84%
of attraction but sometimes I
do think-I mean I love the law

00:17:59.445 --> 00:18:00.813 align:middle line:90%
of attraction as well

00:18:00.813 --> 00:18:05.118 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes people forget
the law of taking action.

00:18:05.118 --> 00:18:07.954 align:middle line:84%
So even wishful think
of winning the lottery

00:18:07.954 --> 00:18:10.990 align:middle line:84%
or getting the dream job but
if you don't buy that ticket

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:14.227 align:middle line:84%
or if you don't apply for jobs,
you're not going to get them.

00:18:14.227 --> 00:18:17.130 align:middle line:84%
So yes, allow wonderful
pictures in your mind

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:20.099 align:middle line:84%
and really have goals of how
you'd like it, try it on because

00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:22.368 align:middle line:84%
when you try it on then
you feel aligned with it,

00:18:22.368 --> 00:18:24.604 align:middle line:84%
you know that there's
what I'm going to get

00:18:24.604 --> 00:18:27.574 align:middle line:84%
and you won't self-sabotage that
because you feel good about it.

00:18:27.574 --> 00:18:29.909 align:middle line:84%
But then knowing that
they're suggestions

00:18:29.909 --> 00:18:32.679 align:middle line:84%
to your unconscious mind
or the world or the reality

00:18:32.679 --> 00:18:36.849 align:middle line:84%
or the universe, we then take
inspired and massive action.

00:18:36.849 --> 00:18:39.752 align:middle line:84%
When things you feel
inspired to do, you're going

00:18:39.752 --> 00:18:42.322 align:middle line:84%
to make the change because you
align them, you're congruent

00:18:42.322 --> 00:18:45.291 align:middle line:84%
and you're really heading
in the right direction.

00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:49.829 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, have the goal but
follow it up with those steps.

00:18:49.829 --> 00:18:53.099 align:middle line:84%
Constant small steps will
then create big leaps.

00:18:53.099 --> 00:18:55.301 align:middle line:84%
Because you think about all
the people who've made massive

00:18:55.301 --> 00:19:00.206 align:middle line:84%
changes in the world and we may
see them as making big leaps,

00:19:00.206 --> 00:19:02.742 align:middle line:84%
big leaps from where they
were to where they are now

00:19:02.742 --> 00:19:07.113 align:middle line:84%
or whatever they did but behind
the surface there's these small

00:19:07.113 --> 00:19:10.984 align:middle line:84%
consistent steps they're
making every day, every week,

00:19:10.984 --> 00:19:12.619 align:middle line:90%
that allows them to grow.

00:19:12.619 --> 00:19:16.256 align:middle line:84%
So each step that we take
towards our goal will then be

00:19:16.256 --> 00:19:18.691 align:middle line:84%
the perceived leap in
other people's eyes.

00:19:18.691 --> 00:19:21.728 align:middle line:84%
So it is important that we
take massive, inspired action

00:19:21.728 --> 00:19:24.030 align:middle line:84%
and really make things
happen and have those goals.

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:27.300 align:middle line:84%
That's great, that's the
direction you could say.

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:31.337 align:middle line:84%
So the goal is like
the goal, the outcome

00:19:31.337 --> 00:19:36.442 align:middle line:84%
and then the action is the
direction and motivation

00:19:36.442 --> 00:19:37.710 align:middle line:84%
and the [inaudible]
that we're taking.

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:40.413 align:middle line:84%
So again the both there's
going to be very powerful.

00:19:40.413 --> 00:19:43.983 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Yeah and how,
how, is there a quicker path

00:19:43.983 --> 00:19:45.652 align:middle line:90%
or do you feel there is ways

00:19:45.652 --> 00:19:50.056 align:middle line:84%
that things really just
really come together quicker?

00:19:50.056 --> 00:19:52.659 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: I would say when
you're aligned to it.

00:19:52.659 --> 00:19:56.696 align:middle line:84%
When you're aligned
with your goal truly and

00:19:56.696 --> 00:19:58.831 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: What do you mean
by that so that we're clear

00:19:58.831 --> 00:20:00.266 align:middle line:90%
on knowing the same thing.

00:20:00.266 --> 00:20:05.038 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: Okay so, sometimes we
can self-sabotage our own goals.

00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:07.940 align:middle line:84%
For example let's
take a scenario.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:11.778 align:middle line:84%
Let's say someone wants to be
a pop star or in the media,

00:20:11.778 --> 00:20:15.448 align:middle line:84%
a movie star, and they think
well why would I want this?

00:20:15.448 --> 00:20:17.617 align:middle line:84%
Well it gives me money,
it gives me exposure,

00:20:17.617 --> 00:20:21.621 align:middle line:84%
it gives me all these wonderful
things but there's things

00:20:21.621 --> 00:20:24.757 align:middle line:84%
by getting that goal what
actually may not be that good.

00:20:24.757 --> 00:20:27.093 align:middle line:90%
They might lose privacy.

00:20:27.093 --> 00:20:29.996 align:middle line:84%
They might attract new
friends which are trying

00:20:29.996 --> 00:20:31.931 align:middle line:84%
to take advantage of
them and they'll know

00:20:31.931 --> 00:20:35.101 align:middle line:84%
that at a deep level but
[inaudible] thinking about it,

00:20:35.101 --> 00:20:37.670 align:middle line:84%
thinking of all the things
they want so they'll start

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:40.239 align:middle line:90%
to maybe self-sabotage it then.

00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:43.476 align:middle line:84%
But once you try it on
and really consider it,

00:20:43.476 --> 00:20:47.246 align:middle line:84%
then you'll be truly aligned
because you are completely

00:20:47.246 --> 00:20:50.516 align:middle line:84%
at peace with the things
that you might lose.

00:20:50.516 --> 00:20:54.554 align:middle line:84%
I mean if, for example, back
then if I'd thought well

00:20:54.554 --> 00:20:57.190 align:middle line:84%
if I'm confident,
what might I lose?

00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:58.958 align:middle line:84%
Well I might lose
attention from people

00:20:58.958 --> 00:21:01.527 align:middle line:84%
because if I'm unconfident
people

00:21:01.527 --> 00:21:03.730 align:middle line:84%
in my life would go oh
Joseph, that's okay,

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:06.065 align:middle line:84%
don't worry about it, and
that makes me feel good.

00:21:06.065 --> 00:21:09.002 align:middle line:84%
So always be prepared that
you might lose things.

00:21:09.002 --> 00:21:12.305 align:middle line:84%
Or you might get things which
may not be great but once you're

00:21:12.305 --> 00:21:14.841 align:middle line:84%
at peace with that then
you become truly aligned

00:21:14.841 --> 00:21:17.944 align:middle line:84%
and therefore you
attract into your world.

00:21:17.944 --> 00:21:21.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Is there, is
there other like techniques

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:22.515 align:middle line:90%
in the books that you cover?

00:21:22.515 --> 00:21:25.752 align:middle line:84%
What are the different-what
do you go into?

00:21:25.752 --> 00:21:31.657 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: Well in the book "Be
Your Potential" it's very much

00:21:31.657 --> 00:21:32.825 align:middle line:90%
processes [inaudible].

00:21:32.825 --> 00:21:35.461 align:middle line:84%
There's active steps
and within the book

00:21:35.461 --> 00:21:39.399 align:middle line:84%
as well I created some
audio, some hypnosis audio,

00:21:39.399 --> 00:21:43.336 align:middle line:84%
some coaching audio, so within
the book you can download all

00:21:43.336 --> 00:21:44.704 align:middle line:90%
that audio so you're reading it

00:21:44.704 --> 00:21:46.305 align:middle line:84%
and also you can
start to apply it.

00:21:46.305 --> 00:21:49.375 align:middle line:84%
So there's hypnosis there,
there's coaching there.

00:21:49.375 --> 00:21:52.278 align:middle line:84%
How you can change your
emotional state just like that.

00:21:52.278 --> 00:21:55.314 align:middle line:84%
How you can resolve
limiting beliefs.

00:21:55.314 --> 00:21:57.950 align:middle line:84%
So these are like very powerful
steps that you can apply

00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:01.788 align:middle line:84%
to yourself in book form,
in audio form and also

00:22:01.788 --> 00:22:06.192 align:middle line:84%
in written form, so you can
actually write some things

00:22:06.192 --> 00:22:08.027 align:middle line:90%
about that process.

00:22:08.027 --> 00:22:11.998 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So the hypnosis you,
it's another again way to go

00:22:11.998 --> 00:22:14.967 align:middle line:84%
into the subconscious
and resurface?

00:22:14.967 --> 00:22:18.604 align:middle line:84%
You basically talk and then
the experience of hypnosis.

00:22:18.604 --> 00:22:22.408 align:middle line:90%
How does that solve problems?

00:22:22.408 --> 00:22:24.444 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: Well I would say
once again it connects

00:22:24.444 --> 00:22:25.778 align:middle line:90%
with your unconscious mind.

00:22:25.778 --> 00:22:27.213 align:middle line:90%
If you could change you would.

00:22:27.213 --> 00:22:31.017 align:middle line:84%
If you can't it must be a
block, a limiting belief,

00:22:31.017 --> 00:22:33.920 align:middle line:84%
some negative association
to with the issue

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:36.255 align:middle line:84%
or a relationship [inaudible],
so going into a state

00:22:36.255 --> 00:22:38.991 align:middle line:84%
of hypnosis is a learning
stage, it's like mediation.

00:22:38.991 --> 00:22:41.093 align:middle line:84%
You get clarity,
you get connection,

00:22:41.093 --> 00:22:43.029 align:middle line:90%
so the hypnosis is very powerful

00:22:43.029 --> 00:22:44.430 align:middle line:84%
because you're becoming
consciously

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:47.467 align:middle line:84%
and unconsciously aligned
and therefore you're going

00:22:47.467 --> 00:22:50.136 align:middle line:84%
to start making powerful changes
rather just being consciously

00:22:50.136 --> 00:22:51.337 align:middle line:90%
wanting what you want.

00:22:51.337 --> 00:22:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So you would
have it on specific topic

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:57.577 align:middle line:84%
or is there-what I'm
wondering is the process

00:22:57.577 --> 00:23:01.013 align:middle line:84%
within the hypnosis how can you
make it general for everybody?

00:23:01.013 --> 00:23:03.516 align:middle line:84%
Is there some, some
steps or some things

00:23:03.516 --> 00:23:07.687 align:middle line:84%
to first-like is the
subconscious mind has

00:23:07.687 --> 00:23:12.525 align:middle line:84%
compartments, you
know, different levels?

00:23:12.525 --> 00:23:14.460 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: Well it usually it goes

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:16.896 align:middle line:84%
down to your conscious
intention.

00:23:16.896 --> 00:23:18.831 align:middle line:90%
Why am I going into trance?

00:23:18.831 --> 00:23:20.433 align:middle line:90%
What do I want from this?

00:23:20.433 --> 00:23:23.402 align:middle line:84%
So that's the direction you're
sending your unconscious mind.

00:23:23.402 --> 00:23:27.473 align:middle line:84%
Some of it I also do, I've
got like some hypnosis apps

00:23:27.473 --> 00:23:29.308 align:middle line:84%
so they're for every
issue you can think of.

00:23:29.308 --> 00:23:32.145 align:middle line:84%
It's like 50, 60,
70, 80 on there.

00:23:32.145 --> 00:23:34.580 align:middle line:84%
Custom ones which you can
choose what you like to listen

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:38.351 align:middle line:84%
to so it could be about anxiety
or about being more relaxed,

00:23:38.351 --> 00:23:42.388 align:middle line:84%
and then those suggestions
are there to be helping you

00:23:42.388 --> 00:23:43.623 align:middle line:90%
for that specific topic.

00:23:43.623 --> 00:23:46.659 align:middle line:84%
But in general, or
like mediation as well,

00:23:46.659 --> 00:23:49.228 align:middle line:90%
it's wherever your intention is.

00:23:49.228 --> 00:23:52.598 align:middle line:84%
If your intention is to go into
trance to get more confidence,

00:23:52.598 --> 00:23:56.068 align:middle line:84%
you go into trance and your
unconscious mind will find

00:23:56.068 --> 00:23:57.069 align:middle line:90%
that connection.

00:23:57.069 --> 00:23:59.105 align:middle line:84%
It'll find that resource
for your need.

00:23:59.105 --> 00:24:01.440 align:middle line:84%
So it can be very
general and then it's

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:04.810 align:middle line:84%
up to your conscious intention,
or it can be more specific

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:07.547 align:middle line:84%
if you use, or listen to,
something more specific

00:24:07.547 --> 00:24:12.485 align:middle line:84%
for your issue or how
you'd like to be different.

00:24:12.485 --> 00:24:14.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Fear, living
fearlessly.

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:18.658 align:middle line:84%
That's like whoa, whoa, whoa
bring on the juice isn't it?

00:24:18.658 --> 00:24:21.527 align:middle line:84%
Because when there's no fears
it's just pure potential.

00:24:21.527 --> 00:24:23.229 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: That's it, living
beyond your comfort zone

00:24:23.229 --> 00:24:26.165 align:middle line:84%
and when you do you begin
to expand your comfort zone,

00:24:26.165 --> 00:24:27.633 align:middle line:90%
so therefore you go beyond that

00:24:27.633 --> 00:24:29.669 align:middle line:84%
and then you expand
your comfort zone,

00:24:29.669 --> 00:24:32.538 align:middle line:84%
so yeah definitely just
living courageously.

00:24:32.538 --> 00:24:35.975 align:middle line:84%
When you do that you kind of
really show yourself, the world

00:24:35.975 --> 00:24:40.313 align:middle line:84%
and everyone around you that we
are powerful and they see that

00:24:40.313 --> 00:24:42.615 align:middle line:84%
and they think they
are powerful as well.

00:24:42.615 --> 00:24:45.451 align:middle line:84%
They think that in their mind,
well I can do this as well.

00:24:45.451 --> 00:24:49.855 align:middle line:84%
So by living courageously,
powerfully in our potential,

00:24:49.855 --> 00:24:51.824 align:middle line:84%
we really show a
light to other people

00:24:51.824 --> 00:24:55.962 align:middle line:84%
and also it gives us more
examples of what else we can do.

00:24:55.962 --> 00:24:59.031 align:middle line:84%
Because if I can do this
then what else can I do?

00:24:59.031 --> 00:25:02.034 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I can go for this and if
I get that what else can I do?

00:25:02.034 --> 00:25:05.905 align:middle line:84%
And it's an ever growing
expansion of our potential.

00:25:05.905 --> 00:25:09.108 align:middle line:84%
Once you start feeding the
potential it starts to manifest

00:25:09.108 --> 00:25:10.443 align:middle line:90%
and get bigger and bigger.

00:25:10.443 --> 00:25:13.946 align:middle line:84%
Or not manifests and get bigger
but it becomes unleashed.

00:25:13.946 --> 00:25:15.247 align:middle line:84%
It becomes unleashed
and you begin

00:25:15.247 --> 00:25:18.250 align:middle line:84%
to see more it around
in your world.

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:20.987 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And to really
know that these are,

00:25:20.987 --> 00:25:23.155 align:middle line:84%
this is the direction
you want to take

00:25:23.155 --> 00:25:25.591 align:middle line:84%
versus another do you
go also into intuition

00:25:25.591 --> 00:25:27.393 align:middle line:90%
or how do you make decisions?

00:25:27.393 --> 00:25:30.896 align:middle line:84%
Because I see how many
No's it requires to be able

00:25:30.896 --> 00:25:34.867 align:middle line:84%
to say a Yes you know in
life and sometimes we have

00:25:34.867 --> 00:25:36.569 align:middle line:90%
to make those tough choices.

00:25:36.569 --> 00:25:38.371 align:middle line:90%
Right or left.

00:25:38.371 --> 00:25:40.773 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: That's right and
that is life isn't it?

00:25:40.773 --> 00:25:45.411 align:middle line:84%
We have many opportunities to
say yes or no or do this or do

00:25:45.411 --> 00:25:49.248 align:middle line:90%
that but I go by, I sound

00:25:49.248 --> 00:25:50.916 align:middle line:84%
like I'm repeating
myself a small bit,

00:25:50.916 --> 00:25:53.219 align:middle line:90%
but once you become consciously

00:25:53.219 --> 00:25:56.822 align:middle line:84%
and unconsciously aligned-think
of-obviously we have our

00:25:56.822 --> 00:25:58.924 align:middle line:84%
conscious mind and we
have our unconscious mind,

00:25:58.924 --> 00:26:01.861 align:middle line:84%
our biological body runs a
[inaudible] and flat response,

00:26:01.861 --> 00:26:05.364 align:middle line:84%
the healing of the body, it runs
on habits, our belief systems,

00:26:05.364 --> 00:26:08.334 align:middle line:84%
it runs on memories,
so very powerful.

00:26:08.334 --> 00:26:11.370 align:middle line:84%
Once we become aligned
consciously or connected

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:14.674 align:middle line:84%
with our conscious mind and
unconscious mind become aligned

00:26:14.674 --> 00:26:18.110 align:middle line:90%
with the outside world as well.

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:21.814 align:middle line:84%
The more you put, more
intention and attention you put

00:26:21.814 --> 00:26:25.051 align:middle line:84%
on the inside or [inaudible]
you then change the

00:26:25.051 --> 00:26:26.485 align:middle line:90%
outside universe.

00:26:26.485 --> 00:26:27.687 align:middle line:90%
So by being more connected

00:26:27.687 --> 00:26:30.690 align:middle line:84%
with yourself you make
more powerful decisions

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:31.891 align:middle line:90%
and it feels right.

00:26:31.891 --> 00:26:35.461 align:middle line:84%
You become naturally
more intuitive

00:26:35.461 --> 00:26:37.997 align:middle line:84%
because you're sensing
more about the world.

00:26:37.997 --> 00:26:41.000 align:middle line:84%
You're-rather just consciously,
I mean if you can imagine

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.869 align:middle line:84%
that I'm just consciously
looking at reality like this,

00:26:43.869 --> 00:26:46.305 align:middle line:84%
now I'm seeing it as a whole
because I'm consciously

00:26:46.305 --> 00:26:49.375 align:middle line:84%
and unconsciously connected, so
therefore I can pick up small,

00:26:49.375 --> 00:26:51.911 align:middle line:84%
different other aspects
I may have been deleting,

00:26:51.911 --> 00:26:54.013 align:middle line:84%
but now I'm taking it in and
I'm seeing if it resonates

00:26:54.013 --> 00:26:56.382 align:middle line:84%
or it doesn't resonate on a
heart level, on a brain level

00:26:56.382 --> 00:26:57.883 align:middle line:90%
and a biological level.

00:26:57.883 --> 00:27:01.554 align:middle line:84%
We're really in tune
with where we're headed.

00:27:01.554 --> 00:27:03.689 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: What are you
looking at these days?

00:27:03.689 --> 00:27:07.093 align:middle line:84%
How is all this evolving
since you're been doing this

00:27:07.093 --> 00:27:11.597 align:middle line:84%
for quite a while and your
young and fresh and out there?

00:27:11.597 --> 00:27:13.365 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: Thank you.

00:27:13.365 --> 00:27:14.500 align:middle line:90%
So what am I?

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:16.368 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: What are you
up to or what are some,

00:27:16.368 --> 00:27:20.473 align:middle line:84%
what are you working on or how
this, you know how did it evolve

00:27:20.473 --> 00:27:23.209 align:middle line:90%
to where you're now at?

00:27:23.209 --> 00:27:26.879 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: Okay so I made a
conscious decision based

00:27:26.879 --> 00:27:30.349 align:middle line:84%
on my connection
with myself to share.

00:27:30.349 --> 00:27:34.754 align:middle line:84%
So I went on a mission
to, to create free,

00:27:34.754 --> 00:27:36.956 align:middle line:84%
wonderful-like this
wonderful video now

00:27:36.956 --> 00:27:39.692 align:middle line:84%
and all your other videos,
it's about sharing information,

00:27:39.692 --> 00:27:42.394 align:middle line:84%
helping people, connecting
people.

00:27:42.394 --> 00:27:46.132 align:middle line:84%
So I made a decision very
similar to that and I chose

00:27:46.132 --> 00:27:51.303 align:middle line:84%
to create over 100 hours
of free hypnosis, coaching,

00:27:51.303 --> 00:27:53.939 align:middle line:84%
there's like an eight hour
confidence program all

00:27:53.939 --> 00:27:55.307 align:middle line:90%
for free online.

00:27:55.307 --> 00:27:57.843 align:middle line:90%
So it's all for free online.

00:27:57.843 --> 00:28:02.548 align:middle line:84%
My apps, my podcasts,
my websites all for free

00:28:02.548 --> 00:28:03.716 align:middle line:90%
to download and listen to.

00:28:03.716 --> 00:28:05.518 align:middle line:90%
No signup, it's just yours.

00:28:05.518 --> 00:28:08.687 align:middle line:84%
All you've got to do is click,
download and that's that.

00:28:08.687 --> 00:28:11.190 align:middle line:84%
So my mission has been to
really just help as many people

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:13.392 align:middle line:84%
as possible, to put
as much out there,

00:28:13.392 --> 00:28:17.630 align:middle line:84%
so I'm doing a weekly video,
a weekly audio all for free

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:20.866 align:middle line:84%
and that's allowing people
to feel more connected.

00:28:20.866 --> 00:28:23.435 align:middle line:84%
And they're sharing this
information which is beautiful

00:28:23.435 --> 00:28:25.504 align:middle line:84%
because when you do
something because you want

00:28:25.504 --> 00:28:27.473 align:middle line:90%
to help, people notice that.

00:28:27.473 --> 00:28:30.176 align:middle line:90%
They get your energy.

00:28:30.176 --> 00:28:32.178 align:middle line:84%
We were talking about this
before the video won't we?

00:28:32.178 --> 00:28:35.247 align:middle line:84%
About how as you're doing
what you're doing people want

00:28:35.247 --> 00:28:37.383 align:middle line:84%
to help you, they want
to assist your mission

00:28:37.383 --> 00:28:40.119 align:middle line:84%
and connecting authors
or speakers

00:28:40.119 --> 00:28:43.389 align:middle line:84%
and how you can enlarge your
audience because it's wonderful,

00:28:43.389 --> 00:28:45.991 align:middle line:84%
quality content and you're
doing it from the place

00:28:45.991 --> 00:28:48.227 align:middle line:90%
of wanting to help people.

00:28:48.227 --> 00:28:51.030 align:middle line:84%
So that was very much
similar in my mission

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:52.798 align:middle line:84%
and that's just transformed
things.

00:28:52.798 --> 00:28:56.135 align:middle line:84%
At the moment I'm
so grateful of this,

00:28:56.135 --> 00:29:01.974 align:middle line:84%
100,000 downloads every
month and it's getting

00:29:01.974 --> 00:29:05.945 align:middle line:84%
over 2 million downloads
to date and we're getting

00:29:05.945 --> 00:29:08.681 align:middle line:84%
over 100,000 downloads
every month just

00:29:08.681 --> 00:29:10.850 align:middle line:84%
on the podcasts,
let alone the apps.

00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:14.386 align:middle line:84%
So we're really pushing a
lot of information out there

00:29:14.386 --> 00:29:17.256 align:middle line:90%
and that's my real mission.

00:29:17.256 --> 00:29:19.325 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Because I saw you
were, you were number one

00:29:19.325 --> 00:29:23.062 align:middle line:84%
of the [inaudible] House
authors of your list,

00:29:23.062 --> 00:29:24.763 align:middle line:90%
kind of in your publishing.

00:29:24.763 --> 00:29:26.131 align:middle line:90%
How do you get there?

00:29:26.131 --> 00:29:29.401 align:middle line:84%
Is it, is it, did you condition
yourself to it or is it kind

00:29:29.401 --> 00:29:31.837 align:middle line:84%
of just happened
very quickly for you

00:29:31.837 --> 00:29:35.040 align:middle line:90%
and you were surprised even?

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:37.142 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: It's about
hustling sometimes.

00:29:37.142 --> 00:29:38.644 align:middle line:90%
You've got to take that action.

00:29:38.644 --> 00:29:39.879 align:middle line:90%
You've got to do things.

00:29:39.879 --> 00:29:41.013 align:middle line:84%
You've got to make
things happen.

00:29:41.013 --> 00:29:43.015 align:middle line:90%
I mean it is a journey.

00:29:43.015 --> 00:29:45.851 align:middle line:90%
I've failed or failed many times

00:29:45.851 --> 00:29:47.519 align:middle line:84%
but I've learned
from those and grown.

00:29:47.519 --> 00:29:48.621 align:middle line:90%
There's mistakes that I've made

00:29:48.621 --> 00:29:50.556 align:middle line:84%
and I think well how
can I improve from this?

00:29:50.556 --> 00:29:54.193 align:middle line:84%
How can I learn from it and
connect with more people?

00:29:54.193 --> 00:29:56.762 align:middle line:84%
So really it has been
about taking action

00:29:56.762 --> 00:29:59.198 align:middle line:90%
and doing what you love.

00:29:59.198 --> 00:30:02.067 align:middle line:84%
When you do what you love
you will become more aligned

00:30:02.067 --> 00:30:06.472 align:middle line:84%
with everything around you
and those opportunities begin

00:30:06.472 --> 00:30:09.308 align:middle line:84%
to become apparent
in your reality.

00:30:09.308 --> 00:30:13.345 align:middle line:84%
So I would say taking action
and just being true to yourself.

00:30:13.345 --> 00:30:14.680 align:middle line:84%
When you're connected
to yourself

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.515 align:middle line:84%
and where you're heading and
you just want to share love,

00:30:16.515 --> 00:30:19.084 align:middle line:84%
and I'll say that is a key
one, love, love for self,

00:30:19.084 --> 00:30:22.788 align:middle line:84%
love for others, then even
like love for your hobby,

00:30:22.788 --> 00:30:24.690 align:middle line:84%
love for your business,
love for your relationship,

00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:26.392 align:middle line:84%
love for your health,
all these things.

00:30:26.392 --> 00:30:30.529 align:middle line:84%
When you come from that place
you'll, things become aligned.

00:30:30.529 --> 00:30:31.664 align:middle line:90%
You are aligned.

00:30:31.664 --> 00:30:34.600 align:middle line:84%
You are connected with
who you are as a person

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.236 align:middle line:84%
and all those avenues
and opportunities.

00:30:37.236 --> 00:30:39.238 align:middle line:84%
So yeah there's learning
there, there's some kind

00:30:39.238 --> 00:30:41.273 align:middle line:84%
of dead ends along the way
which you kind of come back

00:30:41.273 --> 00:30:44.410 align:middle line:84%
and then go off again, but
it's all about progression

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:46.946 align:middle line:84%
and life's just simply
a journey like that.

00:30:46.946 --> 00:30:48.314 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Is there other topics?

00:30:48.314 --> 00:30:51.417 align:middle line:84%
Are you thinking of doing some
more books or other things?

00:30:51.417 --> 00:30:54.720 align:middle line:84%
Because once we start, it's for
sure you're probably [inaudible]

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.522 align:middle line:90%
like where's the second one?

00:30:56.522 --> 00:30:58.691 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: Yes, I have
decided I would

00:30:58.691 --> 00:31:00.559 align:middle line:84%
like another, like
to write a book.

00:31:00.559 --> 00:31:03.929 align:middle line:84%
I haven't actually told
anyone about the subject yet

00:31:03.929 --> 00:31:07.099 align:middle line:84%
but this is telling
you and everyone else.

00:31:07.099 --> 00:31:10.736 align:middle line:84%
My intention is to
write a book on love.

00:31:10.736 --> 00:31:13.572 align:middle line:84%
Love for life, love for
self, love for others,

00:31:13.572 --> 00:31:15.908 align:middle line:84%
love what you do because
as I said when you come

00:31:15.908 --> 00:31:18.877 align:middle line:90%
from that place there's no fear.

00:31:18.877 --> 00:31:20.112 align:middle line:90%
There's no scarcity.

00:31:20.112 --> 00:31:21.313 align:middle line:90%
There's no doubts.

00:31:21.313 --> 00:31:23.449 align:middle line:84%
And by love I don't mean
just like out there love,

00:31:23.449 --> 00:31:27.252 align:middle line:84%
I just mean being the core
source of who you are,

00:31:27.252 --> 00:31:30.723 align:middle line:84%
which is potential, which
is being courageous,

00:31:30.723 --> 00:31:33.292 align:middle line:84%
which is living beyond
your comfort zone.

00:31:33.292 --> 00:31:36.061 align:middle line:84%
When you come from that
place you are connected

00:31:36.061 --> 00:31:37.262 align:middle line:90%
and you make changes.

00:31:37.262 --> 00:31:39.698 align:middle line:84%
So I think that feels
right for me at the moment

00:31:39.698 --> 00:31:40.933 align:middle line:90%
to start writing that.

00:31:40.933 --> 00:31:43.068 align:middle line:84%
I've been very busy running
trainings and seminars

00:31:43.068 --> 00:31:47.272 align:middle line:84%
and producing all this free
audio and video but I am going

00:31:47.272 --> 00:31:52.177 align:middle line:84%
to put some time aside now to
start writing a new, a new book.

00:31:52.177 --> 00:31:53.579 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: The love
is so essential

00:31:53.579 --> 00:31:56.982 align:middle line:84%
because whatever we're doing if
we're not loving and accepting

00:31:56.982 --> 00:31:58.584 align:middle line:90%
who we are, but really loving,

00:31:58.584 --> 00:32:00.119 align:middle line:84%
just having those
loving thoughts,

00:32:00.119 --> 00:32:02.721 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to really
live that potential.

00:32:02.721 --> 00:32:03.822 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: That's right.

00:32:03.822 --> 00:32:04.690 align:middle line:90%
It's so true.

00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:05.824 align:middle line:90%
I mean

00:32:05.824 --> 00:32:07.459 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: I feel like
it rewires by itself.

00:32:07.459 --> 00:32:09.995 align:middle line:84%
Like how do you explain then
that people like me even

00:32:09.995 --> 00:32:14.066 align:middle line:84%
if I haven't done NLP or
hypnosis I was able to let go

00:32:14.066 --> 00:32:15.868 align:middle line:90%
of those past way of beings.

00:32:15.868 --> 00:32:18.437 align:middle line:84%
Is it because through
repetition maybe

00:32:18.437 --> 00:32:22.007 align:middle line:84%
or those interviews
around the world?

00:32:22.007 --> 00:32:23.142 align:middle line:90%
[Laughing]

00:32:23.142 --> 00:32:24.276 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: I'm sure you pick
up a lot of information

00:32:24.276 --> 00:32:26.945 align:middle line:84%
which is resonating with
your soul and your body

00:32:26.945 --> 00:32:30.582 align:middle line:84%
but I would really say
just being in the moment

00:32:30.582 --> 00:32:36.188 align:middle line:84%
and having love for life you're
communicating with your body,

00:32:36.188 --> 00:32:37.556 align:middle line:84%
because you know
that if you have

00:32:37.556 --> 00:32:41.060 align:middle line:84%
that negative thought your body
feels that negative thought.

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:42.961 align:middle line:84%
You know that if you have
negative thoughts it's going

00:32:42.961 --> 00:32:45.230 align:middle line:84%
to change how you
react in the future

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:47.299 align:middle line:84%
because you think I
don't want this to happen

00:32:47.299 --> 00:32:48.901 align:middle line:90%
and you come out of sync.

00:32:48.901 --> 00:32:51.937 align:middle line:84%
But when you come from love or
fill in the blank or something

00:32:51.937 --> 00:32:54.440 align:middle line:84%
like maybe contentment,
peace, it's all the same;

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:56.842 align:middle line:84%
it's all the same
ingredients there.

00:32:56.842 --> 00:32:59.411 align:middle line:84%
When you come from that
place you change how you see

00:32:59.411 --> 00:33:00.779 align:middle line:90%
your past.

00:33:00.779 --> 00:33:04.416 align:middle line:84%
You change how your physical
body feels and how it reacts,

00:33:04.416 --> 00:33:08.554 align:middle line:84%
how it ages, how it grows, how
it looks, how all these things

00:33:08.554 --> 00:33:11.290 align:middle line:84%
and we'll say when you
have love for your future

00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:16.195 align:middle line:84%
and what you do right now,
you make transformations

00:33:16.195 --> 00:33:18.130 align:middle line:84%
and it's just really
that simple.

00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:20.032 align:middle line:84%
Put your attention
there, let it grow

00:33:20.032 --> 00:33:21.867 align:middle line:90%
and things will start to change.

00:33:21.867 --> 00:33:23.402 align:middle line:90%
It happens.

00:33:23.402 --> 00:33:26.572 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Do you, do you
go at all into the fact

00:33:26.572 --> 00:33:28.874 align:middle line:84%
that as we change our
environment change,

00:33:28.874 --> 00:33:30.375 align:middle line:90%
people around us change?

00:33:30.375 --> 00:33:33.445 align:middle line:84%
Did you notice that in your
life, the transformation

00:33:33.445 --> 00:33:35.347 align:middle line:84%
of others just because
you are there

00:33:35.347 --> 00:33:37.216 align:middle line:84%
or because you have
done what you have done

00:33:37.216 --> 00:33:39.585 align:middle line:90%
and experienced your potential?

00:33:39.585 --> 00:33:40.953 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: Definitely.

00:33:40.953 --> 00:33:43.388 align:middle line:84%
When you make that conscious
decision that something is going

00:33:43.388 --> 00:33:45.791 align:middle line:84%
to be changed or you
want to do something,

00:33:45.791 --> 00:33:49.094 align:middle line:84%
then you'll bring more
people into your life

00:33:49.094 --> 00:33:51.230 align:middle line:90%
which are resonate with that.

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:53.565 align:middle line:84%
You begin to attract them
because they're your-think

00:33:53.565 --> 00:33:56.969 align:middle line:84%
of if you start to make
powerful changes, your qualities

00:33:56.969 --> 00:34:00.572 align:middle line:84%
of yourself are just being
shone out into the world,

00:34:00.572 --> 00:34:03.775 align:middle line:84%
the qualities of who you are
and what you do and how you act

00:34:03.775 --> 00:34:08.080 align:middle line:84%
and how you give off that
energy, and in turn it's

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:11.249 align:middle line:84%
like people see that and
think wow, I'm like that too

00:34:11.249 --> 00:34:12.217 align:middle line:90%
or I want to be like that.

00:34:12.217 --> 00:34:14.119 align:middle line:84%
So you start to attract
the people

00:34:14.119 --> 00:34:16.220 align:middle line:90%
in alignment of who you are.

00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:19.124 align:middle line:84%
But if you are on the negative
side and you only see the bad

00:34:19.124 --> 00:34:23.195 align:middle line:84%
in people or the bad in the
world, that's all you're going

00:34:23.195 --> 00:34:25.063 align:middle line:84%
to see, that's all
you're going to attract.

00:34:25.063 --> 00:34:27.932 align:middle line:84%
So definitely when you
start to make changes

00:34:27.932 --> 00:34:31.236 align:middle line:84%
in yourself you bring
more into your life.

00:34:31.236 --> 00:34:33.539 align:middle line:84%
I mean when you make change
in yourself you're letting go

00:34:33.539 --> 00:34:36.809 align:middle line:84%
of stuff, the old things,
so therefore there's space

00:34:36.809 --> 00:34:40.045 align:middle line:84%
for new things to come in,
and those new things coming

00:34:40.045 --> 00:34:44.483 align:middle line:84%
in will be based on your present
thoughts, your present feelings

00:34:44.483 --> 00:34:46.852 align:middle line:84%
and that's, because
that's one of happiness,

00:34:46.852 --> 00:34:48.653 align:middle line:90%
you bring in that happiness.

00:34:48.653 --> 00:34:51.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: You're 30 years
old, you just turned 30,

00:34:51.890 --> 00:34:55.928 align:middle line:84%
so you're the young generation,
you're the newbies coming up.

00:34:55.928 --> 00:34:58.664 align:middle line:90%
I mean you're the fresh blood.

00:34:58.664 --> 00:35:02.067 align:middle line:84%
What do you feel is different
from the other generations

00:35:02.067 --> 00:35:05.070 align:middle line:84%
like the Dr. Wayne
Dyer's and all of that?

00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:09.775 align:middle line:84%
What do you bring in or how
do you feel it's different?

00:35:09.775 --> 00:35:11.176 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: Great question.

00:35:11.176 --> 00:35:16.048 align:middle line:84%
It's one really maybe difficult
to answer but I would say

00:35:16.048 --> 00:35:20.953 align:middle line:90%
that I think it's very similar

00:35:20.953 --> 00:35:24.323 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes maybe-the
great thing

00:35:24.323 --> 00:35:26.558 align:middle line:84%
about people they're
all individuals

00:35:26.558 --> 00:35:30.295 align:middle line:84%
so therefore they relate to
different other individuals.

00:35:30.295 --> 00:35:33.799 align:middle line:84%
So it may be being a bit
younger, I may, I don't know

00:35:33.799 --> 00:35:37.169 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of people coming
to my seminars in their 60's

00:35:37.169 --> 00:35:40.138 align:middle line:84%
and 70's so they like
to see that as well.

00:35:40.138 --> 00:35:42.207 align:middle line:84%
So it's not about
necessarily about age

00:35:42.207 --> 00:35:44.276 align:middle line:90%
but it's something different.

00:35:44.276 --> 00:35:47.980 align:middle line:84%
Maybe a new insight and new
thoughts, a new way of being

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:53.252 align:middle line:84%
and the collective of the
young, the old, the middle,

00:35:53.252 --> 00:35:56.355 align:middle line:84%
the [inaudible], I mean
age doesn't matter anyway

00:35:56.355 --> 00:35:59.925 align:middle line:84%
but I think it just maybe
gives a new dimension

00:35:59.925 --> 00:36:01.860 align:middle line:84%
or a different spin
on things maybe.

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:04.029 align:middle line:90%
I think that could be it.

00:36:04.029 --> 00:36:08.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: I think, I do think
we bring a certain freshness

00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:10.969 align:middle line:84%
and just some things that
we were born into already

00:36:10.969 --> 00:36:14.539 align:middle line:84%
like when I wasn't born with the
internet but look at kids now,

00:36:14.539 --> 00:36:16.241 align:middle line:84%
I mean they pick up the
internet right away.

00:36:16.241 --> 00:36:19.711 align:middle line:84%
We were born into these
conversations more or less.

00:36:19.711 --> 00:36:21.580 align:middle line:90%
Your father your parents were.

00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:23.548 align:middle line:84%
It seems, it seems
you have been growing

00:36:23.548 --> 00:36:25.717 align:middle line:90%
with fairly open parents huh?

00:36:25.717 --> 00:36:28.687 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: Yes I mean my
parents have been amazing.

00:36:28.687 --> 00:36:30.489 align:middle line:84%
They've allowed me
to be who I am really

00:36:30.489 --> 00:36:33.892 align:middle line:90%
so I'm very thankful for that.

00:36:33.892 --> 00:36:36.461 align:middle line:84%
But as you were saying
about the internet as well,

00:36:36.461 --> 00:36:39.731 align:middle line:84%
like right now you can
download so many podcasts,

00:36:39.731 --> 00:36:41.466 align:middle line:84%
you can watch these
wonderful videos,

00:36:41.466 --> 00:36:43.969 align:middle line:84%
you can do all these
things at an instant.

00:36:43.969 --> 00:36:47.005 align:middle line:84%
It's all out there where back in
the past we'd have to maybe go

00:36:47.005 --> 00:36:50.275 align:middle line:84%
to the library or do mail
ordering for books and,

00:36:50.275 --> 00:36:53.979 align:middle line:84%
I was going to say CD's but
even like tapes even far back

00:36:53.979 --> 00:36:55.380 align:middle line:90%
or records, whatever it may be

00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:58.050 align:middle line:84%
but now the digital
age is allowing us

00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:00.452 align:middle line:84%
to be more connected more
quickly, more freely,

00:37:00.452 --> 00:37:03.622 align:middle line:84%
more openly and therefore
we're educating.

00:37:03.622 --> 00:37:07.793 align:middle line:84%
I mean the amount of times where
people in their late teens,

00:37:07.793 --> 00:37:09.494 align:middle line:90%
people at college, university,

00:37:09.494 --> 00:37:14.399 align:middle line:84%
who email me saying I've really
made some powerful changes,

00:37:14.399 --> 00:37:17.836 align:middle line:84%
it's really kind of fantastic
because they just found it.

00:37:17.836 --> 00:37:20.005 align:middle line:84%
They had an issue and
thought well how can I get an

00:37:20.005 --> 00:37:21.373 align:middle line:90%
answer here?

00:37:21.373 --> 00:37:24.509 align:middle line:84%
So they go online because we're
all connected that way now,

00:37:24.509 --> 00:37:25.944 align:middle line:90%
things are there in an instant

00:37:25.944 --> 00:37:30.248 align:middle line:84%
when you can buy a hypnosis
download or a coaching audio

00:37:30.248 --> 00:37:33.785 align:middle line:84%
or a podcast or watch
a video within seconds.

00:37:33.785 --> 00:37:36.221 align:middle line:84%
So it's just there, we've just
got to put our attention to it.

00:37:36.221 --> 00:37:40.192 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And if you [inaudible]
we're part of this generation,

00:37:40.192 --> 00:37:43.695 align:middle line:84%
for us it's about sharing freely
you know like possibly I've put

00:37:43.695 --> 00:37:47.332 align:middle line:84%
over 2000 videos, maybe
2500 videos online,

00:37:47.332 --> 00:37:48.633 align:middle line:90%
where does this come from?

00:37:48.633 --> 00:37:51.336 align:middle line:84%
I think it's part of our
generation, you know,

00:37:51.336 --> 00:37:54.740 align:middle line:84%
just wanting to share and
wanting to spread this huh?

00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:56.875 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems like we
really have this in common

00:37:56.875 --> 00:37:58.810 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure a lot
of other ones.

00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:00.112 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: Definitely.

00:38:00.112 --> 00:38:04.216 align:middle line:84%
I think because there are
ways of sharing so easy now,

00:38:04.216 --> 00:38:08.954 align:middle line:84%
which are for free like YouTube,
is free or on the podcast

00:38:08.954 --> 00:38:12.724 align:middle line:84%
or even I invest money
to share things for free.

00:38:12.724 --> 00:38:16.728 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually at my cost I
mean even if in time or expense

00:38:16.728 --> 00:38:19.865 align:middle line:84%
of video cameras and
things like that, hotels,

00:38:19.865 --> 00:38:24.169 align:middle line:84%
it's very much an investment
that we're making or a cost

00:38:24.169 --> 00:38:25.771 align:middle line:84%
to us but we see
it as an investment

00:38:25.771 --> 00:38:28.573 align:middle line:84%
because the more people
who are happy in the world,

00:38:28.573 --> 00:38:30.542 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't that be
a wonderful thing?

00:38:30.542 --> 00:38:31.910 align:middle line:90%
That's really why isn't it?

00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:36.181 align:middle line:84%
We want people to live and love
life more than ever before.

00:38:36.181 --> 00:38:39.184 align:middle line:84%
To get meaning out of life
and it gives me meaning.

00:38:39.184 --> 00:38:42.287 align:middle line:84%
I mean if you think for
me the meaning of life is

00:38:42.287 --> 00:38:43.655 align:middle line:90%
to live a life of meaning.

00:38:43.655 --> 00:38:46.658 align:middle line:84%
When we live meaningfully
then we start to make changes

00:38:46.658 --> 00:38:47.959 align:middle line:90%
and there's my meaning.

00:38:47.959 --> 00:38:49.828 align:middle line:84%
I just want to help people,
to share this information

00:38:49.828 --> 00:38:53.165 align:middle line:84%
but I have learned over the
years, my own experiences

00:38:53.165 --> 00:38:54.533 align:middle line:90%
because I still have issues.

00:38:54.533 --> 00:38:57.269 align:middle line:84%
I'm not one of these people
who say oh, I'm free of issues.

00:38:57.269 --> 00:38:59.337 align:middle line:90%
I'm always working on myself.

00:38:59.337 --> 00:39:01.406 align:middle line:84%
I know that there's
some stumbling blocks

00:39:01.406 --> 00:39:04.543 align:middle line:84%
which I'm always working on
but I'm getting over them.

00:39:04.543 --> 00:39:05.544 align:middle line:90%
I'm learning all the time.

00:39:05.544 --> 00:39:06.845 align:middle line:90%
I'm growing as a person.

00:39:06.845 --> 00:39:08.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm a real person and I want
to share those learning's

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:11.883 align:middle line:84%
with those who have been
in that situation who want

00:39:11.883 --> 00:39:13.251 align:middle line:90%
to be able to get help.

00:39:13.251 --> 00:39:15.987 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And that's also
part of this new generation.

00:39:15.987 --> 00:39:19.891 align:middle line:84%
I do feel that way, that
we are not afraid to say

00:39:19.891 --> 00:39:22.260 align:middle line:84%
and be our authentic self
and say okay this is,

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:25.230 align:middle line:84%
I made a boo boo or this is
where it's sitting, you know,

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:27.499 align:middle line:84%
the shit is hitting
the fan there.

00:39:27.499 --> 00:39:31.336 align:middle line:84%
But this is part of you know
the guru and the teacher

00:39:31.336 --> 00:39:34.739 align:middle line:84%
out there just knowing it all
is not what resonates with me.

00:39:34.739 --> 00:39:36.141 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: Not at all.

00:39:36.141 --> 00:39:40.011 align:middle line:84%
There's something that I haven't
liked about some of the industry

00:39:40.011 --> 00:39:43.315 align:middle line:84%
over the previous years, over
the last ten years and my first,

00:39:43.315 --> 00:39:45.383 align:middle line:84%
because I've been doing
this like 12 years

00:39:45.383 --> 00:39:49.254 align:middle line:84%
so when I was coming into
this there are these gurus

00:39:49.254 --> 00:39:52.224 align:middle line:84%
and we put them up
there and it's

00:39:52.224 --> 00:39:56.661 align:middle line:84%
like well how can we ever be
like that because they are gurus

00:39:56.661 --> 00:39:59.264 align:middle line:84%
and everything but really
they're just normal people

00:39:59.264 --> 00:40:03.668 align:middle line:84%
who have an insight, or maybe
have a process or a philosophy

00:40:03.668 --> 00:40:05.837 align:middle line:84%
or an idea that which
ones thought

00:40:05.837 --> 00:40:08.340 align:middle line:90%
about makes changes in others.

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:11.710 align:middle line:84%
And when people realize
that we're real people

00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:17.249 align:middle line:84%
and we're resolving things as
we go they can connect with that

00:40:17.249 --> 00:40:20.986 align:middle line:84%
because we're the same, and
I think that's very resonate

00:40:20.986 --> 00:40:24.222 align:middle line:84%
to people to realize
that we're not different.

00:40:24.222 --> 00:40:25.557 align:middle line:90%
We can never be like that person

00:40:25.557 --> 00:40:27.792 align:middle line:84%
because they're amazing
at what they do.

00:40:27.792 --> 00:40:31.530 align:middle line:84%
Anyone can do anything I
think and once we're more real

00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:35.700 align:middle line:84%
and open as to who we are
as a person our own mistakes

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:40.805 align:middle line:84%
or our own issues and it just
makes them be able to see a way

00:40:40.805 --> 00:40:44.910 align:middle line:84%
of changing as well because
they know that we've been there,

00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:47.512 align:middle line:84%
they know we've been
there and got over it

00:40:47.512 --> 00:40:48.880 align:middle line:90%
so they can do it as well.

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:52.984 align:middle line:84%
So I like to think we're an
example of how people can change

00:40:52.984 --> 00:40:55.220 align:middle line:84%
because we've been
there as well.

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:56.154 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Beautiful Joseph.

00:40:56.154 --> 00:40:58.623 align:middle line:84%
I really enjoyed
this conversation.

00:40:58.623 --> 00:41:02.460 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: Like I've said it's been
over a year or so missing kind

00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:04.262 align:middle line:84%
of schedules because I've
been around the world,

00:41:04.262 --> 00:41:05.897 align:middle line:90%
you've been around the world

00:41:05.897 --> 00:41:09.501 align:middle line:84%
and this one day everything
became in alignment.

00:41:09.501 --> 00:41:11.803 align:middle line:84%
Consciously, unconsciously
in the world all in alignment

00:41:11.803 --> 00:41:15.674 align:middle line:84%
and I'm so thankful for
you to allow me to be here

00:41:15.674 --> 00:41:17.609 align:middle line:90%
and to connect with you.

00:41:17.609 --> 00:41:18.877 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Delicious pleasure.

00:41:18.877 --> 00:41:20.912 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, thank you my
beautiful [inaudible] readers

00:41:20.912 --> 00:41:22.514 align:middle line:90%
for watching this video.

00:41:22.514 --> 00:41:24.449 align:middle line:90%
Your book, "Be Your Potential"

00:41:24.449 --> 00:41:28.186 align:middle line:84%
and I look forward meeting
you again around the world.

00:41:28.186 --> 00:41:30.255 align:middle line:84%
Thank you Joseph and
thank you to you.

00:41:30.255 --> 00:41:33.224 align:middle line:90%
Big kisses wherever you are.

00:41:33.224 --> 00:41:38.296 align:middle line:90%
