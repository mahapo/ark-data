00:00:01.488 --> 00:00:04.464 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.464 --> 00:00:11.420 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:12.880 align:middle line:90%
Hello, my juicy co-creators!

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.540 align:middle line:90%
Lilou, here for Gaiam TV.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.200 align:middle line:84%
Today, I'm in England,
near-- not too

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.850 align:middle line:90%
far from the Windsor Castle.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.510 align:middle line:84%
The British-- the
Queen's castle.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.420 align:middle line:90%
The Queen's castle, yeah.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:23.750 align:middle line:10%
And a beautiful castle it is.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:24.620 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.060 align:middle line:10%
And it's not raining today.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.900 align:middle line:10%
It's not raining in England
and I found an inside spot

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.420 align:middle line:10%
this time because I know you
saw me last time in Manchester.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.460 align:middle line:90%
I was literally freezing.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.680 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.860 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, Manchester can be cold.
-Yeah.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.120 align:middle line:84%
So you're a spiritual
life coach and we're

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.650 align:middle line:84%
going to speak about
chakras, about energy,

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.990 align:middle line:84%
about blockages, about
traumas, about what's

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.610 align:middle line:90%
stopping us really.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And I would love to start this
conversation from understanding

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.210 align:middle line:84%
from you what you-- why
you think, as human beings,

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.680 align:middle line:84%
we're stopped to live
our best potential?

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.810 align:middle line:84%
Why aren't we all there already?
Huh.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.160 align:middle line:84%
See-- see, the thing is,
if we were already there,

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.320 align:middle line:90%
it would be no fun, right?

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.814 align:middle line:90%
So the fun's the journey.

00:01:04.814 --> 00:01:05.680 align:middle line:90%
And that's the main thing.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.390 align:middle line:90%
It's the journey.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.860 align:middle line:84%
For people, what they
need to understand

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.340 align:middle line:84%
is that you need to
enjoy the journey,

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.800 align:middle line:90%
not where you're ending to.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.570 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy the journey to it.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.485 align:middle line:90%
That's-- that's the best bit.

00:01:16.485 --> 00:01:18.620 align:middle line:84%
But it's getting people
in that right mindset

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.380 align:middle line:84%
because when we're
born, we're told,

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.910 align:middle line:84%
you know, you're
going to grow old.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.220 align:middle line:84%
So you're already
thinking, oh my god,

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be old one day.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.620 align:middle line:84%
So we need to change that.
Think, actually, no.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.900 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the old bit--
don't worry about that.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.830 align:middle line:84%
Let's focus on what we're
doing right now because the way

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.780 align:middle line:84%
that our mind works-- our
subconscious mind only

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.460 align:middle line:84%
believes in the now,
only knows the now.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.510 align:middle line:84%
So we need to understand
that we live in the now,

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.200 align:middle line:90%
that's what we're creating.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.070 align:middle line:84%
But we get too much
caught up in the past

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.720 align:middle line:84%
and trying to create the
future when, actually, the now

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.880 align:middle line:84%
is the most important part.
-Mm.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.115 align:middle line:84%
And that creates
a lot of stress.

00:01:51.115 --> 00:01:53.414 align:middle line:84%
A whole lot of stress
in the physical body.

00:01:53.414 --> 00:01:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And you're seeing that
with a lot of people.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.890 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing a lot of
disease because people

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.580 align:middle line:84%
are trying to create this stuff
before it's even happened.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.655 align:middle line:90%
That's hard.

00:02:00.655 --> 00:02:02.155 align:middle line:84%
And they still haven't
understood why they're

00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:03.800 align:middle line:90%
here in the first place.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.020 align:middle line:84%
So once you understand
why you're here,

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.889 align:middle line:84%
then you can create
that a lot better.

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:11.105 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people are kind of
wandering around going, OK, so

00:02:11.105 --> 00:02:12.265 align:middle line:90%
what am I doing with my life?

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:15.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm going, what do you
want to do with your life?

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.220 align:middle line:84%
Cause the thing is, you can
create whatever you want.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.370 align:middle line:90%
Your mind is your creation.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.840 align:middle line:90%
Your imagination, use it.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.830 align:middle line:90%
We do you want to do?

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.340 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, there's
different systems

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.690 align:middle line:84%
that we can use to maybe
help you find that,

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.490 align:middle line:84%
but it's about you going, what
do I want to do with my life?

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:31.440 align:middle line:90%
It's important.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.610 align:middle line:84%
But it seems like sometimes
what we want is not really

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:34.870 align:middle line:90%
what's the best for us, too.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.500 align:middle line:84%
Like there's a
lot of projections

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.220 align:middle line:84%
of medias, of magazines,
of things like that.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's ego driven.
-Yeah.

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know, unfortunately,
we live in a society

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.490 align:middle line:84%
where media really
does kind of show us

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.730 align:middle line:84%
a way of living, which
is fine because people

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:50.990 align:middle line:90%
want to live that life.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.270 align:middle line:84%
But there's also
a lot people who

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.070 align:middle line:84%
realize-- who've actually
lived that life and realize,

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.020 align:middle line:90%
actually, you know what?

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.050 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't suit me anymore.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.500 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't serve
my purpose anymore.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.370 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes you actually have
to experience that side of life

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.743 align:middle line:90%
to know what you don't want.

00:03:02.743 --> 00:03:03.550 align:middle line:90%
Mm hm.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.749 align:middle line:84%
And once you
experience it, you go,

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:05.937 align:middle line:90%
OK, now I know what I do want.

00:03:05.937 --> 00:03:07.070 align:middle line:84%
Nothing-- nothing
wrong with that.

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.850 align:middle line:84%
Human beings, it's
almost like we

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.710 align:middle line:84%
have to-- I call it--
what we call-- you

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.480 align:middle line:90%
have to find your rock bottom.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's when people realize,
I need to change my life.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.310 align:middle line:84%
So disease is a big--
it's what I call rock

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.210 align:middle line:90%
bottom for a lot of people.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.230 align:middle line:90%
So cancer's been a big one.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.930 align:middle line:84%
So when people hit their
rock bottom, they realize,

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:22.860 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.230 align:middle line:84%
My life doesn't
serve me any more.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.600 align:middle line:90%
I need to change what I'm doing.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.100 align:middle line:84%
It may have worked and
got me to this point,

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.340 align:middle line:90%
but where do I want to go now?

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.490 align:middle line:90%
What do I want to do there?

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- that can be a
big issue for a lot of people.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.250 align:middle line:90%
Mm hm.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.460 align:middle line:84%
So do we have to put
ourselves in a position--

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do-- what is your--
how do you accompany all that?

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.610 align:middle line:84%
Because I know you work
with a lot of people,

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.880 align:middle line:84%
so what is your-- where do we
start, really, in this process?

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:49.580 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.720 align:middle line:84%
So, for me, it's about saying,
OK, rather than think too much

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.400 align:middle line:84%
about the physical, what
you want physically, how do

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.590 align:middle line:90%
you want to feel, emotionally?

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:59.350 align:middle line:90%
Mm hm.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And this-- this is a key when
I'm working with people now.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.470 align:middle line:84%
It's going, emotionally,
how do you want to feel?

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.940 align:middle line:84%
So when-- when you've got
your-- maybe your big house,

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.290 align:middle line:84%
and your car, and your holidays,
how are you going to feel?

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.440 align:middle line:84%
You're going to feel excited.
Amazing.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.140 align:middle line:90%
Exciting.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.850 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.720 align:middle line:84%
That's what I want
you to tune into.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.029 align:middle line:90%
Don't think about the pictures.

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:18.209 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we use things
like vision boards.

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.579 align:middle line:84%
So vision boards are
great because you

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.450 align:middle line:84%
put all your pictures on
there, so your subconscious

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.290 align:middle line:90%
mind starts to see it.

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.980 align:middle line:84%
But then you get in touch with
emotions, which attach to that.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And every day you keep
tuning into those emotions.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And the more you do that--
even as I'm talking now,

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting that buzz and
my-- that kind of energy

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.192 align:middle line:84%
running through me
because as soon as you get

00:04:35.192 --> 00:04:37.525 align:middle line:84%
in touch with your
emotions, the universe

00:04:37.525 --> 00:04:39.515 align:middle line:84%
and your subconscious
mind knows what you want

00:04:39.515 --> 00:04:40.850 align:middle line:90%
and it starts creating it.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And here's the thing we have to
focus on the most-- trust it.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.630 align:middle line:90%
Don't try and make it happen.

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.790 align:middle line:84%
Allow the process of life
to-- to bring that into us.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And that will come
when it's ready.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.910 align:middle line:84%
We can't make it happen
faster than it needs to be.

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.410 align:middle line:84%
There's a process, but we
need to make sure that that's

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:59.590 align:middle line:90%
exactly what we want.

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.080 align:middle line:84%
It's about getting in
touch with emotion of it,

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.386 align:middle line:84%
so that you understand
exactly what you want from it.

00:05:04.386 --> 00:05:05.240 align:middle line:90%
Mm hm.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And-- and regarding
the subconscious mind,

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.210 align:middle line:84%
I know you're very interested in
that as some kind of blueprints

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.180 align:middle line:84%
or programs that are already
in there from a very early age.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.999 align:middle line:84%
How does that work?
-Yeah.

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:17.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know you've
spoken to Bruce Lipton,

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.080 align:middle line:90%
who speaks about this a lot.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.830 align:middle line:84%
As he says, we're
actually-- you know,

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.160 align:middle line:84%
we're hypnotized in the
first six years of our life.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.210 align:middle line:84%
So our parents and
people around us

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.720 align:middle line:84%
are showing us how to live
our lives through our beliefs,

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.490 align:middle line:90%
which is fine.

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.170 align:middle line:84%
It give us a starting
point, right?

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.450 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, we then
have to re-recognize that

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.720 align:middle line:84%
and go, OK, that
served me for now,

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.470 align:middle line:90%
but where do I want to go now?

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.200 align:middle line:84%
So this is where we
can then start changing

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.770 align:middle line:90%
people's thinking process.

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.020 align:middle line:84%
But the problem
is, a lot of people

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.020 align:middle line:84%
actually recognize that
they're actually copying

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.690 align:middle line:84%
the patterns of their
parents and the people

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:50.820 align:middle line:90%
that they grew up with.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.800 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing is to notice
that, actually, you're copying

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.600 align:middle line:90%
those patterns, which is fine.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.230 align:middle line:84%
Then you go, OK, I
accept that, but now,

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:00.900 align:middle line:90%
what do I want it to be next?

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.500 align:middle line:90%
How do I want to change my life?

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.124 align:middle line:84%
Do I still want to be
like my mom or my dad?

00:06:05.124 --> 00:06:05.890 align:middle line:90%
Do I want to copy that?

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:07.140 align:middle line:84%
Which a lot of
people don't want to.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.530 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:08.896 align:middle line:84%
There are some people
who do because, you

00:06:08.896 --> 00:06:11.360 align:middle line:84%
know what, their dad or mom
have actually had a great life.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.640 align:middle line:84%
So it's not saying it's bad
or-- it's good or bad here.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.430 align:middle line:84%
What it's saying is, do
I want to copy my parents

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.300 align:middle line:90%
or do I want to learn from them?

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.860 align:middle line:84%
If you want to learn from
them, recognize the patterns

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.360 align:middle line:84%
that they've taught you because
you've come here for a reason

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.490 align:middle line:90%
to learn those patterns.

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.710 align:middle line:84%
You can either keep learning
the patterns over and over again

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.150 align:middle line:84%
or you can say, I've
learned those patterns,

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.620 align:middle line:84%
now I want to start
creating new patterns.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.840 align:middle line:84%
That-- that, for
me, is the big key.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.550 align:middle line:84%
It's getting people to
the point where they go,

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.247 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready to change.

00:06:39.247 --> 00:06:41.180 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of people who
think they're ready to change,

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.657 align:middle line:90%
but, actually, they're not.

00:06:42.657 --> 00:06:44.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I go
back to the rock bottom

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.370 align:middle line:84%
because they haven't hit that
point where they've gone,

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.970 align:middle line:90%
now my time is to change.

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's-- it's allowing
people to going, you know what?

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:53.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to wait
until you're ready.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.010 align:middle line:84%
Not to when you
think you're ready,

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:56.210 align:middle line:90%
but actually when you're ready.

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're
really ready,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.340 align:middle line:84%
those emotions will come
rushing through your body

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.260 align:middle line:84%
and they'll let you
know that time's ready.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:03.070 align:middle line:90%
And it's amazing.

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.275 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you've heard stories
over the years of people who

00:07:05.275 --> 00:07:06.980 align:middle line:84%
have had these kind
of experiences,

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:11.050 align:middle line:84%
which have just changed their
life in the blink of an eye.

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And for some people,
that's what they need.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:15.530 align:middle line:84%
For other people, they already
know, from an early age,

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:18.120 align:middle line:84%
what they want and where they
want to go with their life.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.460 align:middle line:84%
They're really in
touch with that.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.310 align:middle line:84%
But then the need
to find and follow.

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.030 align:middle line:90%
So I use synchronicity a lot.

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:25.290 align:middle line:84%
Synchronicity is
great because as soon

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.510 align:middle line:84%
as you start using it
and tuning into it,

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:29.090 align:middle line:84%
it will take you
on your journey.

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.440 align:middle line:84%
Are those the signs, you
mean, that we have in our life?

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.610 align:middle line:84%
We have to pay
attention to those?

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:33.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:36.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you look at the
life-- your world around you,

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:39.750 align:middle line:84%
all it is is what you've
created through your mind.

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:43.130 align:middle line:84%
So basically, it's you being
reflected back on yourself.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.230 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at
the world around you,

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:46.850 align:middle line:84%
it will take you
on your own journey

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:48.820 align:middle line:84%
because you've created
it in the first place.

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:53.120 align:middle line:84%
So you think most things
that we see around us

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.261 align:middle line:84%
are made only from
four chemicals.

00:07:55.261 --> 00:07:55.960 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:00.090 align:middle line:84%
So there are four elements which
make up most things in life,

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:03.090 align:middle line:84%
but we've got so many different
varieties of things around us.

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:05.320 align:middle line:84%
So what-- what creates that?
Well, we do.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.550 align:middle line:90%
It's our perception.

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:09.960 align:middle line:84%
What we perceive is what
we create around us.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.910 align:middle line:84%
So when you're looking
to change that,

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:14.670 align:middle line:84%
follow the signs
because you've already

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:18.120 align:middle line:84%
created the vision that
you're seeing in front of you.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.560 align:middle line:84%
So it's also showing
you the next part of it

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.890 align:middle line:90%
because it's like a story.

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:23.000 align:middle line:90%
You're following that story, OK?

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.610 align:middle line:84%
So this is where I'm
living right now,

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:27.750 align:middle line:84%
but, actually, if
I see these signs,

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:29.540 align:middle line:84%
they're going to take
me to the next level.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:32.830 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, I had someone
I worked with who was told,

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:37.070 align:middle line:84%
when she was 42, she would be a
psychic, a well known psychic.

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:40.780 align:middle line:84%
At the time, she was working
in the financial district.

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:44.740 align:middle line:90%
So totally two fields apart.

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:45.660 align:middle line:90%
And she goes, OK.

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.880 align:middle line:84%
Didn't really kind of
pay much attention to it.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And she was due to go to
Hong Kong for a business trip

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:52.260 align:middle line:90%
and couldn't quite decide.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:53.540 align:middle line:90%
Do I need to go to Hong Kong?

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.090 align:middle line:90%
Do I need to stay in London?

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:57.220 align:middle line:90%
And she went shopping.

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:58.100 align:middle line:90%
Best thing.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.670 align:middle line:90%
Go shopping.

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:00.871 align:middle line:84%
You were going to
say, for a woman.

00:09:00.871 --> 00:09:02.310 align:middle line:84%
For a woman.
Yes, that's true.

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:04.290 align:middle line:84%
Actually, no.
Men-- we like to shop as well.

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:06.540 align:middle line:90%
So it's not just about women.

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And so she's wandering
down the high street

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.850 align:middle line:90%
and this man stops her.

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:13.480 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, you need to go.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.140 align:middle line:84%
She goes, what do you
mean, I need to go?

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:16.260 align:middle line:90%
You need to go.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:17.270 align:middle line:90%
She goes, I need to go where?

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:19.520 align:middle line:90%
You need to go to Hong Kong.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.780 align:middle line:84%
He goes-- she goes, what do
you mean, I need to go there?

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And she's had these kind
of instances happen to her

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:25.740 align:middle line:90%
throughout her life ever since.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.790 align:middle line:84%
Where people will
just come up to her

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:30.210 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of
the street and say,

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:32.390 align:middle line:84%
we used to share
a life together.

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:34.110 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes you
meet people who tell

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:35.010 align:middle line:90%
you these kinds of stories.

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:36.920 align:middle line:90%
You go, my god.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.320 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the signs
can be that clear.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.200 align:middle line:90%
They can be in your face.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.610 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they're more subtle.

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:45.050 align:middle line:84%
They give-- for me, spirit-- I
always find that spirit gives

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:47.372 align:middle line:84%
you the signs in a way that
they know that you're going

00:09:47.372 --> 00:09:49.900 align:middle line:84%
to understand it,
whether it's verbally,

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:53.220 align:middle line:84%
through smells, through
what you see around you.

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.411 align:middle line:84%
For me, personally, I
use the things around me,

00:09:55.411 --> 00:09:57.710 align:middle line:84%
but also words.
Words are very-- as a key.

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:00.540 align:middle line:84%
So certain words
will link into things

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:02.660 align:middle line:90%
to take me to certain places.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- so you've got
to find what works for you.

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And once you open up to that,
you start following them,

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.880 align:middle line:84%
you'll start seeing more and
more of the synchronicities.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And this is what, you know, the
book, "The Celestine Prophecy,"

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:14.200 align:middle line:90%
is all about.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.300 align:middle line:84%
It's about opening up
to those synchronicity.

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And trust me, when you do-- I
mean, from my own experiences,

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.070 align:middle line:84%
oh my god, it's amazing
what happens sometimes.

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:25.040 align:middle line:90%
And that's-- that's a big key.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.960 align:middle line:84%
How do you know it's
the synchronicity

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.440 align:middle line:90%
versus just a random thing?

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.260 align:middle line:90%
Because it comes back to trust.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.412 align:middle line:84%
So last year, I had an
instance where I put

00:10:35.412 --> 00:10:38.440 align:middle line:90%
a trust in something happening.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.980 align:middle line:84%
So this was actually
linked to a particular car.

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:43.160 align:middle line:90%
Audi.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.370 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK, fine.

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:47.570 align:middle line:84%
So the morning that I
was heading out to work,

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:48.770 align:middle line:84%
there's a song that
came in my head.

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's not a song that
I kind of know very well.

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:53.760 align:middle line:84%
But it's a song that was
called, "Back in Black,"

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.420 align:middle line:90%
by a group called AC/DC.

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:57.900 align:middle line:84%
So this song kept
playing in mind.

00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:59.240 align:middle line:90%
And I go, OK, don't worry.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:04.210 align:middle line:84%
Now that day, all I saw was
black Audis everywhere I went.

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:05.600 align:middle line:90%
No other color Audi.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.050 align:middle line:84%
Just black Audis
everywhere I went.

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:11.800 align:middle line:84%
And that was my sign to
go keep following that.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And then, when you get the
signs like that, you go,

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:17.620 align:middle line:84%
as crazy is it may be,
it's telling me something.

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:19.990 align:middle line:84%
I can dismiss it and
go, you know what?

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:21.180 align:middle line:90%
I didn't see it.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:22.440 align:middle line:90%
Or you can go, I saw that.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.080 align:middle line:90%
Show me something else now.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.090 align:middle line:84%
And the more you
open up to that,

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:27.140 align:middle line:90%
the more the signs come up.

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And, you know,
I've heard stories

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:29.920 align:middle line:84%
over the years of
different people

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.566 align:middle line:84%
whose signs-- like
the lady I was just

00:11:31.566 --> 00:11:33.790 align:middle line:90%
saying-- just blow me away.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:36.730 align:middle line:84%
And you go, OK, that's why
I believe in synchronicity

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:38.480 align:middle line:84%
because the universe
will give you

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.580 align:middle line:90%
back what you're asking for.

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:42.850 align:middle line:84%
But the key is get in
touch with the emotion.

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:44.590 align:middle line:90%
How does it feel to you?

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:46.550 align:middle line:84%
Once you get in touch
with the emotion,

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:48.760 align:middle line:84%
allow the physical
to create itself.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.060 align:middle line:84%
So it was telling
you to buy the Audi?

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.184 align:middle line:84%
Or--
-No, no.

00:11:51.184 --> 00:11:52.650 align:middle line:84%
It actually wasn't to
do anything with Audi.

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:54.840 align:middle line:84%
It was to do with--
actually, saying

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.650 align:middle line:84%
that, there is--
one of my dreams

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:59.390 align:middle line:84%
is actually to drive
a particular Audi.

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:00.240 align:middle line:90%
It's called the Audi--

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.866 align:middle line:84%
-The A8-- AR.
-All right.

00:12:01.866 --> 00:12:03.407 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
There you go!

00:12:03.407 --> 00:12:04.630 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful!

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:05.440 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful car, exactly.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:06.240 align:middle line:90%
So you know exactly.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.030 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't actually
particularly for that,

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:10.087 align:middle line:84%
but, actually, it
was also linking it

00:12:10.087 --> 00:12:13.510 align:middle line:84%
because the Audi was also a big
thing in my dreams at the time.

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:14.850 align:middle line:84%
So it was just
saying, if you keep

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:17.710 align:middle line:84%
following this, this will
take you in the direction

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:18.631 align:middle line:84%
of your dreams.
So yeah.

00:12:18.631 --> 00:12:19.330 align:middle line:90%
No, it wasn't--

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:20.840 align:middle line:84%
So it was reinforcing--
it was giving

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.670 align:middle line:84%
you also encourage, I guess?
-Yeah.

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:23.420 align:middle line:90%
And-- yeah.

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:25.904 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- and that's a
big thing that I see a lot.

00:12:25.904 --> 00:12:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And I've been through
it a lot myself.

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:28.600 align:middle line:90%
It's actually trusting that.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:32.540 align:middle line:84%
Trust is a big issue
for a lot of people.

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:33.910 align:middle line:84%
So it's going,
actually, you know what?

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:34.880 align:middle line:90%
Let go.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.180 align:middle line:90%
Let go and just trust in it.

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:38.130 align:middle line:84%
Which, trust me,
is not easy to do.

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:39.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm saying it already.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.440 align:middle line:84%
So, you know-- and if
you keep saying it,

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.040 align:middle line:84%
you're creating it again.
So you go, OK.

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.420 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, for
instance, you know,

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:48.010 align:middle line:90%
someone has a car accident.

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:50.130 align:middle line:84%
They go, well, I didn't
ask for a car accident.

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:51.840 align:middle line:84%
I go, I know you didn't
ask for a car accident,

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.561 align:middle line:84%
but how did that car
accident make you feel?

00:12:53.561 --> 00:12:55.151 align:middle line:84%
Oh, damn.
It was frustrating.

00:12:55.151 --> 00:12:55.850 align:middle line:90%
I was angry with it.

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:57.941 align:middle line:84%
I go, so how have you
been feeling recently?

00:12:57.941 --> 00:12:59.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, things
are not going well.

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:00.430 align:middle line:90%
I've been frustrated and angry.

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:02.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm going, ah, that's
why you got it.

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:05.190 align:middle line:84%
Not because you asked
for the car accident,

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:07.870 align:middle line:84%
but you actually had the
emotion, which was driving it,

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:10.160 align:middle line:84%
so the universe goes, well, if
you want frustration and anger,

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.729 align:middle line:84%
there we are.
-Mm hm.

00:13:11.729 --> 00:13:12.580 align:middle line:90%
That's what you want.

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:16.920 align:middle line:84%
So this-- so 90% of what
you think about today,

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:19.240 align:middle line:90%
you'll think about tomorrow.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.673 align:middle line:84%
So we need to change--
-Break that pattern.

00:13:20.673 --> 00:13:21.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.600 align:middle line:84%
This is about
breaking the pattern.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.010 align:middle line:84%
So, for me, what you
do is, when you find

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:30.170 align:middle line:84%
that your mind is wandering into
a certain direction, change it.

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:33.020 align:middle line:90%
Come back with a word.

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:34.380 align:middle line:90%
Love, for instance.

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:35.120 align:middle line:90%
Amazing.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.400 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.450 align:middle line:84%
Whatever word you want to
use, which then replaces that.

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And you keep saying it over
and over again in your head.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.150 align:middle line:84%
And the more you
say it, you start

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:45.400 align:middle line:90%
feeling that in your body.

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:46.680 align:middle line:84%
If you're in tune
with your body,

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.280 align:middle line:84%
you'll start feeling the
energy coming up in it.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.705 align:middle line:84%
You can feel almost--
you can almost

00:13:49.705 --> 00:13:52.420 align:middle line:84%
feel like the chemicals and the
molecules changing in your body

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:53.120 align:middle line:90%
as you're doing it.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.586 align:middle line:84%
Because, at least for
me, when I'm doing it,

00:13:54.586 --> 00:13:55.960 align:middle line:90%
I can feel it my head.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.120 align:middle line:84%
I can feel like
all the brain just

00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.880 align:middle line:84%
kind of moving around,
going, oh, I'm liking this.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:00.860 align:middle line:90%
This feels great.

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:03.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's-- it's--
for me, the most

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.950 align:middle line:84%
powerful bit is about getting in
touch with the emotions of it.

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And you've just got to--
it's-- it's a process.

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:10.320 align:middle line:84%
We have to keep going over-- you
don't just do it for one day,

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.650 align:middle line:90%
you do it everyday.

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:14.981 align:middle line:84%
Whenever it comes to
your head, follow it.

00:14:14.981 --> 00:14:15.680 align:middle line:90%
Mm hm.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And just keep coming
up with the emotions.

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:20.390 align:middle line:84%
And different days, I have
different emotions I use.

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:21.340 align:middle line:90%
Any type of emotion?

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.690 align:middle line:84%
Like in relationship
jealousy, for example.

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:24.530 align:middle line:90%
You can work on that?

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:26.710 align:middle line:84%
You think it's possible
to rewire and permanently

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:27.730 align:middle line:90%
not feel this anymore?

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:28.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:31.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've got techniques,
which I use to actually change

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:33.560 align:middle line:90%
people's belief patterns.

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:37.110 align:middle line:84%
So a particular technique
called, PSYCH-K.

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:39.210 align:middle line:84%
So I use PSYCH-K,
which is basically

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:41.920 align:middle line:84%
about tuning into your
subconscious mind,

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.830 align:middle line:84%
using muscle
testing, kinesiology.

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And we ask the subconscious
mind, what do you believe?

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.870 align:middle line:84%
So for instance,
a big one, which

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:50.250 align:middle line:84%
I get with a lot
of clients, is I

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:52.710 align:middle line:90%
love myself and I hate myself.

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:55.870 align:middle line:84%
So most people would test
weak for I love myself

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:58.380 align:middle line:84%
and test strong
for I hate myself.

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:00.034 align:middle line:84%
So you go, no,
but I love myself.

00:15:00.034 --> 00:15:02.000 align:middle line:84%
I know you're saying it, but
you don't actually believe it.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:02.360 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.540 align:middle line:84%
So your subconscious
mind, which

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:06.310 align:middle line:84%
is where 95% of your
thoughts come from,

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:08.140 align:middle line:84%
is actually telling
you-- you're saying it

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:10.710 align:middle line:84%
in your conscious mind, but
your subconscious mind is going,

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:12.320 align:middle line:84%
ha, you don't believe this.
-Mm.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.721 align:middle line:84%
It's years, and years, and
years of working on that.

00:15:14.721 --> 00:15:16.470 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
-Yeah, but here's the thing.

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:17.970 align:middle line:84%
Because--
-Of believing it.

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:19.030 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
In believing-- yeah.

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:20.630 align:middle line:84%
But here's the thing,
most people don't actually

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:22.610 align:middle line:84%
realize they've been believing
the opposite of what they

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:24.474 align:middle line:84%
think they've been believing.
-Mm hm.

00:15:24.474 --> 00:15:26.170 align:middle line:84%
So when you actually show
that to them, they go,

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:29.230 align:middle line:84%
oh my god, that may explain
why my life hasn't probably

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:31.120 align:middle line:84%
gone as well as I want
it to because actually, I

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.070 align:middle line:90%
don't love myself.

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:34.510 align:middle line:84%
If you don't love yourself,
how can you love your pattern,

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:36.530 align:middle line:90%
your children, your family?

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:37.230 align:middle line:90%
Mm mm.

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:39.080 align:middle line:84%
So that what you
have for yourself

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:40.920 align:middle line:84%
is what you give
to other people.

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And, for me, that's
a big link, when

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:46.690 align:middle line:84%
you we go back to the physical,
to like breast cancer.

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:52.780 align:middle line:84%
Self love comes from spending
time and giving love to self.

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:55.740 align:middle line:84%
A lot of women are giving
their time to their husbands,

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:58.900 align:middle line:84%
to their children, to
their jobs, which is fine,

00:15:58.900 --> 00:15:59.850 align:middle line:90%
but it's all about balance.

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:00.980 align:middle line:90%
Mm hm.

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:02.837 align:middle line:84%
So it's about self
love, first of all.

00:16:02.837 --> 00:16:04.870 align:middle line:84%
We've always got to start with--
number one in our priorities

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:07.400 align:middle line:90%
in our life is our self.

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.940 align:middle line:90%
Then our partners, our children.

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:11.847 align:middle line:84%
Everybody else comes
underneath that.

00:16:11.847 --> 00:16:13.080 align:middle line:84%
But we've always
got to put ourselves

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:18.010 align:middle line:84%
at the top of that totem
pole because people want

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:21.040 align:middle line:84%
to understand that
if I give myself

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.840 align:middle line:84%
a lot of love, a lot of
energy, I've got a lot

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:24.520 align:middle line:90%
more to give to other people.

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:26.321 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- that's-- for
some people, changing that--

00:16:26.321 --> 00:16:28.286 align:middle line:84%
they might say-- well, they'll
think, you know, my children

00:16:28.286 --> 00:16:29.899 align:middle line:84%
are so important to me.
Absolutely.

00:16:29.899 --> 00:16:32.720 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing wrong with that,
but you can't put someone else

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:35.268 align:middle line:84%
before yourself
because if you're

00:16:35.268 --> 00:16:37.460 align:middle line:84%
doing that with your family,
where else are you doing that?

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:38.320 align:middle line:90%
Mm hm.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.330 align:middle line:84%
Your own needs are never being
met because you're putting

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:41.840 align:middle line:84%
everything-- something
else in front of it,

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:42.873 align:middle line:90%
thinking that's more important.

00:16:42.873 --> 00:16:47.295 align:middle line:84%
Now it comes back to the self
belief and your statement.

00:16:47.295 --> 00:16:49.410 align:middle line:84%
Going, I love myself.
Actually, no.

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:50.160 align:middle line:90%
I hate myself.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.310 align:middle line:84%
That's why you can't give
love to other people.

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:54.200 align:middle line:84%
So you actually find you're
actually working harder

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.080 align:middle line:84%
trying to love other
people because you

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.880 align:middle line:84%
still haven't loved yourself.
This is a key.

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:00.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:05.589 align:middle line:84%
Embracing, even with-- when
things don't go the way

00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:06.760 align:middle line:90%
we want it to.

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:09.930 align:middle line:84%
Because there is this
thing about not-- I guess,

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:14.260 align:middle line:84%
a lot-- most of us don't see the
universe as a friendly thing.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.079 align:middle line:84%
So it comes to get us, or
something is going to come,

00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:18.550 align:middle line:90%
or it's too good to be true.

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:20.119 align:middle line:84%
And all of these things, huh?
-Yeah.

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:20.819 align:middle line:90%
No, it's true.

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:24.359 align:middle line:84%
But here's the thing, you know,
life isn't a straight line.

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:25.390 align:middle line:90%
Life is in waves.

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:26.810 align:middle line:90%
It goes up and down.

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:29.157 align:middle line:84%
So life is not always
going to be amazing.

00:17:29.157 --> 00:17:30.490 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have
low points in life.

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:31.189 align:middle line:90%
That's life.

00:17:31.189 --> 00:17:34.730 align:middle line:84%
You know, the funny thing
is, we live in time,

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:37.000 align:middle line:90%
but time is linear.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.760 align:middle line:84%
But it's the only thing
in the universe that is,

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:41.000 align:middle line:84%
but that's how we're
living our life.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.050 align:middle line:84%
So if we understand that the--
the universe works in waves,

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:46.620 align:middle line:90%
then that's how life flows.

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:47.780 align:middle line:90%
It goes in those waves.

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:50.870 align:middle line:84%
So when you hit those-- what we
call low points in your life,

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:51.960 align:middle line:90%
embrace them.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:52.970 align:middle line:90%
So you know what I do?

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:55.720 align:middle line:84%
I go to people-- I go-- when
I hit a low point in my life,

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.760 align:middle line:84%
I go, come on, is that the
worst you've got for me?

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.470 align:middle line:84%
Come on, you can give
me better than that!

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:01.240 align:middle line:90%
Because you know what?

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:02.982 align:middle line:84%
That low-- there's going
to be another high that's

00:18:02.982 --> 00:18:04.150 align:middle line:84%
at the other end of that.
-Mm hm.

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:05.984 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to go, if this
is the worst low I've got,

00:18:05.984 --> 00:18:07.549 align:middle line:84%
I know that my high is
going to be even better.

00:18:07.549 --> 00:18:08.410 align:middle line:90%
Mm hm.

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:09.630 align:middle line:90%
So it's about embracing it.

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:12.280 align:middle line:84%
You know, life's never going to
be smooth all the way through.

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's a big thing for
people, going, you know what?

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:15.870 align:middle line:84%
Don't worry about
when things are

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:17.410 align:middle line:84%
not going bad
because that's also

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:19.440 align:middle line:90%
a time to just take a break.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:20.970 align:middle line:90%
And going, you know what?

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:21.950 align:middle line:90%
Put some more time into me.

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:23.890 align:middle line:84%
Because, for me, when people
are not putting enough time

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:27.086 align:middle line:84%
into themselves, that's when
they start hitting those kind

00:18:27.086 --> 00:18:28.510 align:middle line:90%
of low points more often.

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:30.870 align:middle line:84%
Because it's almost like
their highest self spirit

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:32.480 align:middle line:90%
going to them, you know what?

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:33.590 align:middle line:90%
You got you.

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:34.811 align:middle line:84%
Forget about you.
Self love.

00:18:34.811 --> 00:18:37.160 align:middle line:84%
-Mm hm.
-It's more time for yourself.

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:41.300 align:middle line:84%
That's-- that's-- self-- for
me, self love is a big thing.

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:43.274 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we have
an issue with trust.

00:18:43.274 --> 00:18:44.440 align:middle line:84%
Because if we don't
love ourselves,

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.090 align:middle line:84%
then we're not going
to love someone else.

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:48.110 align:middle line:90%
So we don't trust them.

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:49.400 align:middle line:84%
So once you give
that love back, then

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:53.540 align:middle line:84%
they go, OK, now
I know my partner,

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:55.670 align:middle line:84%
my children are
here for a reason.

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:59.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to work so hard to
make them happy, to serve them.

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:03.164 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- evolutionary
wise, we've changed.

00:19:03.164 --> 00:19:03.930 align:middle line:90%
Our roles have changed.

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:06.800 align:middle line:84%
You know, it used to be the man
would go out to be the hunter

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:09.200 align:middle line:84%
and the wife would stay
at home, which is fine.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.110 align:middle line:90%
But we've evolved from that.

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:13.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, women are now
wanting to embrace that.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.810 align:middle line:90%
They want to go out and work.

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:17.860 align:middle line:84%
But it's also about finding
a balance within that.

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:21.680 align:middle line:84%
So you can have your work, your
home life, your social life,

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:25.070 align:middle line:84%
but remember, there's you at
the center of all of this.

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:28.012 align:middle line:84%
Because that can't happen
unless you're balanced.

00:19:28.012 --> 00:19:29.400 align:middle line:90%
Mm hm.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.891 align:middle line:84%
You read chakras,
you can see chakras.

00:19:31.891 --> 00:19:32.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:35.580 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain what
those are and if we all

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:37.710 align:middle line:90%
have this ability?

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:38.545 align:middle line:90%
We all have the ability.

00:19:38.545 --> 00:19:40.110 align:middle line:90%
So it's intuition.

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:41.860 align:middle line:90%
So I'm intuitive.

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:47.030 align:middle line:84%
So in my mind's eye, I can
tune into particular chakras.

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:50.010 align:middle line:84%
So our seven chakras, which
each one leading to different

00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:51.790 align:middle line:84%
areas of our life,
different parts of the body,

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:53.810 align:middle line:90%
I can tune into it.

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:55.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm also a medical intuitive.

00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:57.530 align:middle line:84%
So I can scan your body
and it will tell me

00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:01.780 align:middle line:84%
which areas-- because my
background is sports rehab,

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:05.747 align:middle line:84%
I can look at someone and say,
OK, so it's your right hip.

00:20:05.747 --> 00:20:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And then we can follow that
pattern and see where it goes.

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:10.340 align:middle line:84%
So the chakras are my
way of accessing people.

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And saying, OK--
so what will happen

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:14.400 align:middle line:84%
is one chakra will
come into my mind.

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.460 align:middle line:84%
So that's the one
we're seeing right now.

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:18.561 align:middle line:84%
This is one that needs
to be served right now.

00:20:18.561 --> 00:20:19.260 align:middle line:90%
So whatever.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.570 align:middle line:84%
Say, for instance,
the heart chakra.

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:22.470 align:middle line:90%
It's about giving love.

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:23.560 align:middle line:90%
Giving and receiving love.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:24.670 align:middle line:84%
So what I do is
I'll get an image

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:28.350 align:middle line:84%
in my mind, which will go,
is love flowing out properly?

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:29.350 align:middle line:90%
Or is love coming in probably?

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:32.080 align:middle line:84%
So from the back of the body,
am I seeing love coming in?

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:33.110 align:middle line:90%
Are they receiving love?

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:34.530 align:middle line:84%
-Mm hm.
-So often, you--

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:35.820 align:middle line:84%
Cause it's coming
in from the back.

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:36.090 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:37.623 align:middle line:84%
So if we look at-- if
we look at the chakras--

00:20:37.623 --> 00:20:39.400 align:middle line:84%
because they come
either side of the body.

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.634 align:middle line:84%
So it's about giving
out to the world

00:20:40.634 --> 00:20:42.099 align:middle line:84%
and it's also about
receiving from the world

00:20:42.099 --> 00:20:43.035 align:middle line:90%
at the back of the body.

00:20:43.035 --> 00:20:45.350 align:middle line:84%
So we do, are you
receiving enough love?

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:49.860 align:middle line:84%
So often, I see people who
are receiving a lot of love

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:53.120 align:middle line:84%
and they're not giving enough
because they've, you know,

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:55.550 align:middle line:84%
been in relationship which
has kind of gone-- oh.

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:57.050 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's-- that's
a big issue for me.

00:20:57.050 --> 00:20:58.240 align:middle line:84%
I can't give love anymore.
-Uh huh.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.350 align:middle line:90%
Or they can be the opposite.

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:02.470 align:middle line:84%
They're giving out so much,
but they're not getting back.

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:05.260 align:middle line:84%
So they go, you know, I'm
doing everything for everybody,

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:07.460 align:middle line:84%
but I don't feel like I'm
getting anything back in life.

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:09.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to people,
it's about finding a balance.

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:11.980 align:middle line:84%
So one chakra, for
me, will stand out.

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And we work with energy
of that because that's

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:17.640 align:middle line:84%
what your higher self is telling
me is your priority right now.

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:20.160 align:middle line:84%
So you may come to me
and go, you know what?

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.340 align:middle line:84%
Relationships are a big
problem for me right now.

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:24.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm going, that's fine,
but you know what?

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:27.760 align:middle line:84%
Your throat chakra,
communication and creativity,

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.290 align:middle line:90%
are not being addressed here.

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:30.960 align:middle line:84%
That's why your relationships
are not working.

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:33.800 align:middle line:84%
So you may not be communicating
what you're trying to achieve

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.710 align:middle line:90%
in your life with your partner.

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:37.620 align:middle line:84%
That's-- it can
be that sometimes.

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:38.814 align:middle line:90%
That simple.

00:21:38.814 --> 00:21:40.780 align:middle line:84%
But once you go through that
process, then all of a sudden,

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:41.960 align:middle line:90%
the relationship changes.

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:45.350 align:middle line:84%
So what we sometimes think
is our priorities in life

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:47.360 align:middle line:90%
are not always the case.

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:48.630 align:middle line:84%
It can be actually
something else

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:52.110 align:middle line:84%
is driving that, which is why
you're finding that problem.

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:55.140 align:middle line:84%
With the chakras, we've
got the seven chakras.

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:57.720 align:middle line:84%
But your base chakra,
which is your lowest one,

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.920 align:middle line:84%
links in with your crown
chakra, so the top one.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.420 align:middle line:84%
So they work in pairs.
-Mm hm.

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:04.510 align:middle line:84%
So often, you'll see a
pattern happen between the two.

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:09.120 align:middle line:84%
So the way work is I'll actually
score each chakra between zero

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.150 align:middle line:90%
to three.

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:12.820 align:middle line:84%
Zero means the chakra's
fully closed down,

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:14.410 align:middle line:84%
three means it's
fully opened up.

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:16.040 align:middle line:84%
So often, we score
somewhere in between that.

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And normally, I'll see a
pattern between the high and low

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:20.780 align:middle line:90%
chakras.

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And then the bottom
three, I look

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:25.810 align:middle line:84%
at as your materialistic world.
This--

00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:27.840 align:middle line:84%
-The- the red, orange, yellow.
-Yeah.

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:32.700 align:middle line:84%
So you got your base chakra,
sacral, and then solar plexus.

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:37.660 align:middle line:90%
So yellow, orange, red.

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:40.410 align:middle line:84%
And what we do is, we go,
this is your foundations

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:41.220 align:middle line:90%
of your building.

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:44.140 align:middle line:90%
This is your physical life.

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:46.815 align:middle line:84%
Now-- so if I'm scorind--
say, for instance, I've got

00:22:46.815 --> 00:22:48.940 align:middle line:90%
a one, one and half, and a one.

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:50.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm going, OK,
imagine if you try

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:51.769 align:middle line:90%
to build a building on that.

00:22:51.769 --> 00:22:53.234 align:middle line:84%
That's not very strong.
-Mm hm.

00:22:53.234 --> 00:22:55.140 align:middle line:84%
Because if you put those
numbers into a kind of context,

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:56.840 align:middle line:90%
they're quite short.

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:58.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm going, we can't build
much on top of that.

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:01.370 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes we've got to
focus on building stronger

00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:03.780 align:middle line:84%
foundations first,
before we try,

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:06.120 align:middle line:84%
and go, and follow all the
higher stuff-- the spiritual

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:07.340 align:middle line:90%
and our life purpose.

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:09.230 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes what
we need, first of all,

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:10.697 align:middle line:90%
is security in life.

00:23:10.697 --> 00:23:12.330 align:middle line:84%
So we're trying to go and
do these magical things

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:13.770 align:middle line:84%
with our life, but
you're going, well,

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:15.410 align:middle line:90%
how are you supporting that?

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:16.884 align:middle line:84%
Well, the universe
will support me--

00:23:16.884 --> 00:23:18.050 align:middle line:84%
which it will, to
a certain extent,

00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:19.250 align:middle line:84%
but you've still
got to do the work.

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:20.520 align:middle line:84%
You've still got to
support yourself.

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:23.900 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, when you're
working in a spiritual kind

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:26.010 align:middle line:84%
of business, you
meet a lot people

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:28.210 align:middle line:84%
whose intentions are
to change the world

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:29.920 align:middle line:84%
and help the world,
which is great.

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:33.120 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going, imagine how
much more you can help them,

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.800 align:middle line:84%
if your foundations are
strong and you actually

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.284 align:middle line:84%
have that security yourself?
-Mm hm.

00:23:36.284 --> 00:23:37.550 align:middle line:84%
Because that's where
you're building.

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:39.180 align:middle line:84%
It's the people,
unfortunately, who've actually

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:40.840 align:middle line:84%
got the money who are
the ones who are helping

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:42.400 align:middle line:90%
people on a larger scale.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.100 align:middle line:84%
So if you really
want to help people,

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:47.290 align:middle line:84%
make sure you get your--
your foundations strong.

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:48.800 align:middle line:84%
Build your own
security, first of all,

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.290 align:middle line:84%
whether that's
financial-- you know,

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:53.000 align:middle line:84%
whatever materialistic
means to you.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.070 align:middle line:84%
You build that strong for
yourself, first of all.

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And then you start moving
onto the next layer,

00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:59.345 align:middle line:84%
then you can start
helping people a lot more.

00:23:59.345 --> 00:24:01.340 align:middle line:90%
But life is not linear.

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:02.620 align:middle line:90%
Life is not linear, no.

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:04.280 align:middle line:84%
But we have to have a
starting point, right?

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:04.980 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:07.910 align:middle line:84%
So the starting point
is you need foundations.

00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:11.120 align:middle line:84%
You need to build--
something to build on top of.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:12.160 align:middle line:90%
So that is your foundation.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.580 align:middle line:84%
So, for me, that's
where the bottom three

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:17.180 align:middle line:84%
chakras-- and most issues--
because this is our survival.

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:20.840 align:middle line:84%
So if you go back to
animals, the first thing

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:23.140 align:middle line:84%
they do when they kind
of wake up in the morning

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:26.820 align:middle line:84%
is they check to make sure
that things are secure.

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:28.770 align:middle line:90%
That their environment is safe.

00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:30.260 align:middle line:84%
The second thing
they do is they have

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:32.780 align:middle line:90%
to then nourish themselves.

00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:36.330 align:middle line:90%
Third thing-- it's about sex.

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:37.550 align:middle line:90%
What do we do-- humans do?

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:39.424 align:middle line:90%
We wake up, we want to have sex.

00:24:39.424 --> 00:24:41.090 align:middle line:84%
We're then going to have
breakfast and then we go,

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:41.510 align:middle line:90%
oh my god.

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:43.150 align:middle line:84%
I've go to go to work,
I've got to pay the bills.

00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:45.220 align:middle line:84%
We do it all the
wrong way around.

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:47.280 align:middle line:84%
So, for me, it's getting
people in the mind set, going,

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:49.990 align:middle line:84%
think about your safety
and security, first of all.

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:51.170 align:middle line:90%
Before everything else.

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:53.334 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you
build on top of.

00:24:53.334 --> 00:24:56.020 align:middle line:84%
Though the heart chakra
seems to be a big one that

00:24:56.020 --> 00:25:00.130 align:middle line:84%
is also related to the money
and to the abundance somehow,

00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:01.080 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:01.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:03.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the heart chakra--
because it's about love.

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:06.170 align:middle line:84%
So love covers
all areas of life.

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:09.000 align:middle line:84%
So when we're open
to receiving--

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.321 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of people have
issues in receiving money.

00:25:11.321 --> 00:25:12.020 align:middle line:90%
Mm hm.

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And actually saying,
I'm not worthy enough

00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:14.690 align:middle line:90%
to receive that money.

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:18.580 align:middle line:84%
You're going, don't
see money as money.

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:20.850 align:middle line:90%
See money as energy.

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:23.520 align:middle line:84%
You're getting energy back
for what you're giving out.

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:27.220 align:middle line:84%
So if you're giving out, the
universe will give you it back.

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:28.810 align:middle line:84%
So that can come
in the form money.

00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:31.380 align:middle line:84%
But in the spiritual
world, a lot of people

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:32.660 align:middle line:84%
have issue with
that, thinking money

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:33.750 align:middle line:90%
is-- oh, it's a dirty thing.

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:36.860 align:middle line:84%
We can't have that, you know,
because it's linked to crime,

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:39.190 align:middle line:84%
and to a lot of problems,
and people with money

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:40.960 align:middle line:90%
are never happy.

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.260 align:middle line:90%
But actually, not really.

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:44.330 align:middle line:84%
It's our form of energy
that we have actually

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:46.750 align:middle line:90%
created for an exchange.

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:49.780 align:middle line:84%
So when I work with a client,
there's got to be an exchange.

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:53.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm giving them a service
and in return, the energy

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:55.000 align:middle line:90%
that I get back is in money.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.020 align:middle line:90%
And that's how it works.

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:58.630 align:middle line:84%
Once you accept that,
then you'll find

00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:00.080 align:middle line:90%
that flow works a lot easier.

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:03.870 align:middle line:84%
A lot people are struggling
to take that on board

00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:06.550 align:middle line:84%
and they'll always find
that they've never got money

00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:07.691 align:middle line:90%
coming in on a regular basis.

00:26:07.691 --> 00:26:08.990 align:middle line:84%
They'll find they
have money for awhile

00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:10.625 align:middle line:84%
and then they have
no money coming in.

00:26:10.625 --> 00:26:13.200 align:middle line:84%
Or they'll find they're always
struggling to pay the bills.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:16.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm going, because you need to
have a relationship with money.

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.310 align:middle line:84%
Because don't see it as
money, see it as energy.

00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:21.000 align:middle line:90%
And that energy is your energy.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And the people that you're
surrounding yourself with,

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:24.970 align:middle line:84%
whether it's your
boss that you work for

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:27.500 align:middle line:84%
or your clients that
you work with-- this

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:28.700 align:middle line:90%
is a mutual exchange.

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:31.560 align:middle line:84%
This is about giving
and receiving love.

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:34.810 align:middle line:84%
So forget about the money,
see it as about energy

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:36.438 align:middle line:90%
and about sharing love.

00:26:36.438 --> 00:26:38.840 align:middle line:84%
Hm.
Nice.

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:41.680 align:middle line:90%
And numerology and all that.

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:45.340 align:middle line:84%
How does that play in
this whole big picture

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:46.890 align:middle line:84%
that we just painted?
-OK.

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:49.270 align:middle line:90%
So numerology.

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:54.720 align:middle line:84%
We go back and we look at--
because everything is symbolic.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.970 align:middle line:90%
So numbers, colors.

00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:59.285 align:middle line:84%
In sacred geometry,
different shapes.

00:26:59.285 --> 00:27:01.080 align:middle line:84%
They're all symbolic
in some way.

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.050 align:middle line:84%
So with numerology,
we look at the numbers

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:07.170 align:middle line:84%
because each number relates
to-- has a different energy.

00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:10.170 align:middle line:84%
So if we take your
birthday and we break it

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:13.620 align:middle line:84%
down to a single digit
or sometimes two digits--

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:16.100 align:middle line:84%
we have what we call power
numbers-- 11, 12-- sorry.

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:18.450 align:middle line:84%
11, 22, and sometimes
33, depending on which

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:20.640 align:middle line:90%
form of numerology you use.

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.680 align:middle line:90%
But each number has a meaning.

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:25.160 align:middle line:84%
So if we were to break
your birthday down

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:27.770 align:middle line:90%
into a single digit--

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:28.990 align:middle line:84%
-Let's take seven.
-Take seven.

00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:29.689 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:29.689 --> 00:27:33.330 align:middle line:84%
So seven is-- I'm
a seven, luckily.

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:36.140 align:middle line:84%
So seven is about
analytical mind.

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:38.660 align:middle line:84%
It's about creating
a spiritual world.

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:40.660 align:middle line:90%
So I'm living my life purpose.

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:44.140 align:middle line:84%
So your birthday is all
about your life purpose.

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:46.740 align:middle line:84%
So if you're living
to your life purposes,

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:50.480 align:middle line:84%
you'll find that your life will
have a lot more meaning to you.

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:53.505 align:middle line:84%
So for what I do, I'm actually
living my life purpose.

00:27:53.505 --> 00:27:56.080 align:middle line:84%
You know, I-- I
analyze everything.

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:58.490 align:middle line:84%
It's all about knowledge, it's
all about understanding things.

00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:00.510 align:middle line:84%
It's all about then
connecting with people

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:01.950 align:middle line:90%
and helping them on their path.

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:02.974 align:middle line:90%
That's what seven's all about.

00:28:02.974 --> 00:28:04.340 align:middle line:84%
If you then take an
eight, it's all about

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:06.260 align:middle line:90%
the materialistic satisfaction.

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:10.731 align:middle line:84%
So the eights, they want
to be satisfied and secure.

00:28:10.731 --> 00:28:12.630 align:middle line:84%
So they're the ones you look
at-- when we look at-- we go

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:14.163 align:middle line:84%
back to the chakras, if
I've got someone who's

00:28:14.163 --> 00:28:16.270 align:middle line:84%
an eight in numerology
and there bottom three

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:18.870 align:middle line:84%
chapters are out of
balance, I'm going,

00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:20.300 align:middle line:90%
this can be a big issue for you.

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And often, you'll see
that they'll have problems

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:23.970 align:middle line:84%
in their work,
their relationships,

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:27.200 align:middle line:84%
in their home life
because being eight

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:30.200 align:middle line:84%
means your life purpose is
about being materialistically

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:33.390 align:middle line:90%
satisfied and secure.

00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And is that
something to overcome?

00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:37.451 align:middle line:84%
I guess the biggest challenges
also come from there?

00:28:37.451 --> 00:28:38.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:39.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you go
fully-- forever

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:42.170 align:middle line:84%
into numerology
reading, what you can

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:44.990 align:middle line:84%
often is if that number
comes up a few times,

00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:46.960 align:middle line:90%
it's also a lesson for you.

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:49.185 align:middle line:84%
So often, what you find
is your life purpose

00:28:49.185 --> 00:28:51.660 align:middle line:84%
can also be your
life lesson as well.

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:53.960 align:middle line:84%
So your lesson could
be about being secure.

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:56.530 align:middle line:84%
So often, you'll find that
people who are an eight-- they

00:28:56.530 --> 00:28:58.310 align:middle line:84%
go-- you've got
some people who are

00:28:58.310 --> 00:29:00.230 align:middle line:84%
an eight who are
actually-- their home life,

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:01.730 align:middle line:90%
everything, is perfect.

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:03.550 align:middle line:84%
They've made sure
that that's secure.

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:05.200 align:middle line:84%
Then you've got
other people going,

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.480 align:middle line:84%
yeah, that's my life purpose,
but I can't get the balance.

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And then you go through
the reading and go,

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:11.000 align:middle line:84%
well, actually, you've got
quite a few eights here

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.730 align:middle line:84%
because it's also
a lesson for you,

00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:15.150 align:middle line:84%
which means you need to learn
how to get that security.

00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:18.220 align:middle line:84%
So it's knowing whether that
eight is there-- you've learnt

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:19.440 align:middle line:90%
it and you get it quite easy.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:21.140 align:middle line:84%
Or it's a lesson
for you as well,

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:23.531 align:middle line:84%
which means it's going to be
more of a challenge for you.

00:29:23.531 --> 00:29:24.230 align:middle line:90%
Mm hm.

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's where you going to
go back to the chakras and go,

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:28.390 align:middle line:84%
which chakra is
driving this one?

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:29.520 align:middle line:90%
Is it the base chakra?

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:30.570 align:middle line:90%
Is it the sacral?

00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:31.610 align:middle line:90%
Or is it solar plexus?

00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:33.003 align:middle line:90%
Is it me who is stopping it?

00:29:33.003 --> 00:29:33.710 align:middle line:90%
Mm hm.

00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And then we go
back to the beliefs.

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:36.830 align:middle line:84%
Which belief-- what
belief patterns

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:39.500 align:middle line:84%
are you running from your
parents which are driving

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:41.140 align:middle line:90%
this, that you're copying?

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:44.541 align:middle line:84%
Because you'll see that pattern
go back through you're family.

00:29:44.541 --> 00:29:46.321 align:middle line:84%
You'll see--
-Generations after generations.

00:29:46.321 --> 00:29:47.480 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
Absolutely.

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:50.490 align:middle line:90%
So it's-- it's patterns.

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:53.940 align:middle line:84%
So it's, again, am I-- do I
want to learn from my parents?

00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:55.451 align:middle line:90%
Or do I just want to copy them?

00:29:55.451 --> 00:29:56.651 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing a lot
of people who would

00:29:56.651 --> 00:29:57.550 align:middle line:90%
like to copy their parents.

00:29:57.550 --> 00:29:58.384 align:middle line:90%
Mm hm.

00:29:58.384 --> 00:29:59.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:01.900 align:middle line:84%
They're somewhat the kind
of-- not the role model,

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:07.900 align:middle line:84%
but a certain
something that is-- I

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:08.920 align:middle line:90%
don't know how to say it.

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:10.910 align:middle line:90%
But yeah.

00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:13.280 align:middle line:90%
A point out in the horizon.

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:14.080 align:middle line:90%
A reference.

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.250 align:middle line:84%
That's what I was
looking for, a reference.

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:17.140 align:middle line:90%
I guess.

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:18.560 align:middle line:84%
Without copying,
but it's something

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:20.250 align:middle line:84%
that you've seen
from close, so you

00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:22.550 align:middle line:84%
can identify with
it or not really

00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:24.950 align:middle line:84%
want it at all, in any way.
-Yeah.

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:26.910 align:middle line:84%
You know, actually, I'm working
with someone right whose

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:30.840 align:middle line:84%
parents-- actually, he's
actually innate in numerology,

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:32.090 align:middle line:90%
funnily enough.

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:34.601 align:middle line:84%
And his parents have actually
taught him all about security.

00:30:34.601 --> 00:30:35.300 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:37.540 align:middle line:84%
He's got his home,
his work life.

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:39.150 align:middle line:90%
It's all perfect.

00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:40.640 align:middle line:90%
He's got security.

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.250 align:middle line:90%
Money's not a problem for him.

00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:44.601 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is now, he's now
going to next level and going,

00:30:44.601 --> 00:30:45.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm not happy.

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:47.310 align:middle line:84%
So we get him to
the solar plexus.

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:48.210 align:middle line:90%
He goes, I'm not satisfied.

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:49.591 align:middle line:84%
I'm not happy with
the way I look.

00:30:49.591 --> 00:30:50.790 align:middle line:84%
When I look at
myself in the mirror,

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:53.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm not happy with who I see.

00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:56.871 align:middle line:84%
So what I then-- the problem is,
he's now trying to sabotage it

00:30:56.871 --> 00:30:57.570 align:middle line:90%
in different ways.

00:30:57.570 --> 00:30:59.740 align:middle line:84%
So that can be done
through drink, drugs--

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:01.530 align:middle line:84%
whichever way you want
to sabotage yourself

00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:02.700 align:middle line:90%
to try and satisfy that need.

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:05.950 align:middle line:84%
Because if you can't
find that need within,

00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:08.050 align:middle line:84%
you'll look externally
to find that.

00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And often, people will
use drink, drugs to find

00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:13.240 align:middle line:90%
that and satisfy that need.

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:13.940 align:middle line:90%
Mm hm.

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:15.373 align:middle line:84%
But you're-- you're
going to hit a certain

00:31:15.373 --> 00:31:16.740 align:middle line:84%
point where you're--
you're going to go,

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:17.679 align:middle line:90%
this is not serving me.

00:31:17.679 --> 00:31:18.845 align:middle line:84%
Because you'll
either find that you

00:31:18.845 --> 00:31:21.300 align:middle line:84%
have to do more and
more of it to-- to make

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:22.640 align:middle line:90%
yourself feel better.

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:24.130 align:middle line:84%
Or you'll get to the
point where you go,

00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:25.400 align:middle line:90%
I can't do this anymore.

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:26.500 align:middle line:90%
I need to find a new answer.

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is what this
particular client did.

00:31:28.670 --> 00:31:30.990 align:middle line:84%
He goes, I've got to
find a new answer.

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:33.590 align:middle line:84%
So he realized, actually,
he's not happy with himself.

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:35.930 align:middle line:84%
So, for me, I say
to people, if you

00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:38.160 align:middle line:84%
can stand in front of the
mirror in the morning, naked,

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:41.120 align:middle line:84%
and look at yourself, and
go, I love what I see,

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.570 align:middle line:84%
then you know you're
doing all right.

00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:44.370 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people look at
themselves naked in the mirror

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:45.900 align:middle line:84%
and go, I don't like
what I see in front me.

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:46.600 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:49.387 align:middle line:84%
We-- we may not be perfect,
but you go, you know what?

00:31:49.387 --> 00:31:51.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm happy with the person
that I see in front of me.

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:52.770 align:middle line:90%
Mm hm.

00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:55.180 align:middle line:84%
That's-- that's the first
thing I get people to do.

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:56.560 align:middle line:90%
I want you-- not when I'm there.

00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:59.090 align:middle line:84%
But I want them to go, and stand
in front of the mirror, naked,

00:31:59.090 --> 00:32:00.910 align:middle line:84%
look themselves-- really
look at themselves and say,

00:32:00.910 --> 00:32:04.730 align:middle line:84%
do you actually like the
person you see in front of you?

00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:08.600 align:middle line:84%
You'd be surprised, a
lot of people don't.

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:10.670 align:middle line:84%
-Especially as we get older.
-As we-- yeah.

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:13.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, as we get older, our
body's changing, which is fine.

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:17.020 align:middle line:84%
But, I think, also-- we
also grow into our bodies.

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:18.790 align:middle line:84%
We kind of grow and go,
actually, you know what?

00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:20.110 align:middle line:90%
I like the little things.

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:22.380 align:middle line:84%
This doesn't quite fit, but,
you know, I quite like that.

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:23.880 align:middle line:84%
As you get older, you
get-- you kind of start

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:25.850 align:middle line:90%
to appreciate your body more.

00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:28.410 align:middle line:84%
But this-- I've still got
clients in their 40s and 50s,

00:32:28.410 --> 00:32:32.910 align:middle line:84%
who are-- they can't look
in the mirror at themselves

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:34.850 align:middle line:90%
because they don't themselves.

00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:35.560 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:37.940 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as you give that--
you change that belief pattern

00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:40.830 align:middle line:84%
back and give them
love back, it's

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:43.221 align:middle line:84%
amazing how quickly they can
go, I just run around the house

00:32:43.221 --> 00:32:45.950 align:middle line:84%
naked now.
I just love it.

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:48.420 align:middle line:84%
No, but it's lovely what
it-- the impact that it has

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:51.070 align:middle line:84%
because Louisa Hay, for
example, that is 85 years old,

00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:53.100 align:middle line:84%
that started the Hay
House publishing.

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:55.090 align:middle line:84%
She was there in
Glasgow last weekend.

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And she has mirrors, apparently,
everywhere around her house.

00:32:58.750 --> 00:33:01.095 align:middle line:84%
And saying just,
I love you, kid!

00:33:01.095 --> 00:33:02.130 align:middle line:90%
And how are you doing?

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:03.740 align:middle line:90%
You're so beautiful today.

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:06.290 align:middle line:84%
And she has even a
mirror in her bra.

00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:07.980 align:middle line:84%
Oh my god.
So--

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:09.460 align:middle line:90%
She really plays with it.

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And-- and she--
because, for her, it's

00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:13.180 align:middle line:84%
all about affirmation,
and really

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:16.320 align:middle line:84%
feeling it, and bringing
in the vibe even higher,

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:18.667 align:middle line:84%
and enjoying life.
-Yeah.

00:33:18.667 --> 00:33:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And she's saying about
the affirmations.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:20.900 align:middle line:90%
And that's going back.

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:22.800 align:middle line:84%
It's actually reaffirming,
over and over again,

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:24.379 align:middle line:84%
to your subconscious mind.
-Over--

00:33:24.379 --> 00:33:25.660 align:middle line:90%
Going, I love you.

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:27.250 align:middle line:84%
I love this person
I see in the mirror.

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:29.520 align:middle line:84%
This the person I
want to be with.

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:31.900 align:middle line:84%
Because once you can
be with this person,

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:33.890 align:middle line:84%
then you can find your
partner a lot easier.

00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:35.540 align:middle line:84%
So for instance,
if you're single,

00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:36.850 align:middle line:84%
make sure you love
yourself first.

00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:39.090 align:middle line:84%
Make sure you look in the
mirror and go, you know what?

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:41.320 align:middle line:84%
If I can't look at myself naked,
how am I expecting someone else

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:42.257 align:middle line:90%
to look at me naked?

00:33:42.257 --> 00:33:43.890 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to look--
make you look at yourself

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:44.623 align:middle line:90%
and go, you know what?

00:33:44.623 --> 00:33:46.187 align:middle line:90%
I love who I see in the mirror.

00:33:46.187 --> 00:33:48.020 align:middle line:84%
Once I love who's there, then
I can go and find someone

00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:50.850 align:middle line:84%
because when I'm naked, I don't
care how I look because I'm

00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:51.720 align:middle line:90%
comfortable with that.

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:54.410 align:middle line:84%
Even if-- even if you're
overweight or whatever, as long

00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:55.970 align:middle line:84%
as you're comfortable
with who you are,

00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:56.990 align:middle line:90%
that's a good starting point.

00:33:56.990 --> 00:34:00.780 align:middle line:84%
For me, it's how you
think is the biggest

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:01.850 align:middle line:90%
strength that can have.

00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:04.250 align:middle line:84%
If you have the right
thoughts-- sometimes

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:05.750 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter what
kind of life you have.

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:08.090 align:middle line:84%
You know, you meet people
who've smoked all their life

00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:10.540 align:middle line:84%
and always eaten
the fatty foods,

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:14.151 align:middle line:84%
but they have such a positive
mind that they never got ill.

00:34:14.151 --> 00:34:14.850 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:16.465 align:middle line:84%
You expect them to
have cancer, to have

00:34:16.465 --> 00:34:18.860 align:middle line:90%
all these different diseases.

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:22.190 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, because
they're so strong in the mind,

00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:23.670 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't affect them.

00:34:23.670 --> 00:34:25.340 align:middle line:84%
They love the person
for who they are.

00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:28.070 align:middle line:84%
They're not trying to change
and be someone that they're not.

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:29.719 align:middle line:84%
They're going, no,
this is who I am.

00:34:29.719 --> 00:34:31.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to change
who I am because I love who

00:34:31.650 --> 00:34:33.150 align:middle line:90%
I see in front of that mirror.

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:33.960 align:middle line:90%
Mm hm.

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:35.719 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you
go, you know what?

00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:36.750 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:38.581 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we'd like to change
the rest of your lifestyle,

00:34:38.581 --> 00:34:39.940 align:middle line:84%
but you know what?
-Mm hm.

00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:41.810 align:middle line:90%
If you're happy, that's great.

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:45.400 align:middle line:84%
Do you really feel that EFT,
too, is also a great-- the

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:47.420 align:middle line:90%
tapping methods are good?

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:48.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:52.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, EFT-- well, often, what
I do is now because-- actually,

00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:54.650 align:middle line:84%
now with YouTube,
you can actually

00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:57.950 align:middle line:84%
send people to-- to
YouTube and say, look,

00:34:57.950 --> 00:34:59.660 align:middle line:84%
go and type in the
belief patterns

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:00.850 align:middle line:90%
that you have a problem with.

00:35:00.850 --> 00:35:03.770 align:middle line:84%
So with the
[INAUDIBLE], we address

00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:04.720 align:middle line:90%
things at the core belief.

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:06.340 align:middle line:90%
We get down to the nitty-gritty.

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:07.960 align:middle line:84%
But when you've got
small, little things going

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:09.977 align:middle line:84%
on, I say to people,
look, you can

00:35:09.977 --> 00:35:10.910 align:middle line:90%
go ahead and do the tapping.

00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:13.040 align:middle line:84%
The tapping is easy and you
can use it on a daily basis.

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:14.860 align:middle line:84%
You know, you can even
go into the bathroom.

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:19.100 align:middle line:84%
If you're at work, go into the
bathroom, go and do some taps.

00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:21.200 align:middle line:84%
If something comes up for
you, go and tap it out.

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing how people
have learnt this technique.

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:25.955 align:middle line:84%
It used to be a
case where you would

00:35:25.955 --> 00:35:28.110 align:middle line:84%
have to go and see someone to
kind of go through the process.

00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:30.817 align:middle line:84%
But now people are going, I can
now learn how to tap myself.

00:35:30.817 --> 00:35:31.650 align:middle line:90%
And that's why I said it.

00:35:31.650 --> 00:35:33.400 align:middle line:84%
So I don't actually do
much EFT with my clients

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:37.320 align:middle line:84%
anymore because I tell them, you
go and do the EFT on your own.

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.810 align:middle line:84%
I do this stuff
which is a bit deeper

00:35:38.810 --> 00:35:41.350 align:middle line:84%
and which we can't
do without me.

00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And then you go, and do the EFT,
and change the emotions that

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:45.540 align:middle line:90%
may be coming up at the job.

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Because everything's like this--
I use the onion as the analogy.

00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:51.440 align:middle line:84%
We take one layer away,
then something else

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:52.520 align:middle line:84%
is going to come up.
-Mm hm.

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:54.310 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes we need
to get deeper into that

00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:55.790 align:middle line:84%
and we need to do
more work on it.

00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:57.450 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's
something very simple.

00:35:57.450 --> 00:35:59.090 align:middle line:84%
There's an emotion,
which has been

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:00.540 align:middle line:84%
attached to it, which,
actually, sometimes

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:01.570 align:middle line:90%
you can break yourself.

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's where EFT
is brilliant for that.

00:36:03.210 --> 00:36:04.490 align:middle line:84%
Because it will
break those patterns.

00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:07.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying EFT can't
be used for deeper stuff.

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:10.630 align:middle line:84%
But when I'm doing
deep stuff with people,

00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:12.535 align:middle line:84%
I then get them to work
on the little things that

00:36:12.535 --> 00:36:14.590 align:middle line:84%
come up in between sessions.
-Right.

00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:16.071 align:middle line:84%
And that's where EFT
is brilliant for that.

00:36:16.071 --> 00:36:17.590 align:middle line:84%
Mm.
OK, great.

00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:19.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, this was really,
really interesting.

00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:21.930 align:middle line:84%
Is there something else
that you would like

00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:23.770 align:middle line:90%
to add to this conversation?

00:36:23.770 --> 00:36:26.600 align:middle line:84%
Or to summarize something
that we said that you think

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:29.140 align:middle line:84%
is particularly important?
-OK.

00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:34.300 align:middle line:90%
For me, change your thinking.

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:38.890 align:middle line:84%
Get your thoughts in line with
how you want to feel when you

00:36:38.890 --> 00:36:41.630 align:middle line:84%
have the perfect life,
whether your perfect life is

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:44.200 align:middle line:84%
a big house, car,
lots of holidays,

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:47.380 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's just actually
living in-- in the forest.

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:49.850 align:middle line:84%
Whichever-- whatever
your life wants to be,

00:36:49.850 --> 00:36:51.980 align:middle line:84%
I want people to get in
touch with the emotions

00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:53.894 align:middle line:84%
of how they're going to
feel when I they have that.

00:36:53.894 --> 00:36:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And then when you get
in touch with that,

00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:56.370 align:middle line:90%
I want you to really feel it.

00:36:56.370 --> 00:36:58.981 align:middle line:84%
I mean, not just like,
yeah, I feel it, it's nice.

00:36:58.981 --> 00:37:00.870 align:middle line:84%
No.
I want you to really feel it.

00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:03.640 align:middle line:84%
But not just today, tomorrow.
Every day.

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:07.640 align:middle line:84%
Every day until all of a sudden,
you look and you go, oh my god.

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:09.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm now living that life.

00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:12.310 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people think, if I do
it for a week, it'll be fine?

00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:13.640 align:middle line:90%
I say, you keep doing this.

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:15.190 align:middle line:84%
And what you'll find
is, after awhile,

00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:16.920 align:middle line:90%
you just get into habit.

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:19.160 align:middle line:84%
And you're actually doing it
without even thinking about it.

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:22.730 align:middle line:84%
But for me, you're
thinking, your emotions,

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:24.670 align:middle line:84%
is what's driving
the rest your life.

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:27.710 align:middle line:84%
The physical body
is just a vehicle.

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:30.860 align:middle line:84%
What drives that is how
we think and how we feel.

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:34.030 align:middle line:84%
When we can change that and
we can really get in touch

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:35.650 align:middle line:90%
with that-- and I mean deep.

00:37:35.650 --> 00:37:36.425 align:middle line:90%
Down to the core.

00:37:36.425 --> 00:37:39.206 align:middle line:84%
Where you literally-- for
me, when I'm doing it,

00:37:39.206 --> 00:37:40.644 align:middle line:84%
I literally get
tingling over my body

00:37:40.644 --> 00:37:42.530 align:middle line:84%
that tells me that I've gone
in touch with that emotion.

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:43.229 align:middle line:90%
Mm hm.

00:37:43.229 --> 00:37:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And then the last bit, trust
that that's going to happen.

00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:49.370 align:middle line:84%
Actually feel it as if
it's already happened.

00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:50.480 align:middle line:90%
That you've already got it.

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And then trust that
the universal will give

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:54.360 align:middle line:90%
it to you when you need it.

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.572 align:middle line:90%
At the right time.

00:37:55.572 --> 00:37:56.476 align:middle line:90%
Mm hm.

00:37:56.476 --> 00:37:58.500 align:middle line:84%
So you-- so you really
live it every day

00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:01.630 align:middle line:84%
like if it was already there
and it had already manifested.

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:02.330 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:04.380 align:middle line:84%
Because remember,
the subconscious mind

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:05.550 align:middle line:90%
only knows the now.

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:06.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:08.580 align:middle line:84%
So every day, it's
back in the now moment.

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:09.970 align:middle line:84%
So if you keep
telling it, now, now.

00:38:09.970 --> 00:38:11.920 align:middle line:84%
After a while,
it's going, well, I

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:14.850 align:middle line:84%
didn't know what you were
thinking for last two weeks,

00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:18.050 align:middle line:84%
last two years, but right now,
you have this same emotion.

00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:20.000 align:middle line:84%
This seems to be like
a common pattern.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.725 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
it's-- that's what

00:38:21.725 --> 00:38:22.690 align:middle line:90%
your life's all about.

00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:24.020 align:middle line:90%
It's about being happy.

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:24.737 align:middle line:90%
It's about love.

00:38:24.737 --> 00:38:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, you're
seeing that all around you.

00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:28.010 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it may
not be in the form

00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:29.560 align:middle line:84%
that you think
you want it to be,

00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:32.490 align:middle line:84%
but it will be in the form
that's the best served for you.

00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:33.710 align:middle line:90%
Mm hm.

00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:35.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- it's a
continuous process.

00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:36.570 align:middle line:84%
It's not-- I don't
say to people,

00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:38.261 align:middle line:84%
look, do this for a week
and all of a sudden,

00:38:38.261 --> 00:38:39.490 align:middle line:84%
things will change.
-Yeah.

00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:40.376 align:middle line:84%
You know, sometimes
you're going to have to do

00:38:40.376 --> 00:38:41.750 align:middle line:90%
this for a year, for two years.

00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:43.140 align:middle line:84%
-But it can be really fast, too.
-Yeah.

00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:44.290 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely.
You can get both.

00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:46.950 align:middle line:84%
Don't-- don't think, OK, I've
got to do two years of this?

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:48.679 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to do two years!
OK, no.

00:38:48.679 --> 00:38:49.440 align:middle line:90%
Keep doing it.

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And then just watch
things change.

00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:53.850 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you get small
changes, but sometimes you

00:38:53.850 --> 00:38:54.680 align:middle line:90%
get big changes.

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:57.930 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people-- I've seen
things happen in people's lives

00:38:57.930 --> 00:38:59.430 align:middle line:90%
in the click of a finger.

00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:02.620 align:middle line:84%
You're going, wow, how
the hell do you do that?

00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:06.460 align:middle line:84%
Because it was-- an analogy,
which I saw-- hear about

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:08.430 align:middle line:84%
was that everything we seen
in our life at the moment

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:11.300 align:middle line:84%
is on the radar screen,
but most of things that

00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:12.550 align:middle line:84%
are going to happen
in your life are

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:14.264 align:middle line:90%
outside of that radar screen.

00:39:14.264 --> 00:39:15.930 align:middle line:84%
Will you trust that they're
actually going to come

00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:17.810 align:middle line:90%
in when the time is right?

00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:19.210 align:middle line:84%
Then it will happen.
-Mm hm.

00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:22.077 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you just
let go and go, you know what?

00:39:22.077 --> 00:39:23.010 align:middle line:90%
