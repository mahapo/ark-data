>>Why were the ancients so
interested in the motion

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:10.934 align:middle line:90%
of the stars?

00:00:10.934 --> 00:00:13.740 align:middle line:90%


00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.260 align:middle line:84%
Why was cosmology
sacred to the ancients?

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.500 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.470 align:middle line:84%
Pondering the history
of Ancient Egypt,

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.960 align:middle line:84%
we typically think of the
mysteries of the pyramids

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.870 align:middle line:90%
and the grandeur of the temples.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.260 align:middle line:90%
But where did it all start?

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.100 align:middle line:84%
Do we know how long
ago the ancients

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.522 align:middle line:90%
began tracking the stars?

00:00:38.522 --> 00:00:41.830 align:middle line:84%
Could there be lost worlds
buried beneath the sands?

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.323 align:middle line:90%

>>Cosmology is the study of
the universe in its totality.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.530 align:middle line:90%


00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.440 align:middle line:84%
We think of
cosmology as science,

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.008 align:middle line:84%
whereas the Egyptians
considered it sacred.

00:01:39.008 --> 00:01:43.590 align:middle line:90%


00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.100 align:middle line:10%
>>There's one thing we know
about the ancient Egypt

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.300 align:middle line:10%
for certainty, is that they
observed the star Sirius.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.890 align:middle line:84%
We are sure when they
speak of that star.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.100 align:middle line:10%
>>Everything that comes
out of the ancient world

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.045 align:middle line:10%
has to have a spiritual
and metaphysical base.

00:02:00.045 --> 00:02:03.400 align:middle line:90%


00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.990 align:middle line:10%
>>The ancients-- and
the ancient Egyptians,

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.419 align:middle line:10%
in particular, but probably
ancient civilizations,

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:13.530 align:middle line:10%
more generally-- saw
themselves-- humanity, us-- as

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.365 align:middle line:10%
tied in with the
bigger environment,

00:02:15.365 --> 00:02:17.260 align:middle line:10%
the cosmos, the bigger picture.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.030 align:middle line:84%
>>They built monuments
in alignment.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.050 align:middle line:90%
But what for?

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:27.264 align:middle line:10%
And do their belief systems
have validity today?

00:02:27.264 --> 00:02:30.680 align:middle line:10%
>>If we want to decode
Egyptian symbolism,

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.580 align:middle line:10%
we should look for clues
in the ancient language

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.250 align:middle line:10%
that Hakim learned as
a child from his elders

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.000 align:middle line:10%
living along the Band of Peace.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.450 align:middle line:84%
Looking at the many images
left by the Egyptians,

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.080 align:middle line:84%
we have assumed that they
were obsessed with death.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.015 align:middle line:84%
Turning to the
ancient Suf language,

00:02:51.015 --> 00:02:53.840 align:middle line:84%
however, we learn
that they didn't even

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.230 align:middle line:90%
have a word for death.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.325 align:middle line:90%
They called it "westing."

00:02:59.325 --> 00:03:05.080 align:middle line:10%
>>We have no word the death in
our culture-- no word "death."

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:11.220 align:middle line:10%
And to express this
operation of death,

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.860 align:middle line:10%
we say "westing"--
going towards west,

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.900 align:middle line:10%
like the Sun rise from
the east, and westing.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.340 align:middle line:84%
So there is no
word "death" here.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, they believe
in resurrection.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.630 align:middle line:84%
If the Sun sets in the
west, the resurrection

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.686 align:middle line:84%
happen the next day, when
the Sun rise in the next day.

00:03:31.686 --> 00:03:36.950 align:middle line:84%
So the deceased believe
that it's just like the Sun.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>>The Egyptians obviously had
a very different world view

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.700 align:middle line:90%
from ours today.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.905 align:middle line:84%
They believed in the afterlife
and the soul's immortality.

00:03:46.905 --> 00:03:49.670 align:middle line:84%
>>Was it possible
at all that they

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.686 align:middle line:84%
had found some sort of science
of immortality, for example,

00:03:53.686 --> 00:03:55.170 align:middle line:90%
we call it.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.770 align:middle line:84%
As crazy as it may
seem, they seem

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.740 align:middle line:84%
to be very, very
convinced that they

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:06.130 align:middle line:84%
knew how to send the
king to his cosmic world.

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.470 align:middle line:84%
Those stellar gods-- of
whom the king believed

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.720 align:middle line:84%
that he, himself, would
become one stellar god

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:19.620 align:middle line:84%
after his death-- constructed
monuments and performed rituals

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.790 align:middle line:84%
that mimicked the events
that they saw in the sky.

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:29.250 align:middle line:84%
It sounds against all the tenets
of our scientific beliefs.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.610 align:middle line:84%
But we have to see why
they were so convinced.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.670 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Egyptians
perceived the land

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:43.690 align:middle line:84%
as a cosmic environment,
that it followed

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.150 align:middle line:90%
the activities of the sky.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.440 align:middle line:84%
Because they believed them
to be running in parallel.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And they had reasons
to believe that.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.010 align:middle line:84%
One of the main reasons
was the cycles of the Nile.

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.870 align:middle line:84%
The Nile was the
lifeblood of Egypt,

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.240 align:middle line:84%
and it performed a
cycle, which followed

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.315 align:middle line:84%
the cycle of the
Sun and the stars.

00:05:04.315 --> 00:05:06.720 align:middle line:84%
It's not surprising at
all that they associated

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.790 align:middle line:84%
the reappearance of the stars
with the rebirth of the Nile.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:15.010 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, this star
religion, if you like,

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.605 align:middle line:84%
boiled down to one
important aspect--

00:05:19.605 --> 00:05:26.490 align:middle line:84%
that it somehow could help the
king become a spiritual being

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.230 align:middle line:84%
and return to the cosmic
world in a specific place

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:31.470 align:middle line:90%
with Orion, and so forth.

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.310 align:middle line:90%


00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.042 align:middle line:84%
How they thought
they were going to do

00:05:36.042 --> 00:05:38.934 align:middle line:84%
it is by looking very,
very carefully at what

00:05:38.934 --> 00:05:41.550 align:middle line:90%
happened to the stars.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.170 align:middle line:84%
The stars perform a
annual cycle that those

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:48.360 align:middle line:84%
who've seen this
in Orion give us

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.103 align:middle line:84%
a curious cycle in
that they disappear.

00:05:53.103 --> 00:05:57.510 align:middle line:90%
Or they appear to disappear.

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.040 align:middle line:84%
But if you watch a star
over the course of the year,

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.420 align:middle line:84%
you'll find that there
comes a time when

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:08.075 align:middle line:84%
it is very low in the
west at time of sunset.

00:06:08.075 --> 00:06:09.823 align:middle line:90%
So the Sun sets.

00:06:09.823 --> 00:06:12.158 align:middle line:84%
And as it gets dark,
the star appears just

00:06:12.158 --> 00:06:14.025 align:middle line:90%
for a few seconds over the west.

00:06:14.025 --> 00:06:18.190 align:middle line:84%
If you come the next day,
you would not see that star.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.670 align:middle line:84%
And for 70 days or
so, the star has gone.

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.100 align:middle line:84%
It seems to have
gone under the Earth.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:30.317 align:middle line:84%
But after those 70 days, it
appears by this time at dawn,

00:06:30.317 --> 00:06:34.002 align:middle line:84%
rising just before the Sun,
which we call the heliacal

00:06:34.002 --> 00:06:35.750 align:middle line:84%
rising, whereas
the Egyptian called

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:37.856 align:middle line:90%
it the rebirth of the star.

00:06:37.856 --> 00:06:40.680 align:middle line:84%
So in their mind,
something happened.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:45.780 align:middle line:84%
In their mind, the star went
in the underworld, stayed

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:50.576 align:middle line:84%
in the underworld for 70 days,
and then, by magic, popped

00:06:50.576 --> 00:06:53.722 align:middle line:84%
up again-- was reborn
again in the east.

00:06:53.722 --> 00:06:55.174 align:middle line:90%
That's the Pyramid Texts.

00:06:55.174 --> 00:06:58.562 align:middle line:84%
The Pyramid Texts
mimic this cycle.

00:06:58.562 --> 00:07:01.220 align:middle line:84%
>>At the ancient
site of Saqqara,

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.880 align:middle line:84%
we find the Pyramid Texts, the
oldest known religious texts

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:06.445 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:07:06.445 --> 00:07:09.770 align:middle line:90%


00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.720 align:middle line:84%
Covering the inner walls
of these small pyramids

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.410 align:middle line:84%
are thousands of hieroglyphs
showing knowledge

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.890 align:middle line:84%
of celestial mechanics
and cycles of time.

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:26.140 align:middle line:90%


00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.890 align:middle line:84%
Although we've come a long
way in our understanding

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:32.880 align:middle line:84%
of hieroglyphs, it is
possible that many layers

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:37.790 align:middle line:84%
of meaning in the symbols
remain hidden-- until now.

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:40.340 align:middle line:90%


00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.510 align:middle line:10%
When we approach
hieroglyphics, we

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:45.800 align:middle line:10%
do so from our
own point of view.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.370 align:middle line:10%
And we assume that the
letters of our alphabet

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:52.340 align:middle line:10%
correspond with
certain hieroglyphs.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:56.250 align:middle line:84%
There are 4,000 Egyptian
hieroglyphs, but only

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:59.370 align:middle line:90%
26 letters.

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:01.830 align:middle line:84%
In order to crack
the code, we need

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:06.310 align:middle line:84%
to open our minds to
different levels of meaning.

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:09.290 align:middle line:84%
>>I think it's just a
familiarity with the way

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:10.490 align:middle line:90%
modern languages work.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.630 align:middle line:84%
No one expects that a word
would work differently.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:17.780 align:middle line:10%
Our mindset is that a letter is
the carrier of a kinetic value,

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.910 align:middle line:10%
and that a word is a
carrier of a concept.

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:22.562 align:middle line:10%
To understand the
Egyptian words,

00:08:22.562 --> 00:08:24.020 align:middle line:10%
you have to start
from the approach

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:27.520 align:middle line:10%
that the letter is the
carrier of the concept.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And the word is an
extended sentence.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.820 align:middle line:90%


00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:36.330 align:middle line:84%
There are nuances of
meanings to the words

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.220 align:middle line:84%
that you don't get if
you don't understand

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:41.086 align:middle line:90%
what the individual glyphs mean.

00:08:41.086 --> 00:08:42.669 align:middle line:84%
For instance, there's
an Egyptian word

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:46.300 align:middle line:84%
that is translated
as "diving duck."

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.000 align:middle line:84%
But when you read
the glyphs, it really

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.420 align:middle line:84%
reads, "pool of water,
place of diving duck."

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:58.550 align:middle line:10%
>>In 1822, French scholar
Jean-Francois Champollion

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:01.130 align:middle line:10%
and British scientist
Thomas Young

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:05.330 align:middle line:10%
deciphered the hieroglyphics
from the Rosetta Stone.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:09.766 align:middle line:90%
The stone was created in 196 BC.

00:09:09.766 --> 00:09:13.850 align:middle line:84%
It showed the same text
in hieroglyphic, Greek,

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:18.050 align:middle line:84%
and demotic Egyptian
on the one tablet.

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:21.500 align:middle line:84%
Scholars have used
Champollion's translations

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:25.570 align:middle line:84%
as the basis for
deciphering hieroglyphs.

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:29.620 align:middle line:84%
Could Champollion have missed
subtleties or even withheld

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:30.650 align:middle line:90%
some information?

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:32.770 align:middle line:84%
>>One biographical
study of Champollion

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:37.910 align:middle line:84%
said that he delayed for
a very long period of time

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:40.880 align:middle line:84%
before producing his
translation because

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:46.090 align:middle line:84%
in the words of the study, he
clung stubbornly to the idea

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:49.550 align:middle line:84%
that an Egyptian glyph
might mean something more

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:51.186 align:middle line:90%
than just a phonetic value.

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:59.680 align:middle line:84%
who has interpreted a new
aspect of hieroglyphics.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:03.330 align:middle line:84%
His research is revolutionizing
the way hieroglyphic

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:04.690 align:middle line:90%
is understood.

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:07.000 align:middle line:10%
>>Basically, Egyptian
hieroglyphic words

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.690 align:middle line:10%
work more like an acronym in
English-- like the phrase FYI

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:16.440 align:middle line:10%
or an acronym such
as CIA or CBS--

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.680 align:middle line:10%
where anyone who reads
English understands

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.190 align:middle line:10%
that you don't try to
pronounce this word.

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:24.000 align:middle line:10%
This is not a word that you're
going to read for its meaning,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.960 align:middle line:10%
in terms of the letters
all put together.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.317 align:middle line:10%
It's one letter at a time
stands for one word at a time.

00:10:30.317 --> 00:10:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And you put the words
together to get the meaning.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.640 align:middle line:84%
>>If we think of each
hieroglyphic word

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:39.230 align:middle line:84%
as an acronym, rather than
having a phonetic value,

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:43.450 align:middle line:84%
a new layer of
interpretation appears.

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:47.160 align:middle line:84%
Hieroglyphs reveal in
symbolic terms the way

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:51.060 align:middle line:84%
the ancient Egyptians
thought the universe works.

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:54.500 align:middle line:84%
>>I can show that certain
key glyph shapes came out

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:59.790 align:middle line:84%
of cosmology, which describes
how the universe was created.

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And because the shapes
came out of cosmology,

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:05.470 align:middle line:84%
it makes sense that the meanings
that attach to the shape

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:07.385 align:middle line:84%
are associated with
cosmology, also.

00:11:07.385 --> 00:11:09.540 align:middle line:84%
They would have meanings
related to the creation

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.590 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:14.580 align:middle line:10%
Once you agree that the Sun
glyph means what it means--

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:17.080 align:middle line:10%
and that's all traditional
meanings-- it's

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.390 align:middle line:10%
hard to argue that the
word "month" doesn't say,

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:20.862 align:middle line:10%
the moon makes an orbit.

00:11:20.862 --> 00:11:23.720 align:middle line:10%


00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:27.035 align:middle line:10%
Or it's hard to argue that the
word "year" doesn't say, time

00:11:27.035 --> 00:11:28.625 align:middle line:10%
of the Earth's orbit
around the Sun.

00:11:28.625 --> 00:11:41.170 align:middle line:90%


00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:44.680 align:middle line:84%
>>The ancient Egyptians were
almost obsessive keepers

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:46.310 align:middle line:90%
of records.

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that they observed
most was the celestial objects.

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:55.700 align:middle line:84%
But we'd expect them to
pay attention and record.

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:59.970 align:middle line:84%
Now how far back--
that's a big question.

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:02.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, we now have some
sites that go at least 6,000

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:07.180 align:middle line:90%
or 7,000 years before.

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:10.170 align:middle line:84%
There's a megalithic
site that has

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:13.930 align:middle line:84%
been found in the
early '70s, but not

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:18.704 align:middle line:84%
understood until lately, that
has astronomical language.

00:12:18.704 --> 00:12:22.762 align:middle line:84%
And strangely, the astronomical
language that it has

00:12:22.762 --> 00:12:27.420 align:middle line:84%
are precisely the ones you
find in the Pyramid Age.

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:31.210 align:middle line:84%
So Orion, Sirius, the summer
solstice-- they're all there.

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:32.840 align:middle line:90%
It's no more theory.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:34.774 align:middle line:84%
We have evidence
that they did it.

00:12:34.774 --> 00:12:39.450 align:middle line:90%


00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:41.830 align:middle line:84%
>>For decades,
author Robert Bauval

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:45.370 align:middle line:84%
has been studying the
alignment of Egyptian monuments

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:46.485 align:middle line:90%
to key stars.

00:12:46.485 --> 00:12:51.317 align:middle line:90%


00:12:51.317 --> 00:12:53.290 align:middle line:90%
>>Muhammad's out guide.

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:55.160 align:middle line:90%
We've come here.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:13:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And what we're trying to do
is get to the Nabta Playa.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.856 align:middle line:84%
The most important
thing is we get there.

00:13:02.856 --> 00:13:04.520 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:07.930 align:middle line:84%
>>He is now planning an
expedition across the desert

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:13.670 align:middle line:84%
to a site called Nabta Playa,
100 kilometers west of the Nile

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:17.910 align:middle line:84%
and 30 kilometers north
of the Sudanese border.

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:21.570 align:middle line:84%
It is the location of Egypt's
oldest astronomical measuring

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:22.070 align:middle line:90%
device.

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:24.750 align:middle line:90%


00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:26.972 align:middle line:84%
>>And when we're there, how
do you know we're there?

00:13:26.972 --> 00:13:28.840 align:middle line:90%
It's all desert.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.914 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes, it's desert.

00:13:30.914 --> 00:13:32.830 align:middle line:84%
Every place here in
Western Desert, I know it.

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:35.154 align:middle line:84%
>>If you can, we're
going to need a GPS.

00:13:35.154 --> 00:13:35.653 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:13:35.653 --> 00:13:36.575 align:middle line:90%
>>If you can get one.

00:13:36.575 --> 00:13:38.210 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes, I have one.

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>>That makes me
feel a lot happier.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.850 align:middle line:84%
>>The team finds out
that permits from Cairo

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:46.440 align:middle line:90%
have been delayed.

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.700 align:middle line:90%
>>Now we wait.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:51.540 align:middle line:84%
You tell us we wait for
the answer from Cairo.

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:54.050 align:middle line:84%
So in the meanwhile, let's
go and see the sights.

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:55.950 align:middle line:84%
Let's go and see some
of the temples here.

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:56.450 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:57.782 align:middle line:90%
>>Let's do it.

00:13:57.782 --> 00:14:02.021 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:02.021 --> 00:14:05.840 align:middle line:84%
>>The key to decoding
Egypt is in the alignments

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:10.260 align:middle line:84%
of the temples, which
changed in different epochs

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:14.470 align:middle line:84%
to match the majestic drift of
the procession of the stars.

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:18.060 align:middle line:84%
>>We're now here at the
Karnak Temple in Luxor.

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:21.290 align:middle line:84%
On this wall, we
can see the ritual

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:23.580 align:middle line:90%
of the stretching of the cord.

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:26.110 align:middle line:84%
On the right-hand side
is the goddess, Seshat.

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:31.460 align:middle line:84%
She's represented by a priestess
holding a rope and a mallet.

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.110 align:middle line:84%
On the other side
is the pharaoh.

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:35.997 align:middle line:84%
There's the cord
looking between them.

00:14:35.997 --> 00:14:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And what they're
doing is that they're

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:39.600 align:middle line:84%
aligning the monuments
to the stars.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.890 align:middle line:90%


00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:46.010 align:middle line:84%
>>We know from inscriptions
at the Temple of Karnak

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:49.710 align:middle line:84%
that they aligned monuments
with the circumpolar stars,

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:50.930 align:middle line:90%
principally, the Big Dipper.

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:53.900 align:middle line:90%


00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:57.550 align:middle line:84%
>>They also aligned to the
stars of Orion, very similarly

00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:59.396 align:middle line:90%
to what we also have at Nabta.

00:14:59.396 --> 00:15:01.930 align:middle line:84%
The Karnak Temple,
the very center

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:05.360 align:middle line:84%
of Egyptian religious
activity, is

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.190 align:middle line:84%
aligned to the sunrise
at the winter solstice.

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:12.050 align:middle line:84%
So as we look down the axis this
way, on the winter solstice,

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:14.670 align:middle line:84%
the Sun will rise
along the axis.

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And in the summer
solstice, it will

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.960 align:middle line:84%
be aligned with the
sunset of the summer.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:23.700 align:middle line:84%
So as we have at
the Nabta Playa,

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:27.200 align:middle line:84%
and the circle of the
calendrical circle, where there

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.320 align:middle line:84%
is the summer
solstice alignment,

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:32.820 align:middle line:84%
here we have another example
of the similar alignment

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:35.920 align:middle line:90%
3,000 years later.

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.510 align:middle line:84%
>>On the expedition
into the open desert,

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:41.510 align:middle line:84%
Robert Bauval hopes
to see for himself

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:44.790 align:middle line:84%
that these alignments exist
in the remote region of Nabta

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:47.140 align:middle line:90%
Playa.

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:53.392 align:middle line:84%
The team prepares by mapping a
route they will access via GPS.

00:15:53.392 --> 00:15:56.340 align:middle line:84%
Jeeps are equipped with supplies
for the dangerous journey.

00:15:56.340 --> 00:16:07.380 align:middle line:90%


00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:10.300 align:middle line:84%
The team arrives at the
first stop on their journey

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:11.142 align:middle line:90%
through history.

00:16:11.142 --> 00:16:17.750 align:middle line:90%


00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:20.590 align:middle line:84%
In the heart of
the El Kharga Oasis

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:23.590 align:middle line:84%
lies a Christian
settlement dating back

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:27.450 align:middle line:90%
to the third century AD.

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:30.930 align:middle line:84%
Original paint graces the
ceiling of the chapel,

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:33.210 align:middle line:84%
telling the stories
of Adam and Eve.

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:38.030 align:middle line:84%
>>What is important here
is that at Nabta, we

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:43.910 align:middle line:84%
have a settlement that
is 6,000 BC, at least.

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And here, we have
a Roman settlement,

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:51.730 align:middle line:84%
which is of the
first-- second century.

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:54.280 align:middle line:84%
Surely, the people here
were aware of some sort

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.618 align:middle line:90%
of origins in the desert.

00:16:56.618 --> 00:17:00.020 align:middle line:90%
They must've moved around here.

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.964 align:middle line:84%
And this is a big world
that anthropologists

00:17:01.964 --> 00:17:04.394 align:middle line:84%
have to get into-- cultural
anthropologists-- people who

00:17:04.394 --> 00:17:09.390 align:middle line:84%
understand how to look for
clues within a lost culture.

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:10.930 align:middle line:84%
We're looking for
a lost culture.

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And it could be the origins
of our civilization.

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:15.398 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
talking about here.

00:17:15.398 --> 00:17:20.318 align:middle line:90%


00:17:20.318 --> 00:17:23.349 align:middle line:84%
>>Off in the distance,
the Christian settlement

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:25.329 align:middle line:90%
can be seen.

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:28.220 align:middle line:84%
In the valley below, we
can see the old riverbed

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:34.470 align:middle line:84%
of the Nile, which has migrated
over 60 kilometers to the east.

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:36.520 align:middle line:84%
How many thousands
of years would it

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:39.560 align:middle line:84%
take to wind back
the geological time

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:43.393 align:middle line:84%
clock to when the
Nile flowed here?

00:17:43.393 --> 00:17:44.866 align:middle line:84%
>>The Nile we know
there was here.

00:17:44.866 --> 00:17:46.170 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:47.885 align:middle line:90%
>>Before, we didn't know.

00:17:47.885 --> 00:17:49.620 align:middle line:90%
Realize what this is.

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:51.640 align:middle line:84%
Almost surely, the
ideas of these people--

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.930 align:middle line:84%
their beliefs, the way they
look at the stars, the way

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:56.360 align:middle line:84%
they look at the Sun, the
way they buried people--

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:59.428 align:middle line:90%
comes from here through.

00:17:59.428 --> 00:18:02.322 align:middle line:84%
Influenced the
following civilization.

00:18:02.322 --> 00:18:07.100 align:middle line:90%
Imagine 2,000 years ago.

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:11.200 align:middle line:84%
It was a Roman garrison, with
Centurians walking about,

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:16.340 align:middle line:84%
and priests, and Roman
ladies in carriages.

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing to think
that this was like this.

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:21.190 align:middle line:84%
People have been here
for thousands of years.

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:22.473 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:18:22.473 --> 00:18:23.995 align:middle line:84%
But now you have
to show us caves.

00:18:23.995 --> 00:18:26.245 align:middle line:84%
You're going to show us
prehistoric caves, where there

00:18:26.245 --> 00:18:28.860 align:middle line:84%

There is water-like ripples,
and seashells are still

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:02.670 align:middle line:84%
a vast change in
geology and climate

as much as 500 millimeters

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:38.550 align:middle line:90%
of precipitation per year.

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:41.790 align:middle line:84%
There were permanent
lakes, large springs,

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:44.730 align:middle line:90%
and seasonal streams.

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:50.850 align:middle line:84%
The most recent wet period
was between 130,000 and 70,000

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:53.360 align:middle line:90%
years ago.

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:57.120 align:middle line:84%
Then, it was thorn
brush savanna.

00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:00.420 align:middle line:84%
At that time, the area
supported many large animals:

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:05.510 align:middle line:84%
gazelles, giraffes, buffalo,
camels, and antelopes.

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:10.990 align:middle line:90%


00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:18.260 align:middle line:84%

reached southern Egypt.

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:28.650 align:middle line:84%
Precipitation was
limited and fell mostly

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:31.180 align:middle line:90%
during the summer months.

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:35.360 align:middle line:84%
It was sufficient to support
small animals and cattle.

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:39.100 align:middle line:84%
The small animals
could live off the dew.

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:42.546 align:middle line:84%
The climate resulted in highly
mobile human populations.

00:21:42.546 --> 00:21:46.750 align:middle line:90%


00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:50.910 align:middle line:84%

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:38.480 align:middle line:90%
The site is unprotected.

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.775 align:middle line:84%
And the irony is that
people who are responsible

00:22:40.775 --> 00:22:43.440 align:middle line:84%
are prevented from coming
here and driven crazy

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:54.485 align:middle line:90%
This is an artist.

00:22:54.485 --> 00:22:57.790 align:middle line:90%
This is not a primitive carver.

00:22:57.790 --> 00:23:03.850 align:middle line:90%

>>Predynastic Egyptian
belief systems

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:12.000 align:middle line:84%
originated with cattle
cults linked to the Nile.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.320 align:middle line:84%
A cow was seen as the
mother of the the Sun.

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:18.020 align:middle line:84%
Cattle were deified
and were considered

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:22.480 align:middle line:84%
earthly representatives
of the gods, an enduring

ideology with Hathor
as the center figure.

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:31.200 align:middle line:84%
Images of bulls were shown
with depictions of stars.

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.020 align:middle line:84%

Prehistoric rock art shows
people and their cattle.

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:17.810 align:middle line:84%
Since Gilf Kebir is
600 kilometers away,

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:19.820 align:middle line:84%
it seems as though
cattle cults were

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:24.130 align:middle line:84%
prevalent throughout North
Africa in ancient times.

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:26.780 align:middle line:84%
Could this be another clue
that the nomadic tribes

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:28.280 align:middle line:90%
were connected?

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:31.020 align:middle line:84%
Could they have influence
the ancient Egyptians?

00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:49.246 align:middle line:84%
view to that of the
ancient Egyptians.

00:28:49.246 --> 00:28:52.780 align:middle line:90%


00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:59.010 align:middle line:84%
The Dogon live in Mali,
largely in isolation.

00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:02.430 align:middle line:84%
Studies of the Dogon
culture mirror the ideology

00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:07.069 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient Egyptians
with uncanny precision.

00:29:07.069 --> 00:29:08.610 align:middle line:10%
>>I realized through
my Dogon studies

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:11.500 align:middle line:10%
that there were relationships
between Dogon words

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:12.600 align:middle line:10%
and Egyptian words.

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:15.270 align:middle line:10%
And I noticed that
Dogon drawings turned up

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:17.350 align:middle line:10%
as glyphs in those
Egyptian words.

00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:20.320 align:middle line:84%
>>Laird Scranton's
radical reinterpretation

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:23.350 align:middle line:84%
of Egyptian hieroglyphs
came directly

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:28.330 align:middle line:84%
from his studies of Dogon
cosmological symbols.

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:32.610 align:middle line:84%
Their priests use cosmological
drawings-- symbols

00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:36.290 align:middle line:84%
they have used for
thousands of years.

00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:39.160 align:middle line:84%
While it is impossible to
ask the ancient Egyptians

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:42.980 align:middle line:84%
to explain their
beliefs, Dogon priests

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:45.690 align:middle line:84%
can explain their
cosmology and how

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:48.892 align:middle line:84%
their symbols are
written and pronounced.

00:29:48.892 --> 00:29:52.210 align:middle line:84%
>>The Dogon lay things
out in such detail

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:53.760 align:middle line:84%
that it's like
having the teacher's

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:55.805 align:middle line:84%
copy of the manual
of the book you're

00:29:55.805 --> 00:29:58.430 align:middle line:84%
studying, with the answers
to the questions written down

00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:59.420 align:middle line:90%
in the back.

00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:00.920 align:middle line:84%
You can go to a
Dogon priest, or you

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:02.820 align:middle line:84%
can go to the
anthropological studies that

00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:05.340 align:middle line:84%
were taken in relation
to the Dogon priests,

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:09.600 align:middle line:84%
and they flat out tell you
what their symbol means

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.740 align:middle line:84%
and what they're
trying to talk about.

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:19.080 align:middle line:90%


00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:23.510 align:middle line:84%
The general pattern I could
say is that Dogon cosmology

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:28.480 align:middle line:84%
tells us how a concept
should be expressed--

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:31.790 align:middle line:84%
how the words should
be pronounced,

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:33.860 align:middle line:84%
what multiple levels
of meaning the word

00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:36.560 align:middle line:84%
should be associated with,
and what kind of a drawing

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:39.430 align:middle line:90%
it should be associated with.

00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:43.180 align:middle line:84%
That predicts for us what
we ought to find in Egypt.

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And so when I go to
Egyptian studies,

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:47.650 align:middle line:84%
I look at the Egyptian
hieroglyphic dictionary,

00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:51.490 align:middle line:84%
or go to a book about
Egyptian cosmology,

00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:54.720 align:middle line:84%
sure enough, I
find the same word

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.620 align:middle line:84%
expressing the same
meanings, written

00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:59.620 align:middle line:84%
with the same drawing or
the same drawn character.

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:01.260 align:middle line:90%
And I say, I've got a match.

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:04.020 align:middle line:90%


00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:06.660 align:middle line:84%
>>How is it possible
that the Dogon culture

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:11.660 align:middle line:84%
in present-day Mali is connected
to the ancient Egyptians?

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:14.310 align:middle line:90%
What is the link?

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:17.770 align:middle line:84%
>>The Dogon seem to have come
out of a class of priests

00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:19.990 align:middle line:84%
who had very
specialized knowledge

00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:22.080 align:middle line:84%
and who, for one
reason or another,

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.330 align:middle line:84%
were not happy with the way
things were going in Egypt

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:25.980 align:middle line:90%
and deliberately left.

00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:27.800 align:middle line:84%
I would say that
sounds like it's true.

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.510 align:middle line:84%
I can't prove it's
true, but it doesn't

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:31.829 align:middle line:90%
contradict anything I know.

00:31:31.829 --> 00:31:34.120 align:middle line:84%
The fact that there's a match
between the Dogon drawing

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:38.410 align:middle line:84%
and the Egyptian glyph in the
context of the same word--

00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:41.520 align:middle line:84%
pronounced the same way,
carrying the same meanings--

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.152 align:middle line:84%
is just another
level of validation

00:31:43.152 --> 00:31:45.360 align:middle line:84%
that I'm on the right track--
that these words really

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:46.660 align:middle line:90%
do correspond to each other.

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:49.560 align:middle line:90%


00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:52.840 align:middle line:84%
>>Using this new
interpretation of hieroglyphic,

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:56.250 align:middle line:84%
what can we learn about
the ancient Egyptian view

00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:57.215 align:middle line:90%
of sacred cosmology?

00:31:57.215 --> 00:32:02.460 align:middle line:90%


00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:04.940 align:middle line:90%

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:11.530 align:middle line:10%
>>I had some
concerns originally,

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:13.100 align:middle line:10%
as I began writing
some of the books,

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:16.300 align:middle line:10%
about what right did I have
to be revealing secrets that

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:19.040 align:middle line:10%
had been kept for 3,000 years.

00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:22.230 align:middle line:10%
But when I realized that
cosmology is about science--

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:25.640 align:middle line:10%
it's about the creation of
matter and things like that--

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:29.090 align:middle line:10%
and I realized how close
our science is right now

00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:35.390 align:middle line:10%
to being caught up with what
the ancient cosmology seemed

00:32:35.390 --> 00:32:37.585 align:middle line:10%
to know, I realized
that if anybody's going

00:32:37.585 --> 00:32:39.850 align:middle line:10%
to get any benefit
out of it at all,

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:41.210 align:middle line:10%
that it has to come out now.

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:42.690 align:middle line:90%
It can't wait any longer.

00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:45.671 align:middle line:84%
We're only about 50 years away
from discovering all the things

00:32:45.671 --> 00:32:49.910 align:middle line:84%
that I've found in the Dogon
and Egyptian cosmology.

00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:53.110 align:middle line:84%
>>Is it possible the
ancient Egyptian cosmology

00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:56.930 align:middle line:84%
was more advanced
than today's science?

00:32:56.930 --> 00:33:01.366 align:middle line:84%
>>I'd say there is information
in the ancient cosmology that

00:33:01.366 --> 00:33:03.700 align:middle line:84%
would be a benefit to
the string theorists

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:07.920 align:middle line:84%
and to the modern cosmologists
if they'd pay attention to it.

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.800 align:middle line:84%
I think the Dogon
and the Egyptians

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:14.200 align:middle line:84%
explain to us how it is that
a mere act of perception

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:16.850 align:middle line:84%
can cause the wavelike
behavior of matter

00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:20.820 align:middle line:84%
to turn into particles,
that scientists don't know.

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:24.755 align:middle line:84%
When you ask Stephen Hawking
how many fundamental particles

00:33:24.755 --> 00:33:27.650 align:middle line:84%
there are, he says,
more than 200.

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:33.800 align:middle line:84%
If you ask a Dogon
priest, he says 266.

>>Science is on the verge
of understanding things

00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:41.760 align:middle line:84%
that ancient civilizations
seemed to know long ago.

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:43.216 align:middle line:90%
How is this possible?

>>Here we have this
bunch of huge megaliths

00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:50.530 align:middle line:84%
that they dragged from God knows
where and placed in a pattern--

00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:54.817 align:middle line:84%
a sort of center point
of the whole area.

00:34:54.817 --> 00:34:57.090 align:middle line:84%
It's essential that
we do not disturb

00:34:57.090 --> 00:34:59.020 align:middle line:84%
the stones-- we
not touch anything.

00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:00.040 align:middle line:90%
We just look at them.

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:01.555 align:middle line:84%
Because the
alignments are there,

00:35:01.555 --> 00:35:05.476 align:middle line:84%
and they've been there for
thousands of years undisturbed.

00:35:05.476 --> 00:35:08.066 align:middle line:84%
And we can use them
to date this place.

>>A group of archaeologists
led by Fred Wendorf, called

00:35:11.312 --> 00:35:14.150 align:middle line:10%
the Combined Prehistoric
Expedition, by chance

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:16.865 align:middle line:10%
found some pottery
shards at Nabta Playa.

00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:25.046 align:middle line:84%
They thought that the megaliths
were just outcrops of rock.

00:35:25.046 --> 00:35:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And then they started
to realize, well,

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:29.620 align:middle line:84%
these are sitting on top of
playa sediments-- sediments

00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:33.670 align:middle line:84%
that were built up during
the Neolithic time.

00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:35.724 align:middle line:90%
And so how did they get there?

00:35:35.724 --> 00:35:38.110 align:middle line:84%
So they had to get
there from man.

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:42.090 align:middle line:84%
These are man-made
objects, these megaliths.

00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:45.800 align:middle line:84%
One of the possible links
to Egypt before the pharaohs

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:49.800 align:middle line:84%
is that Nabta Playa
became climatically hyper

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:54.210 align:middle line:84%
arid, like it is
today, around 3800 BC,

00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:57.604 align:middle line:84%
and it has not been
lived at or used since.

>>It has been
assumed by historians

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:05.920 align:middle line:10%
that Egypt borrowed its complex
society from Mesopotamia.

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:08.590 align:middle line:84%
However, it is now
generally recognized

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:11.880 align:middle line:84%
that a process of
social complexity

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:15.100 align:middle line:84%
is not diffused from
one location to another

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:17.175 align:middle line:90%
but, rather, develops locally.

00:36:17.175 --> 00:36:22.560 align:middle line:90%

up on the Nile Valley, just 100
kilometers east of Nabta Playa.

00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:35.440 align:middle line:84%
If that's the
case, then a lot of

the great dynastic Egyptian
stuff we're all familiar with

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:43.880 align:middle line:84%

she also believes

00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:31.420 align:middle line:84%
We spent two days roaming
around Karkur Talh

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:36.020 align:middle line:84%
and looking at the graffiti, and
all the bovids, and the cattle,

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:39.570 align:middle line:84%
and the people moving
around with their animals.

00:37:47.284 --> 00:37:49.060 align:middle line:84%
They'd use the
position of the Sun

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:51.710 align:middle line:84%
to mark the specific
days of the year.

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:54.590 align:middle line:84%
And the main stations
of the year, of course,

00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:56.980 align:middle line:84%
are the summer solstice,
the winter solstice,

00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:58.530 align:middle line:90%
and the two equinoxes.

00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:01.050 align:middle line:84%
No doubts they tracked
the Sun through the year.

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, they
had a calendar.

00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:07.940 align:middle line:84%
>>This structure may not appear
significant above ground.

00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:11.860 align:middle line:84%
Looking beneath the
surface reveals an enigma.

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>>These complex structures are
the most enigmatic remaining

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:17.629 align:middle line:90%
aspects of Nabta Playa.

00:38:17.629 --> 00:38:19.170 align:middle line:10%
When they estimated
the central one--

00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:23.640 align:middle line:10%
the largest one-- underneath
the surface, down in the playa

00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:27.610 align:middle line:10%
sediments-- the playa sediment
is about 10 feet deep--

00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:29.350 align:middle line:10%
they found this
megalithic sculpture.

00:38:29.350 --> 00:38:31.260 align:middle line:84%
Some people call
it the Cow Stone.

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:33.890 align:middle line:84%
It has, perhaps, a vague
resemblance to a cow.

00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:37.990 align:middle line:84%
But it also seems, maybe, to
have an astronomical meaning,

00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:40.166 align:middle line:84%
because it's in this
astronomical complex.

00:38:40.166 --> 00:38:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And then underneath
the sculpted stone,

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:44.500 align:middle line:84%
on the bedrock-- underneath
all the sediments

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:46.810 align:middle line:84%
that were laid
down earlier-- they

00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:49.520 align:middle line:84%
found another sculpture sculpted
out of the living bedrock,

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:50.695 align:middle line:84%
sort of like the
Sphinx is sculpted out

00:38:50.695 --> 00:38:51.770 align:middle line:90%
of the bedrock itself.

00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:54.080 align:middle line:84%
>>The bedrock
sculpture was carved,

00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:57.990 align:middle line:84%
and sediment filled it in
over thousands of years.

00:38:57.990 --> 00:39:01.426 align:middle line:84%
Then the Cow Stone was
carved and placed there.

00:39:01.426 --> 00:39:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And then sediment
filled it in again.

00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:09.140 align:middle line:84%
We are looking at three
subsurface layers of sediment.

00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:12.660 align:middle line:84%
This is a clue to the
extreme age of Nabta Playa.

00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:20.120 align:middle line:90%


00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:22.610 align:middle line:84%
>>What makes all this
far more exciting

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:26.002 align:middle line:84%
is that they also
align to stars.

00:39:26.002 --> 00:39:28.560 align:middle line:84%
Now that's a totally
different ballgame here.

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:32.275 align:middle line:84%
Because aligning to stars means
that they tracked the seasons.

00:39:32.275 --> 00:39:35.800 align:middle line:84%
The climatic conditions
were very important to them.

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:38.190 align:middle line:84%
There was the beginning
of the monsoons.

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the stars
would be the signal to them

00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:43.580 align:middle line:90%
that the monsoons had started.

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:45.456 align:middle line:90%
They would start migrating here.

00:39:45.456 --> 00:39:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And they would arrive here
when the water-- the monsoons,

00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:50.350 align:middle line:84%
the rainfalls-- had
filled the lakes.

00:39:50.350 --> 00:39:54.100 align:middle line:84%
It was essential that they get
here when the lakes have water.

00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:57.190 align:middle line:84%
It would have been a fatal
mistake had they come here

00:39:57.190 --> 00:40:00.906 align:middle line:90%
20 or 30 days before the event.

00:40:00.906 --> 00:40:02.595 align:middle line:84%
From the central
complex radiates

00:40:02.595 --> 00:40:11.640 align:middle line:84%
three series of lines east
and a series of lines north.

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:17.112 align:middle line:84%
According to Wendorf and
the check-ups by Rophie,

00:40:17.112 --> 00:40:21.410 align:middle line:84%
we've got alignments to
the rising of certain stars

00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:23.450 align:middle line:90%
here and here.

00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:28.150 align:middle line:84%
>>A double alignment of
blocks 250 meters long

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:32.750 align:middle line:84%
points to the brightest
stars in the belt of Orion.

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:37.890 align:middle line:84%
The second line points to the
rising position of Sirius.

00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:41.285 align:middle line:84%
Another long line of stones
aligns to the brightest star

00:40:41.285 --> 00:40:45.270 align:middle line:84%
of the Big Dipper, which
later Egyptians represented

00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:48.960 align:middle line:90%
as a cow thigh or leg.

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:51.310 align:middle line:84%
The stelli faced the
circumpolar region

00:40:51.310 --> 00:40:55.120 align:middle line:84%
of the heavens, which the
Pyramid Texts describe

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:57.500 align:middle line:84%
as a place where
the stars never die.

00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:01.120 align:middle line:90%


00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:07.110 align:middle line:84%
>>They've got Orion's
Belt and Sirius.

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:10.306 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting is that
they seem to be tracking them,

00:41:10.306 --> 00:41:11.574 align:middle line:90%
not just aligning to.

00:41:11.574 --> 00:41:13.740 align:middle line:84%
But they seem to be tracking
them over the movement,

00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:15.620 align:middle line:90%
over the long period of time.

00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:17.600 align:middle line:90%
>>So they knew the stars moved.

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And they knew that the Sun
moved the same every year,

00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:22.410 align:middle line:90%
on an annual cycle.

00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:24.000 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the whole
ceremonial complex

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.890 align:middle line:84%
had something to do with the
Age of Gemini and transition

00:41:26.890 --> 00:41:28.410 align:middle line:90%
to the Age of Taurus.

00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:32.970 align:middle line:84%
>>The constellation of Taurus
is represented by a bull.

00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:35.250 align:middle line:84%
If we are talking
about the transition

00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:38.640 align:middle line:84%
to the Age of Taurus,
was the symbolism

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:41.390 align:middle line:84%
of cows in Ancient
Egypt connected

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:45.270 align:middle line:84%
to the nomadic cattle cults
prevalent in the area?

00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:48.785 align:middle line:84%
>>So astronomy is telling
us that there's a link.

00:41:48.785 --> 00:41:51.610 align:middle line:84%
Now we need the anthropologists
and the Egyptologists

00:41:51.610 --> 00:41:52.857 align:middle line:90%
to find that link.

00:41:52.857 --> 00:41:55.370 align:middle line:84%
>>The problem is that
most of these disciplines

00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:58.905 align:middle line:84%
are so entrenched in
their own little world

00:41:58.905 --> 00:42:02.184 align:middle line:84%
that it's very difficult to move
people one side or the other.

00:42:02.184 --> 00:42:04.176 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how it is
in the United States,

00:42:04.176 --> 00:42:08.450 align:middle line:84%
but in Britain, everyone
is in his own little world.

00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And people who deal
with texts won't

00:42:11.110 --> 00:42:14.612 align:middle line:84%
talk to people who deal with
sites in the same discipline.

00:42:14.612 --> 00:42:19.094 align:middle line:90%


00:42:19.094 --> 00:42:21.090 align:middle line:84%
>>It's becoming more
than obvious now--

00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:22.055 align:middle line:90%
>>I think it is.

00:42:22.055 --> 00:42:23.010 align:middle line:90%
>>That there are--

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:24.010 align:middle line:90%
>>There are connections.

00:42:24.010 --> 00:42:24.470 align:middle line:90%
>>Connections.

00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:25.390 align:middle line:90%
>>Of course there are.

00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:27.265 align:middle line:84%
And they're very, very
important connections.

00:42:27.265 --> 00:42:30.430 align:middle line:84%
Because there are no other
answers, for the moment,

00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:31.250 align:middle line:90%
anyway.

00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:32.536 align:middle line:90%
And this is as good as any.

00:42:32.536 --> 00:42:33.036 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:42:33.036 --> 00:42:33.536 align:middle line:90%
>>Better.

00:42:33.536 --> 00:42:42.090 align:middle line:90%
