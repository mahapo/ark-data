transfer it, and use it.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And that is clear not

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.280 align:middle line:90%
were revealed under the stone.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.360 align:middle line:84%
It would seem that the
images were covered

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.450 align:middle line:84%
in the distant past when things
were changing politically

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:16.500 align:middle line:90%

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:23.290 align:middle line:84%

these out to tourists.

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:33.650 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptological explanation is
that it is multiple hieroglyphs

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:38.040 align:middle line:84%
overlapping from distant
kings' inscriptions.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.880 align:middle line:84%
But, like many things in
Egypt, the explanation

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:42.815 align:middle line:90%
is still debatable.

that Egyptologists merely

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:57.140 align:middle line:84%

the artifact commonly

00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:00.010 align:middle line:84%
known as the
Baghdad Battery that

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:03.730 align:middle line:84%

Similar ancient artifacts
that match these objects

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.870 align:middle line:90%
have been found in Egypt.

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:12.290 align:middle line:84%
We can't say for
certain, but it would

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.520 align:middle line:84%
appear that the
Egyptians documented

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.010 align:middle line:84%
the existence of these
artifacts as well.

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:19.530 align:middle line:90%


00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:22.870 align:middle line:84%
Recreations of these
objects have been made

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.490 align:middle line:84%

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:28.850 align:middle line:90%


00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:32.460 align:middle line:84%
Also noteworthy are
strange representations

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:36.740 align:middle line:84%
of objects that resemble light
bulbs found in the crypts

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.679 align:middle line:90%
at Dendera.

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:41.870 align:middle line:84%
There was no natural light
inside these underground

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:46.960 align:middle line:84%
crypts, but we see no soot
from torches or oil lamps,

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.230 align:middle line:84%
the only lights we
know the ancients used.

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:52.030 align:middle line:84%
Could the ancient
Egyptians have had

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:56.130 align:middle line:84%
their own source of
electrical power?

00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:01.260 align:middle line:84%
If nothing else, the ancients
had to cut, move, and lift

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:06.550 align:middle line:84%
massive stone blocks that would
challenge our engineers today.

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:09.670 align:middle line:90%
What was their secret?

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:13.160 align:middle line:84%
We automatically assume
that ancient structures

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:17.450 align:middle line:84%
are for ceremonial and
religious purposes.

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:21.340 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the pyramids served a
completely different function

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:24.195 align:middle line:90%
than previously imagined.

00:09:24.195 --> 00:09:25.840 align:middle line:84%
>>There's been
lots of speculation

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:29.780 align:middle line:84%
about what the pyramids
were actually built for.

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:32.570 align:middle line:84%
The most accepted notion
is that they were tombs.

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:38.770 align:middle line:90%


00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:40.560 align:middle line:10%

complicated situation

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:44.360 align:middle line:10%
with the Great Pyramid
than most people understand

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.370 align:middle line:10%
or most people believe,
including a lot

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:48.320 align:middle line:10%
of Egyptologists
who see it simply

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.460 align:middle line:10%
as a tomb for the Pharoah Khufu.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:55.840 align:middle line:84%
>>That idea is childish
for the following reason.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:56.730 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's obvious.

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:59.100 align:middle line:10%
We don't find mummies
in the pyramids.

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.810 align:middle line:10%
>>And, of course, not
finding a single mummy

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.440 align:middle line:10%
in any of the
pyramids doesn't seem

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:08.192 align:middle line:10%
to deter the people who think
that that's what they were for.

00:10:08.192 --> 00:10:09.900 align:middle line:84%
>>Yes, there's something
that's sometimes

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.870 align:middle line:84%
referred to as a
stone sarcophagus,

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:16.630 align:middle line:84%
or coffer in it, a
beautiful granite structure.

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:19.485 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't prove
definitively in my mind

00:10:19.485 --> 00:10:21.720 align:middle line:84%
that it was ever
actually used for a tomb.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.085 align:middle line:84%
It may have been used
for many other purposes.

00:10:28.218 --> 00:10:32.040 align:middle line:84%
>>Pyramids were
built not as a tomb.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.610 align:middle line:84%
There are some pyramids built
in a different construction,

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:40.056 align:middle line:84%
like the one in Saqqara,
Step Pyramid, that is tomb.

00:10:40.056 --> 00:10:42.630 align:middle line:84%
>>Look at the obvious
difference in construction

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:47.280 align:middle line:84%
between the Step Pyramid
and the Great Pyramid.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.530 align:middle line:84%
The difference in
style of construction

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:51.390 align:middle line:84%
would logically
indicate they were

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:52.915 align:middle line:90%
built in different time frames.

00:10:52.915 --> 00:10:55.890 align:middle line:90%


00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:58.120 align:middle line:84%
The buildings we
know to be tombs,

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:02.540 align:middle line:84%
like the Step Pyramid at Saqqara
and the flat-topped mastabas

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:05.410 align:middle line:84%
also at Saqqara,
are very different

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:10.760 align:middle line:84%
from the smooth-sided
pyramids at Giza and Dahshur.

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.355 align:middle line:84%
Typically in Egypt,
older constructions

00:11:13.355 --> 00:11:16.920 align:middle line:84%
are built of larger
stones, new constructions

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:20.220 align:middle line:90%
are built of smaller stones.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:24.652 align:middle line:84%
Also in archaeology, older
structures are deeper,

00:11:24.652 --> 00:11:29.600 align:middle line:84%
newer structures are found
closer to the surface.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.730 align:middle line:84%
Every other tomb
that has been found

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:36.790 align:middle line:84%
is highly decorated with
names of the occupant.

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:40.222 align:middle line:84%
The inside of these pyramids
seems solely functional

00:11:40.222 --> 00:11:42.750 align:middle line:90%
and not decorative at all.

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:44.772 align:middle line:84%
>>But if we stop all
together and say, OK,

00:11:44.772 --> 00:11:47.133 align:middle line:84%
if they weren't
tombs, what were they?

00:11:47.133 --> 00:11:51.910 align:middle line:90%


00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:53.480 align:middle line:84%
>>What are the
biggest structures

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:57.010 align:middle line:84%
that modern man
builds on the planet?

00:11:57.010 --> 00:12:00.240 align:middle line:84%
The biggest, most awe-inspiring
structures we create

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.540 align:middle line:90%
are hydroelectric dams.

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:04.810 align:middle line:90%


00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:08.580 align:middle line:10%
Why are we willing to invest
such awe-inspiring amounts

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:11.677 align:middle line:10%
of labor and effort
in constructing those?

00:12:11.677 --> 00:12:13.760 align:middle line:10%
Because we know we're going
to get a very valuable

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.790 align:middle line:10%
physical return in the
form of electricity.

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:20.850 align:middle line:84%
And by comparison, I wonder if
the ancient megalith builders

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:24.550 align:middle line:84%
weren't willing to invest such
staggering amounts of resources

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:28.020 align:middle line:84%
by even smaller populations
because they knew that they

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.920 align:middle line:84%
could get something very
physical and worthwhile

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.400 align:middle line:90%
back from it.

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:36.020 align:middle line:84%
>>People are fascinated
by Egyptian monuments,

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:41.290 align:middle line:84%
and some report the energy
is palpable at these sites.

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:43.410 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible to
confirm this energy

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:46.283 align:middle line:90%
through scientific means?

00:12:46.283 --> 00:12:49.080 align:middle line:10%
>>What I've been finding the
last 20 years of research,

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.834 align:middle line:10%
is a lot of
experiments have been

00:12:50.834 --> 00:12:55.600 align:middle line:10%
done that show that there's
a certain type of energy that

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.080 align:middle line:10%
does not exist in
our current science.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.670 align:middle line:84%
It's unknown to our
current science.

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:02.580 align:middle line:90%
We call it subtle energy.

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:05.690 align:middle line:10%
>>This is a whole
new trend of thought

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:09.230 align:middle line:10%
in looking at ancient structures
that maybe the ancients

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:10.415 align:middle line:10%
understood subtle energies.

00:13:10.415 --> 00:13:15.650 align:middle line:90%


00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:18.410 align:middle line:84%
>>So this appears to
be a technology that

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:21.950 align:middle line:84%
may have existed in
megalithic societies.

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:24.580 align:middle line:84%
You know, these--
these societies

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:27.610 align:middle line:84%
that built things
out of big stones.

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>>It makes sense that you could
motivate an entire population

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:35.226 align:middle line:84%
to invest so heavily in building
these structures, I think.

00:13:35.226 --> 00:13:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean
to say by any means

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.070 align:middle line:84%
that this is the only
purpose of the megaliths,

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:42.955 align:middle line:84%
but I think it's pretty
clear that it's at least one

00:13:42.955 --> 00:13:46.450 align:middle line:84%
of the primary, or one
of the important purposes

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:49.672 align:middle line:90%
for building these structures.

00:13:49.672 --> 00:13:53.511 align:middle line:84%
We find megalithic sites
everywhere around the world,

00:13:53.511 --> 00:13:55.730 align:middle line:84%
and there-- there's a
tendency to make circles

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:57.021 align:middle line:90%
or certain types of formations.

00:13:57.021 --> 00:13:59.760 align:middle line:90%


00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:04.040 align:middle line:84%
>>Megalithic sites occur
all over the world.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.340 align:middle line:90%
Is their placement random?

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.730 align:middle line:84%
Or does the location
of these sites

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:13.960 align:middle line:84%
reveal yet another hidden
layer of ancient knowledge?

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:17.650 align:middle line:84%
>>One thing I found looking at
different megalithic structures

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:20.240 align:middle line:84%
over a few continents
in numerous places

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:23.380 align:middle line:84%
around the world,
overwhelmingly, these places,

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:26.730 align:middle line:84%
the pyramids, the Stonehenges,
et cetera of the world

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:31.530 align:middle line:84%
were placed on ground where
an unusual type of geology

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:35.360 align:middle line:84%
naturally concentrates
the regular daily natural

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:38.370 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic fluctuations
that occur everywhere

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:40.610 align:middle line:90%
on the Earth each day.

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:44.320 align:middle line:84%
>>You go into England, for
example, the ley lines that

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:47.520 align:middle line:84%
cross England, the Michael line,
which is hundreds of miles long

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.790 align:middle line:84%
that crosses
England, that carries

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:53.260 align:middle line:90%
this energy along that line.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.740 align:middle line:84%
>>It will therefore
generate electric currents

00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:58.970 align:middle line:84%
in the land, called
telluric currents

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:01.910 align:middle line:84%
in the straight geological
sense of that word,

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:05.110 align:middle line:84%
and those occur
everywhere on the planet.

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:07.580 align:middle line:84%
>>But we know that this ley
energy, this subtle energy

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.000 align:middle line:90%
passes along these lines.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.620 align:middle line:84%
>>There are certain
special types of geology

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:16.200 align:middle line:84%
that will magnify
those several fold.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:20.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we found the
megalith builders preferred

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:23.550 align:middle line:90%
to put their-- their monuments.

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:25.615 align:middle line:84%
>>And typically where
the lines cross,

00:15:25.615 --> 00:15:28.225 align:middle line:84%
where you get more than
one line intersecting,

00:15:28.225 --> 00:15:30.900 align:middle line:90%
temples were often built.

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:34.470 align:middle line:84%
>>These are called conductivity
discontinuities, which

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:37.140 align:middle line:84%
sounds highly technical,
but it's merely

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:42.010 align:middle line:84%
the place where one area of
ground that has a good ability

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:45.690 align:middle line:84%
to conduct electricity meets
another area of ground that

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:49.110 align:middle line:84%
has a lesser ability to
conduct these natural electric

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:49.750 align:middle line:90%
currents.

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:51.910 align:middle line:84%
>>The Chinese had
the same tradition.

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:53.890 align:middle line:90%
They called them dragon lines.

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:58.330 align:middle line:84%
It was illegal for a commoner
to be buried on such a line.

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:00.860 align:middle line:84%
A king had to be
buried on such a line.

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:04.750 align:middle line:90%
They put the palaces there.

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:07.670 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole series
of sacred sites.

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:12.410 align:middle line:84%
They're always built
on lines like this.

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:16.615 align:middle line:84%
>>I want to say in this area
about the location of temple.

00:16:16.615 --> 00:16:21.180 align:middle line:84%
You have to have a symbols
appear on the ground.

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:27.870 align:middle line:10%
When it's seen, then this is
the place where people naturally

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:33.580 align:middle line:10%
come to get more healthy
energy from that spot.

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:38.047 align:middle line:10%
You know, energy
perhaps from the Earth.

00:16:38.047 --> 00:16:42.920 align:middle line:84%
>>And it appears as though
they were attempting

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:45.455 align:middle line:84%
to control the
flow of this energy

00:16:45.455 --> 00:16:47.125 align:middle line:84%
and use it for
their own purposes.

00:16:47.125 --> 00:16:53.020 align:middle line:90%


00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:56.206 align:middle line:84%
>>The key hours, unfortunately,
are the predawn hours.

00:16:56.206 --> 00:16:57.580 align:middle line:84%
If you really want
to study this,

00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:00.890 align:middle line:84%
you've got to get up at 3:00
and get out there very fast.

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:04.400 align:middle line:84%
That's because the--
the energy that's

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:07.730 align:middle line:84%
involved in these sites that's
really fueling most of it

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:11.400 align:middle line:84%
originates with the daily
changes in the Earth's

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.329 align:middle line:90%
geomagnetic field.

00:17:13.329 --> 00:17:16.710 align:middle line:84%
Its strongest during the
day, weakest at night.

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And in the hours
leading up to dawn,

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:23.339 align:middle line:84%
the weaker field
lines now come roaring

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:25.869 align:middle line:84%
back to closer to full
strength very quick.

00:17:25.869 --> 00:17:28.490 align:middle line:84%
It's the most
dramatic time in terms

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:32.330 align:middle line:84%
of change of magnetic
strengths per hour,

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:34.770 align:middle line:84%
it's the most dramatic
time of the day.

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And wherever you have a changing
magnetic field occurring,

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:41.490 align:middle line:84%
you are generating
electric current

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:44.630 align:middle line:84%
in anything present that
will conduct electricity.

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:47.850 align:middle line:84%
It's a simple principle of
physics known as induction,

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:48.900 align:middle line:90%
and it's a universal.

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:54.220 align:middle line:90%


00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:57.270 align:middle line:84%
>>Normally in everyday
life, we don't ever

00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:00.590 align:middle line:84%
see large concentrations
of this energy.

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:06.130 align:middle line:84%
Normally it'll show up at the
mountaintops, at sacred sites.

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:09.700 align:middle line:84%
You'll feel a certain
calm, a certain peace.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:13.940 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people in those places
report mystical experiences.

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:15.760 align:middle line:84%
They'll see into
some other dimension.

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.070 align:middle line:84%
OK, they'll see into
some other time.

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:20.780 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese have known
about this for a long time,

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.265 align:middle line:90%
and they call it Chi.

00:18:22.265 --> 00:18:26.623 align:middle line:84%
The Hindus in their ancient
texts call it prana.

00:18:26.623 --> 00:18:31.392 align:middle line:84%
And the Yogis, with the maintain
of range and tradition, use it.

00:18:31.392 --> 00:18:33.700 align:middle line:84%
It affects a-- a variety
of different processes,

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:36.570 align:middle line:84%
electricity, magnetism has
a strong effect on that.

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:41.161 align:middle line:84%
So it modifies all the
other laws of physics.

00:18:41.161 --> 00:18:45.660 align:middle line:84%
When you look back on how
sacred sites were chosen

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:50.710 align:middle line:84%
and buildings like the pyramids
were-- were constructed,

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:54.150 align:middle line:84%
the suspicion arises
that they understood

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:56.290 align:middle line:84%
quite a bit more about
this stuff than we do.

00:18:56.290 --> 00:19:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And they may have been using
it in their engineering.

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:03.430 align:middle line:84%
>>Then, the megalith builders
designed these structures

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:05.720 align:middle line:84%
and then built them
in such a way as

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.340 align:middle line:84%
to further concentrate
those energies.

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:11.240 align:middle line:84%
So they definitely seem to have
known what they were doing.

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:15.140 align:middle line:90%


00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:17.080 align:middle line:84%
>>We are not used
to things built out

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:21.186 align:middle line:90%
of stone being high technology.

00:19:21.186 --> 00:19:23.350 align:middle line:84%
It is clear that
several different kinds

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:26.380 align:middle line:84%
of stone from a
variety of sources

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:28.540 align:middle line:84%
were used to construct
Egyptian monuments.

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:34.840 align:middle line:90%


00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.350 align:middle line:84%
Did the distinct
qualities of the stone

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:39.818 align:middle line:90%
serve a special purpose?

00:19:39.818 --> 00:19:44.440 align:middle line:84%
>>What I do find fascinating is
that the core of the pyramids,

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:47.780 align:middle line:84%
at least at Giza, are made
out of one type of limestone.

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:50.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, it is the limestone
that was closest,

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:53.820 align:middle line:84%
but it also happens to be the
type that's called dolomite

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:56.340 align:middle line:84%
because it's got a
high magnesium content.

00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:59.510 align:middle line:10%
And because of that metal
content, that kind of limestone

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:02.080 align:middle line:10%
conducts electricity
pretty well.

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And then they chose to sheath
the pyramid in the wider Tura

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.925 align:middle line:84%
limestone, which
granted it's wider

00:20:08.925 --> 00:20:11.370 align:middle line:84%
and it's prettier and
all that; but it's also

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:15.450 align:middle line:84%
has almost zero
magnesium content.

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it's a
much poorer conductor

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:18.700 align:middle line:90%
of electricity.

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:21.630 align:middle line:10%
It's closer to a pure
calcium carbonate,

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:23.580 align:middle line:10%
which is what all limestone is.

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And pure calcium carbonate
conducts electricity

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:29.760 align:middle line:84%
much more poorly
than dolomite does.

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:32.390 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting to me
that those outer stones

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:34.940 align:middle line:84%
were the ones that
they cut so precisely

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:36.980 align:middle line:84%
that all these
thousands of years later

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:39.690 align:middle line:84%
you still can't get a
razor blade between them.

00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:41.570 align:middle line:84%
Because basically,
what we've got here

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:44.640 align:middle line:84%
is we've got a situation with a
highly electrically conductive

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:48.030 align:middle line:84%
core of those pyramids
wrapped in what is effectively

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:51.550 align:middle line:90%
a very effective insulator.

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:54.217 align:middle line:84%
Why the granite in the
passageways, you know?

00:20:54.217 --> 00:20:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And so, of course, I'm thinking
from an electrical point

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:58.570 align:middle line:84%
of view and a physical
point of view,

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:01.210 align:middle line:84%
is there anything
special about granite?

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:02.520 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, there is.

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:05.270 align:middle line:84%
Granite is slightly
radioactive and it

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:09.040 align:middle line:84%
will ionize, or
electrify, the air.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:13.530 align:middle line:84%
It releases radon gas,
which is radioactive.

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:15.490 align:middle line:84%
>>Granite is a
transmission stone.

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:19.060 align:middle line:90%
It's not dead stone, it's alive.

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:23.340 align:middle line:84%
>>So, you have these sealed
shafts with granite linings

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:26.090 align:middle line:84%
and I wonder if
it wasn't designed

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:30.770 align:middle line:84%
to keep an electrical charge
present in those shafts.

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:34.710 align:middle line:84%
They were built exactly like,
if you will, an insulated wire.

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:37.850 align:middle line:10%
Only more so, because
you've got all the charge

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:40.840 align:middle line:10%
in the ground, that's
spread across the base,

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:44.800 align:middle line:10%
concentrated all the way up
into this tiny spot at the top.

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:51.640 align:middle line:90%


00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:54.490 align:middle line:84%
>>We find similarities in
three different constructions.

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:58.660 align:middle line:84%
The one at Giza, Valley
Temple, and one at Abydos,

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:01.710 align:middle line:84%
and another one
abroad in England,

00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:04.430 align:middle line:84%
the Stonehenge,
the same material

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:09.390 align:middle line:84%
being constructed with, and
same way, and same technique.

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:13.230 align:middle line:10%
But the construction there,
it's built in addition

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:19.150 align:middle line:10%
to have the water because it's
water bed-- it's a huge water

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:23.010 align:middle line:10%
bed and it's still working,
still producing water.

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:27.530 align:middle line:84%
>>In Egypt, you do have a
similar situation to England

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:32.365 align:middle line:84%
in that you have limestone
aquifers under the monuments.

00:22:32.365 --> 00:22:34.730 align:middle line:84%
>>An aquifer is an
underground layer

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:37.860 align:middle line:90%
of porous water-bearing rock.

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:41.520 align:middle line:84%
Water flows through the
aquifers as rainfall.

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:45.430 align:middle line:84%
Or when rivers and lakes flood,
the water drains into them.

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:49.530 align:middle line:84%
>>And movement of water through
limestone or chalk aquifers

00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:52.100 align:middle line:84%
is known to produce
electrical charge

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:55.410 align:middle line:84%
by two different processes
that are self-reinforcing.

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:57.850 align:middle line:84%
And I've personally
measured this for a week

00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:01.040 align:middle line:84%
at a stretch at Solsbury
Hill in England, for example.

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.840 align:middle line:84%
Right before and
after thunderstorms

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:05.080 align:middle line:84%
as the water is sinking
into the ground,

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:07.270 align:middle line:84%
we measured the increase
in ground current,

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:09.940 align:middle line:84%
the change in the magnetic field
as that happened, et cetera.

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:13.890 align:middle line:90%


00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And in Egypt, you had the
Nile crashing, you know,

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:19.700 align:middle line:84%
dropping every year and
then flooding again.

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And that movement of water up
and down through the layers

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:29.480 align:middle line:84%
of limestone would
generate electrical charge.

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:34.980 align:middle line:84%
Flowing water generates a-- at
least a mild electrical charge,

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:37.490 align:middle line:84%
which means it generates
an electric current, which

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:40.420 align:middle line:84%
means it generates a
magnetic field as well.

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:43.400 align:middle line:84%
So if you were looking to
give an electrical charge

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:46.230 align:middle line:84%
a little boost to say a
mound or something like that,

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:49.390 align:middle line:84%
it makes a lot of sense to have
at a minimum running water.

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, at Tiwanaku on the
south shore of Lake Titicaca,

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:56.780 align:middle line:84%
their biggest monument,
the Akapana Pyramid,

00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:00.760 align:middle line:84%
was terraced in such a way as
to have the water come down

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:03.870 align:middle line:84%
in waterfalls that alternated
outside the pyramid,

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:05.270 align:middle line:90%
inside the pyramid.

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:08.170 align:middle line:84%
But that kind of
falling water generates

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:12.600 align:middle line:84%
enough electric charge that one
of the common school physics

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:16.056 align:middle line:84%
experiments is you can
in your own sink at home,

00:24:16.056 --> 00:24:18.680 align:middle line:84%
if you can divide the stream of
water coming out of your faucet

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:22.790 align:middle line:84%
into two separate streams, you
can take a little LED indicator

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:25.170 align:middle line:84%
light and put it
between the streams

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:28.220 align:middle line:84%
and it'll generate enough
electricity that maybe every 20

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:32.190 align:middle line:84%
seconds or so the-- the
light bulb will come on.

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:34.010 align:middle line:84%
And then the
question is, did some

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:38.340 align:middle line:84%
of those layers of limestone
run up to the Giza Plateau?

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:40.764 align:middle line:84%
And they did, and
they did come up

00:24:40.764 --> 00:24:42.930 align:middle line:84%
to the surface underneath
where some of the pyramids

00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:45.860 align:middle line:90%
are located.

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:49.140 align:middle line:84%
The idea would be that-- that it
would be the rising and falling

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:51.710 align:middle line:84%
of the Nile that would
produce this electric ground

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:55.080 align:middle line:84%
current by moving through
the different layers

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.390 align:middle line:90%
of the limestone aquifer.

00:24:57.390 --> 00:25:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And when there was a
dip, say, in that supply,

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:05.470 align:middle line:84%
maybe that's when the ionized
air in the granite shafts

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:09.800 align:middle line:84%
and galleries could help keep
the process going, if you will.

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.950 align:middle line:84%
I tend to wonder if the
electrified shafts might not

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:15.070 align:middle line:84%
have been able to act
in a similar fashion

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:17.870 align:middle line:84%
to your car battery when
you come to a stoplight.

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:19.434 align:middle line:84%
Normally, your
battery is not being

00:25:19.434 --> 00:25:20.850 align:middle line:84%
used when you're
driving your car,

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:22.930 align:middle line:84%
the alternator
provides all the juice.

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:24.670 align:middle line:84%
But when you stop
and that alternator

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:28.140 align:middle line:84%
is turning very weakly, that's
when you want the battery there

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:31.320 align:middle line:84%
to keep everything going so
your engine doesn't cut out.

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:36.430 align:middle line:90%


00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:39.000 align:middle line:84%
So you've got this
concentration of negative charge

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.250 align:middle line:84%
from the ground at the peak
of the pyramid or mound,

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:45.010 align:middle line:84%
and a concentration of
positive charge above it.

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And if those two
become strong enough,

00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:50.560 align:middle line:84%
you can start to get
brush discharge, which

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:54.010 align:middle line:84%
would mean it would glow like
a ball lightning for example.

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:57.610 align:middle line:90%


00:25:57.610 --> 00:25:58.414 align:middle line:90%
It's a theory.

00:25:58.414 --> 00:26:02.130 align:middle line:90%


00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:05.570 align:middle line:84%
>>Why in the Great Pyramid
is there no frescoes,

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:09.130 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing, no
decorations at all.

00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:12.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, some people have
proposed the idea

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:15.340 align:middle line:84%
that the pyramids are
actually energy machines.

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:17.380 align:middle line:84%
And so, I liken
this to the fact,

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:21.931 align:middle line:84%
like, you wouldn't put a
decoration inside your oven.

00:26:21.931 --> 00:26:23.430 align:middle line:84%
>>I was talking
with a woman who had

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:25.230 align:middle line:84%
spent some time in
the Great Pyramid,

00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:28.440 align:middle line:84%
and her comment was, it felt
like I was in a machine.

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:31.050 align:middle line:90%


00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:34.630 align:middle line:84%
She said it was not like this,
oh, it's a wonderful shrine.

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:37.370 align:middle line:84%
She said it felt
very functional.

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:39.890 align:middle line:10%
In fact, she made a
comment that I actually

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:41.240 align:middle line:10%
think is probably right on.

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:44.470 align:middle line:10%
She said, I felt
as if I wouldn't

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:46.880 align:middle line:10%
have wanted to be in
here when it was running.

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:55.480 align:middle line:90%


00:26:55.480 --> 00:27:00.120 align:middle line:84%
>>Invisible, subtle energy
occurs around us all the time

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:03.050 align:middle line:90%
and is measurable by science.

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:05.140 align:middle line:10%
>>We had noticed a lot
of people showing us

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:07.680 align:middle line:10%
photographs from
megalithic sites

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.810 align:middle line:10%
that disproportionately
often seemed

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:15.290 align:middle line:10%
to have these balls of light
in there, usually flash photos.

00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:18.960 align:middle line:84%
>>Orbs are often written off
as dust or other particles

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.136 align:middle line:90%
in the air.

00:27:20.136 --> 00:27:22.454 align:middle line:84%
But that does not
change the fact

00:27:22.454 --> 00:27:24.323 align:middle line:84%
that they seem to
occur more often

00:27:24.323 --> 00:27:27.161 align:middle line:84%
in particular places
at particular times.

00:27:27.161 --> 00:27:29.740 align:middle line:90%


00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:33.630 align:middle line:84%
>>At Tikal, at the top of the
most energetic pyramid that we

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:37.620 align:middle line:84%
found down there, uh, we
took a lot of flash photos

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:39.695 align:middle line:84%
during the course of our
eight-hour stakeouts,

00:27:39.695 --> 00:27:44.310 align:middle line:84%
which would run from roughly
3:00 AM till 11:00 AM.

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And on the pyramids that
were electrically dead,

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:49.285 align:middle line:84%
that had no juice,
nothing going on,

00:27:49.285 --> 00:27:52.830 align:middle line:84%
which were the big fancy
ones, but the most recently

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:57.040 align:middle line:84%
built ones, uh, there-- we
would take photos and find out

00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:58.680 align:middle line:84%
eventually when
they were developed

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:01.575 align:middle line:84%
no orbs, no glowing
balls of light.

00:28:01.575 --> 00:28:04.090 align:middle line:84%
But on the oldest
pyramid down there,

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:07.390 align:middle line:84%
where we did work and
got all kinds of results,

00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:11.760 align:middle line:84%
that was 1,200 years older
than the big fancier ones,

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:15.460 align:middle line:84%
in that case, the-- the
photography we got back

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:17.760 align:middle line:84%
from our own simple
flash cameras,

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:22.430 align:middle line:84%
uh, they were literally choking
the screen with these balls

00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:24.970 align:middle line:84%
at the period at
which the air was

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:27.406 align:middle line:90%
highest in electrical charge.

00:28:27.406 --> 00:28:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And on that-- the
strongest day down there,

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.180 align:middle line:84%
I was recording
electrical charge higher

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:37.310 align:middle line:84%
than I've recorded even in
thunderstorms back home.

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:40.370 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what orbs are,
but we-- our personal guess

00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:44.540 align:middle line:84%
is that they're balls of
ionized or electrified air

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:46.060 align:middle line:90%
that will tend to hang together.

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:50.050 align:middle line:84%
Uh, a good analogy would
be ball lightening,

00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:54.030 align:middle line:84%
where it's simply so electrified
that the molecules are

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:55.410 align:middle line:90%
excited enough to glow.

00:28:55.410 --> 00:29:00.150 align:middle line:90%


00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:01.720 align:middle line:84%
>>Other evidence
shows that there

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:04.230 align:middle line:84%
is energy occurring
naturally everywhere

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:08.190 align:middle line:84%
on the planet that our
science knows about, but seems

00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:08.800 align:middle line:90%
to ignore.

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:11.470 align:middle line:90%


00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:15.460 align:middle line:84%
Nikola Tesla sought to provide
the world with free wireless

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:19.140 align:middle line:84%
electricity for
everybody on Earth.

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:21.890 align:middle line:84%
He discovered that
electricity occurred naturally

00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:25.590 align:middle line:84%
throughout the Earth's
atmosphere and ground,

00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:27.590 align:middle line:84%
the telluric currents
in the ground

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:30.880 align:middle line:84%
that John Burke discussed
and the electricity

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:33.960 align:middle line:84%
present in the ionosphere
and the atmosphere, which

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:37.410 align:middle line:90%
is ionized by the sun.

00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:40.990 align:middle line:84%
He also created and developed
ways to harness those energies.

00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:44.240 align:middle line:90%


00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:44.820 align:middle line:10%
>>Tesla.

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:49.910 align:middle line:10%
Who teach Nikola Tesla to get
to that power of electricity?

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:54.890 align:middle line:10%
And he-- he-- he-- he didn't
invent it, it's already there,

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:57.170 align:middle line:10%
but he know how to use it.

00:29:57.170 --> 00:30:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, he
did not take an advantage

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:02.151 align:middle line:90%
like Mr. Edison.

00:30:02.151 --> 00:30:05.450 align:middle line:90%


00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:08.110 align:middle line:84%
>>Tesla wanted to harness
the natural energy that

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:12.980 align:middle line:84%
exists everywhere on Earth and
make it free to the public.

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:16.200 align:middle line:84%
Edison endeavored to produce
and distribute electricity

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:22.030 align:middle line:84%
by creating a regulated
monopoly for profit.

00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:26.750 align:middle line:84%
>>He become rich, and the people
more light into their home.

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:30.400 align:middle line:84%
So Nikola Tesla,
he's the one think

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:33.620 align:middle line:90%
of how to use this energy.

00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:38.920 align:middle line:10%
>>Between 1901 and
1917, the Tesla Tower

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:42.740 align:middle line:10%
was built on Long Island
as a wireless broadcasting

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:47.390 align:middle line:10%
system for telephone
and electrical signals.

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:50.820 align:middle line:10%
Interestingly, it was
constructed on an aquifer

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:54.660 align:middle line:10%
with descending passageways
and tunnels beneath it.

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:58.930 align:middle line:84%
At the time, few
understood how it worked.

00:30:58.930 --> 00:31:02.910 align:middle line:84%
Tesla's funding was ultimately
dropped by JP Morgan

00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:05.800 align:middle line:84%
because Tesla wanted
the wireless electricity

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:11.740 align:middle line:84%
to be free, and therefore, JP
Morgan couldn't make a profit.

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:14.880 align:middle line:84%
So even though Tesla's
genius was seen by many,

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:18.610 align:middle line:84%
he was still driven
into obscurity.

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:22.650 align:middle line:84%
The energy to create
free wireless energy

00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:27.210 align:middle line:84%
has always existed on our
planet, and still exists today.

00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:31.215 align:middle line:84%
>>And it's not only energy
on our planet that's plenty.

00:31:31.215 --> 00:31:34.796 align:middle line:90%
The rivers are flow by energy.

00:31:34.796 --> 00:31:37.500 align:middle line:90%
A tsunami is energy.

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:39.590 align:middle line:90%
Frequencies are energy.

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:43.720 align:middle line:84%
If we have the electricity now,
it's based on explosion energy.

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:47.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, the sound energy
based on technology

00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:50.060 align:middle line:84%
different from the
explosion energy,

00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:53.120 align:middle line:84%
and it's known as
implosion energy.

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:55.440 align:middle line:84%
>>This energy was not
the kind of energy

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:57.310 align:middle line:90%
that we have that pollutes.

00:31:57.310 --> 00:32:03.960 align:middle line:84%
It was a completely passive
energy that had no by-products.

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:08.066 align:middle line:84%
>>The energy we use today
is generated by combustion

00:32:08.066 --> 00:32:10.600 align:middle line:90%
and is non-renewable.

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:13.440 align:middle line:84%
It is called explosion
energy and leaves

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:16.026 align:middle line:90%
exhaust and pollution.

00:32:16.026 --> 00:32:18.800 align:middle line:84%
>>Our system all
over the planet today

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.940 align:middle line:84%
is based on the
explosion energy.

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:25.110 align:middle line:84%
That's why the petrol
is so expensive.

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:29.870 align:middle line:84%
>>In contrast, implosion energy
like solar panels and wind

00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:33.250 align:middle line:90%
power, is clean and renewable.

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:37.230 align:middle line:84%
We are beginning to realize
that we need sustainable energy.

00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:39.370 align:middle line:90%
>>Implosion energy, very simple.

00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:45.050 align:middle line:84%
All what you need is the beam
of the sun on a running water.

00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:47.990 align:middle line:84%
Not just running in a straight
line, but in a zig-zag.

00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And that-- you'll
find all the tunnels

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:54.360 align:middle line:84%
are in a zig-zag form
for such a purpose.

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:56.620 align:middle line:84%
>>In addition to the
limestone aquifers

00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:58.660 align:middle line:84%
underneath the
pyramids, there is

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:01.825 align:middle line:84%
evidence of a network
of man-made tunnels.

00:33:01.825 --> 00:33:05.330 align:middle line:90%


00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:08.210 align:middle line:84%
>>As a boy, when I'm
living in my house, which

00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:12.710 align:middle line:84%
is a few hundred yards
away from the nose

00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:17.250 align:middle line:84%
of what we call the Sphinx,
this was my playing yard.

00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:19.190 align:middle line:90%
And I know the tunnels.

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:20.650 align:middle line:90%
I walked in these tunnels.

00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:21.960 align:middle line:90%
I swim in these tunnels.

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:24.010 align:middle line:90%
I crawled in these tunnels.

00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:28.584 align:middle line:84%
And I know that this is
one way of creating energy.

00:33:28.584 --> 00:33:36.296 align:middle line:90%


00:33:36.296 --> 00:33:37.760 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is costs nothing.

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:40.600 align:middle line:10%
I mean, all what
you need is a beam

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:45.400 align:middle line:10%
of the sun reaching the running
water underneath the tunnel,

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:49.550 align:middle line:10%
and you can see that there are
many openings in each tunnel

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:53.670 align:middle line:10%
to admit this beam--
sunbeam reach the water.

00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:58.205 align:middle line:84%
And when it does, then
the energy is there.

00:33:58.205 --> 00:34:02.212 align:middle line:84%
Energy is not just
to run your car,

00:34:02.212 --> 00:34:04.681 align:middle line:84%
it's run the people,
feed the people.

00:34:04.681 --> 00:34:10.340 align:middle line:90%


00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:13.639 align:middle line:84%
>>If the pyramid fields
of the Band of Peace

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:17.230 align:middle line:84%
and the network of underground
tunnels are still there,

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:21.763 align:middle line:84%
why don't they generate
energy the way they used to?

00:34:21.763 --> 00:34:23.179 align:middle line:84%
>>In the condition
of the pyramids

00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:26.810 align:middle line:84%
now, stripped of those smooth
insulating outer casings,

00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:29.260 align:middle line:84%
it's going to leak
electrical air about

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:32.739 align:middle line:84%
as well as a car
radiator radiates heat.

00:34:32.739 --> 00:34:35.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's almost perfectly
designed to weaken that.

00:34:35.650 --> 00:34:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And yet still, you get
these reports of people

00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:42.620 align:middle line:84%
like Siemens, who was one of
the pioneers of electricity,

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:44.489 align:middle line:90%
and in-- he was an Englishman.

00:34:44.489 --> 00:34:46.170 align:middle line:84%
There's even a
unit of electrical,

00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:49.460 align:middle line:84%
I believe, resistance named
after him, called the Siemens.

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:51.380 align:middle line:84%
He was on top of
the Great Pyramid,

00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:54.310 align:middle line:84%
I think during the
1880s, and they

00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:57.320 align:middle line:84%
began to notice that when his
Arab guide stood up and spread

00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:00.240 align:middle line:84%
his fingers, they'd
hear a ringing.

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And, um, when he closed
them, you wouldn't.

00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And he stood up,
and I guess he could

00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:09.980 align:middle line:84%
sense the literal electricity
in the air, and on the spot,

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:13.550 align:middle line:84%
he improvised an instant
Leyden jar, which

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:15.483 align:middle line:84%
is one of the earliest
things they used

00:35:15.483 --> 00:35:18.040 align:middle line:90%
to use to store electric charge.

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:21.490 align:middle line:10%
And he did it by opening a wine
bottle, wetting some newspaper,

00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:24.900 align:middle line:10%
wrapping the wet newspaper
around the glass wine bottle

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:28.060 align:middle line:10%
and holding the wine
bottle up above his head

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:31.740 align:middle line:10%
until sparks started to
issue from the wine bottle.

00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
his Arab guide

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:36.890 align:middle line:84%
started calling-- accusing
him of things like witchcraft.

00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:38.940 align:middle line:84%
They got into a
physical struggle,

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:41.130 align:middle line:84%
and he accidentally
touched one of the guides

00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:43.850 align:middle line:84%
with the charged wine bottle
and it knocked the man

00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:47.500 align:middle line:84%
to the ground and unconscious
for a short period, after which

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:49.910 align:middle line:90%
they took off down the pyramid.

00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:52.570 align:middle line:84%
But there was, in other words,
a professional scientist

00:35:52.570 --> 00:35:57.330 align:middle line:84%
familiar with electricity in its
rudimentary but accurate forms

00:35:57.330 --> 00:36:00.320 align:middle line:84%
sensing exactly that, even
in this ruined condition

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.462 align:middle line:84%
that the pyramid's
in today, yeah.

00:36:02.462 --> 00:36:07.250 align:middle line:90%


00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:09.460 align:middle line:84%
>>If you come to
the Egyptian Museum,

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:14.380 align:middle line:84%
there is an item over there
known as the Schist Disc found

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:18.052 align:middle line:84%
by Dr. Walter
Emery, and he said,

00:36:18.052 --> 00:36:22.830 align:middle line:84%
or he think that this could
be a vase for a lotus flower.

00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:25.390 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:29.640 align:middle line:84%
>>The Schist Disc was founded
at Saqqara in a burial chamber

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:32.710 align:middle line:90%
that no one is allowed to visit.

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:36.860 align:middle line:84%
Other goods found in the chamber
were simple ropes, pottery,

00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:39.460 align:middle line:90%
and grains.

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:43.640 align:middle line:84%
The disc shows clear evidence
of sophisticated technology

00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:46.560 align:middle line:84%
in the way it was
built, and it seems out

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:50.740 align:middle line:84%
of context with the
rest of the grave goods.

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:54.480 align:middle line:84%
Is this the original
context for this artifact?

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:56.360 align:middle line:84%
Or is it possible
that it has had

00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:59.840 align:middle line:84%
a long journey over the
last several millennia

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:02.980 align:middle line:84%
and this just happened to
be its final resting place?

00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:05.920 align:middle line:90%


00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:09.110 align:middle line:90%
Look at this hollow stone tube.

00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:12.980 align:middle line:84%
It looks as though the Schist
Disc could fit over it.

00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:14.970 align:middle line:84%
It would take
sophisticated instruments

00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:18.110 align:middle line:90%
to shape the tube so precisely.

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:20.530 align:middle line:90%
How did they do it?

00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:26.370 align:middle line:10%
>>To cut the stone,
this is by a sonic cut

00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:33.650 align:middle line:10%
with no metal instruments like
a bronze chisel or this, no.

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:37.260 align:middle line:84%
It's another stone
and this other stone,

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:41.710 align:middle line:84%
it's hard, hardest stone you
can find, which is the diamond.

00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:44.630 align:middle line:84%
>>There are pieces
of stone lying around

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:48.400 align:middle line:84%
that show concave
shapes that actually

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.647 align:middle line:84%
have the machine
tooling marks on it.

00:37:50.647 --> 00:37:52.105 align:middle line:84%
The evidence of
the high technology

00:37:52.105 --> 00:37:53.382 align:middle line:90%
is right in front of us.

00:37:53.382 --> 00:37:56.930 align:middle line:90%


00:37:56.930 --> 00:38:00.160 align:middle line:84%
>>Look again at
these quartz objects.

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:03.150 align:middle line:84%
Aside from their unique
and amazing shapes,

00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:06.990 align:middle line:84%
could they have had
another purpose?

00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:09.890 align:middle line:84%
Today, quartz crystal
is used as the basis

00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:13.690 align:middle line:84%
of all kinds of
modern technology.

00:38:13.690 --> 00:38:16.947 align:middle line:84%
It is most commonly used
in crystal oscillators.

00:38:16.947 --> 00:38:21.170 align:middle line:84%
Technology uses oscillating
frequencies from tiny quartz

00:38:21.170 --> 00:38:24.730 align:middle line:84%
crystals that vibrate
at certain speeds

00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:28.230 align:middle line:84%
with a signature
vibration for each device.

00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:33.260 align:middle line:84%
AM-FM radios, CDs, and
DVDs, computer processors,

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:37.860 align:middle line:84%
and ethernet rely
on quartz crystals.

00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:39.560 align:middle line:84%
Could it be that
the ancients were

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:42.510 align:middle line:84%
tapping into this
technology and using it

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:48.300 align:middle line:84%
on a much larger scale in a way
we can only begin to imagine?

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:50.460 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we can't
say for certain,

00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:53.606 align:middle line:84%
but based on what we've
seen, we can theorize.

00:38:53.606 --> 00:38:58.010 align:middle line:90%


00:38:58.010 --> 00:39:03.470 align:middle line:84%
Energy can be created and
manipulated in many ways.

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:06.420 align:middle line:84%
It is the lifeblood
of a civilization,

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:09.753 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, an
important resource.

00:39:09.753 --> 00:39:15.260 align:middle line:84%
>>In Egypt, there are
67 constructions all

00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:17.590 align:middle line:90%
along the Nile like sails.

00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And for those who
has the eye, they

00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:29.235 align:middle line:84%
can tell from the shape of that
construction, the straight form

00:39:29.235 --> 00:39:36.240 align:middle line:84%
of angles that is a pyramid
or a construction for energy,

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:39.110 align:middle line:90%
a plant for energy.

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:40.512 align:middle line:90%
That's what you have.

00:39:40.512 --> 00:39:41.970 align:middle line:84%
>>A theory that's
always struck me,

00:39:41.970 --> 00:39:45.570 align:middle line:84%
that they were intended
actually to somehow

00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:48.690 align:middle line:84%
or another spiritualize
a whole civilization.

00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:54.580 align:middle line:84%
In other words, to provide a
widespread high level of energy

00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:59.060 align:middle line:84%
that people needed because the
descending age was upon them.

00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:02.200 align:middle line:84%
>>And I believe what the pyramid
and other cert-- certain other

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:05.970 align:middle line:84%
structures were constructed
for was to basically act

00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:09.137 align:middle line:84%
as a kind of-- the
equivalent of a street light.

00:40:09.137 --> 00:40:11.220 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you're in a
neighborhood that's maybe

00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:14.090 align:middle line:84%
not the nicest
neighborhood and, you know,

00:40:14.090 --> 00:40:18.050 align:middle line:84%
it gets dark at night, you like
to have bright lights go on.

00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's effectively
what the Great Pyramid was.

00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:23.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, these were not
lights that illuminated it

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:25.060 align:middle line:84%
so that people could see
where they were going.

00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:28.650 align:middle line:84%
It was basically a device, a
generator for, if you will,

00:40:28.650 --> 00:40:31.690 align:middle line:84%
broadcasting and transmitting
throughout the planetary

00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:37.320 align:middle line:84%
structure a type of field which
uplifted the entire humanity.

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:41.170 align:middle line:84%
>>And maybe those pyramids were
built in some sense or another

00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:44.560 align:middle line:90%
to, to stay the decline.

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:47.000 align:middle line:90%


00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.750 align:middle line:84%
Let's call them, in
some sense or another,

00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:53.640 align:middle line:84%
spiritual granaries,
designed to somehow store

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:57.400 align:middle line:84%
an emotional or spiritual
or psychological

00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:01.270 align:middle line:84%
or some sort of energy that
was needed to keep people

00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:03.720 align:middle line:84%
from becoming the
total barbarians

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:07.280 align:middle line:90%
that they subsequently became.

00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:11.032 align:middle line:84%
>>We had the ability to
basically prop up humanity

00:41:11.032 --> 00:41:14.720 align:middle line:84%
for a while using this
system, but what we saw

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:18.155 align:middle line:84%
was the-- the street
light eventually went out.

00:41:18.155 --> 00:41:24.720 align:middle line:90%


00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:27.240 align:middle line:84%
>>The original
knowledge got lost,

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:30.250 align:middle line:84%
and the later builders were
building them out of ego.

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:32.720 align:middle line:84%
They were monuments to
the king, if you will.

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:34.380 align:middle line:84%
But they were no
longer engines that

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:36.530 align:middle line:90%
could help feed their people.

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:40.990 align:middle line:84%
>>Catastrophes around the
world damaged or, if you will,

00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:43.380 align:middle line:84%
decommissioned some
of these sites.

00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:46.128 align:middle line:84%
So some of them went offline,
just like a power plant

00:41:46.128 --> 00:41:47.370 align:middle line:90%
going offline.

00:41:47.370 --> 00:41:49.980 align:middle line:84%
>>I tend to wonder
if the few people who

00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:55.540 align:middle line:84%
knew the secrets to the energy
connection with those pyramids

00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:57.210 align:middle line:90%
didn't die off.

00:41:57.210 --> 00:41:59.790 align:middle line:84%
If it was a thin
chain of, for example,

00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:03.850 align:middle line:84%
a shaman to his apprentice, and
if the wrong people get killed

00:42:03.850 --> 00:42:05.540 align:middle line:84%
at the right time,
that chain is broken,

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:06.770 align:middle line:90%
that knowledge gets lost.

00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:10.620 align:middle line:90%


00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:13.800 align:middle line:84%
>>As long as we think we are
more advanced than we've ever

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:19.370 align:middle line:84%
been, we are blind to technology
based on subtle energies.

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:21.110 align:middle line:90%
>>It's not fair also.

00:42:21.110 --> 00:42:24.910 align:middle line:84%
It's not fair to deny
what you can see and touch

00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:26.460 align:middle line:90%
by your own hand.

00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:31.790 align:middle line:84%
This is only the technique, and
we have that technique still,

00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:34.440 align:middle line:90%
but nobody wants to listen!
