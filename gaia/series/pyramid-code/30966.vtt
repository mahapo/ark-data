00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.238 align:middle line:84%
>>Who were the ancient
peoples of the world?

00:00:08.238 --> 00:00:09.666 align:middle line:90%
And what did they know?

00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:14.440 align:middle line:90%


00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.750 align:middle line:84%
Egyptology tells us
that the pyramids

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.980 align:middle line:90%
were built around 2500 BC.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.750 align:middle line:84%
Is there evidence
that the pyramids

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.500 align:middle line:90%
could be much, much older?

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.640 align:middle line:90%


00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.259 align:middle line:84%
Has traditional science
been able to explain

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.000 align:middle line:84%
why the pyramids
were built, or is it

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.335 align:middle line:90%
a puzzle yet to be decoded?

00:00:37.335 --> 00:01:23.550 align:middle line:90%


00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.500 align:middle line:10%
At the geodesic
center of the world,

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.005 align:middle line:10%
at the mouth of the
Nile delta, there

00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:33.530 align:middle line:10%
are pyramids built by an
early civilization clustering

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.580 align:middle line:10%
at six distinct sites.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.640 align:middle line:10%
One pyramid is up a mountain.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.270 align:middle line:90%
It can be seen from space.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.996 align:middle line:84%
Curiously, the inside
is open to the air.

00:01:48.996 --> 00:01:50.836 align:middle line:90%
What was its function?

00:01:50.836 --> 00:01:58.090 align:middle line:90%


00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.830 align:middle line:84%
Most people are familiar with
the Giza Plateau and the Sphinx

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.840 align:middle line:84%
but are not aware of their
connection to the other sites.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.637 align:middle line:90%


00:02:07.637 --> 00:02:14.330 align:middle line:84%
The sites run parallel to the
fertile band along the Nile.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.180 align:middle line:84%
Some sites are unknown, isolated
in the middle of the desert.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.130 align:middle line:90%


00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.250 align:middle line:84%
Other sites are known, but
are only partially excavated.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:35.830 align:middle line:90%


00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.910 align:middle line:84%
The monumental
nature of the sites

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.806 align:middle line:84%
is hypnotic and stimulates
our wonder and curiosity.

00:02:41.806 --> 00:02:51.440 align:middle line:90%


00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.010 align:middle line:84%
All the sites show evidence
of sophisticated engineering,

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.680 align:middle line:84%
advanced technology, and
monumental architecture.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:05.141 align:middle line:90%


00:03:05.141 --> 00:03:07.740 align:middle line:84%
Could the ancients have
had an understanding

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.010 align:middle line:90%
of a superior science?

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.510 align:middle line:90%


00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.940 align:middle line:84%
Is it conceivable that
there's a correlation

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.502 align:middle line:90%
between the sky and the ground?

00:03:18.502 --> 00:03:23.332 align:middle line:90%


00:03:23.332 --> 00:03:28.305 align:middle line:84%
Why do we understand so
little about the Egyptians.

00:03:28.305 --> 00:03:31.335 align:middle line:84%
We are told their
technology was primitive.

00:03:31.335 --> 00:03:33.960 align:middle line:84%
Yet the temple walls
show the ancients

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.760 align:middle line:90%
making precise calculations.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.090 align:middle line:84%
There is plenty of evidence
that paints a fuller picture.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.775 align:middle line:90%
Let's go and see for ourselves.

00:03:42.775 --> 00:04:21.769 align:middle line:90%


00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.810 align:middle line:10%
>>So here we are on
location at Abu Rowash,

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.440 align:middle line:10%
which is a fascinating site
in that it's up a mountain.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.430 align:middle line:84%
>>This is a pyramid like
no other, open to the air.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.690 align:middle line:90%


00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.070 align:middle line:84%
>>This site really
debunks the theory

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.440 align:middle line:84%
of pulling stones with
rope to get them up

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.560 align:middle line:84%
on top of a pyramid, in that
the stone would have to come up

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.705 align:middle line:84%
a mountain before it
went up a pyramid.

00:04:47.705 --> 00:04:53.780 align:middle line:90%


00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.060 align:middle line:84%
This site is largely
isolated and abandoned,

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.950 align:middle line:84%
and many people don't
even know it's here.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:58.750 align:middle line:90%
There's no booth.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:59.710 align:middle line:90%
There's no guard.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.130 align:middle line:90%
There's nobody up here.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's meant
to be largely forgotten

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.672 align:middle line:84%
because it really comes
head to head with the theory

00:05:07.672 --> 00:05:09.255 align:middle line:84%
about the way the
pyramids were built.

00:05:09.255 --> 00:05:16.110 align:middle line:90%


00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.550 align:middle line:84%
When you look
around the site, you

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.490 align:middle line:84%
see evidence of small
stones that are newer,

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.345 align:middle line:84%
medium stones, and then
the ancient large stones.

00:05:23.345 --> 00:05:30.410 align:middle line:90%


00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:35.850 align:middle line:84%
>>At Abu Rowash, we can see
evidence of machine tool marks.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.160 align:middle line:84%
We know the granite came
from distant quarries.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.240 align:middle line:84%
The polished, concave
slabs of stone

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.550 align:middle line:84%
could not possibly have
been made with chisels.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.340 align:middle line:84%
This is not the only
example of machine tooling.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.960 align:middle line:90%


00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.040 align:middle line:84%
>>We're now going to
go inside the pyramid.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.480 align:middle line:90%
We're walking along this ledge.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.270 align:middle line:90%


00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.320 align:middle line:84%
And what we'll see is
there's a passageway here

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.346 align:middle line:84%
that goes down into
the pyramid, even

00:06:07.346 --> 00:06:09.318 align:middle line:90%
though it's open and exposed.

00:06:09.318 --> 00:06:10.797 align:middle line:90%
So let's go down.

00:06:10.797 --> 00:06:22.140 align:middle line:90%


00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.090 align:middle line:84%
If you stand here, all
the way through this area,

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.490 align:middle line:84%
the stone seems to be
blackened, and it's

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.740 align:middle line:84%
evidence of high
heat of some kind.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.440 align:middle line:84%
I tend to think this was going
on during the ancient times,

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.760 align:middle line:90%
but it's still very curious.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.215 align:middle line:84%
There's a pit here, and the
stone's obviously broken.

00:06:40.215 --> 00:06:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And I think that they
were heating something.

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:57.860 align:middle line:90%


00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.150 align:middle line:84%
This is the northern point
of the Band of Peace.

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.730 align:middle line:84%
It's the top pyramid in a
series of 22 pyramids that

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.420 align:middle line:90%
go from north to south.

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.180 align:middle line:84%
So we are now north
of the Giza Plateau.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:13.680 align:middle line:90%


00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.430 align:middle line:84%
>>As you can see on this
map of the Band of Peace,

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:21.262 align:middle line:84%
all these sites trace the
shape of the River Nile.

00:07:21.262 --> 00:07:24.980 align:middle line:84%
A new theory suggests that
the Nile once flowed right

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:28.910 align:middle line:84%
in front of the pyramids, and
the causeways of all the sites

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:30.223 align:middle line:90%
touched the river itself.

00:07:30.223 --> 00:07:34.010 align:middle line:90%


00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:37.700 align:middle line:84%
Considering that the Nile
is the lifeblood of Egypt,

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.590 align:middle line:84%
just as rivers all
around the world

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:42.690 align:middle line:84%
are vital to the
cultures living by them,

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:46.210 align:middle line:84%
it seems obvious that
important, sacred structures

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:48.940 align:middle line:84%
would be built
directly on the river,

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:50.630 align:middle line:90%
not eight miles away from it.

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:55.280 align:middle line:90%


00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:00.100 align:middle line:84%
How long would it take this
river to migrate eight miles?

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.600 align:middle line:84%
Looking at geological
time provides yet

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.820 align:middle line:84%
another clue to finding out when
these magnificent structures

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.260 align:middle line:90%
may have been built.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:20.270 align:middle line:90%


00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:24.320 align:middle line:84%
>>This probably was a seabed,
and that the mouth of the Nile

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.033 align:middle line:84%
started here, and
that moved along

00:08:27.033 --> 00:08:28.606 align:middle line:90%
in front of all these pyramids.

00:08:28.606 --> 00:08:32.620 align:middle line:90%


00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:36.200 align:middle line:84%
One of the features of each
of the sites in this area

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:41.179 align:middle line:84%
is that you can see the pyramids
of next site from the original.

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:43.219 align:middle line:84%
>>From here, the volume
of the Great Pyramid

00:08:43.219 --> 00:08:45.670 align:middle line:84%
and the second
pyramid look the same.

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:47.640 align:middle line:84%
When we get to the
next site, we see

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.430 align:middle line:84%
the volumes are
obviously different.

00:08:49.430 --> 00:09:36.675 align:middle line:90%


00:09:36.675 --> 00:09:40.160 align:middle line:84%
It's hard not to be amazed
by the pyramids of the Giza

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.110 align:middle line:90%
Plateau.

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:45.406 align:middle line:84%
The Great Pyramid
covers 13 acres.

00:09:45.406 --> 00:09:48.890 align:middle line:84%
It was constructed
of 2.3 million stones

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:50.944 align:middle line:90%
weighing up to 200 tons each.

00:09:50.944 --> 00:09:53.910 align:middle line:90%


00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:56.820 align:middle line:10%
>>They must have had a
level of engineering science

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:01.810 align:middle line:10%
that-- it was unbelievable--
compared to what we have now.

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:05.060 align:middle line:10%
>>Indeed, they managed a have
an order of which they based

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:10.530 align:middle line:10%
on this so-called cosmic order,
which lasted for 3,000 years.

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:12.110 align:middle line:84%
No other civilization
has done this.

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:15.900 align:middle line:90%


00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:20.310 align:middle line:84%
>>Why is ancient Egypt
still so mysterious to us?

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:24.544 align:middle line:84%
Are we looking in
the wrong place?

00:10:24.544 --> 00:10:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Or are we looking
in the wrong way?

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:33.740 align:middle line:10%
>>We look at everything through
our sociocultural context,

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.150 align:middle line:10%
and so it's very difficult
for us to look through that

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:41.626 align:middle line:10%
and see another possibility
for how life could have been.

00:10:41.626 --> 00:10:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And we also have to
be willing to depart

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:47.611 align:middle line:84%
from our own traditional
ways of looking at things.

00:10:47.611 --> 00:10:49.735 align:middle line:84%
That's what's really stopping
us from understanding

00:10:49.735 --> 00:10:50.376 align:middle line:90%
the ancients.

00:10:50.376 --> 00:10:54.850 align:middle line:90%


00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:58.120 align:middle line:84%
>>We may need to reconsider
what we've been told

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.040 align:middle line:90%
and what we think we've seen.

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:11.100 align:middle line:90%


00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:14.590 align:middle line:84%
For example, instead of
thinking that the Egyptians put

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:18.430 align:middle line:84%
the causeway at an angle because
the Sphinx was in the way,

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:21.120 align:middle line:84%
we could consider
another reason.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.840 align:middle line:84%
At summer solstice, the sun
rises along the causeway

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:28.880 align:middle line:84%
in front of the Great Pyramid
and moves across the sky,

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.760 align:middle line:84%
setting between the second
and the Great Pyramid,

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.750 align:middle line:90%
making it hotter in summer.

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:38.370 align:middle line:84%
In the winter, the sun rises
in line with the grand causeway

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:42.240 align:middle line:84%
by the second pyramid, and sets
between the second and third

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.060 align:middle line:84%
pyramids, making a
short trajectory,

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:46.290 align:middle line:90%
resulting in cooler weather.

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:48.800 align:middle line:90%


00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.360 align:middle line:84%
It appears that the
causeways are deliberately

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:55.820 align:middle line:84%
pointing towards the rising
sun on the summer and winter

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:58.470 align:middle line:90%
solstices.

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:03.270 align:middle line:84%
Orthodox Egyptologists insist
that the pyramid were tombs.

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:07.740 align:middle line:10%
>>Of all of the wild theories
floating around the pyramids,

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.050 align:middle line:10%
the actual wildest
is the one that's

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:12.460 align:middle line:10%
accepted without question
by all Egyptologists, which

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.330 align:middle line:10%
is that the pyramids
served as tombs.

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:18.935 align:middle line:84%
>>All of those concepts about
it being a tomb are nonsense.

00:12:18.935 --> 00:12:22.600 align:middle line:84%
>>Of all of the theories for
which there is zero evidence,

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.416 align:middle line:84%
that one has zero
squared evidence.

00:12:25.416 --> 00:12:27.540 align:middle line:10%
>>In fact, I don't even
think there's good evidence

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:30.952 align:middle line:10%
that it ever was a tomb
for any pharaoh whatsoever.

00:12:30.952 --> 00:12:31.910 align:middle line:90%
>>I mean, it's obvious.

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:34.110 align:middle line:84%
We don't find mummies
in the pyramids.

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:38.090 align:middle line:84%
>>There's no question you can
bring up that isn't debatable.

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:42.710 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians themselves,
in at least one stone tablet

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:46.530 align:middle line:84%
and one papyrus, tell the
story that ancient Egypt

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:49.990 align:middle line:84%
is much, much older than the
Egyptologists think it is.

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:52.990 align:middle line:84%
>>Where the Great
Pyramid sits, I believe,

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:56.540 align:middle line:90%
is on a much more ancient site.

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:58.690 align:middle line:84%
Under the Great
Pyramid to this day

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:02.234 align:middle line:84%
is the descending passage
in the subterranean chamber.

00:13:02.234 --> 00:13:03.650 align:middle line:84%
I think there's
very good evidence

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:05.690 align:middle line:84%
that that was carved
out in what we

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:07.930 align:middle line:90%
would call pre-dynastic times.

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:11.690 align:middle line:84%
That goes back to a
very ancient date.

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:14.180 align:middle line:84%
Based on the hieroglyphics
that we have,

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.190 align:middle line:84%
the second pyramid
was, in many ways,

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:19.990 align:middle line:84%
regarded as the primary
pyramid on the Giza Plateau.

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:23.340 align:middle line:84%
Actually, from many angles
on the Giza Plateau,

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:27.040 align:middle line:90%
the second pyramid is dominant.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.670 align:middle line:84%
The structure underneath
it, or the base of it,

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:33.930 align:middle line:84%
was older than even
the Great Pyramid.

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:36.420 align:middle line:84%
There was a
platform-type structure

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:39.090 align:middle line:90%
where the second pyramid is now.

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:41.400 align:middle line:84%
>>You can see from the
platform that it's larger

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.070 align:middle line:84%
than the pyramid,
suggesting there was once

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:46.560 align:middle line:90%
something else there.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>>Around the base is a ring
of granite, red granite.

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And, at least from what
I've seen in Egypt,

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:58.870 align:middle line:84%
this is something that was
often used around the bases

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:01.650 align:middle line:84%
or on structures when
they were renewing them,

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:04.450 align:middle line:84%
they were refurbishing
them, they were taking older

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:09.480 align:middle line:84%
structures, re-energizing
them, rebuilding them.

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:12.230 align:middle line:84%
>>It's demonstrable, in
that the second pyramid

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:15.560 align:middle line:84%
is very definitely built in at
least two stages, the third,

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:18.550 align:middle line:90%
built in two or more stages.

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:21.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we really don't, at
the moment, have anything to,

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:23.610 align:middle line:84%
even provisionally,
to date them with.

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:25.200 align:middle line:90%
With the Sphinx, we do.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:29.660 align:middle line:84%
>>Looking at the weathering
on the Sphinx and the Sphinx

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:34.500 align:middle line:84%
enclosure, that weathering
was clearly formed by runoff

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:37.110 align:middle line:90%
from rain from precipitation.

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:40.290 align:middle line:84%
>>We have the severe
weathering, which

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:44.950 align:middle line:84%
99% of the geologists of the
world who've heard our evidence

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:47.540 align:middle line:84%
concur that it is indeed
water weathering and

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:49.270 align:middle line:90%
precipitation-induced.

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:51.480 align:middle line:84%
So it has to have been
done by heavy rainfalls

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:52.560 align:middle line:90%
in the distant past.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:56.596 align:middle line:84%
And the question then is
how distant was that past.

00:14:56.596 --> 00:15:00.890 align:middle line:84%
>>That runoff is coming
from up on the plateau.

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:03.160 align:middle line:84%
Follow up the plateau
northwest of the Sphinx,

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:06.690 align:middle line:84%
you ultimately hit
the Great Pyramid.

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:08.300 align:middle line:84%
The natural topography
is the water

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.970 align:middle line:84%
would run down the back
of the Sphinx enclosure.

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
you see the greatest

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:16.010 align:middle line:84%
amount of water
precipitation weathering.

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:18.950 align:middle line:84%
To have that surface
hydrology, you

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:21.960 align:middle line:84%
need to have the plateau
relatively intact.

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:24.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you look
currently, there's

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:28.530 align:middle line:84%
a big quarry interrupting
the water flow.

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:30.530 align:middle line:84%
So we know that
the water flow that

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:36.360 align:middle line:84%
was causing that weathering
had to occur before that quarry

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.200 align:middle line:90%
existed.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:42.020 align:middle line:84%
That quarry is well-known
Egyptologically by inscriptions

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:43.760 align:middle line:84%
because that was
a quarry that was

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:47.110 align:middle line:84%
used when the Great
Pyramid was built.

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:51.400 align:middle line:84%
So that means that the Sphinx
must have been carved earlier.

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.560 align:middle line:84%
The water was still
running off, running down

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:56.850 align:middle line:84%
the back of the enclosure
wall, and causing

00:15:56.850 --> 00:16:00.130 align:middle line:84%
that weathering
before that quarry

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:03.980 align:middle line:84%
was a quarry, which means
that occurs before the Great

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:05.680 align:middle line:90%
Pyramid was built.

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:09.150 align:middle line:84%
Basically, we have
right there disrupted

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:10.280 align:middle line:90%
the traditional chronology.

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:12.810 align:middle line:90%


00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:15.970 align:middle line:84%
>>Even Egyptologists agree
that the Giza Plateau

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:18.920 align:middle line:90%
has a unified ground plan.

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:20.480 align:middle line:84%
How does the Great
Pyramid display

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.105 align:middle line:90%
evidence of this correlation?

00:16:22.105 --> 00:16:24.980 align:middle line:90%


00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:28.570 align:middle line:84%
>>I do think when it was what
we would call partially built,

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:32.630 align:middle line:84%
it was used as an
astronomical observatory.

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:36.130 align:middle line:84%
The grand gallery perfectly
aligned north-south opening

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:37.690 align:middle line:84%
to the southern
sky would have made

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:41.740 align:middle line:84%
a wonderful observational
tube, essentially,

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:43.830 align:middle line:90%
looking up into the sky.

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:46.280 align:middle line:84%
>>We have shafts pointing
to certain stars.

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:48.850 align:middle line:90%
Orion's belt series.

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:52.780 align:middle line:84%
We know the stars because
they're mentioned in texts.

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:57.900 align:middle line:84%
We therefore can use precession
to place the stars back

00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.640 align:middle line:84%
in alignment with
these monuments,

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.040 align:middle line:84%
in this case, the
pyramids, for example.

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.619 align:middle line:84%
>>The Great Pyramid
stands exactly

00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:09.210 align:middle line:84%
at the center of the largest
land mass on the planet.

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:12.540 align:middle line:84%
Yet we had no idea of the
position of continents

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.639 align:middle line:90%
until 600 years ago.

00:17:14.639 --> 00:17:16.250 align:middle line:90%
How could they have known?

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:19.390 align:middle line:90%


00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:22.810 align:middle line:84%
>>I've shown that
Giza, if interpreted

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:27.270 align:middle line:84%
as being Orion's belt
counterpart, then

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:29.780 align:middle line:84%
the layout of the
three pyramids,

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:32.070 align:middle line:84%
as they are at the
ground meridian,

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:37.035 align:middle line:84%
would fit a celestial meridian
of these stars at 10,500 BC,

00:17:37.035 --> 00:17:41.760 align:middle line:84%
that they reached the
very lowest point in their

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:44.300 align:middle line:90%
up and down move.

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:47.210 align:middle line:10%
Looking east, you had
the Sphinx looking

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:48.850 align:middle line:10%
at the constellation of Leo.

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:51.580 align:middle line:10%
So you have two major
monuments, on the same site,

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:57.036 align:middle line:10%
looking at constellations
that are representative

00:17:57.036 --> 00:18:00.570 align:middle line:10%
of these features on
the ground in this sky.

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:03.220 align:middle line:84%
We have evidence
that they did it.

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:06.320 align:middle line:90%
And the alignments were there.

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:10.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, could the pyramid
builders have been aware

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:11.980 align:middle line:90%
of these alignments?

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:12.950 align:middle line:90%
Well, why not?

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:18.580 align:middle line:90%


00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:20.350 align:middle line:84%
>>With this evidence,
it would seem

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:22.640 align:middle line:84%
that it's time to rethink
what we've been told.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:59.690 align:middle line:90%


00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:01.235 align:middle line:90%
>>Here we are at Abu Garab.

00:19:01.235 --> 00:19:03.130 align:middle line:10%
You can see that there's
no road, no ticket

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:04.140 align:middle line:10%
booth, no nothing.

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:06.154 align:middle line:10%
This is a very isolated area.

00:19:06.154 --> 00:19:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to walk
through a mango grove.

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:12.034 align:middle line:90%


00:19:12.034 --> 00:19:15.120 align:middle line:84%
If you were to get
on a camel and ride

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:18.610 align:middle line:84%
south from Giza Plateau, you'd
come up over this sand dune

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:22.700 align:middle line:90%
and see these other pyramids.

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:25.720 align:middle line:84%
So as we approach up here,
you see a pile of rubble.

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:28.775 align:middle line:84%
But really what
it is is the base

00:19:28.775 --> 00:19:31.190 align:middle line:84%
of the largest obelisk
that ever was in Egypt.

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:36.962 align:middle line:90%


00:19:36.962 --> 00:19:42.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, here we come up to the
platform of the Crystal Altar.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.195 align:middle line:84%
You can see that
it's made of quartz,

00:19:44.195 --> 00:19:45.570 align:middle line:90%
if you look up close here.

00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:49.130 align:middle line:90%


00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:52.080 align:middle line:84%
These little bits of crystal
are coming right off it.

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And then, we have a laser-cut
six-foot circle in the middle,

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:02.760 align:middle line:84%
and then these points, these
huge slabs each pointing

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:05.160 align:middle line:84%
to the four cardinal
directions, made out

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.275 align:middle line:84%
of single, solid
pieces of quartz.

00:20:08.275 --> 00:20:12.370 align:middle line:90%


00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:14.720 align:middle line:84%
So here we have
some stone basins

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:17.635 align:middle line:84%
that were found by Sir Walter
Emery years and years ago.

00:20:17.635 --> 00:20:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And the Department
of Antiquities

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:22.570 align:middle line:84%
lined all these up with the
idea of maybe bringing them

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:23.980 align:middle line:90%
to the museum.

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:28.314 align:middle line:84%
And they really didn't know what
to call them or what they were.

00:20:28.314 --> 00:20:29.980 align:middle line:84%
So they just decided
to leave them here,

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:31.355 align:middle line:84%
and they've been
here ever since.

00:20:31.355 --> 00:20:35.180 align:middle line:90%


00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:36.957 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at
the features on these,

00:20:36.957 --> 00:20:38.790 align:middle line:84%
they're actually made
out of quartz crystal.

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:42.430 align:middle line:90%


00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:44.180 align:middle line:84%
We'll look up close
at some of the places,

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:46.580 align:middle line:84%
but when there's little
fragments that break off,

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.350 align:middle line:90%
it's actually a hunk of quartz.

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:50.237 align:middle line:84%
And there are these
little holes inside,

00:20:50.237 --> 00:20:52.320 align:middle line:84%
and they say that they
were for animal sacrifices,

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.250 align:middle line:84%
and the blood
would drop through.

00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:55.030 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:58.310 align:middle line:84%
I really don't think
that's what happened.

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:02.280 align:middle line:84%
No one has ever come up with
a theory that satisfies me

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.630 align:middle line:90%
about what they're for.

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:06.150 align:middle line:90%


00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:08.395 align:middle line:84%
>>Is there anyone who
knows more about this area?

00:21:08.395 --> 00:21:14.090 align:middle line:90%


00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:17.520 align:middle line:84%
Hakim Awyan is an
indigenous wisdom-keeper

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.370 align:middle line:84%
who was born in the
village of Abusir.

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:22.650 align:middle line:84%
He trained in Europe
as an archaeologist.

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:25.470 align:middle line:90%


00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:27.650 align:middle line:10%
Hakim lived his whole
life in the area

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:29.370 align:middle line:10%
known as the Band of Peace.

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:36.690 align:middle line:90%


00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:38.905 align:middle line:84%
The Giza Plateau
was his front yard.

00:21:38.905 --> 00:21:43.160 align:middle line:84%
>>1936, '37, the Sphinx
then was covered with sand

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.420 align:middle line:90%
up to the neck.

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:45.670 align:middle line:90%
And there was my playing yard.

00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:48.290 align:middle line:90%


00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:49.460 align:middle line:90%
There are tunnels.

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:52.252 align:middle line:90%
I used to walk in these tunnels.

00:21:52.252 --> 00:21:58.930 align:middle line:84%
In water, I used to crawl
sometimes, because it's narrow.

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:04.080 align:middle line:84%
At Abu Garab, we have a
crystal altar, a round disk

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.080 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of four,
a symbol of hotep.

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And the word hotep
means peace and food.

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:16.150 align:middle line:84%
This round disk,
it's a lid on a shaft

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:23.540 align:middle line:84%
about 180 feet deep, to
the level of the ocean.

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:25.650 align:middle line:84%
And that is still
running water in there,

00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:30.050 align:middle line:84%
and you can feel it
while you're in the area.

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:33.670 align:middle line:84%
These instruments were not found
in a line like you see today,

00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:34.946 align:middle line:90%
the nine of them.

00:22:34.946 --> 00:22:36.820 align:middle line:84%
But they're found
around the area,

00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:39.790 align:middle line:84%
and there are still
some more to be found.

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And then we have oldest
obelisk located in Egypt.

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:50.310 align:middle line:84%
Next to the altar,
what's left of the what

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:54.590 align:middle line:84%
you call hieroglyph writing,
that's Sufi writing,

00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:58.520 align:middle line:84%
at the obelisk, and
the disk of the sun,

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:01.510 align:middle line:84%
and words saying the
heart of the sun.

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:41.630 align:middle line:90%


00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:44.685 align:middle line:84%
>>Arriving at Abusir, we can
imagine the ancient priests

00:23:44.685 --> 00:23:49.850 align:middle line:84%
and priestesses who trained
as high-level initiates here.

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:54.680 align:middle line:84%
Just as we have monks,
nuns, and priests nowadays,

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.980 align:middle line:84%
the ancients trained
initiates in ritual practices

00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:00.075 align:middle line:84%
that served the highest
good of mankind.

00:24:00.075 --> 00:24:05.801 align:middle line:90%


00:24:05.801 --> 00:24:07.420 align:middle line:90%
>>Here we are at Abusir.

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's very obvious you
can see the old river bed.

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:12.110 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the
pyramids of Saqqara

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:13.900 align:middle line:84%
and the pyramids
of Giza from here.

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:17.200 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly, you
can see the old causeway,

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:20.926 align:middle line:84%
and you can imagine that boats
used to come along the river.

00:24:20.926 --> 00:24:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And then the
high-level initiates

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:25.720 align:middle line:84%
would just step off the boat
and walk up the grand causeway

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:28.120 align:middle line:84%
and through the pillars
into the temple, which

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:30.860 align:middle line:90%
is in front of the main pyramid.

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:33.960 align:middle line:84%
>>Spiritual connections
would nourish the initiates,

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.652 align:middle line:84%
instilling a sense
of peace and purpose.

00:24:36.652 --> 00:24:40.850 align:middle line:90%


00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:44.333 align:middle line:84%
These elegant columns are
carved from solid granite.

00:24:44.333 --> 00:24:49.090 align:middle line:90%


00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:51.580 align:middle line:84%
>>There's something about these
black floors that you just

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:55.680 align:middle line:84%
imagine them being polished,
and the beauty in here.

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:58.610 align:middle line:90%


00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:01.250 align:middle line:84%
>>Similarly, you can see
a beautiful black floor

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:03.556 align:middle line:84%
in the temple to the east
of the Great Pyramid.

00:25:03.556 --> 00:25:08.340 align:middle line:90%


00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:13.340 align:middle line:84%
The rituals of ancient Egyptians
were dictated by the stars.

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:16.730 align:middle line:84%
For example, the ancients
tracked the movement

00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:21.350 align:middle line:84%
of the most prominent star
in the night sky, Sirius.

00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:25.720 align:middle line:84%
Through watching night after
night, season after season,

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:29.780 align:middle line:84%
they realized that this star
would drop below the horizon

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:35.010 align:middle line:84%
and remain out of sight
for 70 days each year.

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:38.090 align:middle line:84%
Its return was awaited
with anticipation

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:42.590 align:middle line:84%
because it coincided with
the flooding of the Nile.

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:44.670 align:middle line:10%
>>Now what happens
during the 70 days?

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:47.920 align:middle line:10%
Well, if you
observe the sky, you

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:51.170 align:middle line:10%
will notice that the sun
reaches a certain point

00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:56.110 align:middle line:10%
in its apparent cycle
along the zodiac.

00:25:56.110 --> 00:26:01.120 align:middle line:84%
It's somewhere above Orion at
the beginning of the 70 days.

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:06.340 align:middle line:84%
And it drifts approximately
a degree every day

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:08.880 align:middle line:84%
towards the
constellation of Leo.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:14.760 align:middle line:84%
So the 70 days are
bracketed by Leo and a point

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:17.790 align:middle line:90%
somewhere above Orion.

00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:21.650 align:middle line:84%
That point is where
the Pleiades are.

00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:23.605 align:middle line:90%
In the sky, it's very clear.

00:26:23.605 --> 00:26:26.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we know what
happens in those 70 days.

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:29.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, assuming on the ground that
the three stars are represented

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:33.500 align:middle line:84%
by the three pyramids of
Giza and that the temple

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:40.290 align:middle line:84%
of Heliopolis represents
the constellation of Leo,

00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:42.820 align:middle line:90%
then you have another feature.

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:44.780 align:middle line:84%
You have the Nile that
separates them both.

00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:48.340 align:middle line:90%


00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:53.970 align:middle line:10%
Similarly in the sky, the sun
at the beginning of the 70 days

00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:59.220 align:middle line:10%
is about to cross the Milky
Way and head towards Leo.

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:02.860 align:middle line:84%
So if you take the three
stars of Orion's belt

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:06.375 align:middle line:84%
as being the three pyramids,
then you have a scale.

00:27:06.375 --> 00:27:08.100 align:middle line:84%
You know the distance,
and therefore you

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:10.100 align:middle line:84%
know the static scale
that you're talking about.

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And if you use that scale,
you work on the same scale,

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:23.240 align:middle line:84%
then the position of
Abusir fits the Pleiades.

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:27.535 align:middle line:84%
And surprisingly, there are
five, six pyramids there,

00:27:27.535 --> 00:27:29.700 align:middle line:84%
and there are six or
seven stars there,

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:33.010 align:middle line:84%
and they seem to
be in a cluster.

00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:35.834 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, the sun's path
is just below the Pleiades.

00:27:35.834 --> 00:27:36.750 align:middle line:90%
It's not through them.

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:38.600 align:middle line:90%
Just below them.

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:42.360 align:middle line:84%
And odd enough, we find
the sun temples just

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.540 align:middle line:90%
below the Abusir pyramids.

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:47.850 align:middle line:84%
So you've got sun
temple to sun temple.

00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:49.850 align:middle line:90%
I now call it sun stations.

00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:54.930 align:middle line:84%
It looks like these were the
stations that on the ground,

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:58.920 align:middle line:84%
the Sol king performed
these 70 days' rituals,

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:02.270 align:middle line:84%
a bit like the
stations of the cross.

00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:07.770 align:middle line:84%
So you can see them in a much
archaic and grandiose way.

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:11.515 align:middle line:84%
The king went along
to these stations,

00:28:11.515 --> 00:28:15.430 align:middle line:84%
if you like, to perform
his rituals, his passion.

00:28:15.430 --> 00:29:20.562 align:middle line:90%


00:29:20.562 --> 00:29:22.110 align:middle line:90%
>>Here we are at Saqqara.

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:26.880 align:middle line:90%


00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:31.250 align:middle line:10%
This is the famous
step pyramid of Djoser.

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:35.720 align:middle line:10%
Djoser is a title to the
king of the Third Dynasty,

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:41.390 align:middle line:10%
2900 BC, roughly, say the books.

00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:48.300 align:middle line:84%
The step pyramid is located in
a big courtyard much, much older

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:49.770 align:middle line:90%
than the pyramid itself.

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:51.350 align:middle line:90%
And you can compare yourself.

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:53.100 align:middle line:84%
With the same eye, you
look at the pyramid

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:55.308 align:middle line:84%
and you look at the wall,
you can see the difference.

00:29:55.308 --> 00:29:58.960 align:middle line:90%


00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:01.180 align:middle line:84%
>>These chunks of
stone in front of Hakim

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:04.772 align:middle line:84%
are quartz crystal
characteristic of the area.

00:30:04.772 --> 00:30:08.626 align:middle line:84%
>>If we go back to
the ceiling here,

00:30:08.626 --> 00:30:11.880 align:middle line:84%
then it reflects the
crystal tile on the ground.

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:13.380 align:middle line:90%
This is what's left of it.

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:16.000 align:middle line:84%
This has been quarried
by the natives

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:22.540 align:middle line:90%
in the area in the 17th century,

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:27.170 align:middle line:84%
>>We see the remains of a quartz
floor at Giza in the temple

00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:28.750 align:middle line:84%
to the east of the
second pyramid.

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:31.310 align:middle line:90%


00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:34.130 align:middle line:84%
>>Now I'm pointing
the Djed Pillar,

00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:40.010 align:middle line:84%
which is symbolizing one of
the ancient gods, Osiris.

00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And djed is the
word we still use

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:45.370 align:middle line:90%
to address the older people.

00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:49.140 align:middle line:84%
My grandmother and
grandfather, djed.

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:52.160 align:middle line:84%
It goes back to
the story of Osiris

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:55.406 align:middle line:84%
and his brother
Seth, the bad guy,

00:30:55.406 --> 00:30:59.136 align:middle line:84%
who put Osiris in a coffin,
threw him in the ocean.

00:30:59.136 --> 00:31:05.490 align:middle line:84%
The ocean took him place,
Phoenicia, Lebanon today.

00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:08.216 align:middle line:84%
And there as the
cedar tree grows,

00:31:08.216 --> 00:31:12.080 align:middle line:84%
and the roots of the cedar
tree captured his coffin.

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.900 align:middle line:84%
Osiris has been found by
his beloved sister, Isis.

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:18.530 align:middle line:90%


00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:19.390 align:middle line:90%
She cry.

00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:26.173 align:middle line:84%
As she touched his body, and
they lived together again

00:31:26.173 --> 00:31:30.410 align:middle line:84%
for a short while,
short enough to make

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:33.208 align:middle line:90%
a baby with the name of Horus.

00:31:33.208 --> 00:31:37.680 align:middle line:10%
>>The story of Isis,
Osiris, and Horus

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:41.840 align:middle line:10%
is fundamental to
Egyptian cosmology.

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:45.460 align:middle line:84%
Isis is connected
to the star Sirius,

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:49.770 align:middle line:84%
and Osiris is connected to
the constellation of Orion.

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:53.735 align:middle line:90%
Horus is their prodigal son.

00:31:53.735 --> 00:31:55.444 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm going to
take you now to see

00:31:55.444 --> 00:32:00.990 align:middle line:84%
that hospital, the
healing with sound.

00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:03.770 align:middle line:84%
>>Stories about ancient
healing techniques

00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:08.830 align:middle line:84%
were passed down from generation
to generation by the elders.

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:12.460 align:middle line:84%
Hakim explains how
sound played a part

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:16.280 align:middle line:84%
in diagnosing and
healing patients.

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:19.745 align:middle line:84%
>>That line of construction
you see like three chambers,

00:32:19.745 --> 00:32:23.050 align:middle line:84%
it's what's left of the
House of the Spirit,

00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:28.500 align:middle line:84%
and it's a healing
system with sound.

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:32.634 align:middle line:84%
It's a medical
investigation table.

00:32:32.634 --> 00:32:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And the patient have
the right to use

00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:40.090 align:middle line:84%
either side of the stairs, one
on the right, one on the left.

00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:42.230 align:middle line:84%
So he'd have to
follow, or she'd have

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:45.580 align:middle line:84%
to follow her own antenna
to climb up there and choose

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:48.240 align:middle line:84%
the point where she stand,
because each point is

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:51.386 align:middle line:90%
connected to a check chamber.

00:32:51.386 --> 00:32:53.900 align:middle line:84%
We have 22 of them,
11 on each side.

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:55.646 align:middle line:90%
No ceiling.

00:32:55.646 --> 00:32:59.400 align:middle line:84%
And when you go inside,
you can see a niche

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:02.070 align:middle line:84%
where the physician put
his head in the niche

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:04.390 align:middle line:84%
to see what's the matter
with his patient laying

00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:06.418 align:middle line:90%
on this table.

00:33:06.418 --> 00:33:09.230 align:middle line:90%
And that works with the sound.

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:13.490 align:middle line:84%
And the sound, the source,
is the running water

00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:15.060 align:middle line:90%
in a tunnel underneath here.

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:18.610 align:middle line:84%
There is a big map of
tunnels underneath here.

00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:21.870 align:middle line:90%


00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:23.940 align:middle line:84%
>>Let's consider that
the pyramid sites

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:27.360 align:middle line:84%
along the Band of Peace
are sophisticated, harmonic

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:33.090 align:middle line:84%
structures not only mirroring
positions of the stars,

00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:35.140 align:middle line:84%
but designed to
replicate harmonic

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:39.004 align:middle line:90%
cavities of the human body.

00:33:39.004 --> 00:33:41.810 align:middle line:84%
It seems that the
chambers in the pyramids

00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:45.140 align:middle line:84%
are harmonically tuned
to a specific frequency

00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:46.170 align:middle line:90%
or musical tone.

00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:48.895 align:middle line:90%


00:33:48.895 --> 00:33:51.240 align:middle line:84%
Sound healing
techniques were used

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:54.703 align:middle line:84%
to restore the patient's body
to the correct harmonic within.

00:33:54.703 --> 00:33:57.860 align:middle line:90%


00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:01.260 align:middle line:84%
This is the view of Abusir
to the north of Saqqara.

00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:04.256 align:middle line:84%
And here is the view of
Dashour to the south.

00:34:04.256 --> 00:34:52.360 align:middle line:90%


00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:55.659 align:middle line:10%
>>Here we are on location
at the Bent Pyramid.

00:34:55.659 --> 00:34:57.740 align:middle line:10%
What you'll notice here
is that the construction

00:34:57.740 --> 00:34:58.545 align:middle line:10%
has two angles.

00:34:58.545 --> 00:35:01.180 align:middle line:90%


00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:03.700 align:middle line:84%
>>Traditional
Egyptologists will tell you

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:08.220 align:middle line:84%
that the Egyptians were
practicing building pyramids.

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And they started
building at one angle,

00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:14.160 align:middle line:84%
then changed their
minds partway through.

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:15.870 align:middle line:84%
This is the kind of
thinking that paints

00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:19.245 align:middle line:84%
the ancient Egyptians as
infantile and misguided.

00:35:19.245 --> 00:35:22.030 align:middle line:84%
But is there another
way of looking at it?

00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:25.360 align:middle line:84%
>>We call these
constructions at that area

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:29.844 align:middle line:84%
in Dashour related to
king called Sneferu.

00:35:29.844 --> 00:35:33.113 align:middle line:90%


00:35:33.113 --> 00:35:35.890 align:middle line:84%
>>At Dashour, there
are three pyramids

00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:41.160 align:middle line:84%
with three burial chambers
in each, nine in total.

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:44.720 align:middle line:84%
Traditional Egyptology tells
us that the entire site

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:47.416 align:middle line:90%
was built by Sneferu.

00:35:47.416 --> 00:35:51.300 align:middle line:84%
If the established story
that the pyramids are tombs

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:55.525 align:middle line:84%
is correct, why would
Sneferu have needed so many?

00:35:55.525 --> 00:35:58.890 align:middle line:90%


00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:01.310 align:middle line:84%
>>Sneferu would have had
nine different possibilities

00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:03.520 align:middle line:84%
and options for where he
would have been buried,

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:05.060 align:middle line:90%
which again is illogical.

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:08.030 align:middle line:84%
So this comes back to the
fact that understanding

00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:11.090 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptians in terms
of traditional Egyptology

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:13.820 align:middle line:84%
means that they were
misguided and illogical.

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:15.180 align:middle line:90%
I don't think this was the case.

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:17.826 align:middle line:90%


00:36:17.826 --> 00:36:22.700 align:middle line:10%
>>Now, when you come to the
word Sneferu, Sn means double,

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:23.742 align:middle line:10%
nefer is harmony.

00:36:23.742 --> 00:36:24.700 align:middle line:10%
So it's double harmony.

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:27.420 align:middle line:10%
It's not a name of
a person, but it's

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:29.300 align:middle line:10%
the energy we get from
this construction.

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:33.220 align:middle line:90%


00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:35.420 align:middle line:84%
>>Let's consider that
the pyramid sites

00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:38.930 align:middle line:84%
along the Band of Peace
are sophisticated, harmonic

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:40.540 align:middle line:90%
structures.

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:52.440 align:middle line:90%
[HUMMING]

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:55.020 align:middle line:84%
>>It seems that the
chambers in the pyramids

00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:58.700 align:middle line:84%
were harmonically tuned
to different frequencies

00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:02.280 align:middle line:90%
or musical tones.

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:07.770 align:middle line:84%
>>The Bent Pyramid,
it has two chambers

00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:09.710 align:middle line:90%
for two different sounds.

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:middle line:84%
>>Each chamber in
each pyramid, then,

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:15.320 align:middle line:84%
could be exemplifying
sound technology

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:18.450 align:middle line:84%
with distinct tones
creating huge fields

00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:19.460 align:middle line:90%
of harmonic resonance.

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:34.570 align:middle line:90%


00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:37.492 align:middle line:84%
At Dashour, we have the Red
Pyramid and the Black Pyramid.

00:37:37.492 --> 00:37:40.842 align:middle line:90%


00:37:40.842 --> 00:37:45.140 align:middle line:84%
The Bent Pyramid is covered
in white Tura limestone.

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:48.760 align:middle line:84%
So we have red,
white, and black.

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:51.670 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this is a clue to
the Giza pyramids also

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:55.550 align:middle line:84%
having distinct
colors in the past.

00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:57.450 align:middle line:84%
It would seem that the
Great Pyramid would

00:37:57.450 --> 00:38:01.680 align:middle line:84%
have been shimmering white
with its casing stones.

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:04.920 align:middle line:84%
The second pyramid
still glimmers red.

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And the third pyramid has
the remnants of black stones.

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:13.890 align:middle line:90%


00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:19.120 align:middle line:84%
This is the old river bed where
the Nile flowed in times past.

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:21.390 align:middle line:90%
Here is the black pyramid.

00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:24.790 align:middle line:84%
Egyptologists say the pyramid
builders were experimenting,

00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:28.420 align:middle line:84%
and they miscalculated, so
the pyramid broke apart.

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:30.045 align:middle line:84%
Could there be a
different explanation?

00:38:30.045 --> 00:38:32.980 align:middle line:90%


00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:35.350 align:middle line:84%
Another pyramid with
similar construction

00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:38.330 align:middle line:84%
100 kilometers south
of the Band of Peace

00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:42.420 align:middle line:90%
is known as the Meidum Pyramid.

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:44.610 align:middle line:84%
>>Today when you walk
around Meidum Pyramid,

00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:47.350 align:middle line:84%
you will find out
that on the ground

00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:51.514 align:middle line:84%
is a coat of
black-colored flint.

00:38:51.514 --> 00:38:54.250 align:middle line:90%
And the evidence is this.

00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:56.900 align:middle line:84%
When you pick up
one of these flints,

00:38:56.900 --> 00:39:00.940 align:middle line:84%
you see it's black at
the top and the bottom

00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:03.006 align:middle line:90%
is a different color.

00:39:03.006 --> 00:39:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And there is a catastrophe
happened over there.

00:39:06.330 --> 00:39:07.995 align:middle line:84%
I want you to look
at the ground.

00:39:07.995 --> 00:39:11.725 align:middle line:84%
You can see a coat
of smoke affects

00:39:11.725 --> 00:39:14.580 align:middle line:90%
the flints on the ground.

00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:16.470 align:middle line:84%
>>Meidum is not
the only place that

00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:19.700 align:middle line:84%
looks as though there
was an explosion.

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:22.740 align:middle line:84%
Look at this giant crack in the
solid stone of the Red Pyramid.

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:26.200 align:middle line:90%


00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:29.585 align:middle line:84%
It would have taken a huge
force to crack the solid rock.

00:39:29.585 --> 00:39:32.770 align:middle line:90%


00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:35.310 align:middle line:84%
There is a crack in the
subterranean chamber

00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:38.590 align:middle line:90%
in the Great Pyramid.

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And there is another one
in the Grand Gallery.

00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:44.050 align:middle line:90%


00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:47.860 align:middle line:84%
There are weird chemical
burns in the Red Pyramid.

00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:51.540 align:middle line:90%
What could have caused these?

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:54.570 align:middle line:84%
Old photos of the king's
chamber in the Great Pyramid

00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:56.650 align:middle line:90%
show the stone as black.

00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:58.870 align:middle line:84%
The room was cleaned
and restored,

00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:02.210 align:middle line:84%
and now we can see the
walls are pink granite.

00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:05.560 align:middle line:84%
The granite sarcophagus
has a broken corner,

00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:09.730 align:middle line:84%
and the wall next to
it has a giant crack.

00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:12.831 align:middle line:84%
What kind of force
could have caused this?

00:40:12.831 --> 00:40:16.100 align:middle line:90%


00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:19.620 align:middle line:84%
Is the Department of
Antiquities erasing evidence

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:20.936 align:middle line:90%
under the guise of restoration?

00:40:20.936 --> 00:40:24.732 align:middle line:90%


00:40:24.732 --> 00:40:27.400 align:middle line:84%
Where did we get the
history of Egypt?

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:30.930 align:middle line:90%


00:40:30.930 --> 00:40:35.360 align:middle line:84%
Herodotus was a Greek historian
in the 5th century BC.

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:38.990 align:middle line:84%
He wrote from his perspective
with help from local people,

00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:41.960 align:middle line:84%
and we have been
repeating it ever since.

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:45.540 align:middle line:90%
>>I said fake stories.

00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:50.360 align:middle line:84%
I want you to know yourself,
to wake up, to wake the senses

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:52.810 align:middle line:84%
and look carefully what
you are looking at.

00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:55.810 align:middle line:90%


00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:57.690 align:middle line:84%
What have you seen
of the pyramids.

00:40:57.690 --> 00:40:59.766 align:middle line:90%
That's what's left of it.

00:40:59.766 --> 00:41:01.383 align:middle line:90%
Being abused.

00:41:01.383 --> 00:41:03.250 align:middle line:90%
People quarry stones from there.

00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:05.680 align:middle line:84%
Anybody can go
and pick up stones

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:10.460 align:middle line:84%
to build a church,
mosque, house, palace.

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:15.670 align:middle line:84%
It's not taken good care of
by our minister of culture

00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:18.140 align:middle line:90%
and antiquities department.

00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:18.980 align:middle line:90%
I have to say this.

00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:22.305 align:middle line:90%


00:41:22.305 --> 00:41:24.610 align:middle line:84%
>>The story leaves many
questions unanswered.

00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:34.040 align:middle line:90%


00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.580 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it is time we
used the evidence

00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:38.740 align:middle line:84%
to reconsider what
we've been told.

00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:52.360 align:middle line:90%


00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:56.210 align:middle line:84%
We need to look with fresh
eyes and use a different time

00:41:56.210 --> 00:42:01.340 align:middle line:84%
frame to reconstruct the
story of ancient Egypt.

00:42:01.340 --> 00:44:29.134 align:middle line:90%
