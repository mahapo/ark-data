>>We have been taught
to think of Egypt

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.480 align:middle line:84%
as a civilization whose
golden age occurred

Imagining this magnificent
culture springing

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.580 align:middle line:84%
from small settlements
in Biblical times

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.570 align:middle line:84%
makes us wonder whether
we've got the timeline right.

of high levels of consciousness,
superior science, art,

00:00:39.028 --> 00:00:44.480 align:middle line:90%
and architecture from eons ago.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.272 align:middle line:90%
How do we reconcile this?

00:01:25.305 --> 00:01:29.140 align:middle line:84%
We are trapped in our
own concept of time,

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.370 align:middle line:84%
but many cultures think on
a vastly different scale.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.180 align:middle line:84%
Science has established that
the earliest human remains

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.940 align:middle line:90%
are about 2.5 million years old.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.390 align:middle line:84%
It has shifted our marker
back so that now we

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.966 align:middle line:84%
are able to conceive of human
culture being much, much older.

00:01:51.966 --> 00:01:56.770 align:middle line:84%
In Indian traditions,
and in 30 other cultures,

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.400 align:middle line:90%
a 26,000-year cycle is accepted.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.040 align:middle line:10%
How does that affect the
traditional chronology

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.900 align:middle line:10%
of Egypt, which insists that
the pyramids were constructed

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.240 align:middle line:10%
as recently as 2450 BC?

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.510 align:middle line:84%
Will this force the
issue of rethinking

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.175 align:middle line:90%
the chronology of ancient Egypt?

00:02:16.175 --> 00:02:20.000 align:middle line:90%

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.780 align:middle line:90%

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.290 align:middle line:10%
Knowledge because I
wanted to bring together

the bright minds in this whole
field of alternative history

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.540 align:middle line:10%

about the tenets of
Egyptian civilization.

And I am convinced that
there is a misunderstanding

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.580 align:middle line:10%
about it's dating.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.010 align:middle line:10%
>>To me, as a geologist,
it's unquestionable

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.630 align:middle line:10%
that the chronology
has to be redone.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.350 align:middle line:10%
>>Knowledge of precession
and an advanced astronomy

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.805 align:middle line:10%
existed in extremely
distant times.

00:03:24.805 --> 00:03:27.620 align:middle line:90%


00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.670 align:middle line:10%
>>So I think we're looking
at a chronology that's

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.900 align:middle line:10%
far, far older than is accepted.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.800 align:middle line:10%
>>By integrating recent
scientific discoveries

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.000 align:middle line:10%
in different disciplines,
they define a new timeline

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.395 align:middle line:10%
of our past.

00:03:42.395 --> 00:03:45.190 align:middle line:10%


00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.070 align:middle line:10%
The Egyptians provided
us with concrete evidence

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.340 align:middle line:10%
that describes political events
from a far more distant past

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.770 align:middle line:10%
than we can imagine.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.450 align:middle line:90%
Why has this been overlooked?

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.180 align:middle line:10%
>>And the Egyptians themselves,
in at least one stone tablet,

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.140 align:middle line:10%
the Palermo Stone, and one
papyrus, the Turin Papyrus,

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.360 align:middle line:10%
they say that ancient
Egypt is much, much older

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.170 align:middle line:10%
than the Egyptologists
think it is.

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.000 align:middle line:10%
So, to dismiss that is
of course an assumption

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.079 align:middle line:10%
that contemporary
Egyptologists know

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.920 align:middle line:10%
a lot more about
ancient Egyptian history

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.170 align:middle line:10%
than ancient
Egyptians do, which is

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.656 align:middle line:10%
a form of the typical
arrogance on the part

00:04:25.656 --> 00:04:27.850 align:middle line:10%
of the academic community.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.350 align:middle line:84%
>>So why do we
consider civilization

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.330 align:middle line:84%
to be only about
6,000 years old?

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.250 align:middle line:84%
Is it because of our
limited imagination?

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.720 align:middle line:10%
Or is there another reason?

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.320 align:middle line:10%
>>Modern scholars tend
to minimize the age

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.350 align:middle line:10%
because it fits better with the
current paradigm of history.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.720 align:middle line:84%
The current paradigm
is 5,000 years ago

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.805 align:middle line:90%
man was a hunter-gatherer.

00:04:52.805 --> 00:04:55.710 align:middle line:84%
He had to have writing before
he could build large structures

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.296 align:middle line:90%
and civilizations.

00:04:58.296 --> 00:05:02.570 align:middle line:84%
He came together to protect
himself from other warring

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.810 align:middle line:90%
parties, and things like this.

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And so, for example,
in Caral, Peru,

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.620 align:middle line:84%
when they found that amazing
six-pyramid structure

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.010 align:middle line:84%
down there, they assumed
it was built by the Incas

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.180 align:middle line:84%
because that's
only 500 years ago,

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.890 align:middle line:84%
and Incas built most
of South America.

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.165 align:middle line:84%
Well, when they got this
very good carbon dating

00:05:20.165 --> 00:05:24.170 align:middle line:84%
that shows it's 4,700
years old it really

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:31.250 align:middle line:84%
blows a hole in
current history theory.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.420 align:middle line:84%
Generally, the
academic community

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.300 align:middle line:84%
is just sort of silent
about it right now

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.200 align:middle line:84%
because they don't have any good
ideas with the current theories

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.665 align:middle line:90%
of history.

00:05:41.665 --> 00:05:44.330 align:middle line:84%
>>A cross-disciplinary
approach helps

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.330 align:middle line:84%
us to put hard evidence
and theory together

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.400 align:middle line:84%
to reach a greater
understanding.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.560 align:middle line:84%
If we consider the data coming
from astronomy, geology,

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:00.060 align:middle line:84%
astrology, and climatology, we
can arrive at new conclusions

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.300 align:middle line:84%
about the chronology
of ancient Egypt.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.426 align:middle line:84%
>>We have two sciences
that are playing with this.

00:06:04.426 --> 00:06:05.884 align:middle line:84%
We have astronomy,
we have geology.

00:06:05.884 --> 00:06:08.670 align:middle line:84%
With the pyramids, we have
a much more precise science.

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.262 align:middle line:90%
They've aligned the monuments.

00:06:10.262 --> 00:06:13.420 align:middle line:10%
And they have their
religious ideas

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.520 align:middle line:10%
locked to the machinery of the
sky, and the constellations,

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.590 align:middle line:10%
and the sun, and so forth.

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.850 align:middle line:84%
So we can use that
with high precision,

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.610 align:middle line:90%
and arrive at a date.

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.480 align:middle line:84%
>>How does this
information affect

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.220 align:middle line:90%
the dating of the Great Pyramid?

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:32.510 align:middle line:84%
Was it really built when
Egyptologists say it was?

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.880 align:middle line:84%
>>The traditional date for the
Great Pyramids is about 2550,

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:41.444 align:middle line:84%
or so, BC, give or take--
people argue about the dates.

00:06:41.444 --> 00:06:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And some people want to take
it down to a particular year.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.390 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a precision
that's not justified

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:48.610 align:middle line:90%
whatsoever.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.710 align:middle line:84%
>>I like to use the metaphor
of painting a house.

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.740 align:middle line:84%
If you painted your
house last in 2003,

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.030 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't mean your
house was built in 2003.

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:59.840 align:middle line:10%
So I subscribe to
the notion of there

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.680 align:middle line:10%
was probably quite
a lot of work done

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.480 align:middle line:10%
on the Great Pyramid in 2450
BC, but that it probably

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.150 align:middle line:10%
was built quite a bit
earlier than that.

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.790 align:middle line:84%
There's something very
threatening about changing

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:14.760 align:middle line:84%
the dates because it takes us
out of the Patriarchal Era.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:18.900 align:middle line:84%
But I think that there was
a whole world of Egypt that

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.980 align:middle line:90%
existed in matriarchal times.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:23.214 align:middle line:84%
And I think the evidence
is quite strong for that.

00:07:23.214 --> 00:07:28.140 align:middle line:90%


00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:30.930 align:middle line:84%
>>There is absolutely
no reason at all

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:32.425 align:middle line:84%
why the ancient
Egyptians could not

00:07:32.425 --> 00:07:35.421 align:middle line:84%
have worked out the
precession cycle.

00:07:35.421 --> 00:07:38.000 align:middle line:90%
How do we approach the age?

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.510 align:middle line:90%


00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:43.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have a
variety of methods.

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:48.400 align:middle line:84%
When you're looking at
an archaeological site,

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.740 align:middle line:84%
you have what we call, the
archaeological datings, which

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:58.820 align:middle line:84%
means you look at artifacts that
you can fit into a chronology,

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:02.820 align:middle line:84%
and you look a
potsherds, stratas.

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:07.900 align:middle line:84%
But this can be very
deceiving because it

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.700 align:middle line:84%
requires a lot of
interpretation.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.355 align:middle line:84%
Nonetheless, these
are the methods

00:08:12.355 --> 00:08:15.860 align:middle line:84%
that is predominantly
used in archeology.

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:17.530 align:middle line:90%
The other is carbon dating.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Carbon dating is
OK up to a point.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's not
obviously misleading

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:25.010 align:middle line:84%
if it's been contaminated,
and so forth.

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And besides, with
many of these places,

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:32.159 align:middle line:84%
we do not have carbon
datable material.

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:36.799 align:middle line:84%
>>Carbon-14 dating works
only on organic materials.

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:39.630 align:middle line:84%
But simply touching
organic materials

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:42.520 align:middle line:90%
contaminates a sample.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.320 align:middle line:90%
Stone cannot be carbon dated.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.930 align:middle line:90%


00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:48.710 align:middle line:84%
>>There is another
form of dating,

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:52.550 align:middle line:84%
which is to use
precession slurry.

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:56.560 align:middle line:84%
>>What can we use
to measure time?

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.710 align:middle line:84%
Are there markers that connect
to the movement of the stars?

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:04.199 align:middle line:84%
>>The stars would shift about
one degree every 72 years.

00:09:04.199 --> 00:09:05.740 align:middle line:84%
>>It is not anymore
in the same spot.

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:08.460 align:middle line:84%
Our planet is moving
but we can't feel it,

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.820 align:middle line:90%
not in the same position.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:14.060 align:middle line:10%
And that will
change all the time.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:16.580 align:middle line:10%
Nothing stands still.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:20.480 align:middle line:84%
You know that our planet
make a cycle every 24 hours,

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.730 align:middle line:90%
sunrise every 24 hours, right?

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:30.330 align:middle line:84%
But our planet also
revolve in a different way.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:33.980 align:middle line:84%
>>Precession is the motion of
the axis of the earth, which

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:37.910 align:middle line:84%
wobbles like a spinning top
due to gravitational pull.

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:44.270 align:middle line:84%
>>They make one round
every 26,000 years.

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:49.050 align:middle line:84%
>>If you have a
monument-- For example,

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:55.020 align:middle line:84%
let's take one that we know
for sure, the Temple of Isis

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.140 align:middle line:90%
at Dendera.

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:59.950 align:middle line:84%
It's a small temple
behind the mountain.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:07.390 align:middle line:84%
That one is 99% sure aligned
to the rising of Sirius.

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:11.800 align:middle line:84%
So, if we have certainty that
the temple has its axis aligned

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:15.190 align:middle line:84%
to the rising of a star, and
we know which star it is,

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:16.920 align:middle line:90%
then we can date it.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:17.840 align:middle line:90%
It's very simple.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.530 align:middle line:84%
We can do it in a
matter of minutes.

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:24.450 align:middle line:84%
This is known as
precession astronomy.

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:28.250 align:middle line:84%
The star moves, or appears to
move, because of the precession

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:30.710 align:middle line:90%
or wobble and we have a date.

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:35.190 align:middle line:10%
>>Plato called a processional
cycle of 26,000 years

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:36.940 align:middle line:10%
a Great Year.

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:41.420 align:middle line:10%
>>The Great Year is Plato's
term for this vast cycle

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:44.570 align:middle line:10%
of time, one eon, one
procession of the equinox.

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:47.130 align:middle line:90%
It's about 24,000 years.

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And there's over
200 myths that talk

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:55.080 align:middle line:84%
about this cycle of alternating
dark and golden ages,

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:59.900 align:middle line:84%
or that make reference to a
golden age in the distant past.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.840 align:middle line:84%
30 different cultures
have passed down

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.910 align:middle line:84%
these myths from time
to time, and they

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:08.200 align:middle line:84%
all related to the movement of
the stars, which we know today

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.110 align:middle line:90%
as procession.

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:11.340 align:middle line:84%
Even Sir Isaac Newton
himself wrote a book

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:14.220 align:middle line:84%
on it trying to
match history to each

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:17.140 align:middle line:84%
of the constellations
in the zodiac.

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:23.430 align:middle line:84%
And it was wiped out by the
Darwinian evolution paradigm,

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:27.560 align:middle line:84%
which came along less than
200 years ago, where it became

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:33.950 align:middle line:84%
inacceptable to admit that a
culture that lived long, long

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:36.670 align:middle line:84%
before us might know
something that we don't know.

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:41.750 align:middle line:90%


00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:44.130 align:middle line:84%
>>On different
continents, cultures

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:46.320 align:middle line:84%
have come up with
the same ideas.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:50.360 align:middle line:10%
>>There is a certain
science of cycles

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:53.720 align:middle line:10%
that's embedded into the world
age doctrine of the Maya.

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:58.280 align:middle line:84%
You find it nicely paralleled
in Egyptian ideas, as well

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:03.330 align:middle line:84%
as the Hindu world age
doctrine known as the Yugas.

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's somewhat
counterintuitive to what

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:08.390 align:middle line:84%
we've learned in our
own Western education.

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:11.480 align:middle line:84%
It's referred to as
the myth of progress,

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.530 align:middle line:84%
that human beings
today are in all ways

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:17.630 align:middle line:84%
superior to human beings
that became before.

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:19.500 align:middle line:10%
It's simply not true.

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.295 align:middle line:10%
Cycles go through
periods of increase

00:12:22.295 --> 00:12:23.510 align:middle line:10%
and periods of decrease.

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:26.440 align:middle line:90%


00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.870 align:middle line:84%
>>Mayan daykeepers
are descendants

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:34.480 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient Mayan people,
and monitor the sacred calendar.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:39.000 align:middle line:84%
Each day has certain
qualities and gods.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.800 align:middle line:84%
Daykeepers follow the
movement of planets, eclipses,

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.730 align:middle line:90%
and astrological alignments.

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:50.500 align:middle line:84%
They are often trained shamans
who do divination ceremonies,

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:53.450 align:middle line:84%
giving daily and
monthly forecasts.

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>>The Maya calendar
is really interesting

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:58.540 align:middle line:84%
because it's based
on a lunar rhythm.

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And the core building block
of the sacred calendar

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.140 align:middle line:90%
is this 260-day cycle.

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:07.920 align:middle line:84%
Maya daykeepers today will
offer as an explanation for this

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.620 align:middle line:84%
that it corresponds to the
human gestation period,

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:12.910 align:middle line:90%
it's roughly nine months.

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:16.220 align:middle line:84%
So all human beings
share this primal rhythm

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:19.450 align:middle line:84%
of unfolding based
upon the lunar cycle.

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's a real
interesting key

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:26.160 align:middle line:84%
to the, what you might say,
the Mayan time philosophy.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.470 align:middle line:84%
>>There are many ways
of dividing time:

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:35.320 align:middle line:84%
solar cycles, lunar cycles,
and larger cycles of time.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:38.440 align:middle line:84%
The Mayans devised their
Long Count calendar,

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.870 align:middle line:84%
which combines a
cycle of 20 named days

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:49.480 align:middle line:84%
with another cycle of 13 numbers
to produce 260 unique days.

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.265 align:middle line:84%
Each of the 20 days is
linked to a different god

00:13:52.265 --> 00:13:54.700 align:middle line:90%
in Mayan mythology.

00:13:54.700 --> 00:14:03.161 align:middle line:84%
The great cycle started in 3114
BC and ends in December 2012.

00:14:03.161 --> 00:14:05.780 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, the Long Count calendar
is the most interesting

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:07.970 align:middle line:84%
calendar that the
Maya had devised.

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:10.670 align:middle line:84%
This is of great
interest in our times

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:14.830 align:middle line:84%
because this large cycle
in the Long Count calendar,

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:20.050 align:middle line:84%
this period of 13
baktuns, ends in 2012.

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:22.690 align:middle line:84%
So there's a great
interest in figuring out

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:25.830 align:middle line:84%
why the early Maya sky
watchers picked 2012

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:28.130 align:middle line:90%
to end this large cycle of time.

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:31.440 align:middle line:90%


00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.750 align:middle line:84%
>>The Mayans were
excellent calendar makers.

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:36.490 align:middle line:84%
They inter-correlated
the movements

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:40.470 align:middle line:84%
of the moon, the
sun, and even Venus

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:43.140 align:middle line:84%
to make their
calendars very precise.

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason, they have
their Long Count calendar,

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:50.850 align:middle line:90%
the baktun, ending here in 2012.

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:53.000 align:middle line:84%
So it seems, perhaps,
they were trying

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.040 align:middle line:90%
to call attention to something.

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:59.890 align:middle line:84%
>>Many people have been talking
about 2012 as a turning point.

00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:02.146 align:middle line:84%
What is the significance
of this date?

00:15:02.146 --> 00:15:04.740 align:middle line:90%


00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:09.080 align:middle line:84%
>>In the years around 2012,
the December solstice sun

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:12.910 align:middle line:84%
will be lining up with the
center of our Milky Way galaxy.

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:16.350 align:middle line:84%
This is a rare alignment in the
Great Cycle of the Precession

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:20.420 align:middle line:84%
of the Equinoxes, this
26,000-year cycle.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, another thing that's
interesting about this period

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:27.100 align:middle line:84%
of the 13-baktun cycle
that began in 3113 BC

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:33.360 align:middle line:84%
and ends in 2012, is
its midpoint, 550 BC.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:38.000 align:middle line:84%
This is a time when great
world teachers appeared

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.070 align:middle line:84%
on the stage of history,
Pythagoras among the Greeks,

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:47.770 align:middle line:84%
the Buddha, Zoroaster among
the ancient early Persians.

00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:50.030 align:middle line:84%
So there's also something
to be said for the way

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:53.190 align:middle line:84%
that the Long Count divides
up time in a certain way that

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:59.900 align:middle line:84%
defines periods in human
culture, dawn points, high noon

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:01.474 align:middle line:90%
points, and end points.

00:16:01.474 --> 00:16:11.560 align:middle line:90%


00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:16.310 align:middle line:84%
>>A carved stone, or stele,
describing the Long Count

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:20.842 align:middle line:84%
calendar was discovered
at Izapa in Mexico.

00:16:20.842 --> 00:16:25.810 align:middle line:84%
It shows the center of the
Milky Way, the celestial pole,

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:27.820 align:middle line:90%
and a sun deity.

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:30.790 align:middle line:84%
Why was this important
to the Mayans?

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:34.290 align:middle line:84%
>>It's really a beautiful
and profound way

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:36.130 align:middle line:90%
of conceiving time.

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:39.900 align:middle line:10%
And in my research, as I've
looked at Izapa, the origin

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.190 align:middle line:10%
place of the 2012
calendar, I've been

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:46.210 align:middle line:10%
able to see how
the Mayan wisdom--

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:48.133 align:middle line:10%
it's not just some
provincial belief

00:16:48.133 --> 00:16:49.910 align:middle line:10%
system of a forgotten people.

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:51.965 align:middle line:10%
It actually is like
a little doorway

00:16:51.965 --> 00:16:54.830 align:middle line:10%
that opens up into the
great spiritual insights

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:57.090 align:middle line:10%
that all of the great
traditions share.

00:16:57.090 --> 00:17:01.810 align:middle line:84%
In Egypt, in India,
Islam, all the world's

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:05.450 align:middle line:84%
great spiritual traditions share
these same universal, eternal

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:06.810 align:middle line:90%
spiritual principles.

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do
with cycle endings.

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>>Just like the cycles of
birth, life, and death,

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:18.650 align:middle line:84%
within the 26,000-year cycle,
referred to as the Great Year,

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:22.849 align:middle line:84%
there are extended periods
of darkness and light.

00:17:22.849 --> 00:17:26.250 align:middle line:84%
These are divided into
distinct ages, known

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:30.540 align:middle line:84%
as the golden age, the
silver age, the bronze age,

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:32.310 align:middle line:90%
and the iron age.

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:36.010 align:middle line:10%
>>The ancients
themselves told us

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:41.110 align:middle line:10%
that history, mankind
would go into a dark age.

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:45.425 align:middle line:84%
4,000, 5,000 years ago,
they viewed the past

00:17:45.425 --> 00:17:47.030 align:middle line:90%
as the golden age.

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:49.750 align:middle line:84%
They see themselves
moving into the dark age,

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:51.692 align:middle line:84%
and they dread it
because they know

00:17:51.692 --> 00:17:53.150 align:middle line:84%
that things are
going to get worse,

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:55.280 align:middle line:90%
they're going to get chaotic.

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:56.790 align:middle line:84%
Cultures all around
the world are

00:17:56.790 --> 00:18:01.830 align:middle line:84%
talking about this pre-dark age
that things are going downhill.

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:07.530 align:middle line:84%
>>I really ascribe to the
Mayan and the Hindu idea

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:11.530 align:middle line:84%
that the golden age,
the time of connection

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:15.370 align:middle line:84%
into the divine wisdom, was
actually a long time ago,

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:17.490 align:middle line:84%
and we've been moving
through periods

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:22.040 align:middle line:84%
of increasing
densification, increasing

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.321 align:middle line:84%
alienation from the
spiritual light.

00:18:24.321 --> 00:18:31.970 align:middle line:90%


00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:34.520 align:middle line:84%
>>Golden ages are
times of enlightenment,

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:38.740 align:middle line:84%
when civilizations reach
high points in architecture,

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:42.550 align:middle line:90%
spirituality, and benevolence.

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:46.640 align:middle line:84%
This is considered to decline
slightly in the silver age,

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.916 align:middle line:84%
further deteriorating
in the bronze age,

00:18:49.916 --> 00:18:53.390 align:middle line:84%
and reaching extreme levels
of chaos, corruption,

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:57.840 align:middle line:84%
and ignorance in the
iron age, or dark age.

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:02.150 align:middle line:84%
Then, the cycle works its way
back up to the next golden age.

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:06.690 align:middle line:90%


00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:11.690 align:middle line:84%
One of the ways to measure
the 26,000-year Yuga cycles is

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:15.259 align:middle line:84%
through the ages of the zodiac,
which the ancient Egyptians

00:19:15.259 --> 00:19:16.050 align:middle line:90%
clearly understood.

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:19.620 align:middle line:90%


00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:21.970 align:middle line:10%
>>The origin of
the zodiacal signs

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:25.500 align:middle line:10%
is a very good question
actually, and probably

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.340 align:middle line:10%
impossible to determine.

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:29.670 align:middle line:84%
The only one of the
signs that vaguely

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:33.230 align:middle line:84%
looks like what it's
supposed to is Leo, the lion.

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:35.610 align:middle line:10%
The stars making
up Virgo definitely

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:37.250 align:middle line:10%
don't look like a
virgin, whatever

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:39.480 align:middle line:10%
a virgin looks like these days.

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And the other signs
are equally mysterious,

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:46.120 align:middle line:84%
the Crab, the Bull,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:48.090 align:middle line:84%
Knowledge of
precession and advance

00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:52.730 align:middle line:84%
astronomy existed in
extremely distant times.

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:58.740 align:middle line:84%
The basis of the signs
themselves in terms of zodiac,

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:00.490 align:middle line:84%
the wheel of life or
the wheel of animals,

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:03.240 align:middle line:84%
there are different translations
of that-- If you really

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.820 align:middle line:84%
want to know what
the sign signify,

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:09.230 align:middle line:84%
you have to go
into the qualities

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:11.300 align:middle line:84%
and properties of
the signs themselves.

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:14.210 align:middle line:84%
In other words, each
sign is male or female,

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:19.840 align:middle line:84%
each sign is fire,
earth, air, water.

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:23.780 align:middle line:10%
>>Each of the 12 signs of the
zodiac has distinct energies.

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:29.300 align:middle line:10%
There are four elements,
earth, or material signs, air,

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:34.925 align:middle line:10%
or intellectual signs, water,
or emotional signs, and fire,

00:20:34.925 --> 00:20:38.370 align:middle line:10%
or creative signs.

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:42.990 align:middle line:84%
By looking at the 12 zodiac,
or ages, of about 2,000 years

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:47.810 align:middle line:84%
each, we can rethink the
Egyptian's concepts of time

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:49.480 align:middle line:90%
and re-create the chronology.

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:55.358 align:middle line:90%


00:20:55.358 --> 00:20:59.215 align:middle line:84%
>>There is a gap in
our historical record.

00:20:59.215 --> 00:21:02.690 align:middle line:84%
>>The Palermo Stone
and the Turin Papyrus

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:06.130 align:middle line:84%
are evidence from the
Egyptians themselves,

00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:09.430 align:middle line:84%
and convey information
from rulers far back

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:11.406 align:middle line:90%
in Egyptian history.

00:21:11.406 --> 00:21:12.780 align:middle line:84%
>>And they give
the reignal years

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:14.750 align:middle line:84%
and the name of each
of these rulers.

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:16.740 align:middle line:84%
And when you compute
all of those names

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:19.860 align:middle line:84%
and put the numbers together,
you get a date somewhere

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:22.450 align:middle line:90%
around 34,000, 36,000 BC.

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:27.680 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, roughly,
that 36,000 34,000 year date

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.760 align:middle line:84%
corresponds to the
Vedas of India,

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:33.462 align:middle line:84%
the Vedic civilization of India,
which also gives a date, which

00:21:33.462 --> 00:21:35.670 align:middle line:84%
when you when you work it
out, comes out to something

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:39.010 align:middle line:84%
like 40,000 years
before our current era.

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:41.880 align:middle line:84%
So we have two great,
sophisticated civilizations

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:45.435 align:middle line:84%
that have documented their own
belief that their civilization

00:21:45.435 --> 00:21:48.130 align:middle line:84%
started back around
that kind of time.

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:53.420 align:middle line:90%


00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:56.160 align:middle line:84%
>>It is interesting to note
that this is roughly one

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.980 align:middle line:84%
and one half
processional cycles ago,

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:01.410 align:middle line:84%
dating back to a
previous golden age.

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:18.243 align:middle line:90%


00:22:18.243 --> 00:22:24.430 align:middle line:10%
The Sphinx, with its lion body,
screams out as a Leo symbol,

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:26.960 align:middle line:10%
as a marker for an age of Leo.

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:31.670 align:middle line:10%
The last age of Leo had it's
ingress at around 10,500 BC.

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:37.170 align:middle line:10%
So that's the date favored by
Graham and by Robert Bauval.

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:42.730 align:middle line:10%
I'm hesitant to accept that
date myself because the last ice

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:46.630 align:middle line:10%
age comes to a catastrophic
end somewhere around 11,000,

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:48.222 align:middle line:10%
11,500 BC.

00:22:48.222 --> 00:22:49.930 align:middle line:84%
It certainly followed,
and this is known,

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:51.550 align:middle line:84%
there are the
quaternary extinctions.

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:53.530 align:middle line:84%
All the mammoths and
the woolly rhinoceroses

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:54.770 align:middle line:90%
die all over the world.

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:59.990 align:middle line:84%
Siberia, which was temperate,
becomes tundra and arctic.

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:04.310 align:middle line:84%
North America, which was under
a couple of miles of ice sheet,

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:06.934 align:middle line:84%
melts, and all that
water goes into the sea.

00:23:06.934 --> 00:23:10.550 align:middle line:84%
The sea rises 300
feet over the course

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:13.190 align:middle line:84%
of a couple of thousand
years, but in stages.

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:15.220 align:middle line:84%
And some of those
stages, very precipitous,

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:17.755 align:middle line:84%
maybe corresponding
to the biblical flood

00:23:17.755 --> 00:23:20.400 align:middle line:84%
and possibly Plato's
Atlantis myth.

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.635 align:middle line:84%
So under these circumstances,
which are catastrophic

00:23:23.635 --> 00:23:28.285 align:middle line:84%
the world over, to
me, it seems unlikely

00:23:28.285 --> 00:23:31.940 align:middle line:84%
that the Sphinx, and the
pyramids, which presupposes

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:35.400 align:middle line:84%
a settled, and stable,
and sophisticated society,

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.380 align:middle line:84%
could have built those
amazing structures

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:39.790 align:middle line:90%
under those kinds of conditions.

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:42.880 align:middle line:10%
So that leaves anything
before 10,500 BC,

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:46.080 align:middle line:10%
but I like the idea
of the Leo symbolism,

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:50.470 align:middle line:10%
so the next age of Leo back
is 26,000 years earlier.

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:53.410 align:middle line:10%
And that puts it back
at around 36,000 BC,

00:23:53.410 --> 00:24:00.000 align:middle line:10%
which, outrageous as it sounds,
by a process of exclusion,

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.340 align:middle line:10%
turns out to be maybe less
outrageous because there are

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:05.575 align:middle line:10%
big problems with those
other later dates.

00:24:05.575 --> 00:24:10.670 align:middle line:90%


00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:15.230 align:middle line:10%
>>Looking at the weathering
on the Sphinx and the Sphinx

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:18.120 align:middle line:10%
enclosure, that
weathering was clearly

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:22.320 align:middle line:10%
formed by runoff
from precipitation.

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.620 align:middle line:84%
>>It is indeed water weathering
and precipitation-induced,

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:27.620 align:middle line:84%
so it has to have been
done in the distant past.

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And the question, then, is
how distant was that past?

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:35.610 align:middle line:84%
>>It could take tens of
thousands of years for the Nile

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:38.020 align:middle line:90%
to have migrated eight miles.

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:41.980 align:middle line:84%
Can we use this evidence
to re-date these monuments?

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:43.910 align:middle line:10%
>>When you look at
geology, you can

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:48.350 align:middle line:10%
see that the riverbed
has migrated all the way

00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:53.150 align:middle line:10%
from the west, beyond 50
kilometers to the west,

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:55.500 align:middle line:10%
then it passed
across the plateau,

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:58.150 align:middle line:10%
and you can see that the
ancient riverbed actually

00:24:58.150 --> 00:25:00.820 align:middle line:10%
went right up the
pyramids and the initiates

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:03.520 align:middle line:10%
could have stepped right
off these barges up

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.990 align:middle line:10%
onto the causeways
into the pyramids.

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:12.220 align:middle line:84%
Now if you look, the Nile is a
full eight miles to the east,

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:15.820 align:middle line:84%
and it's the dividing point
between Cairo and Giza.

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:18.100 align:middle line:10%
And so if we look
at geological time,

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:21.230 align:middle line:10%
it would take several tens of
thousands of years in order

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:24.020 align:middle line:10%
for the Nile to
make that migration.

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:26.960 align:middle line:84%
We can compare that to
places like Tiahuanaco

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:29.840 align:middle line:84%
in Bolivia that
almost certainly was

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:33.980 align:middle line:84%
on the edge of Lake Titicaca,
and now it's 50 miles away.

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:36.910 align:middle line:84%
So it changes the whole
idea of how ancient

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:40.750 align:middle line:90%
these places could have been.

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:42.870 align:middle line:84%
>>How many thousands
of years does it

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:47.510 align:middle line:84%
take for a river to
make this huge journey?

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:50.660 align:middle line:84%
The oases of Al
Kharga and Faiyoum

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:56.420 align:middle line:84%
run parallel to the Nile
today, but 100 kilometers west.

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:59.790 align:middle line:84%
It seems that the river
migrated all the way from here

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:03.160 align:middle line:90%
to its current course.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.320 align:middle line:84%
Evidence of ancient
human settlements

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:08.280 align:middle line:84%
has been found in the
area that is now desert,

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:11.080 align:middle line:90%
but once had water.

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:14.000 align:middle line:84%
At these locations
are stone circles

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.070 align:middle line:84%
indicating a knowledge
of astronomy.

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:20.707 align:middle line:84%
What does it tell us
about the distant past?

00:26:20.707 --> 00:26:23.980 align:middle line:90%


00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:26.180 align:middle line:84%
What can we conclude
you about the dating

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:29.205 align:middle line:90%
of the pyramids and the Sphinx?

00:26:29.205 --> 00:26:33.055 align:middle line:10%
>>All I can really say at this
point, given the data I have,

00:26:33.055 --> 00:26:37.750 align:middle line:10%
is that I think it has been
at least back to 5,000 BC.

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:38.690 align:middle line:10%
Could it be older?

00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:41.110 align:middle line:90%
In fact, might it well be older?

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:42.540 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:46.840 align:middle line:84%
Generally, if sort of
pressed for dates, I'll say,

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:50.746 align:middle line:84%
my best estimate is somewhere
in the period of 7,000 to 5,000

00:26:50.746 --> 00:26:52.500 align:middle line:90%
BC.

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:56.372 align:middle line:84%
So that's really a working
range that I'm comfortable with.

00:26:56.372 --> 00:27:01.580 align:middle line:90%


00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:05.390 align:middle line:84%
We're also finding, elsewhere
in Egypt and around the world,

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:09.860 align:middle line:84%
that other things were happening
in that same period, 7,000

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:14.020 align:middle line:84%
to 5,000, approximately,
BC that, to me, puts

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:17.480 align:middle line:84%
the Sphinx into
a larger regional

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:21.170 align:middle line:84%
and global setting, that it's
not just a isolated thing.

00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:24.570 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't seem as isolated
as it did 15 years ago

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:26.480 align:middle line:90%
when we had less knowledge.

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.295 align:middle line:84%
You come to tentative
conclusions.

00:27:28.295 --> 00:27:32.880 align:middle line:84%
If more data comes in that seems
to indicate something else,

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:37.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't ever want to be afraid
to change my conclusions

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:39.494 align:middle line:84%
and go where the
evidence takes me.

00:27:39.494 --> 00:27:42.400 align:middle line:90%


00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:46.240 align:middle line:84%
>>I'll stick with my
extreme 36,000 BC date

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.820 align:middle line:90%
until proved otherwise.

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:49.795 align:middle line:84%
And if proved otherwise,
I will change my mind.

00:27:49.795 --> 00:27:59.090 align:middle line:90%


00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>>How can we tie the concept
of the Yuga, or Vedic cycles,

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:06.150 align:middle line:84%
into something more
concrete that we

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:09.900 align:middle line:84%
can recognize in
our own history?

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:12.280 align:middle line:84%
If we re-examined the
stories that are often

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:15.520 align:middle line:84%
dismissed as fanciful
myth, we might

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:18.600 align:middle line:84%
find that it indicates
greater forces in play.

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:22.329 align:middle line:90%


00:28:22.329 --> 00:28:23.995 align:middle line:10%
>>Those of us that
are seriously looking

00:28:23.995 --> 00:28:28.700 align:middle line:10%
at this old Vedic concept of
the world ages, the cycle,

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:31.950 align:middle line:10%
we know that the golden age,
the last golden age-- basically,

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:36.520 align:middle line:10%
the peak of the cycle-- was
about 11,500 BC, the highest

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:37.290 align:middle line:10%
point.

00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:40.230 align:middle line:84%
But we also know
that Plato mentions

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:42.650 align:middle line:84%
a series of catastrophes,
which have come down

00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:45.470 align:middle line:84%
to us as the Atlantis
legend, in which he claims

00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:48.250 align:middle line:84%
that, on our calendar system
it would have been around 9,500

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:50.910 align:middle line:84%
BC, some tremendous upheaval
apparently occurred.

00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:51.830 align:middle line:90%
A lot of destruction.

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:59.680 align:middle line:90%


00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:02.750 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it also possible that
for all of those maybe several

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:05.190 align:middle line:84%
thousand years, whatever
those catastrophes were,

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:09.050 align:middle line:84%
were so cataclysmic that
even with that silver age

00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:11.490 align:middle line:84%
or golden age
consciousness, they

00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:14.660 align:middle line:90%
weren't fully able to recover.

00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:18.500 align:middle line:84%
The end of the golden
age and the decline

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:20.770 align:middle line:84%
into the following
silver age, or what

00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:23.520 align:middle line:84%
we would refer to as
mental age, marked the time

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:27.260 align:middle line:84%
at which we were falling out
of this state on this planet

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:30.570 align:middle line:84%
where the average person had
the potential, the capability,

00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:34.730 align:middle line:84%
to be in a very high
state of awareness.

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And they were a far more
enlightened and benevolent

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:40.370 align:middle line:84%
society than we would be
able to even imagine now.

00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:44.080 align:middle line:84%
But they were beginning to lose
that almost divine state that

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:46.070 align:middle line:90%
exists in the golden age.

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And as they started to
descend into the silver age,

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:53.960 align:middle line:84%
there began to be more of an
emphasis on what we would now

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:56.570 align:middle line:84%
refer to as sacred sites
and sacred structures.

00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:59.840 align:middle line:90%


00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:02.220 align:middle line:10%
>>You could almost
think of it as machines

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:08.730 align:middle line:10%
to enhance consciousness, or
to create an environment where,

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:11.710 align:middle line:10%
you might call it altered
states of experience,

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:16.580 align:middle line:10%
but changes in consciousness,
expansion of consciousness.

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:18.870 align:middle line:84%
>>What these were
really intended to do,

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:21.830 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't so much for
the selfish purpose of,

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:25.340 align:middle line:84%
for example, boosting
up a few individuals.

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:30.840 align:middle line:84%
This actually had to do with a
much larger global perspective.

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:33.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's, effectively,
what the Great Pyramid was.

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:37.450 align:middle line:84%
It was, basically, a device,
a generator for, if you will,

00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:40.500 align:middle line:84%
broadcasting and transmitting
throughout the planetary

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:45.265 align:middle line:84%
structure a type of field which
uplifted the entire humanity.

00:30:45.265 --> 00:30:50.340 align:middle line:90%


00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:52.100 align:middle line:84%
For at least 1,000
years this structure

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:54.860 align:middle line:90%
performed beautifully.

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:56.890 align:middle line:84%
My guess is that it
probably did a lot

00:30:56.890 --> 00:31:00.308 align:middle line:84%
to help offset the fall
into the dark ages.

00:31:00.308 --> 00:31:03.116 align:middle line:90%


00:31:03.116 --> 00:31:04.615 align:middle line:84%
And I think what
the pyramids did

00:31:04.615 --> 00:31:06.990 align:middle line:84%
is that for those individuals
that were at least somewhat

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:09.380 align:middle line:84%
receptive, it just kind of
kept that energy polarized

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:12.530 align:middle line:90%
into the higher centers.

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:13.570 align:middle line:90%
>>This is very real.

00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:14.930 align:middle line:90%
I think this is very important.

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:20.240 align:middle line:84%
It's like a great art, or
great spiritual insight,

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.360 align:middle line:90%
expansion of consciousness.

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:25.210 align:middle line:84%
In a way, there's nothing
more important than that.

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:28.460 align:middle line:90%


00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:30.510 align:middle line:84%
>>It couldn't do it
forever because eventually

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:32.110 align:middle line:84%
mother nature is
going to win out.

00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And this cycle is
part of nature.

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:38.010 align:middle line:84%
It's as much a part of the
natural world as day and night

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:38.520 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:43.180 align:middle line:84%
We have the ability to grasp
those electromagnetic forces

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:45.910 align:middle line:84%
and the more fundamental
forces that underlie those to,

00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:51.380 align:middle line:84%
basically, prop up humanity
for a while using the system.

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:54.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, the pyramids only
have a very direct effect

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:57.215 align:middle line:84%
if you're close to them, which
is the way it is in this age.

00:31:57.215 --> 00:31:58.980 align:middle line:84%
If we go stand in
the pyramid, we

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:00.856 align:middle line:90%
might feel an effect like that.

00:32:00.856 --> 00:32:03.064 align:middle line:84%
But, I suspect,
thousands of years

00:32:03.064 --> 00:32:04.480 align:middle line:84%
ago you didn't
have to be near it.

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:07.763 align:middle line:84%
I think it was probably
a global effect.

00:32:07.763 --> 00:32:12.020 align:middle line:90%


00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:15.800 align:middle line:84%
>>The physical structure
could only do so much.

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:19.100 align:middle line:84%
The wisdom keepers
created social structures

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:21.470 align:middle line:84%
as an additional
influence to extend

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:26.200 align:middle line:84%
the energy of the golden age by
creating mystery schools that

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:28.090 align:middle line:90%
preserved the ancient knowledge.

00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:31.024 align:middle line:84%
>>The whole idea of
the schools of mystery,

00:32:31.024 --> 00:32:33.440 align:middle line:84%
and the ancient knowledge, and
preserving those traditions

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:37.195 align:middle line:84%
that had come down from those
fabulous ages, that was lost.

00:32:37.195 --> 00:32:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And then, eventually,
it was ridiculed,

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:40.890 align:middle line:84%
and then finally, it
had to go underground

00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:44.450 align:middle line:84%
because people would either
actively burn those texts

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:48.260 align:middle line:84%
or persecute the people
who had that belief system.

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And I think, at that point,
we were in the dark ages.

00:32:52.100 --> 00:33:16.100 align:middle line:90%


00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:20.450 align:middle line:84%
>>The exact end of the cycle
of darkness is approaching.

00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:24.660 align:middle line:84%
Each winter solstice
before 2012, our sun

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:29.350 align:middle line:84%
comes into close alignment
with the galactic center.

00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:32.240 align:middle line:84%
This means we are beginning
to feel the shift of energy

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:35.990 align:middle line:84%
already, even though
the exact conjunction is

00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:41.800 align:middle line:90%
December the 21st, 2012.

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:44.410 align:middle line:10%
>>So all signs point
to the interpretation

00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:49.450 align:middle line:10%
that we are deep into the
period of increasing darkness.

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:55.100 align:middle line:84%
What happens at the end of that
downward trend is a turnabout.

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that that's where
we are right now in history.

00:33:58.650 --> 00:34:01.300 align:middle line:84%
The Mayan material
for 2012 basically

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:04.090 align:middle line:84%
indicates this turnabout
point, this point

00:34:04.090 --> 00:34:07.280 align:middle line:90%
of maximized spiritual darkness.

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:11.040 align:middle line:84%
But then, in the cycles of
time, we turn the corner,

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.969 align:middle line:84%
and we have an
opportunity to open up

00:34:12.969 --> 00:34:14.580 align:middle line:84%
to the transformational
energies that

00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:16.470 align:middle line:84%
can sweep us into
the next cycle.

00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:20.280 align:middle line:90%


00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:23.070 align:middle line:10%
>>I hope that the
Mayan ancestors trying

00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:25.120 align:middle line:10%
to interpret the few
writings that are left

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:27.449 align:middle line:10%
are correct, that
it means there's

00:34:27.449 --> 00:34:29.699 align:middle line:10%
going to be some quickening,
or something like that,

00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:33.719 align:middle line:10%
because that would
actually go with our latest

00:34:33.719 --> 00:34:35.480 align:middle line:10%
understanding of the Yugas.

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:38.965 align:middle line:84%
What a Yuga cycle really is is
one precession of the equinox.

00:34:38.965 --> 00:34:41.770 align:middle line:90%


00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:45.230 align:middle line:10%
Using these later
scholars' interpretation,

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:47.699 align:middle line:10%
we're actually in
the very early stages

00:34:47.699 --> 00:34:49.550 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness accelerating.

00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:53.330 align:middle line:90%


00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:56.650 align:middle line:84%
>>It has to do with
the opportunity

00:34:56.650 --> 00:35:00.236 align:middle line:84%
that we have to open up
to the divine wisdom,

00:35:00.236 --> 00:35:01.610 align:middle line:84%
to the transformational
energies.

00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:04.930 align:middle line:90%


00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:07.090 align:middle line:84%
But it always comes
down to free will.

00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:09.350 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is predetermined.

00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:11.590 align:middle line:84%
It always comes down
to a choice that we all

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:16.750 align:middle line:84%
have to close down
in fear, succumb

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:20.450 align:middle line:84%
to fear, close down, become more
limited in our consciousness,

00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:25.580 align:middle line:84%
or open up, open up to the
blessing of the connection

00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:28.040 align:middle line:84%
to the higher wisdom
that is symbolized

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:31.150 align:middle line:84%
in the Maya tradition by the
galactic center, the womb

00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:34.045 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Mother, that
which can transform and renew.

00:35:34.045 --> 00:36:01.690 align:middle line:90%


00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:03.585 align:middle line:84%
>>Could the ancients
have had it right?

00:36:03.585 --> 00:36:06.260 align:middle line:90%


00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:08.400 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps we should
consider that we, too,

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:11.532 align:middle line:10%
can return to high
levels of consciousness,

00:36:11.532 --> 00:36:14.623 align:middle line:10%
heightened perception,
and inspired creativity.

00:36:14.623 --> 00:36:19.330 align:middle line:90%


00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:22.400 align:middle line:84%
It would serve us
well to embrace nature

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:24.563 align:middle line:84%
and to protect the
planet's environment.

00:36:24.563 --> 00:36:34.740 align:middle line:90%


00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:38.810 align:middle line:84%
Can we go beyond religious
dogma and allow ourselves

00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:41.059 align:middle line:84%
to imagine what
lies beyond death?

00:36:41.059 --> 00:36:48.690 align:middle line:90%


00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:54.120 align:middle line:84%
How would humanity change if,
instead of material wealth,

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:56.675 align:middle line:84%
consciousness was
our highest value?

00:36:56.675 --> 00:37:06.820 align:middle line:90%


00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:09.910 align:middle line:84%
>>The ideas depicted
in "The Pyramid Code"

00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:14.780 align:middle line:84%
revolutionize accepted beliefs
about the purpose and the age

00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:17.920 align:middle line:90%
of the pyramids and the Sphinx.

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:21.480 align:middle line:84%
Clearly not tombs,
these ancient structures

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:24.440 align:middle line:84%
may have been used to
access and transmit

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:27.776 align:middle line:84%
a type of energy that
affects human consciousness.

00:37:27.776 --> 00:37:30.520 align:middle line:90%


00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:33.910 align:middle line:84%
We have seen concrete evidence
of high-level technology

00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:43.658 align:middle line:84%
with laser-cut crystals,
polished, black basalt floors,

00:37:43.658 --> 00:37:47.020 align:middle line:84%
and curious and
sophisticated instruments,

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:53.320 align:middle line:84%
including those that generated
energy from sound and light.

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:56.220 align:middle line:84%
Looking at the old
riverbed, it seems clear

00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:59.280 align:middle line:84%
that the Nile has
migrated over time,

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:01.770 align:middle line:84%
and that it once flowed to
the east of the pyramids.

00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:06.180 align:middle line:90%


00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:08.630 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Egyptians
built temples

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:11.790 align:middle line:84%
using sacred geometry
corresponding

00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:14.660 align:middle line:90%
to cavities in the human body.

00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:18.110 align:middle line:84%
They had a profound belief in
the significance of the stars

00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:21.100 align:middle line:84%
and how the patterns
of the constellations

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:26.580 align:middle line:84%
corresponded to our
place in the cosmos.

00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:29.930 align:middle line:84%
They understood
large cycles of time,

00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:33.960 align:middle line:84%
and they kept meticulous records
of the motion of the stars

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:36.250 align:middle line:90%
and planets.

00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:39.900 align:middle line:84%
The ancients had a deep
respect for the sacred feminine

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:43.240 align:middle line:84%
principle, and the
importance of balancing

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:47.570 align:middle line:84%
the sacred masculine
and the sacred feminine.

00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:50.850 align:middle line:84%
From pre-dynastic
to dynastic times,

00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:53.775 align:middle line:84%
the ancients maintained a
deep reverence for nature.

00:38:53.775 --> 00:38:56.670 align:middle line:90%


00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:59.276 align:middle line:84%
They were astonishingly
creative and artistic.

00:38:59.276 --> 00:39:03.160 align:middle line:90%


00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:06.160 align:middle line:84%
From clues left on
temple walls, it

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:09.527 align:middle line:84%
seems clear that our
Egyptian ancestors accessed

00:39:09.527 --> 00:39:10.860 align:middle line:90%
altered states of consciousness.

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:14.000 align:middle line:90%


00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.420 align:middle line:84%
Their primary
concerns were how we

00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:21.830 align:middle line:84%
arrived in our earthly bodies,
described in terms of biology,

00:39:21.830 --> 00:39:25.810 align:middle line:84%
and what happened when we left
our earthly bodies, described

00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:27.000 align:middle line:90%
in terms of cosmology.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:32.290 align:middle line:90%


00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:34.710 align:middle line:84%
Our ancestors left
clues embedded

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:37.480 align:middle line:84%
in symbols that had
multiple layers of meaning.

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:45.090 align:middle line:90%


00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:48.970 align:middle line:84%
They were empowered humans
using the full capacity

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:49.710 align:middle line:90%
of their senses.

00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:54.170 align:middle line:90%


00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:57.360 align:middle line:84%
Today, our planet is
in trouble politically,

00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:02.510 align:middle line:84%
economically,
environmentally, and morally.

00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Many will agree that corrupt
people hold places of power.

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:09.640 align:middle line:84%
Citizens are taxed
beyond reason,

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:14.660 align:middle line:84%
and riches are amassed by an
elite that controls the world.

00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:17.910 align:middle line:84%
With all this evidence of the
sophisticated science left

00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:22.260 align:middle line:84%
by the ancients, can we
still uphold the belief

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:25.080 align:middle line:84%
that we are the most
advanced society that

00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:27.173 align:middle line:84%
has ever existed
on planet Earth?

00:40:27.173 --> 00:40:33.330 align:middle line:90%


00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:36.490 align:middle line:84%
Is today's test-driven
education system effective?

00:40:36.490 --> 00:40:39.530 align:middle line:90%


00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:42.780 align:middle line:84%
Instead of rote
memorization of facts,

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:44.960 align:middle line:84%
what would happen if
today's youth were

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:47.450 align:middle line:84%
taught to expand their
capacity to know?

00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:52.090 align:middle line:90%


00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:55.610 align:middle line:84%
If we were taught to
seek truth and justice

00:40:55.610 --> 00:40:58.350 align:middle line:84%
living by the
ancient law of Ma'at,

00:40:58.350 --> 00:41:00.310 align:middle line:90%
how would our society change?

00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:05.070 align:middle line:90%


00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:07.890 align:middle line:84%
Taking our cue
from the ancients,

00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:12.592 align:middle line:84%
if we live in tune with nature,
in an atmosphere of creativity

00:41:12.592 --> 00:41:18.070 align:middle line:84%
and peace, and if we
connect to spirituality,

00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:21.665 align:middle line:84%
is this the answer to a
healthy future for humanity?

00:41:21.665 --> 00:41:25.370 align:middle line:90%


00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:27.990 align:middle line:84%
The ominous date of
December the 21st,

00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:31.290 align:middle line:90%
2012, is fast approaching.

00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:35.550 align:middle line:84%
Does this herald doomsday, or
could it be a powerful gateway

00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:38.780 align:middle line:84%
into new ways of
being and thinking?

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:41.770 align:middle line:84%
Are we turning the
corner and ascending out

00:41:41.770 --> 00:41:44.550 align:middle line:84%
of the age of
darkness to journey

00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:48.560 align:middle line:90%
toward a new golden age?

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:50.770 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
the ancients living

00:41:50.770 --> 00:41:53.400 align:middle line:84%
in a golden age in
the distant past

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:57.140 align:middle line:84%
were able to see into
future cycles of time?

00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:59.850 align:middle line:84%
Could they have
predicted that humanity

00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:04.200 align:middle line:84%
would plummet into the
depths of collective despair?

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:08.090 align:middle line:84%
Could they have predicted that
humans would be disempowered,

00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:11.810 align:middle line:84%
thus losing their
connection to spirituality.

00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:15.480 align:middle line:84%
Did they leave magnificent
structures skillfully aligned

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:19.250 align:middle line:84%
to the stars and
encoded with symbols

00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:23.220 align:middle line:84%
to act as a trigger
for us to wake up now?

00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:27.180 align:middle line:84%
It seems humanity is
at a crucial juncture

00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:30.154 align:middle line:90%
as we approach 2012.

00:42:30.154 --> 00:42:34.140 align:middle line:84%
Are we ready to walk
forward into a new future?

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:37.920 align:middle line:84%
Have we finally cracked
the pyramid code?

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:39.393 align:middle line:90%
>>Wake up.

00:42:39.393 --> 00:42:40.611 align:middle line:90%
We have it.

00:42:40.611 --> 00:42:41.110 align:middle line:90%
We got it.

00:42:41.110 --> 00:42:44.010 align:middle line:84%
Just know that we
have it, and it works.

00:42:44.010 --> 00:42:48.212 align:middle line:90%
