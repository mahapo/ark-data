00:00:05.291 --> 00:00:08.175 align:middle line:84%
>>The sheer beauty
and sophistication

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:11.744 align:middle line:84%
of Egyptian artifacts
entrances us.

00:00:11.744 --> 00:00:16.460 align:middle line:90%


00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.510 align:middle line:84%
How can we unlock
the code embedded

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.752 align:middle line:90%
in every object they made?

00:00:21.752 --> 00:00:26.720 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.510 align:middle line:84%
How does the symbolism
in Egyptian art

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.790 align:middle line:84%
illuminate their
cultural values?

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:37.260 align:middle line:90%


00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.285 align:middle line:84%
What ancient secrets still
lie hidden in plain sight?

00:00:43.285 --> 00:01:27.390 align:middle line:90%


00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.050 align:middle line:84%
Our understanding of ancient
Egyptian culture is limited.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.150 align:middle line:84%
Looking at the artifacts
left behind by the ancients,

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.380 align:middle line:84%
it is obvious that they had
different values, customs,

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.200 align:middle line:90%
and beliefs from ours today.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.370 align:middle line:84%
History books are filled
with stories of war,

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.960 align:middle line:84%
invasion of territories,
and patriarchal ways

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.370 align:middle line:90%
of being and thinking.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.390 align:middle line:84%
Yet it seems that
ancient Egypt enjoyed

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.230 align:middle line:84%
long periods of
peace and prosperity

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.950 align:middle line:84%
and a profound connection
with nature and spirit.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.870 align:middle line:10%
Is there a way to
understand the shift?

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.930 align:middle line:10%
>>So what we refer
to as history that

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.210 align:middle line:10%
began some 6,000
years ago was really

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.425 align:middle line:10%
the advent of a different
style of social organization

00:02:17.425 --> 00:02:20.700 align:middle line:10%
that's typified by
hierarchies of dominance,

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.510 align:middle line:10%
you know, warring deities,
warring mythologies,

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.470 align:middle line:10%
and control systems.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.490 align:middle line:90%


00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.100 align:middle line:10%
>>Vedic culture
from ancient India

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.580 align:middle line:10%
speaks of a grand and measurable
cycle of 26,000 years,

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.490 align:middle line:10%
consisting of ascending light
ages and descending dark ages.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.260 align:middle line:84%
>>In the higher ages,
you see this philosophy

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.300 align:middle line:90%
of living in tune with nature.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.830 align:middle line:10%
People talk about
speaking with the gods

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.020 align:middle line:10%
and a lot of interaction.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.660 align:middle line:10%
Virtually every ancient culture
has stories about the gods

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.600 align:middle line:10%
if you go back far enough.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.540 align:middle line:84%
And you see a lot of
matriarchal cultures

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.470 align:middle line:90%
if you go back far enough.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.180 align:middle line:84%
You know, the dark
age times, you

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.965 align:middle line:84%
have this very brutal,
paternalistic type of ruling.

00:03:15.965 --> 00:03:17.840 align:middle line:10%
>>I think it's difficult
for us to understand

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.830 align:middle line:10%
the ancient Egyptians
because we've

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.500 align:middle line:10%
got the paradigm of the
patriarchal structures

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.870 align:middle line:10%
on top of it, and
we're looking through

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.800 align:middle line:10%
our own cultural lenses.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.652 align:middle line:84%
>>Has world culture always been
male dominated and patriarchal?

00:03:33.652 --> 00:03:37.740 align:middle line:84%
If not, what would a
matriarchal system look like?

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.290 align:middle line:90%


00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.030 align:middle line:84%
Matriarchy is not the
opposite of patriarchy,

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.407 align:middle line:84%
with women dominating
and controlling men.

00:03:48.407 --> 00:03:53.210 align:middle line:84%
It is based on balance between
the masculine and feminine

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.960 align:middle line:90%
and harmony with nature.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.920 align:middle line:84%
This was exemplified
in ancient Egypt, which

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.436 align:middle line:84%
was known in the old language
as the land of Khent.

00:04:03.436 --> 00:04:09.280 align:middle line:90%


00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Hakim Awyan received teachings
about the Khenesian people

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.610 align:middle line:90%
in the distant past.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:21.096 align:middle line:10%
>>The ancient life
system in Asia

00:04:21.096 --> 00:04:24.320 align:middle line:10%
came, the commission
tradition being passed down

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.640 align:middle line:10%
through the mother.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.230 align:middle line:10%
Mother is the teacher.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.700 align:middle line:10%
Not the father, like
patriarchy system.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.840 align:middle line:90%
This is matriarchy.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.354 align:middle line:90%
She is the goddess.

00:04:34.354 --> 00:04:36.789 align:middle line:90%
She is everything in the house.

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:41.180 align:middle line:90%


00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.970 align:middle line:84%
>>Based on the
countless artifacts

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.350 align:middle line:84%
that show the high
status of the feminine,

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.730 align:middle line:84%
it seems that women
have the same status

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.870 align:middle line:90%
as men, if not a higher status.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.300 align:middle line:84%
>>In the museum,
you have statues.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.770 align:middle line:84%
You notice that the
woman put the arm

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.885 align:middle line:90%
around the man's shoulder.

00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:05.060 align:middle line:90%
And that shows are they equal?

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.220 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.855 align:middle line:84%
Woman was the upper
head in the family.

00:05:08.855 --> 00:05:12.560 align:middle line:84%
When she put her arm around the
man's shoulder, she's saying,

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.420 align:middle line:90%
this is mine.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:21.620 align:middle line:84%
You also see that the
sculpture in the old days

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.400 align:middle line:84%
put the feminine
wig on a man's head

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.740 align:middle line:84%
when he promoted more
to a woman than a man.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.870 align:middle line:84%
>>Men's wigs were layered in
different lengths, like steps.

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.280 align:middle line:84%
Women's wigs were parted in
the middle, smooth, and all one

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.750 align:middle line:90%
length.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.250 align:middle line:84%
When a man wore a woman's
wig, it was an indication

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.300 align:middle line:90%
that he had high status.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>>Only men with wisdom
would wear the women's wig.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.065 align:middle line:84%
So these are the scribes,
and the physicians,

00:05:53.065 --> 00:05:56.390 align:middle line:90%
and the rest of them.

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>>What you can do is go
back into the Old Kingdom.

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.180 align:middle line:10%
And what you find is obviously
a fair amount of equality,

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.370 align:middle line:10%
where the goddesses are revered
as reverently as the gods.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.270 align:middle line:10%
And there's even the
instance, for example,

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:15.800 align:middle line:10%
of Hathor, the exception in
that she's the only deity that

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.320 align:middle line:10%
has a temple column
all to herself,

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.510 align:middle line:10%
So the great mother, the
great feminine principle,

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:23.750 align:middle line:10%
occupies a very
important part in

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.620 align:middle line:10%
the whole Egyptian symbology,
the whole Egyptian doctrine.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.540 align:middle line:84%
There's absolutely
no doubt about that.

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.860 align:middle line:84%
Women could own property, had
as much rights as the men.

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.052 align:middle line:84%
They could divorce
as easily as the men.

00:06:37.052 --> 00:06:40.510 align:middle line:84%
Of all the known
sophisticated civilizations

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:44.240 align:middle line:84%
that we have access to, probably
women were better off in Egypt

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.770 align:middle line:90%
than they were anywhere else.

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.870 align:middle line:84%
>>Perhaps we are
looking at ancient Egypt

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.180 align:middle line:90%
from a patriarchal viewpoint.

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.680 align:middle line:10%
We should let the
symbolism and the artifacts

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.260 align:middle line:10%
tell their own story.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.950 align:middle line:10%
The frescoes we see
lining temple walls

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:05.230 align:middle line:10%
in Egypt and on stone slabs in
museums around the world each

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:07.650 align:middle line:10%
tell their own story.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:11.280 align:middle line:84%
We see the same images
repeated again and again

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.840 align:middle line:90%
in Egyptian art.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.790 align:middle line:10%
By learning to
decode these symbols,

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:19.330 align:middle line:10%
we can look back in
time, peeling back

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.240 align:middle line:10%
the layers of
patriarchy that cloud

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.850 align:middle line:10%
our understanding
of ancient history.

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:28.440 align:middle line:84%
Then, we can begin to
decipher the messages

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.346 align:middle line:90%
that the ancients left us.

00:07:30.346 --> 00:07:34.730 align:middle line:90%


00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:39.705 align:middle line:84%
>>You have to accept that we're
dealing with a period that

00:07:39.705 --> 00:07:42.934 align:middle line:84%
occurred at least
5,000 years ago.

00:07:42.934 --> 00:07:45.070 align:middle line:10%
And the little we
know of it comes

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:49.630 align:middle line:10%
from archaic texts
that were written

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:52.176 align:middle line:10%
in a very occult
and esoteric manner.

00:07:52.176 --> 00:07:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And they weren't
meant for you and me.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.070 align:middle line:84%
>>The secrets of the
ancient Egyptians

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:00.564 align:middle line:90%
were not for the commoners.

00:08:00.564 --> 00:08:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>>But for a very,
very small group

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.500 align:middle line:84%
of elites who had to be
initiated over many, many years

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:10.080 align:middle line:84%
to appreciate what
these texts said.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.440 align:middle line:84%
>>They were for the
high-level initiates,

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.350 align:middle line:84%
which were people
who were trained.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And they would go through
different initiations, tests

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:21.045 align:middle line:84%
that would help
them be wise, that

00:08:21.045 --> 00:08:24.720 align:middle line:84%
would help them confront their
fears, that would balance them,

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.090 align:middle line:84%
balance them in the
body, mind, and emotions.

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:30.090 align:middle line:84%
>>Initiates were
students who were

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:32.900 align:middle line:84%
given rudimentary
instruction on the mystery

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:39.030 align:middle line:84%
traditions of Mayan and
Egyptian cosmic cycles.

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:41.400 align:middle line:84%
>>As they approached higher
levels of consciousness,

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:45.180 align:middle line:84%
they came to respect different
aspects of themselves that

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.250 align:middle line:84%
were represented in the
feminine and the masculine.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:50.140 align:middle line:84%
But they went
further and called it

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.590 align:middle line:84%
sacred feminine and
sacred masculine, which

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:56.970 align:middle line:84%
meant the purest form that was
actually connected to the two

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.075 align:middle line:90%
hemispheres of the brain.

00:08:58.075 --> 00:09:01.010 align:middle line:90%


00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:03.150 align:middle line:84%
>>Feminine consciousness
corresponds

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.390 align:middle line:84%
to the right
hemisphere of the brain

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:08.100 align:middle line:90%
and the left side of the body.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.120 align:middle line:84%
In contrast, masculine
consciousness

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.880 align:middle line:84%
corresponds to the
left side of the brain

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.690 align:middle line:90%
and the right side of the body.

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:18.960 align:middle line:84%
Patriarchal
consciousness focuses

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:26.810 align:middle line:84%
on history, linear time, dogma,
rationality, waking reality,

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:29.130 align:middle line:90%
and science.

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:31.950 align:middle line:84%
Matriarchal
consciousness focuses

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:41.019 align:middle line:84%
on eternity, cycles of time,
ritual, magic, altered states,

00:09:41.019 --> 00:09:43.490 align:middle line:90%
and art.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:46.720 align:middle line:84%
If we examine the art,
we can see the characters

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:51.150 align:middle line:84%
almost always have one
foot slightly forward.

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:54.470 align:middle line:84%
In some instances, they
take a big step forward.

00:09:54.470 --> 00:10:00.240 align:middle line:84%
In each scene, the goddess has
her left foot slightly leading,

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.580 align:middle line:84%
showing awareness of
the feminine principles

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:05.900 align:middle line:90%
of timelessness and magic.

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:11.180 align:middle line:84%
The pharaoh, however, takes a
large step with his right foot.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.470 align:middle line:84%
This shows that he is
grounded in the masculine.

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:16.150 align:middle line:90%


00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:22.050 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, we often see
images with two left hands.

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:26.390 align:middle line:84%
It has been suggested that this
is just a stylistic convention.

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:31.160 align:middle line:84%
But we should not impose
our ideas on Egyptian art.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:37.140 align:middle line:84%
Left hands suggest giving, while
right hands suggest taking.

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:40.750 align:middle line:10%
>>In our culture, we've
practically erased the feminine

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:43.030 align:middle line:10%
in favor of the masculine,
reading, writing,

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:44.250 align:middle line:10%
and arithmetic.

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:46.670 align:middle line:10%
Art, music isn't as important.

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And our society is completely
unbalanced because of it.

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:54.530 align:middle line:84%
The ancients knew
that you could not

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:56.460 align:middle line:84%
achieve high states
of consciousness

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:58.380 align:middle line:90%
without these being in balance.

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And so they revered the
pure qualities of either.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.420 align:middle line:10%
And so when we say sacred
feminine and sacred masculine,

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:09.030 align:middle line:10%
this was the highest
form of respect

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:12.600 align:middle line:10%
so that the female would have
both feminine and masculine

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.050 align:middle line:10%
balanced within
her, and the male

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:20.040 align:middle line:10%
would have both feminine and
masculine balanced within him.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.420 align:middle line:84%
>>Balance between
the sacred feminine

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:26.340 align:middle line:84%
and the sacred masculine runs
deep in Egyptian symbolism.

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.970 align:middle line:90%


00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:33.720 align:middle line:84%
We see gods and goddesses
carrying a crook, a flail,

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.970 align:middle line:84%
and a staff in
various combinations.

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:41.716 align:middle line:84%
The crook represents the
balance of the emotions.

00:11:41.716 --> 00:11:45.410 align:middle line:84%
The flail symbolizes
the balance of the mind.

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:50.370 align:middle line:84%
And the staff depicts
the balance of the body.

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:53.950 align:middle line:84%
Once balance of the body,
the mind, and the emotions

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:57.988 align:middle line:84%
was achieved, consciousness
could develop.

00:11:57.988 --> 00:12:01.290 align:middle line:84%
Notice the staff
always has the head

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:05.920 align:middle line:90%
of a bird and a forked base.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.120 align:middle line:84%
The staff never
touches the ground.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:12.720 align:middle line:10%
This indicates that we are
spiritual beings having

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:15.520 align:middle line:10%
an Earth experience.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.330 align:middle line:84%
We are incarnated
here, but our souls

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:20.495 align:middle line:90%
can go beyond the Earthly plane.

00:12:20.495 --> 00:12:25.660 align:middle line:90%


00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:31.062 align:middle line:84%
Egyptian temples were places
where spiritual work was done.

00:12:31.062 --> 00:12:35.300 align:middle line:84%
An arch with a winged disk is
always found at the entrance

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:35.800 align:middle line:90%
to temples.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.040 align:middle line:90%


00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:43.800 align:middle line:84%
The winged disk depicts
a vulture and a snake.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.685 align:middle line:84%
>>Snake been taken as
a symbol of masculine,

00:12:46.685 --> 00:12:50.145 align:middle line:90%
and the vulture is feminine.

00:12:50.145 --> 00:12:54.620 align:middle line:84%
>>The feminine and the
masculine had to be in balance.

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:58.580 align:middle line:84%
The lower self was to
surrender to the higher self

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:02.200 align:middle line:84%
in order to enter
the sacred space.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:06.080 align:middle line:84%
This meant that the ego
of the everyday world

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:09.730 align:middle line:84%
had to step aside while
the higher self connected

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:11.280 align:middle line:90%
with cosmic energy.

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.750 align:middle line:90%
>>Vulture can fly.

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:14.240 align:middle line:90%
Snake can't fly.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.730 align:middle line:10%
But both have the same glands.

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:20.220 align:middle line:90%


00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:25.850 align:middle line:84%
System of life is
based on glands.

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:29.060 align:middle line:84%
>>The glands were the
most important features

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:30.930 align:middle line:90%
of the human being.

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>>One of the most misunderstood
functions of the human body

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:38.660 align:middle line:84%
today is our glandular
or endocrine system.

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:42.680 align:middle line:84%
Glands secrete hormones
that trigger reproduction.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:46.600 align:middle line:84%
Fertility and procreation
had high value

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.670 align:middle line:90%
in Egyptian ideology.

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:51.202 align:middle line:84%
>>The ancients were
very much in tune

00:13:51.202 --> 00:13:53.520 align:middle line:84%
with how the energy
systems in the body,

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:57.395 align:middle line:84%
or the chakras as the East
Indians would talk about them,

00:13:57.395 --> 00:13:59.720 align:middle line:90%
were connected to the glands.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.950 align:middle line:84%
>>Ancient teachings speak
of seven energy centers

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:06.100 align:middle line:90%
in the body called chakras.

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:09.640 align:middle line:84%
Parallels occur between
the concepts of chakras,

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:13.960 align:middle line:84%
or energy centers in the
body, and our glands.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:17.570 align:middle line:84%
It appears they are two ways
of describing the same thing,

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:21.520 align:middle line:84%
through spirituality
and through science.

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:24.960 align:middle line:84%
Ancient Egyptians had a
holistic understanding

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:28.760 align:middle line:84%
of the significance of the
glands and their central role

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.820 align:middle line:84%
in reproduction and
in consciousness.

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:35.890 align:middle line:84%
If we can decode
the symbols, we see

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:38.440 align:middle line:84%
that the sacredness
of procreation

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:43.420 align:middle line:84%
is readily visible in
ancient Egyptian art.

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:47.370 align:middle line:84%
>>When you see a
boy or a man, you

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:52.070 align:middle line:84%
see a kind of a
bottle on his head.

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:57.380 align:middle line:84%
That is not a bottle,
or not a white crown

00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:01.680 align:middle line:84%
symbolizing Upper Egypt, as my
colleagues and scholars say.

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:02.390 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:06.580 align:middle line:84%
This is a gland in
the human body known

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:10.420 align:middle line:84%
as the thymus, located
behind the lungs.

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>>The thymus is most active
when a baby is in utero.

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:19.080 align:middle line:84%
It continues to be
active until puberty.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:22.480 align:middle line:84%
Then it begins to
shrink and is atrophied

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.790 align:middle line:90%
when we stop being fertile.

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:29.273 align:middle line:84%
It was a critical
activator of consciousness.

00:15:29.273 --> 00:15:31.998 align:middle line:90%
>>The crown is another.

00:15:31.998 --> 00:15:36.083 align:middle line:90%
It's the womb, the placenta.

00:15:36.083 --> 00:15:41.490 align:middle line:84%
The thymus and the
womb are connected

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:45.120 align:middle line:90%
for the cycle of life.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:48.280 align:middle line:84%
When you see the double
crown, the red crown

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.555 align:middle line:90%
is the womb and the placenta.

00:15:50.555 --> 00:15:53.275 align:middle line:84%
The white crown
is the thymus, who

00:15:53.275 --> 00:15:57.530 align:middle line:90%
has its influence on the womb.

00:15:57.530 --> 00:16:01.200 align:middle line:84%
That's the symbol of
one of the glands.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:05.100 align:middle line:84%
>>In the early 1900s,
alchemist Schwaller de Lubicz

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:09.326 align:middle line:84%
presented a work called
The Temple of Man.

00:16:09.326 --> 00:16:13.120 align:middle line:84%
It demonstrated that the
architects of the Luxor Temple

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:16.420 align:middle line:84%
used sacred geometry,
which reflected

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:20.040 align:middle line:84%
the exact proportions
of the human body.

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:24.350 align:middle line:84%
As in all Egyptian temples,
the most sacred space

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:28.830 align:middle line:84%
was located at the back of the
temple, the Holy of Holies,

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:31.976 align:middle line:84%
which corresponded
to the pineal gland.

00:16:31.976 --> 00:16:35.430 align:middle line:84%
When activated,
the pineal gland is

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:37.910 align:middle line:84%
said to stimulate the
evolution of higher

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:39.616 align:middle line:90%
states of consciousness.

00:16:39.616 --> 00:16:43.532 align:middle line:84%
If the temples were
metaphors of the human body,

00:16:43.532 --> 00:16:48.405 align:middle line:84%
the pineal gland corresponded
with the Holy of Holies.

00:16:48.405 --> 00:16:51.900 align:middle line:84%
At the entrance to the most
sacred part of the temple

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:57.440 align:middle line:84%
stand tall pillars representing
the masculine and the feminine,

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:02.060 align:middle line:90%
papyrus and the blue lotus.

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:05.500 align:middle line:84%
The papyrus and the
lotus reflect the balance

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:09.420 align:middle line:84%
between the feminine and
the masculine principles

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:11.730 align:middle line:84%
and are shown
together throughout

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:13.145 align:middle line:90%
ancient Egyptian art.

00:17:13.145 --> 00:17:16.634 align:middle line:90%


00:17:16.634 --> 00:17:22.020 align:middle line:84%
>>The blue lotus is
a symbol of life,

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:27.611 align:middle line:84%
and this plant, blossom,
flower, it grows in the water,

00:17:27.611 --> 00:17:29.180 align:middle line:90%
like water lilies.

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:31.460 align:middle line:84%
It's where the
ancient commissions

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:37.460 align:middle line:84%
believe that life starts in
water and in that lotus form.

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:40.970 align:middle line:84%
>>We have seen there are always
multiple layers of meaning

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:43.560 align:middle line:84%
embedded in ancient
Egyptian symbols.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:47.262 align:middle line:84%
Is there another reason why
the blue lotus was so important

00:17:47.262 --> 00:17:48.220 align:middle line:90%
in Egyptian ceremonies?

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:54.210 align:middle line:90%


00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:58.070 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Egyptian art,
we see countless instances

00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:01.980 align:middle line:84%
of part animal,
part human forms.

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:07.010 align:middle line:84%
What were the ancients trying to
convey by these curious images?

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>>There's a technical
term for such creatures

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:09.900 align:middle line:90%
that anthropologists use.

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:11.172 align:middle line:90%
They call them therianthropes.

00:18:11.172 --> 00:18:13.810 align:middle line:10%
And that's from the
Greek, therian, which

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:16.953 align:middle line:10%
means wild beast, and
anthropos, which means man.

00:18:16.953 --> 00:18:20.390 align:middle line:10%
They are combinations
of beast and man.

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:23.230 align:middle line:84%
It's not an accident that
all of the gods of Egypt

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:24.540 align:middle line:90%
are therianthropic.

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:27.350 align:middle line:84%
They have, of course,
fully human forms.

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:29.780 align:middle line:84%
But in most cases,
they also have

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:31.840 align:middle line:84%
forms that are part
animal and part human.

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:35.534 align:middle line:84%
So you may consider
Horus, the head of a hawk

00:18:35.534 --> 00:18:37.438 align:middle line:90%
and the body of a man.

00:18:37.438 --> 00:18:41.590 align:middle line:84%
You may consider Sekhmet,
a lioness with a human body

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:44.020 align:middle line:90%
and a lion's head.

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:46.640 align:middle line:84%
Or Anubis, of course,
the guide of souls,

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:51.280 align:middle line:84%
who is part jackal
and part human.

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:53.060 align:middle line:84%
>>Egypt isn't the
only place where

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:57.000 align:middle line:84%
these half animal, half
human images have been found.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.390 align:middle line:84%
Half a world away, we
find clues to decode

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:02.380 align:middle line:90%
these mysterious symbols.

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:04.740 align:middle line:84%
>>Throughout the
Amazon today, shamans

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:08.920 align:middle line:84%
working with the powerful
visionary brew, ayahuasca,

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:12.990 align:middle line:84%
a combination of two
plants-- very frequently,

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:14.990 align:middle line:84%
they will, after
their visions, when

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:17.726 align:middle line:84%
they return to the normal,
alert, problem-solving state

00:19:17.726 --> 00:19:19.600 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, they
will actually sit down

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.970 align:middle line:84%
and, recollecting what they
saw in the visionary state,

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:26.480 align:middle line:84%
will paint and draw the
images that they saw.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And the most common motif
of these ayahuasca visions

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.790 align:middle line:84%
is the therianthrope,
creatures that

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:34.436 align:middle line:84%
are part animal and
part human in form.

00:19:34.436 --> 00:19:38.900 align:middle line:90%


00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:41.730 align:middle line:84%
This specific characteristic
of the ancient Egyptian gods

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:43.750 align:middle line:84%
is one of the
things that tells me

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:47.610 align:middle line:84%
that our ancient Egyptian
ancestors were using

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:49.910 align:middle line:84%
altered states of
consciousness to explore

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:50.970 align:middle line:90%
the realms of spirit.

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:54.980 align:middle line:90%


00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:58.630 align:middle line:84%
>>Again we see images
of blue lotuses.

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:02.940 align:middle line:84%
Is there another, less obvious
interpretation of this symbol?

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:04.440 align:middle line:84%
>>Altering of
consciousness has been

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.610 align:middle line:84%
done by a variety of different
methods and techniques,

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:10.460 align:middle line:84%
most commonly in
shamanistic cultures.

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:15.290 align:middle line:84%
Still to this day, it's done
by using hallucinogenic plants

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:17.540 align:middle line:84%
which, as it were,
switch the receiver

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:19.530 align:middle line:84%
wavelength of the
brain and allow us

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:22.850 align:middle line:90%
to tune in to other realities.

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:26.540 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there are a range
of non-drug techniques,

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:29.810 align:middle line:84%
rhythmic dancing,
certain kinds of music.

00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:35.270 align:middle line:84%
Certain kinds of spaces have an
effect on human consciousness.

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:36.770 align:middle line:84%
But there's a great
deal of evidence

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:39.632 align:middle line:84%
that they made use
of a potion involving

00:20:39.632 --> 00:20:43.270 align:middle line:84%
the blue lotus and
the mandrake root,

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:45.290 align:middle line:84%
possibly also the
opium poppy as well,

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:49.780 align:middle line:84%
to enter a visionary state,
and in that visionary state

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:56.340 align:middle line:84%
to explore, navigate, and
learn about the realm that

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:58.060 align:middle line:90%
lies beyond death.

00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:00.850 align:middle line:84%
And they had very concrete
and specific ideas

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:04.610 align:middle line:84%
about this, which are expressed
in the ancient Egyptian books

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:09.410 align:middle line:84%
of the dead, going right
back to pyramid texts.

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:11.165 align:middle line:84%
This was not a
work of imagination

00:21:11.165 --> 00:21:13.190 align:middle line:90%
on the part of the priests.

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:15.850 align:middle line:84%
This was a work of
documentation of

00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:19.340 align:middle line:84%
their out-of-body
exploration of realms

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:23.600 align:middle line:84%
that lie beyond the
merely physical.

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:29.530 align:middle line:84%
>>Is it possible for us to learn
to access other realms today?

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:34.530 align:middle line:84%
Can we expand our
capacity to perceive?

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:39.140 align:middle line:84%
Do we need new ways to
describe these phenomena?

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:42.926 align:middle line:84%
>>If I can say I
show you in my dream.

00:21:42.926 --> 00:21:45.130 align:middle line:90%
You can ask, what did you see?

00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:47.800 align:middle line:90%
Then I say the dream.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.430 align:middle line:90%
Now, did I saw you?

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:54.225 align:middle line:10%
The verb see is not there
because I did see you

00:21:54.225 --> 00:21:57.720 align:middle line:10%
in my dream, but not with my
eyes, because I was asleep.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:01.060 align:middle line:10%
So how did that happen?

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:07.420 align:middle line:84%
It must be a sense put all this
vision to me without my eyes.

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:11.950 align:middle line:84%
But I said when I speak,
limit vocabularities,

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:14.540 align:middle line:90%
to say I saw you in my dream.

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:21.180 align:middle line:84%
No, I didn't see you, but
there's no other way to say.

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:24.660 align:middle line:84%
>>Could the ancients have
mastered innate human abilities

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:25.863 align:middle line:90%
that we have forgotten?

00:22:25.863 --> 00:22:30.500 align:middle line:90%


00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:34.110 align:middle line:84%
>>You can tell if
that bird on the tree

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:39.368 align:middle line:84%
is happy or
frightened from a cat.

00:22:39.368 --> 00:22:40.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:44.900 align:middle line:84%
You can tell that the
donkey's annoyed or happy

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:46.440 align:middle line:90%
by the vibration and the sound.

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we want
us to notice, the sound.

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:53.330 align:middle line:90%
It's not the word you said.

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:56.670 align:middle line:90%
It's how being said.

00:22:56.670 --> 00:23:03.070 align:middle line:84%
You can tell if this vibration,
the truth or not truth.

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:04.540 align:middle line:90%
It's natural.

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:05.560 align:middle line:90%
It's healthy.

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:11.300 align:middle line:84%
People, they use all the senses,
the full capacity of senses.

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:14.010 align:middle line:84%
>>The five senses as
we know them today

00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:15.550 align:middle line:90%
were symbolized by the scarab.

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:18.170 align:middle line:90%


00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:21.420 align:middle line:84%
>>And when you see
the scarab, you

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:25.796 align:middle line:90%
are looking at a human skull.

00:23:25.796 --> 00:23:28.850 align:middle line:84%
It divides three
sides, three sections.

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:36.180 align:middle line:84%
The front head, symbolized
by ancient people as seven.

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:37.730 align:middle line:90%
Seven openings.

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:40.350 align:middle line:90%
Two, four, six, seven.

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:42.130 align:middle line:90%
That is the front head.

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:45.380 align:middle line:90%
And these are the receivers.

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:49.153 align:middle line:84%
You see with, you hear
with, you taste with.

00:23:49.153 --> 00:23:49.940 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:52.710 align:middle line:10%
On the left side is
the consciousness side,

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:57.120 align:middle line:10%
and that is the
daily deeds digested

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:00.820 align:middle line:10%
every moment you look at things.

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:04.550 align:middle line:84%
But the other side
is subconscious side,

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:08.940 align:middle line:84%
something you are unable
to explain what's going on.

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:11.130 align:middle line:84%
>>It seems clear
that the ancients

00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:14.470 align:middle line:84%
knew about the
subconscious mind.

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:18.470 align:middle line:84%
They had the power to reach
beyond the senses, something

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:21.670 align:middle line:84%
we began to be aware of
with the writings of Freud

00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:25.780 align:middle line:84%
and the advent of psychology
in the early 1900s.

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:29.705 align:middle line:84%
>>Don't compare people
of today like the people

00:24:29.705 --> 00:24:30.895 align:middle line:90%
of the ancient days.

00:24:30.895 --> 00:24:34.425 align:middle line:84%
The people of ancient
days were healthy,

00:24:34.425 --> 00:24:36.600 align:middle line:90%
they able to use their senses.

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:39.680 align:middle line:84%
We looking at things
as a crippled people.

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.080 align:middle line:90%
We only have five senses.

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:45.970 align:middle line:90%
We supposed to have 360 senses.

00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:47.998 align:middle line:90%
360.

00:24:47.998 --> 00:24:49.402 align:middle line:90%
And only five is recognized.

00:24:49.402 --> 00:24:52.680 align:middle line:90%


00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:55.480 align:middle line:84%
We've got the glands
of the senses.

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.660 align:middle line:90%
But we didn't use it.

00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:00.249 align:middle line:84%
And any muscles you
don't use, it shrink.

00:25:00.249 --> 00:25:00.749 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes.

00:25:00.749 --> 00:25:10.900 align:middle line:90%


00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:14.530 align:middle line:84%
>>How can we begin to
imagine that the ancients had

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:17.690 align:middle line:90%
the capacity of 360 senses?

00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:21.180 align:middle line:90%


00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:25.110 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps a metaphor for
the full spectrum senses

00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:27.550 align:middle line:90%
could be a sphere.

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:32.940 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible for us to move
beyond our five senses today?

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:37.100 align:middle line:84%
>>Our five familiar senses
have been evolved by evolution

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:41.590 align:middle line:84%
to connect us to the
physical and material realm.

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:46.930 align:middle line:10%
But we have, I like to think
of it as a secret doorway

00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:50.230 align:middle line:10%
inside our own minds,
which can be opened

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:53.300 align:middle line:10%
in altered states of
consciousness through which we

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:56.180 align:middle line:10%
may project our consciousness
into other realms

00:25:56.180 --> 00:26:00.746 align:middle line:10%
and dimensions, and those
then become accessible to us.

00:26:00.746 --> 00:26:03.170 align:middle line:84%
>>Could it be that
the ancient Egyptians

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:06.580 align:middle line:84%
were accessing supernatural
realms through heightened

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:12.285 align:middle line:84%
perceptions that came
from full spectrum senses?

00:26:12.285 --> 00:26:14.660 align:middle line:84%
>>I've come to the conclusion
that it's really impossible

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:19.060 align:middle line:84%
to understand ancient
Egyptian civilization

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:22.800 align:middle line:84%
and ancient Egyptian
spirituality and religion

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.340 align:middle line:84%
until you get to
grips with the fact

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:27.600 align:middle line:84%
that the priests
of that religion

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:31.310 align:middle line:84%
were deliberately,
and in a targeted way,

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:34.940 align:middle line:84%
cultivating altered
states of consciousness

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:38.980 align:middle line:84%
in order to access the
supernatural realm.

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:43.340 align:middle line:84%
They know what shamans all over
the world still know today,

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:47.280 align:middle line:84%
that in the alert,
problem-solving state

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:49.790 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness
that is particularly

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:53.120 align:middle line:84%
valued by Western
industrial society,

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:56.340 align:middle line:84%
you are not going to have
supernatural or spiritual

00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:59.760 align:middle line:90%
experiences of any kind.

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:02.330 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that the
supernatural and spirit

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:04.240 align:middle line:84%
realms are not there,
because they are.

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:07.230 align:middle line:84%
They are all around
us all the time.

00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:10.540 align:middle line:84%
But our senses cannot
tune into them.

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:12.470 align:middle line:84%
>>It seems that
the ancients must

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:15.580 align:middle line:84%
have been tuned into something
that allowed them to build

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:20.740 align:middle line:84%
sacred structures using
monumental architecture.

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:25.870 align:middle line:84%
Today, we consider ourselves
to be highly educated,

00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:29.010 align:middle line:84%
yet engineers are
at a loss when they

00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:31.363 align:middle line:84%
try to build even
a small pyramid.

00:27:31.363 --> 00:27:34.060 align:middle line:90%


00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:37.260 align:middle line:84%
Has our system of
education diverted us

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:41.070 align:middle line:84%
from what was common
knowledge in ancient times?

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:43.150 align:middle line:10%
>>There were no schools
and universities

00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:44.550 align:middle line:10%
like what we have today.

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:51.319 align:middle line:10%
We've been influenced by
this system of teaching.

00:27:51.319 --> 00:27:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Today, we think it's a primitive
life, that no education,

00:27:56.430 --> 00:28:00.270 align:middle line:84%
they haven't been to school, and
how can they build a pyramid.

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:01.860 align:middle line:90%
They don't know figures.

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:04.960 align:middle line:90%
How can they build this?

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:08.720 align:middle line:84%
But we don't know that
the senses we have

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:12.980 align:middle line:90%
make the impossible possible.

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:14.680 align:middle line:84%
The impossible to
us, which is based on

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:21.130 align:middle line:84%
ignorance make it
possible because knowing

00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:24.345 align:middle line:84%
is a very great
power, just to know.

00:28:24.345 --> 00:28:33.020 align:middle line:90%


00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:36.150 align:middle line:84%
>>The most important ceremony
for teaching the populace

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:40.330 align:middle line:84%
how to live well was the
weighing of the heart.

00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:42.580 align:middle line:84%
It reveals what the
ancients believed

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:46.540 align:middle line:84%
happened in the
moments after death.

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:50.200 align:middle line:84%
>>Initially in the ceremony
of the weighing of the hearts,

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:55.630 align:middle line:84%
the deceased would meet Anubis,
who would say, you're dead.

00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:57.010 align:middle line:90%
Let's have your heart.

00:28:57.010 --> 00:29:00.056 align:middle line:84%
We're going to weight it
against the feather of truth.

00:29:00.056 --> 00:29:03.540 align:middle line:84%
If your heart was heavy because
you had done something immoral,

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:06.040 align:middle line:84%
you weren't allowed to
go to the other side.

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:10.350 align:middle line:10%
So the populace learned that
they had to be light of heart

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:13.480 align:middle line:10%
in order to live well.

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:17.350 align:middle line:10%
>>As ancient Egypt slipped
into patriarchal ways of being

00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:23.470 align:middle line:10%
and thinking, the old spiritual
ideology became codified,

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:26.100 align:middle line:10%
and organized religion
became dominated

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:27.373 align:middle line:10%
by the Amun priesthood.

00:29:27.373 --> 00:29:31.700 align:middle line:90%


00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:35.830 align:middle line:84%
>>The Amun priesthood
had a lot of power.

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And they were in
a position to have

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:39.680 align:middle line:90%
people pay for their salvation.

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:41.760 align:middle line:84%
It used to be that
your heart was

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.040 align:middle line:84%
weighed against a
feather of truth.

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:46.100 align:middle line:84%
But in later pictures
of the ceremony

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:47.780 align:middle line:84%
of the weighing of
the heart, you'll

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:50.930 align:middle line:84%
see Horus holding
onto the scale.

00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:54.300 align:middle line:84%
And you could pay the
priesthood for shabti dolls.

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And the more of them you
had, the more likelihood

00:29:57.270 --> 00:30:00.110 align:middle line:84%
you could buy the
lightness of heart

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:01.877 align:middle line:90%
instead of being light of heart.

00:30:01.877 --> 00:30:04.619 align:middle line:90%


00:30:04.619 --> 00:30:07.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is a
fundamental change

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:09.890 align:middle line:90%
in terms of how to live well.

00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we still
are living in that way.

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:16.910 align:middle line:84%
>>History is written
by its victors.

00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And as the patriarchy
took hold, much effort

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:23.980 align:middle line:84%
was put into suppressing
Egypt's matriarchal past.

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:25.650 align:middle line:84%
>>There's a few
pharaohs who were

00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:29.290 align:middle line:90%
erased from the kings list.

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:31.650 align:middle line:84%
Hatshepsut was one,
Akhenaten was one,

00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:34.060 align:middle line:90%
and Tutankhamen was another.

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:37.890 align:middle line:84%
>>The legacy of the
controversial pharaoh Akhenaten

00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:41.620 align:middle line:84%
was almost lost forever with
the complete destruction

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:46.890 align:middle line:84%
of the city he and Nefertiti
had founded at Amarna.

00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:50.650 align:middle line:84%
>>Now, very little
was known about Amarna

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:55.060 align:middle line:84%
until there was an earthquake,
and the pylons at Karnak

00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:58.680 align:middle line:84%
were filled with these little
blocks that had been cut up.

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And they used them from
Amarna to just put--

00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:05.714 align:middle line:90%
as filler inside the pylons.

00:31:05.714 --> 00:31:08.130 align:middle line:84%
So when archaeologists found
them and started putting them

00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:10.610 align:middle line:84%
back together, they realized
there was a very large story

00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:11.109 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:31:11.109 --> 00:31:15.050 align:middle line:90%


00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:18.105 align:middle line:84%
>>For the ancients,
life on Earth

00:31:18.105 --> 00:31:22.380 align:middle line:84%
mirrored the motion of
the stars in the sky.

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:24.140 align:middle line:84%
>>What the ancients
did is they would

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:28.170 align:middle line:84%
have the capital be at
Heliopolis in the north,

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:31.050 align:middle line:90%
for 2,160 years.

00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:33.178 align:middle line:10%
And then they would
the capital be

00:31:33.178 --> 00:31:39.230 align:middle line:10%
at Thebes, which is now Karnak,
for that length of time.

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:42.365 align:middle line:10%
When Akhenaten came into
power in the New Kingdom

00:31:42.365 --> 00:31:45.910 align:middle line:10%
of the 18th Dynasty, it
was right at the time when

00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:49.270 align:middle line:10%
things were supposed to shift.

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:51.700 align:middle line:84%
>>During this time,
the patriarchy

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:55.720 align:middle line:84%
gained momentum, with the
Amun priesthood steadily

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:58.225 align:middle line:90%
becoming more powerful.

00:31:58.225 --> 00:31:59.600 align:middle line:10%
>>Akhenaten happened
to have been

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:05.550 align:middle line:10%
born at one of these points
of return or beginning.

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:08.436 align:middle line:84%
He believed that he was
subjugated, like all pharaohs,

00:32:08.436 --> 00:32:12.420 align:middle line:84%
to a cosmic law, to
the law of Ma'at.

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:14.580 align:middle line:84%
What happens up
there, they believed,

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:17.206 align:middle line:84%
was controlling
matters on Earth.

00:32:17.206 --> 00:32:21.510 align:middle line:84%
And things happened up there
that dictated to Akhenaten

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:26.045 align:middle line:90%
that he had to move his base.

00:32:26.045 --> 00:32:30.280 align:middle line:84%
And had to reinstall
the original rituals.

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:33.300 align:middle line:84%
>>When it came time for
Nefertiti and Akhenaten

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:37.765 align:middle line:84%
to change the capital, they knew
that the Amun priesthood was

00:32:37.765 --> 00:32:42.490 align:middle line:84%
in power, and that they would
really fight them on this.

00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>>If he had moved
Heliopolis, there

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:47.580 align:middle line:90%
would have been civil war.

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:50.360 align:middle line:84%
If he had stayed in
Karnak, he would have not

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:56.246 align:middle line:84%
performed what he had to perform
to follow the law, cosmic law.

00:32:56.246 --> 00:32:59.410 align:middle line:84%
He finally settles
for a mid-point.

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:03.020 align:middle line:84%
>>So instead of moving
the capital back north,

00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:06.110 align:middle line:84%
they decided to take a
point exactly in the middle,

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:07.386 align:middle line:90%
between the two.

00:33:07.386 --> 00:33:10.648 align:middle line:90%
And this was Amarna.

00:33:10.648 --> 00:33:14.060 align:middle line:84%
>>Art created by artisans
in the Amarna period

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:17.330 align:middle line:84%
is exquisite and
markedly different

00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:19.030 align:middle line:90%
from the art in other periods.

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:22.695 align:middle line:84%
For the first time,
Egyptian royal art

00:33:22.695 --> 00:33:25.052 align:middle line:84%
depicted the pharaoh
and his family

00:33:25.052 --> 00:33:30.170 align:middle line:84%
all together and clearly showing
affection for each other.

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:33.340 align:middle line:84%
>>They built this
wonderful place.

00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:36.746 align:middle line:90%
And they had gorgeous palaces.

00:33:36.746 --> 00:33:39.616 align:middle line:90%
And people were creative.

00:33:39.616 --> 00:33:40.835 align:middle line:90%
It was peaceful.

00:33:40.835 --> 00:33:43.300 align:middle line:90%
There were flowers and nature.

00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:45.355 align:middle line:84%
And people lived
a leisurely life.

00:33:45.355 --> 00:33:50.400 align:middle line:84%
But what it was was a
return to true spirituality.

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:53.172 align:middle line:84%
He ruled with his
coregent, Nefertiti.

00:33:53.172 --> 00:33:54.980 align:middle line:90%
The feminine was honored.

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:59.280 align:middle line:84%
>>In this transition,
Akhenaten and Nefertiti

00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:01.310 align:middle line:84%
rejected the
established religion

00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:03.670 align:middle line:90%
of the corrupt Amun priesthood.

00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:06.470 align:middle line:84%
They had a profound
respect for solar energy,

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:08.719 align:middle line:90%
known as the Aten.

00:34:08.719 --> 00:34:11.964 align:middle line:84%
>>And so returning to
this was a big threat

00:34:11.964 --> 00:34:13.639 align:middle line:90%
to the Amun priesthood.

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And so they plotted
to take Amarna down.

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:19.154 align:middle line:90%


00:34:19.154 --> 00:34:20.570 align:middle line:84%
>>They eventually
brought it down,

00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:22.790 align:middle line:90%
and they destroyed his city.

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:25.989 align:middle line:84%
And they reinstalled
the ancient gods,

00:34:25.989 --> 00:34:27.750 align:middle line:90%
with all their iconography.

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:29.690 align:middle line:10%
>>They simply
destroyed everything,

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:31.020 align:middle line:10%
every trace of them.

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:36.639 align:middle line:10%
If they didn't find the ruins
of Akhenaten's temples used

00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:39.409 align:middle line:10%
as fill, rubble fill,
in the walls of Karnak,

00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:44.425 align:middle line:10%
there'd be almost no
sign of Akhenaten.

00:34:44.425 --> 00:34:48.670 align:middle line:84%
>>Amarna was a peaceful
society with great creativity

00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:50.350 align:middle line:90%
and beauty.

00:34:50.350 --> 00:34:53.420 align:middle line:84%
Yet scholars in
traditional Egyptology

00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:56.989 align:middle line:84%
continue to portray
Pharaoh Akhenaten

00:34:56.989 --> 00:35:01.480 align:middle line:84%
as a deformed, renegade,
heretical leader.

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:04.166 align:middle line:84%
>>They see him as a heretical
king-- it's quite the opposite.

00:35:04.166 --> 00:35:06.100 align:middle line:90%
The heretics were the priests.

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:07.580 align:middle line:90%
He was not heretical.

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:11.120 align:middle line:84%
He, in fact, was somebody
who was determined

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:14.880 align:middle line:90%
to adhere to the divine laws.

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:19.830 align:middle line:90%
And he went to the cross for it.

00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:23.840 align:middle line:84%
>>After the fall of
Akhenaten, Tutankhaten,

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:26.750 align:middle line:84%
a boy of only nine years
old, became pharaoh.

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:29.470 align:middle line:90%


00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:33.660 align:middle line:84%
>>Now, because we found
Tutankhamen's tomb intact,

00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:37.835 align:middle line:84%
we know a lot about him
and the life that he lived.

00:35:37.835 --> 00:35:39.950 align:middle line:90%
Now, he was raised at Amarna.

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:43.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, some people say that
Akhenaten was his father.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.550 align:middle line:90%
We don't have DNA tests.

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:46.260 align:middle line:84%
We haven't found the
mummy of Akhenaten.

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:48.590 align:middle line:90%
We don't know that for sure.

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:53.400 align:middle line:84%
But it's interesting that he
started out as Tutankhaten,

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:57.276 align:middle line:84%
because at Amarna, they
worshipped the Aten.

00:35:57.276 --> 00:36:00.250 align:middle line:84%
But after he took the throne,
they opened the temples again.

00:36:00.250 --> 00:36:02.710 align:middle line:90%
They moved away from Amarna.

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:06.660 align:middle line:84%
It seems that as soon as the
Amun priesthood found out

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:10.230 align:middle line:84%
that he actually
was of the Aten,

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:14.186 align:middle line:84%
they changed his
name to Tutankhamen,

00:36:14.186 --> 00:36:16.790 align:middle line:90%
that suddenly he disappeared.

00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:21.270 align:middle line:84%
>>After 10 years of leadership,
when Tutankhamen was 19,

00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:23.870 align:middle line:90%
he died mysteriously.

00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:28.140 align:middle line:84%
His mummy was x-rayed,
revealing a fractured skull,

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:30.690 align:middle line:84%
suggesting a blow to
the back of the head.

00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:33.235 align:middle line:84%
>>It seems that he
was buried in a rush.

00:36:33.235 --> 00:36:37.440 align:middle line:84%
His tomb is very
small, and close to it,

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:38.840 align:middle line:84%
there were a whole
lot of mummies

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:43.100 align:middle line:84%
that were moved in a
cache and put aside.

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:45.410 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like there
were several mummies

00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:47.310 align:middle line:84%
from other dynasties
that were in the tomb

00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:48.525 align:middle line:90%
that he ended up in.

00:36:48.525 --> 00:36:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And then they took
furniture from Amarna

00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:53.580 align:middle line:90%
and buried him there.

00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:57.190 align:middle line:84%
>>Though the tomb of King
Tut left us many clues,

00:36:57.190 --> 00:37:00.610 align:middle line:90%
his fate remains a mystery.

00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:03.410 align:middle line:84%
Another casualty of the
patriarchal retelling

00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:07.120 align:middle line:84%
of history is the story
of Queen Hatshepsut.

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:10.330 align:middle line:84%
>>Hatshepsut came earlier
in the 18th Dynasty.

00:37:10.330 --> 00:37:13.810 align:middle line:84%
She started out
by being a queen.

00:37:13.810 --> 00:37:16.130 align:middle line:90%
And then she became pharaoh.

00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:19.640 align:middle line:84%
Hatshepsut was a wise
and powerful leader

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:23.470 align:middle line:84%
who reestablished trade
networks with Egypt's neighbors,

00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:26.120 align:middle line:84%
building the prosperity
of the 18th Dynasty.

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:34.041 align:middle line:90%


00:37:34.041 --> 00:37:35.790 align:middle line:84%
>>She was certainly
ruling for a long time

00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:38.980 align:middle line:84%
at a period of tremendous
peace and prosperity.

00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:42.662 align:middle line:84%
The artwork was never
better than under her reign.

00:37:42.662 --> 00:37:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>>Had she been male,
she would likely

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:47.050 align:middle line:84%
have been remembered
in history books

00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:50.570 align:middle line:90%
as the best ruler of Egypt.

00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:56.490 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of her success as a
leader, she is still an enigma.

00:37:56.490 --> 00:38:00.440 align:middle line:84%
There has been much
controversy about Hatshepsut.

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:02.720 align:middle line:84%
it could be due to
the patriarchy having

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:07.900 align:middle line:84%
little tolerance of images
of an empowered woman.

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:12.600 align:middle line:84%
No one seems to agree on
who the real Hatshepsut was.

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:16.140 align:middle line:84%
>>There have been massive
books written on Hatshepsut.

00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And again, there are
no real conclusions.

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:22.570 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, Hatshepsut must
have been a very able ruler

00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:25.200 align:middle line:84%
because she stayed there
apparently for 22 years.

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:29.930 align:middle line:84%
>>But somehow, about 20
years after she passed,

00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:32.924 align:middle line:84%
her statues were broken
and all put into a pit.

00:38:32.924 --> 00:38:34.340 align:middle line:84%
When they found
them, they started

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:35.464 align:middle line:90%
putting them back together.

00:38:35.464 --> 00:38:38.815 align:middle line:84%
But, like Akhenaten and
Nefertiti, the Amarna period,

00:38:38.815 --> 00:38:41.870 align:middle line:84%
they were largely forgotten
because the people who

00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:44.520 align:middle line:90%
came after were very threatened.

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:48.062 align:middle line:84%
And they somehow wanted
to destroy all trace.

00:38:48.062 --> 00:38:52.370 align:middle line:84%
Hatshepsut, Nefertiti and
Akhenaten, Tutankhamen, they

00:38:52.370 --> 00:38:54.460 align:middle line:84%
were the ones that really
understood spirituality

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:55.940 align:middle line:90%
in some way.

00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:57.710 align:middle line:84%
I suppose there
was no money to be

00:38:57.710 --> 00:39:01.335 align:middle line:84%
made if you weren't
selling salvation.

00:39:01.335 --> 00:39:04.650 align:middle line:90%


00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:07.820 align:middle line:84%
>>We may never know how the
high courts of ancient Egypt

00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:09.890 align:middle line:90%
were run.

00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:12.450 align:middle line:84%
It seems likely that
the stories passed down

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:14.590 align:middle line:84%
through the patriarchal
institutions

00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:20.780 align:middle line:84%
of the 19th and 20th
centuries may have misled us.

00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:24.420 align:middle line:84%
The peace and prosperity
of the 18th Dynasty,

00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:27.880 align:middle line:84%
particularly in the time
of Hatshepsut, Nefertiti,

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:32.320 align:middle line:84%
and Akhenaten, had to do
with honoring the feminine

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:35.210 align:middle line:90%
in balance with the masculine.

00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:38.570 align:middle line:84%
Looking at Egyptian
artifacts and frescoes,

00:39:38.570 --> 00:39:40.770 align:middle line:84%
it is clear that the
feminine principle

00:39:40.770 --> 00:39:43.640 align:middle line:84%
played a prominent
role in society

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:46.110 align:middle line:90%
and was cherished and revered.

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:48.740 align:middle line:84%
The feminine principle
was articulated

00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:51.240 align:middle line:84%
in the concept of
a great mother who

00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:54.650 align:middle line:84%
was central to the
ancient Egyptian worldview

00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:58.610 align:middle line:84%
and was echoed by
other world cultures.

00:39:58.610 --> 00:40:02.170 align:middle line:84%
>>The Milky Way in the sky is
mythologized in various ways,

00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:04.230 align:middle line:84%
in various traditions,
in various cultures

00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:05.370 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:09.000 align:middle line:10%
And it's often thought of,
almost universally thought

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.976 align:middle line:10%
of, as a great mother principle,
the great cosmic mother

00:40:12.976 --> 00:40:14.890 align:middle line:10%
in the sky.

00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:19.273 align:middle line:84%
>>In ancient Egypt,
biology meant cosmology,

00:40:19.273 --> 00:40:21.440 align:middle line:90%
and both were considered sacred.

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:24.240 align:middle line:90%


00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:26.980 align:middle line:10%
>>When you look at the
cosmology in terms of biology

00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:30.580 align:middle line:10%
as describing events that
happen inside of a womb.

00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:34.010 align:middle line:10%
And the womb happens to be the
womb of the mother goddess.

00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:37.610 align:middle line:84%
>>In both Mayan and
ancient Egyptian cosmology,

00:40:37.610 --> 00:40:43.340 align:middle line:84%
the center of the Milky Way
Galaxy is where stars are born.

00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:47.450 align:middle line:84%
Metaphorically, it is the womb
of the great cosmic mother,

00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:52.040 align:middle line:84%
represented as
Isis giving birth.

00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:55.920 align:middle line:84%
>>We keep looking at how the
ancient Egyptians thought.

00:40:55.920 --> 00:41:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And everything fed
biology and procreation.

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:04.110 align:middle line:84%
How we got here, how we came
into existence, biology.

00:41:04.110 --> 00:41:07.755 align:middle line:84%
And then how we left and how
our soul continues to live.

00:41:07.755 --> 00:41:10.980 align:middle line:84%
And we can see that there aren't
really that many symbols that

00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:14.980 align:middle line:84%
aren't pertaining to balance of
the body, mind, and emotions,

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:18.790 align:middle line:84%
and to balance between the
two hemispheres of the brain.

00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:20.550 align:middle line:84%
Once we can embrace
that, then it's

00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:22.920 align:middle line:84%
easier to understand
the Egyptians.

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:26.510 align:middle line:84%
>>That switch from
matriarchy to patriarchy,

00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:32.620 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the cause of what's
on the world now of conflicts

00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:38.556 align:middle line:84%
and disagreement and
showing of power.

00:41:38.556 --> 00:41:40.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:42.625 align:middle line:10%
>>Already, at the beginning
of the First Dynasty

00:41:42.625 --> 00:41:45.050 align:middle line:10%
of ancient Egypt,
Egypt was moving

00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:48.665 align:middle line:10%
from being matriarchal
to coming into more

00:41:48.665 --> 00:41:50.565 align:middle line:10%
patriarchal ways of
being and thinking.

00:41:50.565 --> 00:41:54.010 align:middle line:84%
There were a few periods where
the ancient, ancient knowledge

00:41:54.010 --> 00:41:54.820 align:middle line:90%
was remembered.

00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:56.660 align:middle line:84%
But it's important to
remember that there

00:41:56.660 --> 00:42:00.975 align:middle line:84%
was a lot of ancient Egypt
prior to the dynasties

00:42:00.975 --> 00:42:05.510 align:middle line:84%
and in the early periods that
did not represent those values.

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:09.610 align:middle line:84%
So the parts of Egypt that
I find the most interesting

00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:15.900 align:middle line:84%
come from the memory of
times that came further back.

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:18.640 align:middle line:84%
>>I've said many times
that healthy people,

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:22.590 align:middle line:84%
they got the power which
is-- unhealthy people

00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:23.500 align:middle line:90%
haven't got it.

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:25.920 align:middle line:84%
And I want you
and all my friends

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:29.610 align:middle line:84%
and all my beloved to
know that you have it.

00:42:29.610 --> 00:42:33.555 align:middle line:84%
And when you know that,
you will work on it

00:42:33.555 --> 00:42:36.460 align:middle line:90%
so it can bring you to stronger.

00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:41.730 align:middle line:84%
As I said before, the
senses, just like muscles.

00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:45.375 align:middle line:84%
If you don't use,
it shrink and go.

00:42:45.375 --> 00:44:34.734 align:middle line:90%
