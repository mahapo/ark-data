lot of people are awakening.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.710 align:middle line:10%
And as they're awakening,
energetically they're

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:14.640 align:middle line:10%
upgrading.

It's going to be
beyond my lifetime,

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.320 align:middle line:10%

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.810 align:middle line:10%

going to try to do

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.160 align:middle line:10%
tonight is establish for you
some circumstantial evidence

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.410 align:middle line:10%

culture was not only here,

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.770 align:middle line:10%
