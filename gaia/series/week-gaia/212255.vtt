spiritual practices unique when

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.050 align:middle line:84%
compared to other
practices of the time?

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:17.150 align:middle line:84%

the most sacred relics are

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.570 align:middle line:84%
in a place that is so guarded

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:24.950 align:middle line:90%
to ever see them.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.810 align:middle line:90%

the energy of the divine
feminine and the energy

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.320 align:middle line:10%
of the divine masculine, and
that we both embody that no

>> The area was
completely under water.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And when it receded,
a sacred place

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.720 align:middle line:84%
was left behind, where mountain
springs trickle and mermaids

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.140 align:middle line:84%
are believed to have
sought sanctuary.

bring this body, soul,

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.250 align:middle line:10%
and consciousness container into

where you lower EMFs enough

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.520 align:middle line:10%
that you feel good about your
exposures and you feel good

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.720 align:middle line:10%
about your health.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.240 align:middle line:10%

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.220 align:middle line:10%
the day where we get to
hold it in our hands,

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.240 align:middle line:10%
