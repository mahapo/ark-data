00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.039 align:middle line:84%
it has been said that sacred
geometry is the language

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:09.960 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.110 align:middle line:84%
Crystals, as perfected
geometric forms,

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.350 align:middle line:84%
are a prime example of
the underlying blueprint

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.380 align:middle line:90%
of balance, symmetry, and order.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.130 align:middle line:84%
This week on Gaia,
can the ways in which

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.500 align:middle line:84%
crystals are formed
by the Earth tell us

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.840 align:middle line:90%
what they are best used for?

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.835 align:middle line:84%
>>On "Open Minds"

00:00:29.835 --> 00:00:33.360 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAM HENRY: We're
all capable of suiting up

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.130 align:middle line:10%
here and transcending and
defeating these lower entities.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And in so doing, we become
higher beings ourselves.

>>JASON BADGETT: The way that
reality works is so much more

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.320 align:middle line:10%
interesting and intricate
than what, I think, most

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.260 align:middle line:10%
people would have imagined.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.650 align:middle line:90%
