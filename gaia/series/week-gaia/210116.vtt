>> This week on Gaia--

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.240 align:middle line:90%


00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Make a vow, a promise to
yourself right now that you

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.040 align:middle line:90%
will live a meaningful life.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.630 align:middle line:90%


00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.170 align:middle line:10%
This work is like taking
out the trash without having

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.260 align:middle line:10%
to go through it.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.600 align:middle line:90%
I know it's a big ask.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.920 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it together.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.840 align:middle line:90%
We'll have four components.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.148 align:middle line:10%
Movement, breathwork,
meditation, and affirmation.

00:00:32.148 --> 00:00:33.690 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we're going to
be uncomfortable.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.190 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it's going
to be challenging.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.640 align:middle line:84%
But can the challenges
not be seen as bad?

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.170 align:middle line:84%
The affirmation is there
is nothing wrong with me.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And look directly into
my eyes right now.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.630 align:middle line:90%
There is nothing wrong with you.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.210 align:middle line:84%
Once you realize that
you are innately good,

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.910 align:middle line:84%
the unwholesome,
destructive self habits

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.160 align:middle line:90%
will fall away immediately.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.900 align:middle line:84%
Practice like no
one is watching.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.885 align:middle line:84%
And if someone is watching,
give them a show, honey.

00:01:03.885 --> 00:01:08.670 align:middle line:90%


00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.350 align:middle line:90%
[VOCALIZING]

>> On "Open Minds with
Regina Meredith--"

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.680 align:middle line:10%
>> Anytime you feel a
strong emotion, anytime,

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.560 align:middle line:10%
always it opens up portals.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.530 align:middle line:84%
>> On "Beyond Belief
with George Noory--"

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Our activities determine
how the palm looks.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.420 align:middle line:90%
Lines can change.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And that means that we're
either doing our destiny

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.820 align:middle line:90%
or not doing our destiny.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.010 align:middle line:84%
Life doesn't come
with instructions.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.300 align:middle line:90%
But it does.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.610 align:middle line:90%
It's on our hands.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.160 align:middle line:10%
>> On "Cosmic Disclosure--"

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.180 align:middle line:10%
>> That's where I came in
contact with Jeremiah Davis.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.290 align:middle line:10%
He was brought into Area 51.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And he was drafted
out of Area 51

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.710 align:middle line:84%
into the United Galactic
Federation of Hendon,

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.360 align:middle line:90%
which is 574 different planets.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.990 align:middle line:84%
>> On a new "Into the
Vortex with Jimmy Church--"

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.780 align:middle line:84%
>> My guest today
is Randall Carlson,

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.180 align:middle line:84%
a geological explorer and an
expert in esoteric symbolism.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.710 align:middle line:84%
>> There have been successive
events that would completely

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.370 align:middle line:84%
remodel the surface
of this planet.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.255 align:middle line:90%
>> New series.

00:02:24.255 --> 00:02:27.050 align:middle line:90%


00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:34.960 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a portal near
here that we can enter.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.870 align:middle line:90%


00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:45.550 align:middle line:84%
It will take us
into a new Earth.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Only on Gaia.
