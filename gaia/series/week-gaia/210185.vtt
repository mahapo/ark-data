00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.870 align:middle line:90%
>> This week on "Gaia."

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.370 align:middle line:10%
On a new "Channeling--

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.200 align:middle line:10%
A Bridge to the Beyond."

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.540 align:middle line:10%
>> You are the
critical component.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.560 align:middle line:84%
A spirit cannot use a pendulum,
a Ouija board, or dowsing rods,

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.040 align:middle line:84%
or table tipping without
you sharing your energy.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.200 align:middle line:90%
You are an important part of it.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.960 align:middle line:84%
>> On "Beyond Belief
with George Noory."

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.000 align:middle line:90%
>> I had a head on collision.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.020 align:middle line:10%
Imagine my surprise when at
some point during the surgery

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.160 align:middle line:10%
I left my body.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.770 align:middle line:10%
>> On "Open Minds
with Regina Meredith."

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Not all of these things
are dark, nasty, nefarious.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.810 align:middle line:10%
There are many benevolent
beings out there

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.840 align:middle line:10%
that may be taking
this shape or form.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.720 align:middle line:84%
>> On "Into The Vortex
with Jimmy Church."

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.190 align:middle line:84%
>> When you say that
we are probably alone,

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.260 align:middle line:90%
that's a tall order.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.967 align:middle line:84%
There's probably life out there,
there's probably a lot of life,

00:00:48.967 --> 00:00:50.550 align:middle line:84%
and there's probably
intelligent life.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.600 align:middle line:90%
It would not surprise me.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.890 align:middle line:90%
That's why I look for it.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.710 align:middle line:84%
>> On "Art of Letting
Go with Sah D'Simone."

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.700 align:middle line:10%
>> Every experience that we
have in life leaves an emotional

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.020 align:middle line:10%
residue in our bodies.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.280 align:middle line:10%
>> New series.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.060 align:middle line:10%
>> We think there is
nothing out there.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.210 align:middle line:10%
We have a psychological
problem with extraterrestrials.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.970 align:middle line:90%
But of course, they were here.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.710 align:middle line:90%
>> New series.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.300 align:middle line:84%
>> It is said that this world is
an illusion and beyond it lies

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.360 align:middle line:90%
our real existence.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Only on "Gaia."

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.000 align:middle line:90%
