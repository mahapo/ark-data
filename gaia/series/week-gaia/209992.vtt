00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:06.425 align:middle line:10%
>> This week on Gaia on "Open
Minds with Regina Meredith"--

00:00:06.425 --> 00:00:09.050 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: What kind of
entities were you dealing with?

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.508 align:middle line:84%
>>BONNI MCCLISS:
So many, actually.

00:00:10.508 --> 00:00:12.380 align:middle line:84%
Just this
inter-dimensional highway.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You say basically, I'm
not crazy, I just see things.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: She said, I don't
think you're schizophrenic.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.710 align:middle line:10%
I think something
else is going on.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.180 align:middle line:10%
She said, I think
you're psychic.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.130 align:middle line:84%
Through my psychic
development, I

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.230 align:middle line:84%
knew that I had to
be super present,

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.300 align:middle line:84%
because psychic information
only comes in the now.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: It was almost an
electrified way of being human.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.450 align:middle line:84%
>> On "Beyond Belief
with George Noory"--

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Were you born
with these mystic healing

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:38.820 align:middle line:90%
abilities?

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.320 align:middle line:10%
>>SONJA GRACE: I've
been able to see

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.432 align:middle line:10%
all levels of the astral plane
since I was a little kid.

00:00:43.432 --> 00:00:45.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you a
time traveler as well?

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: When I
experience time travel,

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.170 align:middle line:84%
it is a total physical
body experience.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.930 align:middle line:84%
We have moved into
the fifth dimension.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.590 align:middle line:84%
So it's a much higher frequency,
it's much more intense,

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.510 align:middle line:84%
and we, as a species, have never
navigated this kind of energy

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:03.830 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.560 align:middle line:90%
>> On "Cosmic Disclosure"--

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Germany has a long
history of time traveling

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.500 align:middle line:90%
attempts, at least.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.180 align:middle line:10%
And is it possible?

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.040 align:middle line:10%
Yes, 100%.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.500 align:middle line:10%
Einstein basically dealt with
the question and other physics.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.210 align:middle line:90%
Has it been done?

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.230 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.050 align:middle line:84%
Basically, the
answer, the question

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.550 align:middle line:84%
is, do you time
travel by technology

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.510 align:middle line:84%
or do you time travel by
the natural possibilities

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.390 align:middle line:90%
that the universe itself has?

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.170 align:middle line:84%
>> On a new "Into The
Vortex with Jimmy Church"--

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT WOLTER: First
of all, as a scientist,

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.160 align:middle line:90%
I just want it to be right.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the answer
is is the answer.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.010 align:middle line:90%
And I want it to be the truth.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And frankly, we have been
fed a boatload of lies

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.480 align:middle line:84%
about the history
of our country.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.800 align:middle line:84%
Everybody was here
before Columbus.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And what's at stake
here really is not just

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.970 align:middle line:84%
getting the past right but
getting the present right.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And the way we get it
right is by understanding

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.640 align:middle line:84%
what happened in the past
that leads to the future

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.740 align:middle line:90%
so that we can go forward.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.670 align:middle line:90%
>> New series.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.670 align:middle line:90%


00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:28.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Listen to the sound
of your own heart,

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:36.230 align:middle line:84%
to the sound of
your inner presence.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Only on Gaia.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.000 align:middle line:90%
