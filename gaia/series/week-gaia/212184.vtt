HOST: New documentary.

00:00:03.662 --> 00:00:08.980 align:middle line:84%
- Dr. Greer granted me exclusive
never-before-seen access to one

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.550 align:middle line:84%
of his advanced workshops
where he teaches his protocols.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.200 align:middle line:84%
HOST: This week on Gaia,
on a new series, "Mysteries

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.670 align:middle line:90%
of the Knights Templar."

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT WOLTER: The emerald
tablet literally starts out

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.530 align:middle line:90%
saying, "as above, so below."

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.850 align:middle line:10%
That there was a relationship
between the heavens

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:26.650 align:middle line:10%
and the Earth.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.855 align:middle line:10%
This was fundamental to alchemy.

00:00:28.855 --> 00:00:31.495 align:middle line:10%
HOST: On "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:00:31.495 --> 00:00:33.790 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: The US
military is especially

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.370 align:middle line:84%
communicating with those
civilizations out there.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.880 align:middle line:84%
There's some effort in order
to bring their knowledge back

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.710 align:middle line:84%
to this planet,
and this is what we

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.155 align:middle line:90%
have called Project Cassiopeia.

00:00:44.155 --> 00:00:46.883 align:middle line:84%
HOST: On a new season
of "Into the Vortex."

00:00:46.883 --> 00:00:48.550 align:middle line:84%
>>WENDY KENNEDY: Right
now, you look out

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.330 align:middle line:84%
at the state of the world,
and it seems a big mess.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.360 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to break things
down to build things up.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.520 align:middle line:84%
You will build rapidly because
your state of consciousness

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.353 align:middle line:84%
is now getting higher
and higher and higher.

00:00:56.353 --> 00:00:58.210 align:middle line:90%
HOST: On "The Other Side."

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.530 align:middle line:84%
- Healers are multi-dimensional
beings who dance between

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.980 align:middle line:84%
the realms of the
seen and unseen.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.320 align:middle line:84%
HOST: On "Beyond Belief
with George Noory."

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.820 align:middle line:10%
>>JERRY SARGEANT:
I say to everybody

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.650 align:middle line:10%
that comes into our
healing session,

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:13.880 align:middle line:10%
are you prepared to die?

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.675 align:middle line:84%
When they come out the other
side, they're transformed.

00:01:17.675 --> 00:01:19.380 align:middle line:90%
HOST: On "Superpower."

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRANDA ALCOTT: The
way an animal sees

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.520 align:middle line:90%
life is so different from us.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.550 align:middle line:10%
We have to join the animal
where they are and then

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.030 align:middle line:10%
take it from there.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.150 align:middle line:10%
Otherwise, why
would they trust us?

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.820 align:middle line:10%
HOST: On "Open Minds"
with Regina Meredith.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.910 align:middle line:10%
>>LEE HARRIS: All humans
who come from oneness

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.260 align:middle line:10%
need to return to oneness--
this essential idea that you

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.360 align:middle line:10%
are actually all equal.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.450 align:middle line:90%
HOST: Only on Gaia.
