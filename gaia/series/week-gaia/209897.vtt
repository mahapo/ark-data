00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.460 align:middle line:90%
>> This week on Gaia.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.190 align:middle line:84%
On Beyond Belief
with George Noory.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Before I knew it, I
was in another dimension.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.930 align:middle line:10%
I felt this presence
behind me and I

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.090 align:middle line:10%
heard, "are you ready to die?"

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.305 align:middle line:90%
My body was being held by God.

00:00:16.305 --> 00:00:17.105 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:00:17.105 --> 00:00:19.460 align:middle line:84%
>> They said, "you need to go
back but you're going to have

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.260 align:middle line:90%
a gift."

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.340 align:middle line:84%
And so that really
opened my mediumship up.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.385 align:middle line:10%
>> On Open Minds
with Regina Meredith.

00:00:25.385 --> 00:00:28.970 align:middle line:10%
>> They're talking about what
the soul of a human on Earth is

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.020 align:middle line:10%
evolving into and warning us
of some of the ways that we

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.250 align:middle line:10%
don't want to go.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.010 align:middle line:84%
By all means, look
up and look out.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.220 align:middle line:84%
But they say the Earth
is coming online in ways

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.615 align:middle line:90%
that we have never experienced.

00:00:41.615 --> 00:00:43.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that's exciting.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.365 align:middle line:10%
>> On Truth Hunter.

00:00:45.365 --> 00:00:51.320 align:middle line:84%
>> This specific group seems
to be on a kind of mission

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.060 align:middle line:84%
in order to gain as many
profits as possible.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Profit?

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Profit out of the situation
that Earth is facing right now.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.125 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:07.084 align:middle line:90%
>> On Cosmic Disclosure.

00:01:07.084 --> 00:01:11.500 align:middle line:10%
>> I wouldn't say that this
is true, that we're all AI.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.540 align:middle line:10%
I think the universe
has potential

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.580 align:middle line:10%
to be AI, which is part
of this whole probability

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.990 align:middle line:10%
and possibility thing.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's more kind
of a viewpoint.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.240 align:middle line:84%
And the universe itself
is much more than AI.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.975 align:middle line:84%
>> On the new Into the
Vortex with Jimmy Church.

00:01:29.975 --> 00:01:32.600 align:middle line:84%
>> The amount of sunlight
reflected from it changed

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.560 align:middle line:84%
by a factor of 10
as it was tumbling.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.070 align:middle line:84%
So that made it quite
unusual because it

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.920 align:middle line:84%
meant that it had a very
extreme shape just like a piece

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.780 align:middle line:90%
of paper tumbling in the wind.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.650 align:middle line:84%
But if you think about it
as an artificial object,

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.830 align:middle line:84%
you might think that it's trying
to look in all directions.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Like many ancient
civilizations,

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.610 align:middle line:84%
the Maya appeared in Yucatan
seemingly out of nowhere when

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.820 align:middle line:84%
a star in the Pleiades by
the same name was seen rising

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:10.289 align:middle line:90%
before the Sun around 3100 BC.

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.870 align:middle line:84%
But a number of recent
underwater discoveries

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.415 align:middle line:90%
tell a very different story.

00:02:14.415 --> 00:02:17.020 align:middle line:90%


00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.840 align:middle line:84%
Around the coast, mile
after mile of tunnels

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.540 align:middle line:84%
reveal a world
submerged by rising seas

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.880 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the Ice Age.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.250 align:middle line:84%
In these tunnels were
found human remains

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.670 align:middle line:84%
and Maya artifacts proving
that a culture was already

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.420 align:middle line:84%
established here
6,000 years earlier.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.630 align:middle line:84%
The name Maya means
"water people."

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.890 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps it is a clue
to their true origin.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.200 align:middle line:84%
According to the sacred
book Chilam Balam,

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.750 align:middle line:84%
the ancestors of the
Maya arrived by boat

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.830 align:middle line:84%
in 9600 BC from a large
island to the East

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.350 align:middle line:84%
called Atol or Atitlan, where it
is said, "the waters swallowed

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.720 align:middle line:90%
the source of wisdom."

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.420 align:middle line:84%
A catastrophe destroyed
their island home,

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.350 align:middle line:84%
forcing its divine
survivors to sail west.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.490 align:middle line:90%
This is their story.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:14.262 align:middle line:90%


00:03:14.262 --> 00:03:15.630 align:middle line:90%
>> New series.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.886 align:middle line:90%


00:03:19.886 --> 00:03:32.190 align:middle line:84%
>> We're going to put one
foot in front of the other,

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:44.290 align:middle line:84%
moving through life onto
the edge of the unknown.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Only on Gaia.

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.000 align:middle line:90%
