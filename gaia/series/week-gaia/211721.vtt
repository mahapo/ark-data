00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Any opportunity
for disclosure,

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.240 align:middle line:84%
any opportunity for
change, is an opportunity

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.470 align:middle line:90%
for intervention.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:14.050 align:middle line:90%

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.752 align:middle line:84%
>> On "Open Minds"
with Regina Meredith--

00:00:16.752 --> 00:00:17.960 align:middle line:90%
>> How do we partner with it?

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.230 align:middle line:84%
How do we find
friends within nature?

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.660 align:middle line:10%
And how do we attune
ourselves to listen?

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.050 align:middle line:84%
Because through listening,
then you can be heard.

>> On "Beyond Belief"
with George Noory--

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.670 align:middle line:10%
>> With these different
layers of energies,

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.450 align:middle line:10%
there's going to be a need for
new content and new information

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.470 align:middle line:10%
and new things to
be brought forward.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And so Gaia is at the
forefront of that.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.860 align:middle line:90%
>> --only on Gaia.
