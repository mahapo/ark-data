>>FRANK DELUCA: I really
had to go back to zero

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.360 align:middle line:10%
and say, now, why would I
talk about the Enneagram?

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.450 align:middle line:84%
I drank the Kool-Aid a long
time ago, but not everybody has.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.330 align:middle line:84%
If they had this language, if
they had this point of view,

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.520 align:middle line:84%
oh, it would just
be so much more fun.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.682 align:middle line:84%
We have a kind of
contracted self--

00:00:22.682 --> 00:00:23.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.600 align:middle line:90%
>>DELUCA: And an expanded self.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.920 align:middle line:90%

>>DEVARA THUNDERBEAT: They
actually took me up in the ship

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.590 align:middle line:10%
and brought me to
Sirius A, and stopped me

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.600 align:middle line:10%
before we got into Sirius A.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.180 align:middle line:84%
He came and did a
circle around me.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.480 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what is he doing?

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And he said, he's looking
for immoral implants.

HOWE: The DIA analyst

who requested the
meeting, he had

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.370 align:middle line:10%
said that he wanted to
control the location

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.590 align:middle line:10%
to make sure that satellites
wouldn't penetrate.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And where we met was where
there was a lot of boats--

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.100 align:middle line:90%
lots of white noise.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.580 align:middle line:10%
And as we went to sit
down at a place to talk,

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.220 align:middle line:10%
he looked up at the
sky and he said,

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.330 align:middle line:10%
I don't think our satellites
can penetrate this white noise.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.730 align:middle line:10%
And that's how it began.

timeline, you're
12, 13, 14, 15, 16--

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.290 align:middle line:10%
and she was trying to tell
me that that's really rare.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.740 align:middle line:84%
We didn't even think
such creatures existed.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.200 align:middle line:84%
They're unstuck
in time-- they can

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.790 align:middle line:84%
go forwards, backwards, present,
they live in all the moments.

look at this in terms of what

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.580 align:middle line:90%
it means to all of humanity.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And so when you report on it,
at a site like The Debrief,

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.150 align:middle line:84%
we've got to think about what
are the credible sources?

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.740 align:middle line:90%
What are the major developments?

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.380 align:middle line:84%
What is the
importance, culturally,

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.060 align:middle line:84%
in terms of politics
and government, science?

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.860 align:middle line:90%
All those things.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.070 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, I mean, it's huge.

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.919 align:middle line:84%
And as far as what you
call it, hey, listen,

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:12.230 align:middle line:84%
they've been known for
a long time as UFOs--

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm still cool with that.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.090 align:middle line:84%
But I think that especially
the military going with UAP,

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.520 align:middle line:84%
they're trying to kind of
lift those old stigmas.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.710 align:middle line:84%
Either/or work for me,
as long as we're all

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.547 align:middle line:84%
talking about the same thing and
trying to move forward with it.

I will read to you a new

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.480 align:middle line:10%
of the pyramids of Giza, or what
Egyptologists call Zep Tepi--

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.550 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that what we
all want to know?

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.490 align:middle line:90%
What is life?

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.046 align:middle line:90%
What is consciousness?

how do you turn the waters

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.640 align:middle line:84%
