>> This week on Gaia, on "Open
Minds" with Regina Meredith--

00:00:06.845 --> 00:00:07.836 align:middle line:10%
>> Congratulations.

00:00:07.836 --> 00:00:08.760 align:middle line:90%

talking about narcissists.

being boiled in water.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:14.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>> You're just gently
turning up the heat.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.970 align:middle line:84%
You don't even notice that
that's what's happening.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.370 align:middle line:90%
They've been comfortable.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:20.910 align:middle line:90%
They didn't learn grit?

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:21.890 align:middle line:10%
Well, tough.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.945 align:middle line:10%
This is Earth this
is what we're doing.

00:00:23.945 --> 00:00:25.445 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden,
there's an urgency.

00:00:25.445 --> 00:00:27.560 align:middle line:90%
You cannot not see this.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.150 align:middle line:90%
"I do not consent."

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.060 align:middle line:90%
>> "I don't consent."

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.860 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:31.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that the
soul's dharma turn on

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.040 align:middle line:90%

>> For years, NASA said,
we're not interested in UFOS.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.160 align:middle line:10%
We don't investigate--

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.183 align:middle line:10%
>> And now-- bang.

00:00:47.183 --> 00:00:49.100 align:middle line:84%
What do you think of the
James Webb telescope?

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my goodness.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.520 align:middle line:84%
One of the wonders
of the modern world.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.230 align:middle line:84%
It's like the
scientific community

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.570 align:middle line:84%
is catching up where
the UFO community has

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.485 align:middle line:90%
been for 80 years.

00:00:57.485 --> 00:00:59.540 align:middle line:84%
>> The answers
are going to come.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to
come in a big way.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Some people will
react with fear,

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.550 align:middle line:90%
others with a sense of wonder.

00:01:10.125 --> 00:01:12.710 align:middle line:10%
>> We were told that
you just need to know,

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.280 align:middle line:10%
since y'all drilled
through those two holes,

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.460 align:middle line:10%
that it lit this whole
mountainside where we were

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.953 align:middle line:10%
at up into a blue aura.

00:01:21.953 --> 00:01:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And lightning strikes were
coming out of the ground.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.880 align:middle line:84%
And so we were already
in Vernal, Utah.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And I said, we're
going back out.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.320 align:middle line:90%
We got to see this.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.395 align:middle line:90%
>> And what did you see?

00:01:29.395 --> 00:01:32.150 align:middle line:84%
>> The next thing you
know, over there on the top

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.430 align:middle line:84%
of the mountains where we
were doing that project,

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.990 align:middle line:90%
there was three craft.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.420 align:middle line:90%
In turn, it's a game-changer.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.870 align:middle line:84%
You start seeing things
so different, it's unreal.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.505 align:middle line:84%
And so you start believing, even
though people won't believe.

Vortex" with Jimmy Church--

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:55.110 align:middle line:84%
>> To have a crash retrieval
happen that predated Roswell is

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.950 align:middle line:90%
extraordinary.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.450 align:middle line:90%
Were you surprised by that?

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Everybody was surprised.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.160 align:middle line:84%
The witnesses hadn't
spoken for 60, 65 years.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.440 align:middle line:90%
But the object was taken away.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.830 align:middle line:84%
We know it was taken away
first to White Sands,

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.660 align:middle line:90%
and then to Los Alamos.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And there, there is no
trace of it after that.
