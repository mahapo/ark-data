00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.480 align:middle line:10%
>> On Gaia Events Plus--

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.880 align:middle line:10%
>>MICHAEL BECKWITH: You can
manifest the kind of life

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.800 align:middle line:10%
you wish to experience.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.610 align:middle line:84%
In order for you to be set
free, you have to forgive.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.340 align:middle line:84%
>> This week on
Gaia, new series.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.840 align:middle line:10%
>> ALAN GREEN: We've barely
been able to scratch the surface

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.370 align:middle line:10%
of those so-called
wrong numbers,

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.400 align:middle line:10%
and every single one of them
connects a certain part of one

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.590 align:middle line:10%
play to another play,
seemingly unrelated.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.862 align:middle line:84%
>> On "Open Minds"
with Regina Meredith--

00:00:30.862 --> 00:00:33.070 align:middle line:84%
>>TARA SWART: We don't talk
about hardwiring anymore.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.220 align:middle line:10%
We talk about
softwiring, which means

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.160 align:middle line:10%
that even something that's
been there for a very long time

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.180 align:middle line:10%
can be not undone
but overwritten.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.370 align:middle line:84%
>> On "Beyond Belief"
with George Noory--

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BEN STEWART: I think when
history seems to speed up,

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.370 align:middle line:90%
it's doing that for a reason.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's here to show us that
the old world or the old order

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.880 align:middle line:90%
is coming to an end.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.860 align:middle line:10%
>> On "The Arc of Time--"

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.318 align:middle line:10%
>>RICARDO GONZALEZ
CORPANCHO: There

00:00:57.318 --> 00:00:59.280 align:middle line:10%
are objects of power
capable of interacting

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.130 align:middle line:10%
with that vital field
of light of the Earth.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about a mystery
that we know as the solar disks.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.405 align:middle line:10%
>> On a new season of
"Cosmic Disclosure--"

00:01:09.405 --> 00:01:11.280 align:middle line:10%
>>RICHARD C. DOTY: All
of a sudden, the light

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.420 align:middle line:10%
came towards them.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.080 align:middle line:84%
Her girlfriend panicked, and
she ran back towards the car.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.940 align:middle line:84%
But Cady sat there,
because Cady knew

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.590 align:middle line:90%
that her friends were coming.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Only on Gaia.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.000 align:middle line:90%
