>> Some person or
entity called Janus.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.045 align:middle line:84%
Janus basically said he
was an extraterrestrial.

00:00:19.745 --> 00:00:22.730 align:middle line:10%
>> We want to measure how
much you can reverse the age

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:23.530 align:middle line:10%
of the skin.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.880 align:middle line:84%
To do that, we use
an algorithm that

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.150 align:middle line:84%
measures changes in the
skin's epigenetic profile.

I said, who's speaking to me?

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.380 align:middle line:10%
And I heard very clearly,
this is another part of you.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.310 align:middle line:90%
It's your higher self.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.900 align:middle line:84%

you uncomfortable,

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.390 align:middle line:84%
you can call us
whatever you like.

>> On Open Minds
with Regina Meredith.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Nature is an adaptive machine
that has designed a system

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.010 align:middle line:84%
in which adaptation
is always the driver,

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.170 align:middle line:84%
and that adaptation is
driving for diversity.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.740 align:middle line:10%
And that diversity is leading
to beauty, intelligence,

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.545 align:middle line:10%
and ultimately an ascendant
path towards more light.

making a final approach in from

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:08.220 align:middle line:84%
the airplane, you can see
the grid of the street with

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.670 align:middle line:90%
the different rows of houses.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.382 align:middle line:90%
