accepted by all.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.140 align:middle line:10%
When she feels that
that's not happening,

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.460 align:middle line:10%
she digs her heels in and
works harder to be understood.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.480 align:middle line:90%

the elements of nature.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And we're connecting
to the elements that

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.060 align:middle line:90%
are within us, our own nature.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.120 align:middle line:84%
When that happens, you
push out what you're not.

Whether we want to
call them alien or not,

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.840 align:middle line:10%
they definitely seem
to have this ability

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.000 align:middle line:10%

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:05.450 align:middle line:90%

>> The energy that we bind at
other times in our life really

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.790 align:middle line:10%
is what gives us access to
the quantum, to the field,

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.146 align:middle line:10%
