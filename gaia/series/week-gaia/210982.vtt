>> These beings are
living among us,

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.400 align:middle line:84%
and they do influence
us day to day.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, there
are ones that visit us.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.310 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a question
of if they are here.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.350 align:middle line:10%
They always have been here.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.780 align:middle line:10%
>> New series.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And it was at that moment
that a voice in my own

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.260 align:middle line:84%
language, in perfect
Spanish, broke the silence,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.830 align:middle line:84%
telling me in a metallic
tone, don't stop searching.

>> On "Beyond Belief
with George Noory--"

>> What would happen, Laurie,
if you're walking through

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.810 align:middle line:90%
a portal, and it closes on you?

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Portals are energetic
areas on the Earth,

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.580 align:middle line:84%
even black holes that

>> There was a female energy,
and her voice was familiar

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.900 align:middle line:90%
but I don't know.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.240 align:middle line:90%
She was like, we get it.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.640 align:middle line:90%
We get it's been hard for you.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.310 align:middle line:10%
But if you choose
to stay, you're

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.000 align:middle line:10%
going to be able to help
a lot of people with this.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Only on Gaia.
