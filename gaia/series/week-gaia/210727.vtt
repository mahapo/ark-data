00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750 align:middle line:90%
>> This week on Gaia.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.325 align:middle line:90%
On a new "Deep Space" season 4.

00:00:06.325 --> 00:00:08.700 align:middle line:10%
>> RICHARD DOTY: I know about
this because I was actually

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.500 align:middle line:10%
briefed.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.800 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that the
evens had been visiting Earth

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.600 align:middle line:90%
prior to that?

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.010 align:middle line:90%
Sure, absolutely.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:15.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm only telling
you what I know.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.360 align:middle line:84%
>> On "Beyond Belief"
with George Noory.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.610 align:middle line:10%
>> MICHAEL LICHENS: The
miracles, they can work again.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.545 align:middle line:10%
They're not bound by
physics like we are.

00:00:22.545 --> 00:00:24.150 align:middle line:10%
>> On "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.740 align:middle line:10%
>>JOHN RAMIREZ:
Perhaps these beings

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.070 align:middle line:10%
are the ones who are
somewhat authorized,

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.380 align:middle line:10%
I would say, by the
Galactic Federation

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.970 align:middle line:10%
to make more direct contact.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.702 align:middle line:84%
>> On "Open Minds"
with Regina Meredith.

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:37.410 align:middle line:10%
>>JERRY KANTOR:
Unfortunately, homeopathy

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.160 align:middle line:10%
has been subject to a great
deal of mischaracterization

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.360 align:middle line:10%
and disinformation.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.820 align:middle line:10%
>> On the "Awakening
Conference."

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.820 align:middle line:84%
>> This is all about UFOs
and aliens and ancient

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.020 align:middle line:90%
civilizations.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.360 align:middle line:84%
But how does the whole
thing fit together?

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.920 align:middle line:90%
>> On "The Other Side."

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.380 align:middle line:84%
>> In the world of
shamanic healing,

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.100 align:middle line:84%
we use a large amount
of symbolism throughout

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.780 align:middle line:90%
our practices.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.880 align:middle line:84%
You can put a lot
more information

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.980 align:middle line:84%
into a small amount
of symbolism,

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.265 align:middle line:84%
so this makes our practices
much, much richer.

00:01:08.265 --> 00:01:10.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Only on Gaia.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.000 align:middle line:90%
