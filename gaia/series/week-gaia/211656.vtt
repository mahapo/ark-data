>> It's wonderful with
this incredible orchestra

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.830 align:middle line:84%
that's playing the symphony of
the self in a natural harmonic

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:11.850 align:middle line:90%
resonant frequency.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.940 align:middle line:84%

>> This week on Gaia.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.760 align:middle line:84%
>> You have electric
current in your body,

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.880 align:middle line:84%
and you have a magnetic
field around you.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.340 align:middle line:84%
And when we work in
this magnetic field

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.310 align:middle line:84%
that's when the magic
can really happen.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.740 align:middle line:84%

higher self to take an action

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.330 align:middle line:84%
step that didn't
have a huge payoff.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.910 align:middle line:90%
I've always been totally amazed.

>> On Open Minds
with Regina Meredith.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.640 align:middle line:10%
>> To be relaxed with
who and what we are,

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.360 align:middle line:10%
there is no need
to change others.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.720 align:middle line:10%
>> On Cosmic Disclosure.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>> As we find our place in
the inner galactic community,

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.180 align:middle line:84%
it's not without some position
of authority and responsibility

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.640 align:middle line:84%
because we're really good
at the things that we do.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Only on Gaia.
