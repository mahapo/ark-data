On "Open Minds" with
Regina Meredith--

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.760 align:middle line:10%
>>MATIAS DE STEFANO: So
we have all the emotions

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.640 align:middle line:10%
that our ancestors
and our previous lives

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.170 align:middle line:10%
have been feeling.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.210 align:middle line:84%
Through emotions,
we can awaken what

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.280 align:middle line:90%
was happening in that time.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.958 align:middle line:10%

>>DEBRA SILVERMAN: So
the part of your life

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.450 align:middle line:10%
that shows up with your
personality and uniquely

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.900 align:middle line:10%
to you is dependent on the
chart and how that shows up.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's where it
gets really interesting.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.340 align:middle line:90%
>> On "Cosmic Disclosure--"

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DUANE OLLINGER: The
portals are always moving.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.920 align:middle line:84%
Those computers
can chase it down.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.870 align:middle line:10%
And he always talked that it's
nothing to go several light

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.390 align:middle line:10%
years away, but it
just takes longer

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.790 align:middle line:10%
to get in and out of them.

think it has a lot

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.120 align:middle line:90%
to do with the divine feminine.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.180 align:middle line:10%
There's such a feminine energy
there that kind of really

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.120 align:middle line:10%
gives you a certain
level of balance.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.700 align:middle line:10%
>> New series--

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Somewhere beneath
the plateau at Giza,

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.880 align:middle line:10%
beneath the Great Pyramid,
beneath the Great Sphinx is

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.000 align:middle line:10%
some kind of secret chamber
with, quite literally,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.450 align:middle line:10%
the secrets of the universe
contained within it.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.320 align:middle line:90%

>> Imagine a place where
everyone, everywhere,

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.090 align:middle line:10%
every dimension,
everything is connected to.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.540 align:middle line:10%
>>BASHAR: Your true
nature is nonphysical.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.970 align:middle line:10%

higher self, a soul.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.160 align:middle line:90%

>> Only on Gaia.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.000 align:middle line:90%
