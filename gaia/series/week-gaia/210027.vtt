00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.935 align:middle line:10%
>> This week on Gaia, on "Open
Minds with Regina Meredith"--

00:00:06.935 --> 00:00:08.300 align:middle line:10%
>> We're not alone.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.770 align:middle line:10%
There is life all
over the place.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:10.570 align:middle line:10%
>> All over.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Potentially every kind of
lifeform that you can think

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.700 align:middle line:10%
of and even you cannot think of.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.090 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to make contact
to intelligent being that

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.880 align:middle line:84%
lives outside of
this reality, you

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.180 align:middle line:84%
have to somehow compress
frequencies in a way

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.250 align:middle line:84%
that you can
directly access them.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.712 align:middle line:84%
>> On "Beyond Belief
with George Noory"--

00:00:31.712 --> 00:00:35.380 align:middle line:84%
>> My life's work based off
of my astrology is to restore

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.750 align:middle line:84%
beauty, love, and
unity on the planet.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Nothing wrong with that.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And that was when I had
a light bulb that went ding.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.250 align:middle line:90%
Blue.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.120 align:middle line:90%
People say things all the time.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.620 align:middle line:90%
Words lie all the time.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.635 align:middle line:90%
Energy, energy never lies.

00:00:50.635 --> 00:00:54.588 align:middle line:10%
>> On "Cosmic Disclosure"--

00:00:54.588 --> 00:00:58.310 align:middle line:10%
>> Government and the military
have jumped into this full

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.700 align:middle line:10%
blast, and you don't hear
the word UFO anymore.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.830 align:middle line:10%
>> As everything in the
universe is connected,

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.310 align:middle line:10%
it's necessary for the
consciousness of people on this

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.150 align:middle line:10%
planet to be informed about
what they are, where they are,

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.830 align:middle line:10%
and how to deal with that.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.630 align:middle line:10%
>> The one group that you
can't control is the ETs.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.405 align:middle line:84%
>> On a new "Into the
Vortex with Jimmy Church"--

00:01:20.405 --> 00:01:24.350 align:middle line:84%
>> What is in the Wilson Davis
notes about there being crash

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.630 align:middle line:84%
retrievals, a reverse
engineering program,

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.760 align:middle line:84%
existing craft in
our possessions.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that is
absolutely explosive.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.500 align:middle line:84%
In the UFO research
community, we always

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.200 align:middle line:84%
knew the cover up had
become a corporate secret.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.662 align:middle line:84%
If this is so, a congressional
investigation has to happen.

00:01:41.662 --> 00:01:44.450 align:middle line:90%
>> New series.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.120 align:middle line:84%
>> In my life,
I've known courage.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:55.285 align:middle line:84%
I've known it was there, and
I've known when it's gone.

00:01:55.285 --> 00:01:58.345 align:middle line:10%
>> New series.

00:01:58.345 --> 00:02:03.250 align:middle line:84%
>> We all dream every night
whether we remember or not.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.090 align:middle line:84%
In order to start bringing
back these experiences intact,

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.200 align:middle line:84%
it's critical to instill
some foundational practices--

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.220 align:middle line:84%
extracting data, living
lucidly, reality checking,

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.860 align:middle line:90%
practicing mild daily.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Only on Gaia.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.000 align:middle line:90%
