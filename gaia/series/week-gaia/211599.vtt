00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030 align:middle line:10%
>> On a new episode of Crystals.

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.770 align:middle line:84%
What was behind the
obsession with crystals,

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.730 align:middle line:84%
like the Philosopher's
Stone and the Cintamani?

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.560 align:middle line:90%
Were they actual gems?

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.250 align:middle line:84%
Or were they metaphors for
an internal type of treasure?

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.590 align:middle line:84%
This week on Gaia, crystals
have a long history

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.780 align:middle line:84%
of being used to
foretell the future

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.360 align:middle line:84%
and to develop
psychic abilities.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.630 align:middle line:84%
So what is the spiritual
function of crystals?

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And how can they be
used to strengthen

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.900 align:middle line:84%
the connection between our
physical and spiritual world?

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.700 align:middle line:10%
On Cosmic Disclosure.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.090 align:middle line:84%
>> We, the United States Navy,
realized that their ships were

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.170 align:middle line:90%
vulnerable.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.370 align:middle line:10%
Their submarines were vulnerable
to extraterrestrial crafts.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.980 align:middle line:90%
We can't compete against them.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.680 align:middle line:84%
>> On Open Minds
with Regina Meredith.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Belief systems have
locked us in to what is truly

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.210 align:middle line:84%
the potential of what
we are all capable of.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.940 align:middle line:84%
>> On Beyond Belief
with George Noory.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.620 align:middle line:84%
>> So getting the
nudge is one thing,

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.290 align:middle line:84%
but following
through is another.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And the more that we
can follow our intuition

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.240 align:middle line:84%
and give it more
reason to come through,

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.750 align:middle line:90%
the more we can receive.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Only on Gaia.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.000 align:middle line:90%
