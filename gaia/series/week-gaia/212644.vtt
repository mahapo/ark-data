>> On a new series
"Divine Science"--

00:00:04.055 --> 00:00:08.780 align:middle line:10%
>> If humanity will recognize
that we are part of a living

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.990 align:middle line:10%
vehicle of attunement, we'll
be able to bring together

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.810 align:middle line:10%
a greater harmony between
science and spirituality.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.790 align:middle line:84%
>> This week on Gaia,
on "Superpower"--

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.230 align:middle line:84%
>> So we have the
instinct to survive.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.150 align:middle line:90%
We have the instinct of hunger.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.600 align:middle line:84%
So it starts with fixing
one's own relationship

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.840 align:middle line:90%
with food and body.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.090 align:middle line:90%
We all have that inner wisdom.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.485 align:middle line:90%
We're born with it.

00:00:30.485 --> 00:00:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>> On "Open Minds with
Regina Meredith"--

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And her deeper self
is not in this timeline.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.410 align:middle line:10%
It's not in this linear time.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.510 align:middle line:10%
And so it can be having other
experiences in other timelines

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.600 align:middle line:10%
as this part of our self
is having this experience

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.650 align:middle line:10%
in this timeline.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.490 align:middle line:84%
>> On "Mysteries of
the Knights Templar"--

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.570 align:middle line:84%
>> The Templars went on to
help establish democratic

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.530 align:middle line:84%
governments and revolutions
around the world including

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.420 align:middle line:90%
in the United States of America.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.445 align:middle line:90%
But it began in Europe.

00:01:02.445 --> 00:01:05.070 align:middle line:84%
>> On "Beyond Belief
with George Noory"--

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.580 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'm not saying that AI
is great and there's no flaws

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.300 align:middle line:84%
to it, but I am saying it's a
mixed bag and most people are

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.360 align:middle line:84%
just scared of it because
they don't understand it.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And we fear what we
don't understand.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Only on Gaia.
