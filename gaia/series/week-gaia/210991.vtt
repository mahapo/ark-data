>> If you really want
a humanized birth,

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.355 align:middle line:84%
the best thing to do is to
get out of the hospital.

00:00:10.355 --> 00:00:14.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Are we benefiting
mothers and babies or not?

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.745 align:middle line:90%
>> This week on Gaia.

00:00:16.745 --> 00:00:20.210 align:middle line:84%
>> The gist of all the studies
are that home birth is safe

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.357 align:middle line:84%
and they've set guidelines by
which you have to determine

00:00:23.357 --> 00:00:25.190 align:middle line:84%
whether or not a person
is a good candidate.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.380 align:middle line:84%
>> On Open Minds
with Regina Meredith.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.720 align:middle line:10%
>> What's happened is we're
listening to the world

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.030 align:middle line:10%
as opposed to
listening to ourselves.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And it creates a deafness
to be able to actually hear

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.500 align:middle line:90%
what is going on outside.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.030 align:middle line:84%
There's so much
noise in the world.

>> On Beyond Belief
with George Noory.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.550 align:middle line:10%
>> We're at this time period
where sovereignty is also

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.450 align:middle line:10%
a multi-dimensional experience
of realizing that we are these

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.940 align:middle line:10%
divine beings, remembering
our true nature.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.666 align:middle line:10%
>> New series.

00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:56.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Why were they here
since those remote times?

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.570 align:middle line:90%
Who created them?

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.020 align:middle line:90%
Who controls them?

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.570 align:middle line:10%
And why were they sent to Earth?

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.319 align:middle line:90%
>> On Deep Space.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.090 align:middle line:90%
They don't see humans.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.480 align:middle line:84%
They see Earth, thinking,
trying to figure out

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.430 align:middle line:90%
who the planet is.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.400 align:middle line:84%
They are just guiding us,
not trying to control us.
