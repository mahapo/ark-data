00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.190 align:middle line:84%
>> If you look at abundance
as a word and the etymology

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:22.160 align:middle line:84%
of abundance, it comes from
two Latin words-- ab and unda.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.010 align:middle line:90%
And "ab" means from, an "unda"--

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.980 align:middle line:90%
U-N-D-A-- means wave.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.010 align:middle line:90%
So you're from the wave.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.740 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a journey for everyone,
the journey to abundance.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's very easy
to think that we're

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.110 align:middle line:84%
journeying towards something
outside of ourselves

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.480 align:middle line:84%
when, in fact, the
journey to abundance

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.820 align:middle line:90%
is a journey into ourselves.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.230 align:middle line:84%
Into finding the abundance
that resides within us

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.580 align:middle line:90%
and enjoying that abundance.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And then seeing that
abundance ripple out

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:59.070 align:middle line:84%
into the world in unexpected
and amazing and wondrous ways.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.070 align:middle line:84%
>> So I think part of the
thinking is not to say

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.310 align:middle line:84%
it's outside of me,
how can I get that?

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.830 align:middle line:84%
But how do I already have
that within me, and how

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.132 align:middle line:90%
do I ride that wave to more?

00:01:10.132 --> 00:01:12.590 align:middle line:84%
>> It's really important in
talking about abundance that we

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.100 align:middle line:84%
encompass this area of
understanding the depth

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.830 align:middle line:84%
of life, that it
encompasses all areas.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.130 align:middle line:84%
You can't have one lacking
and be truly prosperous.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.380 align:middle line:84%
You really need to work
on all facets of life.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>> So one day, the novelist Kurt
Vonnegut was at a party at some

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.450 align:middle line:84%
hedge fund trader's
house in the Hamptons,

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.510 align:middle line:84%
this very wealthy
community off New York.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And he was there
with Joseph Heller,

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.350 align:middle line:90%
who is another novelist.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And Joseph Heller had had
a best seller, "Catch-22."

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And Kurt Vonnegut had
had best sellers, too.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And they're standing
in this living

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.880 align:middle line:84%
room that's bigger than both
of their houses combined.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And this is an ultra
wealthy hedge fund trader

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.110 align:middle line:90%
that's giving this party there.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And so Vonnegut, sort of kidding
Joseph Heller, he says, Joe.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.960 align:middle line:84%
He says, doesn't
it make you jealous

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.790 align:middle line:84%
that this guy,
this hedge trader,

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.230 align:middle line:84%
probably makes more in a day
than you made on all your books

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.640 align:middle line:90%
combined?

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And Joseph Heller says, no way,
it doesn't make me jealous.

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.540 align:middle line:90%
He goes, why?

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.040 align:middle line:90%
He said, it's gotta, come on.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.342 align:middle line:84%
You're just lying to yourself,
and you're lying to me.

00:02:16.342 --> 00:02:18.050 align:middle line:84%
He says, why doesn't
it make you jealous?

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.245 align:middle line:84%
He said, because I've got
something he doesn't have.

00:02:21.245 --> 00:02:23.632 align:middle line:84%
He says, what could
you possibly have

00:02:23.632 --> 00:02:24.840 align:middle line:90%
this guy-- he has everything.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.757 align:middle line:84%
He has all the money to
buy anything he wants.

00:02:26.757 --> 00:02:28.610 align:middle line:84%
He has the coolest
cars, a big house.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.527 align:middle line:84%
He has this private helicopter
that jets him out here.

00:02:31.527 --> 00:02:33.610 align:middle line:84%
What could you possibly
have that he doesn't have?

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.520 align:middle line:84%
He says, I know the
meaning of enough.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.580 align:middle line:84%
>> All we have at the end of
the game isn't how much money we

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.390 align:middle line:90%
made.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.580 align:middle line:90%
It's who do we become.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.110 align:middle line:90%
Did my life matter?

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.150 align:middle line:90%
Did my life have purpose?

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.590 align:middle line:84%
Did I use that gift
that I was given

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.870 align:middle line:84%
called life by
whatever you believe

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.450 align:middle line:90%
gave you that gift called life?

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.650 align:middle line:84%
Did I use it in a way that
I'm happy, that I'm proud,

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.180 align:middle line:90%
that I feel fulfilled?

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.730 align:middle line:84%
>> You've got to be
very cautious of letting

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.963 align:middle line:90%
your material things own you.

00:03:06.963 --> 00:03:07.880 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I see.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.250 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people let their
possessions own them,

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.510 align:middle line:84%
and they lose themselves
in their possessions.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.270 align:middle line:90%
And that's not prosperity.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Whereas abundance,
when I think of abundance,

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.890 align:middle line:90%
I think of a forest.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.890 align:middle line:84%
I think of it like an
ecosystem, where not only

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.680 align:middle line:84%
is it OK for me to
be different to you.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.120 align:middle line:84%
Where not only is it OK
for me not to conform.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.470 align:middle line:90%
It's necessary.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.510 align:middle line:90%
Every ecosystem has diversity.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.370 align:middle line:84%
Every ecosystem
thrives on differences,

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.440 align:middle line:84%
and it's inherently
creative, and yet

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.580 align:middle line:90%
cooperative and interdependent.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And it allows for growth,
and allows for freedom.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.090 align:middle line:90%


00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.840 align:middle line:90%
That's what I see as abundance.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.050 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that you have to
find out what your definition

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.850 align:middle line:90%
of abundance is.

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.870 align:middle line:90%
Mine is spaciousness.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.980 align:middle line:84%
When I feel I have spaciousness
in my life in all those areas--

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.120 align:middle line:84%
in energy, in money, in time,
in pursuing what I want,

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.490 align:middle line:90%
in relationships--

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.019 align:middle line:84%
that spaciousness is
a really big thing.

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.310 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm just a person.

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.630 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's just a person.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.970 align:middle line:90%
We're all just doing our best.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And there's no reason why
I can't be abundant as you,

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.610 align:middle line:90%
why you can't be abundant as me.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.390 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing really
separating us other

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.680 align:middle line:84%
than our perceptions
of separation.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.290 align:middle line:90%


00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.450 align:middle line:84%
We can all access
extraordinary abundance

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.060 align:middle line:90%
just because it exists.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.860 align:middle line:90%
Look around you.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:48.660 align:middle line:90%
Look at the world.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.630 align:middle line:84%
Look at the sun, pumping
out energy constantly.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.400 align:middle line:90%
Look at the world.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:59.430 align:middle line:84%
Plants growing, the sea
moving, the planets orbiting.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.360 align:middle line:90%
Galaxies spinning.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.210 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:09.690 align:middle line:84%
We're constantly in growth and
motion and perpetual abundance.

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.180 align:middle line:84%
So we can have it just
because it exists.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.853 align:middle line:90%
And we're part of this creation.

00:05:13.853 --> 00:05:15.270 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
be extraordinary.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.230 align:middle line:90%
We don't do more than we are.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.470 align:middle line:90%
We just have to be here.

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.950 align:middle line:84%
We just have to be present,
and be able to receive it

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.220 align:middle line:90%
into our lives.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.020 align:middle line:90%
>> It's up to you.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.270 align:middle line:90%
You have the ability to do it.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.110 align:middle line:84%
You have the genius
inside of you.

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.820 align:middle line:84%
>> What life experiences does
your soul yearn for if there

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.490 align:middle line:90%
was no obstacles to money?

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.040 align:middle line:84%
If you can remove the money
question out of your mind,

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.120 align:middle line:84%
what would your soul
thrive to live in?

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.340 align:middle line:90%
Who would you love to touch?

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.480 align:middle line:90%
Who would you love to serve?

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.150 align:middle line:84%
What would you
like to experience?

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.070 align:middle line:90%
Taste?

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.950 align:middle line:90%
Eat?

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.110 align:middle line:90%
What would you like to wear?

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.750 align:middle line:90%
How would you like to travel?

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.830 align:middle line:84%
Where would you
like to travel to?

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:03.740 align:middle line:84%
What people is your
soul yearning to meet?

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:09.660 align:middle line:84%
What places in the world are
you feeling drawn and called to?

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.300 align:middle line:84%
>> There are two things that
drive us past our current

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.740 align:middle line:90%
limitations.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.080 align:middle line:90%
Hope and dreams.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's the belief
that there is more.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.500 align:middle line:84%
The belief that this
isn't all there is.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:28.560 align:middle line:84%
The belief that I can exceed
my current limitations.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And without that vision, without
that dream, without that hope,

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:34.770 align:middle line:90%
we stay stuck.

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.170 align:middle line:84%
We stay where we are because
anything else is too fearful.

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.800 align:middle line:84%
It's that that lets us
step past that threshold

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.060 align:middle line:84%
into that new area and
experience something.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.530 align:middle line:90%
Face the fear.

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.720 align:middle line:90%
Move through the fear.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.300 align:middle line:84%
Recognize, OK, this is going
to be a little bit scary,

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.110 align:middle line:84%
but there is a
dream beyond that.

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And so it's looking
at the dream.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.410 align:middle line:90%
It's focusing on the dream.

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:04.740 align:middle line:84%
It's attaching your life,
your actions, your thinking,

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.230 align:middle line:84%
to the hope as
opposed to the fear

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:09.900 align:middle line:84%
that lets us step past
that space and experience

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.090 align:middle line:90%
something else.

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.590 align:middle line:84%
>> And if you think about action
from the point of view that

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:16.140 align:middle line:84%
maybe you wake up in the morning
and you think the goal is

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:17.880 align:middle line:90%
to get butterflies.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.505 align:middle line:84%
So what you might do
is go out and say,

00:07:19.505 --> 00:07:21.505 align:middle line:84%
well, I see some people
are catching butterflies

00:07:21.505 --> 00:07:22.710 align:middle line:90%
with a butterfly net.

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.320 align:middle line:84%
So the scarcity model
is a model in which

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.975 align:middle line:84%
you go out with a butterfly
net to chase butterflies,

00:07:27.975 --> 00:07:29.350 align:middle line:84%
and the goal is
that you're going

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:32.160 align:middle line:84%
to get a bigger and better
net on a day-by-day basis

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.450 align:middle line:90%
to catch more butterflies.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:35.033 align:middle line:84%
But there's a problem
with that model.

00:07:35.033 --> 00:07:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is, no
matter how many butterflies

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:39.660 align:middle line:84%
you get, the next
day when you wake up,

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.280 align:middle line:90%
you've got to chase again.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And if you stop chasing,
all those butterflies,

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.240 align:middle line:90%
they disappear.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.688 align:middle line:84%
Whereas you'll
also notice there's

00:07:46.688 --> 00:07:48.480 align:middle line:84%
a different type of
person who doesn't even

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.410 align:middle line:90%
bother about the net.

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:51.440 align:middle line:84%
What they're doing instead
is they're growing garden.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.965 align:middle line:84%
And if you grow a
garden, well, you're

00:07:52.965 --> 00:07:54.465 align:middle line:84%
not trying to chase
the butterflies.

00:07:54.465 --> 00:07:57.570 align:middle line:84%
But you make it
beautiful with flowers.

00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:58.890 align:middle line:90%
You've got amazing plants.

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:00.300 align:middle line:84%
You've got an
amazing place which

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.900 align:middle line:84%
actually attracts the birds and
the bees and the butterflies.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.880 align:middle line:84%
Then, every day, the
butterflies come to you

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.422 align:middle line:84%
without you having
to chase anything.

00:08:07.422 --> 00:08:11.670 align:middle line:84%
>> So my sense of having
an abundant life is having

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:12.900 align:middle line:90%
freedom.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.600 align:middle line:84%
The freedom of being,
freedom of choice.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:21.720 align:middle line:84%
I used to write in my daily
planner that what I wanted

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.490 align:middle line:84%
was to have enough
income to have choice

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:25.135 align:middle line:90%
about what I did with my time.

00:08:25.135 --> 00:08:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think we've
gotten to that place,

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.850 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's
the real freedom.

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:32.309 align:middle line:84%
But even if we didn't have
all the finances we needed,

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:35.700 align:middle line:84%
I think the mindset is to
live the abundant life.

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's not always
about material wealth.

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:40.870 align:middle line:84%
It's also about wealth
of relationships.

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:46.430 align:middle line:84%
The wealth of experience
that you have.

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:49.050 align:middle line:84%
For me, it was
having my thinking

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:51.940 align:middle line:84%
opening up so there's all
kinds of new possibilities.

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:55.440 align:middle line:84%
So what that does is keeps
life fresh and exciting.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:00.360 align:middle line:84%
>> I have a friend who's
a writer and a therapist.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:04.140 align:middle line:84%
And he told me this story
that I thought was so great.

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:05.660 align:middle line:84%
He was in Hollywood
for a long time,

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.160 align:middle line:84%
and he was a screenwriter, and
he met all the famous people.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.180 align:middle line:90%
And he doesn't drop names.

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:10.560 align:middle line:84%
But one time he was
telling me this story.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.540 align:middle line:84%
He says, Bill, you know
I don't drop names,

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:13.832 align:middle line:90%
but I'm going to drop one name.

00:09:13.832 --> 00:09:20.400 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'm in Park City, Utah
at the Sundance Film Festival.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.727 align:middle line:84%
And Robert Redford was
talking about a script

00:09:23.727 --> 00:09:24.810 align:middle line:90%
he may want me to work on.

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:28.440 align:middle line:84%
So we ride back in
his private plane.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.480 align:middle line:90%
And he says, I'm looking around.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.565 align:middle line:90%
He's got a private plane.

00:09:31.565 --> 00:09:33.690 align:middle line:84%
He's got a car waiting for
him at the airport where

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:35.130 align:middle line:90%
we're gonna land.

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:36.260 align:middle line:90%
He's got it made.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.700 align:middle line:84%
So he talks to me
about the script,

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:40.080 align:middle line:90%
and it doesn't take very long.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.122 align:middle line:84%
And we decide it's not
really a workable project,

00:09:42.122 --> 00:09:45.190 align:middle line:90%
so that's that.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:46.450 align:middle line:90%
We lapse into silence.

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And Robert Redford is
looking out the plane window

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:56.280 align:middle line:84%
and, apropos of
nothing, and says,

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.920 align:middle line:90%
you know who's got it made?

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.890 align:middle line:84%
My friends says, he's
thinking, you've got it.

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:06.250 align:middle line:84%
But he says, no,
who's got it made?

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:08.630 align:middle line:90%
He says, Paul Newman.

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:09.725 align:middle line:90%
He's got it made.

00:10:09.725 --> 00:10:12.488 align:middle line:84%
He says, he has a
wife that loves him.

00:10:12.488 --> 00:10:14.030 align:middle line:84%
They've been married
for a long time.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.497 align:middle line:90%
Kids that love him.

00:10:16.497 --> 00:10:18.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't have such a
great relationship

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.420 align:middle line:90%
with some of my kids.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:20.790 align:middle line:90%
And divorce.

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:21.590 align:middle line:90%
He's aging.

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:22.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm aging.

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:25.490 align:middle line:84%
But he's aged gracefully into
character parts in films.

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:27.830 align:middle line:90%
He's happy with that.

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:29.430 align:middle line:84%
I still want to play
the leading role.

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:30.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm still fighting for that.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.625 align:middle line:84%
And as I get older, it's
harder to get those roles.

00:10:32.625 --> 00:10:34.370 align:middle line:90%
And I'm frustrated with that.

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:38.120 align:middle line:84%
He says, and he's got his
own charity, Newman's Own,

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.060 align:middle line:84%
and it contributes millions
of dollars to people.

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.040 align:middle line:84%
It's done good all
over the world.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.220 align:middle line:84%
He's fulfilled and happy,
and he lives this great life.

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:49.590 align:middle line:84%
He says, Newman,
he's got it made.

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And my friend was
taking, 99% of humanity

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.400 align:middle line:84%
would think you've got
it made, Robert Redford.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.920 align:middle line:84%
He said, and that's
when I realized,

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.860 align:middle line:84%
no matter where you
are, if you don't have

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:04.070 align:middle line:84%
that sense of abundance, that
you have enough, that you're

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:07.760 align:middle line:90%
OK, you're screwed, basically.

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:08.690 align:middle line:90%
You're not happy.

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:12.640 align:middle line:90%
