>> Anytime a person is not
living authentically according

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.010 align:middle line:84%
to what is truly most important,
and meaningful, and value,

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.580 align:middle line:84%
and inspiring in their lives,
the unfulfillment makes them

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.560 align:middle line:84%
seek immediate
gratification to compensate.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And this addictive behavior,
this hedonic treadmill

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.229 align:middle line:84%
trying to find this instant
gratification and pleasure

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:35.830 align:middle line:84%
makes people sometimes try
to be somebody they're not,

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.090 align:middle line:90%
which is a vicious cycle.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.780 align:middle line:84%
>> For me, I ate and I
watched movies and TV.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.220 align:middle line:90%
And that was what I used to do.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.460 align:middle line:84%
As soon as I got home,
I'd start eating junk food

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.220 align:middle line:84%
and watching whatever
was on cable TV.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.510 align:middle line:90%
I would just check out.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.730 align:middle line:84%
Any chance I could to
check out, I was gone.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.370 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to
be anesthetized.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And my drug of choice
was TV, movies, and food.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.564 align:middle line:84%
>> I think to get
through that time,

00:01:05.564 --> 00:01:07.390 align:middle line:84%
I look back now
and I think well,

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.540 align:middle line:84%
I probably had some depression
a little bit going on.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's not a typical
life experience for me.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:21.190 align:middle line:84%
But I also think
I soothed myself

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.790 align:middle line:84%
by numbing myself and doing
that in a variety of ways

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.030 align:middle line:90%
that I don't think are helpful.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Going to work on
Monday, getting to Friday,

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.600 align:middle line:84%
like I used to do, being
really excited for Friday,

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.870 align:middle line:84%
then self-medicating
again till Monday.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.820 align:middle line:90%
And then wash, rinse, repeat.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.230 align:middle line:84%
>> In our society today, as we
know it, is distraction-based.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.420 align:middle line:84%
If you think about all
the time that people

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.320 align:middle line:84%
spend on the internet and
on social media sites,

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.900 align:middle line:84%
and that's another way
that people can really

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.760 align:middle line:84%
check out and
distract themselves.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And keep them from really
going for what they want.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And so often, people go on
these social media sites

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.340 align:middle line:84%
and they look at what
other people are doing

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.440 align:middle line:84%
and then they get jealous
or they get upset.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And then they think,
who am I in the world?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.740 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not as good as they are.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes this recursive,
scarcity-type thinking.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.560 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of people spend
hours a day consuming reality

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:25.090 align:middle line:84%
television, hours a day watching
stuff that's just mental crap.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.270 align:middle line:84%
That I think they're just
unaware of the effect

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.240 align:middle line:90%
it's having on their brain.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.830 align:middle line:90%
On their perception.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.810 align:middle line:84%
On how much it really
affects their expectation

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.970 align:middle line:84%
model and their financial,
emotional, physical

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.820 align:middle line:84%
relationship, health set
points of what they expect.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.950 align:middle line:90%
And I think some of it's good.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.920 align:middle line:84%
However, I think, most
of it's detrimental.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:54.230 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.855 align:middle line:84%
>> And the whole time
I was doing this,

00:02:55.855 --> 00:02:57.500 align:middle line:90%
I was also gaining weight.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.050 align:middle line:84%
So over an 11-year period,
I gained over 200 pounds.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.660 align:middle line:84%
I went from about 180
pounds to 409 pounds.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.960 align:middle line:84%
Trying to diet and all that
kind of stuff, but just pushing

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.730 align:middle line:90%
and pushing and pushing.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And being in a job that I
was somewhat successful at,

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.120 align:middle line:84%
I had about 15 brokers
working under me.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.330 align:middle line:84%
But killing myself working night
and day, hoping that someday

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.640 align:middle line:90%
I could retire.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.775 align:middle line:84%
And it was like a carrot that
was dangled in front of me

00:03:27.775 --> 00:03:29.530 align:middle line:90%
for my whole existence.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And hating every
minute of my existence

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.960 align:middle line:90%
and literally hating it.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
compound the hating

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.600 align:middle line:84%
of the existence with 200
pounds of excess weight,

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.930 align:middle line:90%
it's a living nightmare.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.260 align:middle line:84%
So it got to the
point where I felt

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.450 align:middle line:84%
like I was on this
treadmill that was going too

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.340 align:middle line:90%
fast with nowhere to get off.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.187 align:middle line:84%
>> In the midst of
the economic crisis,

00:03:50.187 --> 00:03:51.520 align:middle line:90%
I was watching the news one day.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And they have these
little tickers

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.810 align:middle line:84%
that go underneath the news
these days, a 24-hour news

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.400 align:middle line:84%
and they got seven things going
on on the screen, one of them

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.710 align:middle line:90%
is this ticker below.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And it goes past that right
in the middle of this housing

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.910 align:middle line:84%
crisis, you hear all
this news, everybody

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.520 align:middle line:90%
is getting foreclosed on--

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.920 align:middle line:84%
93% of Americans are on
time with their mortgage.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And it went by so quickly and
I could never find it online.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:20.769 align:middle line:84%
Where did that
statistic come from?

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.990 align:middle line:84%
I was watching news
and my impression

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.903 align:middle line:84%
was everybody was
going bankrupt.

00:04:24.903 --> 00:04:26.320 align:middle line:84%
Everybody was
losing their houses.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.130 align:middle line:84%
Everybody was getting
foreclosed on.

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.280 align:middle line:90%
And I think there's some--

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.190 align:middle line:84%
get you to watch the news of
it's dramatic and negative

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.070 align:middle line:90%
stuff.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think that kind
of consciousness--

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.680 align:middle line:84%
I turned off the news for
a while because I was like,

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.140 align:middle line:90%
I can't watch this.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing better each year
and they're telling me no,

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.380 align:middle line:90%
everything's getting worse.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.930 align:middle line:84%
>> I do believe
that as a species,

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.060 align:middle line:90%
we do have a negativity bias.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.730 align:middle line:84%
Our attention is drawn
toward the negative.

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.780 align:middle line:84%
In the media, in school,
the teacher's attention

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.730 align:middle line:84%
focuses on the kid who's
creating a problem, a behavior

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:02.530 align:middle line:90%
problem.

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.050 align:middle line:84%
Because he doesn't
want to sit still

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.870 align:middle line:84%
when he's learning because
that's not who he is.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.225 align:middle line:84%
Negativity bias is
real and it's natural.

00:05:10.225 --> 00:05:13.030 align:middle line:90%


00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.860 align:middle line:90%
And it's false.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.240 align:middle line:90%
It's a false set of blinders.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And we obsessively
focus on the negative.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:29.620 align:middle line:84%
>> The human species
is wired for survival.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.650 align:middle line:84%
And to move away from
pain, real or imagined,

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.150 align:middle line:90%
and to move towards pleasure.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.120 align:middle line:84%
Move towards love and away from
being ashamed or embarrassed.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.740 align:middle line:84%
And so there are
driving genetic forces

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:52.360 align:middle line:84%
that wants to keep us in our
comfort zone into this paradigm

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.850 align:middle line:90%
that we have gotten used to.

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And things are changing
so fast right now,

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.050 align:middle line:84%
that it's causing
a lot of people

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.195 align:middle line:84%
to activate the fear
circuits in their brain.

00:06:05.195 --> 00:06:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And when the fear circuits
in the brain are activated,

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.520 align:middle line:84%
the motivational
circuit in the brain

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.040 align:middle line:90%
is actually dwindled down.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.820 align:middle line:84%
>> You get invited into
scarcity, and fear,

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.770 align:middle line:90%
and poverty mentality.

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.290 align:middle line:90%
And it's just an invitation.

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:24.850 align:middle line:84%
You can RSVP, you don't have to
attend that particular party.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to come
to the scarcity party,

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.260 align:middle line:84%
as much as the media
might invite me, as much

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.530 align:middle line:84%
as my friends might invite
me, or family might invite me.

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:34.987 align:middle line:84%
There is that moment of
choice where you say,

00:06:34.987 --> 00:06:36.820 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to hang
around with that stuff.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.328 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to have that input.

00:06:38.328 --> 00:06:40.870 align:middle line:84%
Because I know it could affect
me at the non-conscious level.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.025 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going there.

00:06:42.025 --> 00:06:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>> I always knew that there was
something wrong with what I was

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:46.780 align:middle line:90%
doing.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:52.210 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
if I had any free time,

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.780 align:middle line:84%
I was more concerned
with distracting myself

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:00.310 align:middle line:84%
than trying to find any
kind of meaningful solution.

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.390 align:middle line:84%
So I was already working
as hard as I could

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.030 align:middle line:84%
and if I had any
free time, I was

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:05.710 align:middle line:90%
going to be distracting myself.

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:05.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Well.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:06.818 align:middle line:90%
I think a lot of times.

00:07:06.818 --> 00:07:10.040 align:middle line:84%
We distract
ourselves from having

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.040 align:middle line:84%
a more abundant lifestyle
or abundant way of thinking

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.330 align:middle line:84%
or being because we're
not focusing on what's

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.040 align:middle line:90%
positive in our lives.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.260 align:middle line:84%
You're focusing on the
pain and the troubles.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And what isn't going
to go right and how

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.727 align:middle line:90%
the future won't serve you.

00:07:24.727 --> 00:07:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to try to numb
out on that because there's not

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:28.900 align:middle line:90%
much hope with that.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.932 align:middle line:84%
And I think people
often get a sense when

00:07:30.932 --> 00:07:32.640 align:middle line:84%
they have limiting
beliefs-- for example,

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.000 align:middle line:84%
if they think I'm not the
kind of person that will never

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.850 align:middle line:84%
be successful, then they're
going to live up to that.

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>> And so the
question then becomes,

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.660 align:middle line:90%
do my beliefs serve me?

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:48.350 align:middle line:84%
Do my beliefs move
me towards what

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:53.030 align:middle line:84%
it is that I want or
away from what I want?

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:54.980 align:middle line:84%
Do my habits, which
are also nothing

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.880 align:middle line:84%
more than neural
patterns in the brain,

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:03.690 align:middle line:84%
create a life that
I want or not?

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:07.010 align:middle line:84%
Are they constructive
or destructive?

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:11.360 align:middle line:84%
Are they habits that
serve me or don't?

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Where do I want to go?

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:15.190 align:middle line:90%
And so I went on a journey.

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:17.367 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, that
journey is never-ending,

00:08:17.367 --> 00:08:18.950 align:middle line:84%
but really, a big
part of that journey

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:22.560 align:middle line:84%
was defining what I wanted to
do with the rest of my life.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.830 align:middle line:84%
It was like I've
got everything now,

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:27.710 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about where--
that was phase one.

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:29.553 align:middle line:84%
Here's phase two,
where am I going to go?

00:08:29.553 --> 00:08:30.470 align:middle line:90%
What am I going to do?

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.047 align:middle line:84%
What do I want my
life to look like?

00:08:32.047 --> 00:08:32.880 align:middle line:90%
Who do I want to be?

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.463 align:middle line:84%
What do I want my
relationships to be?

00:08:34.463 --> 00:08:35.460 align:middle line:90%
What friends do I want?

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:38.167 align:middle line:84%
What kind of a husband
do I want to be?

00:08:38.167 --> 00:08:39.750 align:middle line:84%
What do I want my
physical self to be?

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:40.940 align:middle line:90%
How about my community?

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:44.090 align:middle line:84%
>> If we knew where we want
to go rather than where

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:45.610 align:middle line:90%
we've been--

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:49.710 align:middle line:84%
you can focus on where you've
been and try and sort that out,

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:50.773 align:middle line:90%
but that's difficult--

00:08:50.773 --> 00:08:52.190 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the
ways is to have

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:55.610 align:middle line:84%
the future call us and
pull us where we'd rather

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:58.850 align:middle line:84%
be with money, with our
lives, with our experience,

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:00.350 align:middle line:90%
with our relationships.

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:02.960 align:middle line:84%
And have that sense
of here's where

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:07.340 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to go and then have
that influence you to pull you

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:10.850 align:middle line:84%
away from those old
limiting beliefs, and ideas,

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:14.960 align:middle line:84%
and unhelpful influences
to where you want to be.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:21.150 align:middle line:84%
>> How it is that we speak to
ourselves creates our outcome

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:21.950 align:middle line:90%
in life.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:24.590 align:middle line:90%
It creates our experience.

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:29.090 align:middle line:84%
So when we want to
live an authentic life,

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:33.260 align:middle line:84%
a life of alignment,
it's really important

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:37.390 align:middle line:84%
what we say to ourselves,
the words we choose.

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:40.730 align:middle line:84%
So when a problem comes
up, if you start to say,

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:41.730 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what to do.

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:43.490 align:middle line:90%
How am I going to handle this?

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:48.690 align:middle line:84%
You create a whole
path of possibilities.

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:52.280 align:middle line:84%
But if you change your words
and change your thoughts

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:57.980 align:middle line:84%
and start with I know
exactly what to do,

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.920 align:middle line:84%
you open up a
completely different set

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.980 align:middle line:90%
of options for yourself.

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:08.750 align:middle line:84%
Not only options, but a new
experience of confidence,

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:13.850 align:middle line:84%
of alignment, of trusting in the
truth and the process of life

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:17.810 align:middle line:84%
and of your highest good,
being able to be part of how

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:21.090 align:middle line:90%
you live every single day.

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:25.210 align:middle line:84%
So by saying, I know
exactly what to do,

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:29.090 align:middle line:84%
even if at that moment you're
not exactly sure, that's OK.

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:33.150 align:middle line:84%
You start by asserting I
know exactly what to do.

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see that
your shoulders relax.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:38.480 align:middle line:90%
Your body starts to relax.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And it opens up new ways for
you to take your very next step.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:43.760 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>> So what's kind of scary is
when we look at life and we

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:51.950 align:middle line:84%
make positive shifts and we
make changes is that we go back

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:53.930 align:middle line:84%
to whatever it is
we're comfortable.

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And what's really
sad about that is

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:59.720 align:middle line:84%
most people are comfortable
with worry, anxiety, and doubt.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:00.890 align:middle line:90%
And that's the truth.

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:02.510 align:middle line:90%
Because they're used to it.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:06.500 align:middle line:84%
>> I did oscillate, for sure,
between still being scared

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:10.700 align:middle line:84%
and having moments of knowing
it was all going to be OK.

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And going back to being
scared and then knowing it

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:14.690 align:middle line:90%
was going to be OK.

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:17.480 align:middle line:84%
>> As I have
learned to meditate,

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:20.240 align:middle line:84%
I've learned to accept
whatever I'm feeling.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And that involves
sometimes accepting

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:28.100 align:middle line:90%
very painful feelings.

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.860 align:middle line:84%
Feelings of embarrassment
or certainly,

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:34.370 align:middle line:84%
feelings of vulnerability,
feelings of shame,

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:44.240 align:middle line:84%
feelings of anger,
and self-blame.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And just accepting and
staying in that space.

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's a hard
place to stay with.

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.420 align:middle line:84%
That's, I guess, the part
of us that in other lives

00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:02.340 align:middle line:84%
might have soothed over it with
another meal, or another drink,

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:06.890 align:middle line:84%
or something, or gossiping
with people to make ourselves

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:08.640 align:middle line:90%
feel better.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:12.410 align:middle line:84%
But instead, just staying with
it, and holding that space,

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:18.590 align:middle line:84%
and exploring it to see
what I have to learn there.

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:21.242 align:middle line:90%
What it has to teach me.

00:12:21.242 --> 00:12:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And just risking feeling it
in all the ways that I can.

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:34.100 align:middle line:84%
And what I know
from experience--

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:37.660 align:middle line:84%
I forget this, but I
relearn it many times over--

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:42.260 align:middle line:84%
is that it melts away
when I stay with it.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:47.180 align:middle line:84%
>> The first step to being
able to use your intuition is

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:48.860 align:middle line:90%
to listen.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:52.640 align:middle line:84%
You have to listen to your
intuition to access it.

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And the way that you
listen to your intuition

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:02.330 align:middle line:84%
is you create a
space of stillness.

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:05.060 align:middle line:84%
You give yourself
the opportunity

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:12.080 align:middle line:84%
to pause, to wait for your
intuition to speak to you.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:16.980 align:middle line:84%
For you to wait for
your truth or stillness.

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:21.800 align:middle line:84%
For that small quiet
voice to come to you.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.870 align:middle line:90%
It's like holding a dove.

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:26.660 align:middle line:84%
If you squeeze it
too tight, you're

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:28.240 align:middle line:90%
going to squeeze the dove.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.230 align:middle line:84%
If it's too loose,
it's going to fly off.

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:33.530 align:middle line:84%
So there's this
perfect sweet spot

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:38.780 align:middle line:84%
where you've created the
space and the opportunity

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:43.820 align:middle line:84%
for stillness, for quietness,
for the pause where you can

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:47.240 align:middle line:90%
allow the truth to come to you.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:50.660 align:middle line:84%
Just wait for it and
allow it to come to you.

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:52.840 align:middle line:90%
Don't force it.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And when you practice
this every day,

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:59.330 align:middle line:84%
just a little bit
every single day,

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:01.940 align:middle line:84%
then you create a
whole life where

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:04.250 align:middle line:90%
you give yourself that chance.

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:08.570 align:middle line:84%
Each day to wait and let
the truth come to you.

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:11.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And what happens is you
begin to honor and acknowledge

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:15.930 align:middle line:84%
whatever those feelings are
rather than push them away,

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:17.570 align:middle line:84%
which is what a lot
of people will do.

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:20.300 align:middle line:84%
They'll get a negative
feeling or a bad feeling

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:23.360 align:middle line:84%
about their life or the way it
is and so what a lot of people

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.460 align:middle line:90%
do is they self-medicate.

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:26.540 align:middle line:90%
They'll eat too much.

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:28.430 align:middle line:90%
They'll drink too much.

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:30.890 align:middle line:84%
They'll take on
addictive behaviors

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:33.380 align:middle line:90%
or they become apathetic.

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And the best thing you can do
is acknowledge those feelings.

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And find out what the
positive intention

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:46.350 align:middle line:84%
is behind them or the positive
purpose and then move forward.

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And when you begin to do that,
all kinds of opportunities

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:51.200 align:middle line:90%
will open up for you.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:57.710 align:middle line:84%
>> So I started living with
this understanding that the real

00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:00.760 align:middle line:84%
meaning of life for me was
to deepen this connection,

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:01.910 align:middle line:90%
this internal connection.

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:05.260 align:middle line:84%
And that would give
me a purpose in life.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And so my purpose became
channeling that energy,

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:10.620 align:middle line:90%
that was my purpose.

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And from there, I
went on to write

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:16.100 align:middle line:84%
several books that have
been translated to 16

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.380 align:middle line:90%
languages in 60 countries.

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And I've gone on to
speak all over the world.

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:24.240 align:middle line:84%
But none of it is me
as I think of myself,

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.630 align:middle line:90%
it's just this channeled energy.

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And what I came to
understand is that my purpose

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:33.937 align:middle line:84%
is to connect with this energy,
channel it, surrender to it,

00:15:33.937 --> 00:15:35.270 align:middle line:90%
and allow it to work through me.

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:37.100 align:middle line:84%
And as long as I'm
doing that, I'm

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:39.710 align:middle line:84%
always exactly where
I'm meant to be.

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:42.050 align:middle line:84%
Doing exactly what
I'm meant to be doing.

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Years ago, I was assisting
a photographer who was working

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:46.850 align:middle line:90%
on this shoot.

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And Pavarotti was the subject
of this photography shoot.

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.608 align:middle line:84%
And it was a big
news event, a junket.

00:15:53.608 --> 00:15:55.400 align:middle line:84%
So there were different
new stations there.

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And this little woman
from a tacky news--

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:02.150 align:middle line:84%
she came up so Pavarotti,
you are so disciplined.

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:04.260 align:middle line:84%
You go to bed at night
and you rest your voice,

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:09.490 align:middle line:84%
and he said it's not
discipline, it's devotion.

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:12.890 align:middle line:90%
And I will never forget that.

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:14.715 align:middle line:84%
So when you're
devoted to your craft,

00:16:14.715 --> 00:16:17.090 align:middle line:84%
you're devoted to your art,
your devoted to your mission,

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:18.800 align:middle line:90%
it's not about discipline.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.140 align:middle line:90%
It's about a place of love.

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:25.850 align:middle line:84%
>> To truly know when it's time
to move on, one of the things I

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:27.275 align:middle line:90%
go back to is passion.

00:16:27.275 --> 00:16:30.100 align:middle line:90%


00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:34.150 align:middle line:90%
Is my passion still there?

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:39.100 align:middle line:84%
Am I feeling as alive
and excited about diving

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:40.890 align:middle line:90%
into it, again?

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:46.030 align:middle line:84%
Or do I have a sense of dread
about getting going and doing

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:47.510 align:middle line:90%
it yet another time?

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And when my passion starts to
wane, I either need some rest,

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:58.030 align:middle line:84%
and that's valid, or I need to
think about whether it's time

00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:06.250 align:middle line:84%
to move on, to let that
go, and let some open space

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:09.520 align:middle line:84%
take place so that
something new can be born.

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:14.619 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there is effort, but
the effort is joy and passion.

00:17:14.619 --> 00:17:17.030 align:middle line:84%
The effort is in keeping
those connections,

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:19.660 align:middle line:84%
those channels open,
but there's so much joy

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:21.460 align:middle line:90%
in keeping those channels open.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:26.589 align:middle line:84%
>> Passion is the number
one goal we should see.

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:28.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me change
that-- it's number two.

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:30.730 align:middle line:84%
Number one should be,
who am I authentically?

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:34.150 align:middle line:84%
Finding your authentic self
and your authentic path.

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And then because
passion comes from that,

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:39.010 align:middle line:84%
passion comes from
your authenticity,

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:43.880 align:middle line:84%
we find passion within living
within an authentic space.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And so, the second quest
for every human being

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:50.860 align:middle line:90%
should be to find their passion.

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:54.580 align:middle line:84%
Because it's passion
that fuels everything.

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:55.570 align:middle line:90%
It's the motivator.

00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:56.840 align:middle line:90%
It's the driver.

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.710 align:middle line:90%
It fuels everything.

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:01.570 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm not separate from
that which created me.

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:05.170 align:middle line:84%
A lot of religions say
believe in this religion

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:06.970 align:middle line:84%
and do this or that,
and you will one day

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:09.053 align:middle line:84%
be one with that
which created you.

00:18:09.053 --> 00:18:09.970 align:middle line:90%
I don't buy into that.

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:12.460 align:middle line:84%
I believe I'm already one
with that which created me,

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:14.810 align:middle line:84%
I just have to become
more aware of that.

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:17.750 align:middle line:84%
So I just seek to become
more aware of that every day.

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:18.550 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And the more I become aware of
that, there's nothing missing.

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:27.400 align:middle line:84%
There isn't anything
missing at all.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:30.100 align:middle line:84%
Everything is in perfect
order and harmony,

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:31.690 align:middle line:90%
just the way it is.

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:36.520 align:middle line:84%
If I don't like what
is, I have to change.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:37.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm the one who has to change.

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:39.920 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing in
my external world,

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.290 align:middle line:84%
not one person,
not one experience,

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:46.550 align:middle line:84%
not one thought of somebody
else's that has to change.

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:49.060 align:middle line:90%
It's all up to me.

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:52.000 align:middle line:84%
>> So the system, when
you're in the system,

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.060 align:middle line:90%
it really is a choice.

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:55.210 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to be controlled.

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:56.530 align:middle line:90%
You can do what you want.

00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:58.480 align:middle line:90%
You can use the system.

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.910 align:middle line:84%
I think so many people
have the victim mentality.

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:03.530 align:middle line:84%
They say gosh, it
didn't work out for me.

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:04.330 align:middle line:90%
This isn't working.

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:05.020 align:middle line:90%
I got my degree.

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:06.937 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of the
day, it's just a system.

00:19:06.937 --> 00:19:09.970 align:middle line:84%
So pull back, understand
it, and use it.

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:11.020 align:middle line:90%
That's what's great.

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:12.910 align:middle line:84%
The system is actually,
pretty cool when

00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:15.130 align:middle line:90%
you understand how to use it.

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:16.960 align:middle line:90%
You can leverage time.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:20.830 align:middle line:84%
You can leverage all kinds
of resources around you.

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And it just takes an open
mind to be able to do that.

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:26.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's really important
that it is a choice.

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:27.980 align:middle line:90%
Abundance is a choice.

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:29.575 align:middle line:90%
It's a decision that you make.

00:19:29.575 --> 00:19:31.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Now when you start
wasting time like that,

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:33.825 align:middle line:84%
when it's down here, it means
you don't really value that

00:19:33.825 --> 00:19:34.877 align:middle line:90%
time so much.

00:19:34.877 --> 00:19:37.210 align:middle line:84%
If, on the other hand, you're
at this level where you're

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:39.940 align:middle line:84%
actually saying
every hour of time

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:42.443 align:middle line:84%
that I waste is an hour I can
never get back-- with money

00:19:42.443 --> 00:19:43.360 align:middle line:90%
I can always get more.

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.720 align:middle line:84%
But with time, when it's
gone, it's gone forever.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:50.578 align:middle line:84%
The moment you just confront
that and say it's gone forever

00:19:50.578 --> 00:19:52.870 align:middle line:84%
and it's never coming back,
I must make the most of it.

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:55.420 align:middle line:84%
What could I be doing
with that hour right now?

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:56.680 align:middle line:90%
You do stop watching the TV.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.297 align:middle line:84%
You do stop actually
procrastinating.

00:19:58.297 --> 00:20:00.130 align:middle line:84%
You do stop actually
saying it's OK for this

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:01.490 align:middle line:90%
to happen for another day.

00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:04.080 align:middle line:84%
And you do say no, it's
going to change now.

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:11.350 align:middle line:90%
