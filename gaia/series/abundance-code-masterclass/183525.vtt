00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.520 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel that the natural
questioning that should be

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.440 align:middle line:84%
arising when we're in states
of anything less than abundance

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.000 align:middle line:90%
we've abandoned.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.410 align:middle line:90%
We've betrayed.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.720 align:middle line:84%
We've betrayed because
someone somewhere

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.360 align:middle line:90%
has told us, don't question.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.310 align:middle line:90%
This is the path to freedom.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.400 align:middle line:90%
This is the path to happiness.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.810 align:middle line:84%
Stick to that, you
will follow it.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.640 align:middle line:90%
But it's not true.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.010 align:middle line:90%
It's just not true.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.620 align:middle line:84%
It's a bunch of lies that are
continuously being reinforced

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.450 align:middle line:84%
by the people that gain
benefit from it, which there's

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.460 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people who gain
benefit from a lot more people's

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.790 align:middle line:84%
struggle and toil and emotional,
physical, and mental anguish

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.110 align:middle line:90%
and unhealth.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.650 align:middle line:84%
>> No change really, I think,
is possible until you start

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.080 align:middle line:90%
to examine why.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.640 align:middle line:90%
Why do I do what I do?

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.840 align:middle line:90%
What is the pattern?

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.140 align:middle line:90%
Where did that come from?

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.670 align:middle line:90%
When did it start?

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.110 align:middle line:90%
Why did it start?

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.690 align:middle line:84%
Why did I choose
to believe about it

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.570 align:middle line:90%
when that thing happened?

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.050 align:middle line:90%
And why do I keep recreating it?

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.260 align:middle line:90%


00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.700 align:middle line:90%
And is it what I want?

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.540 align:middle line:90%
Is that what I want?

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.510 align:middle line:84%
Do I want to be stuck in
that loop, vortex, prison

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.680 align:middle line:84%
for the rest of my life, or
do I want something else?

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Very few people have taken
the time to really go deep

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.480 align:middle line:84%
and ask themselves, what is it
that would bring me the most

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.750 align:middle line:90%
joy and happiness in my life?

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.310 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of what
anybody else says,

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.727 align:middle line:84%
regardless of what
the media says,

00:01:56.727 --> 00:02:00.530 align:middle line:84%
regardless of what my parents
said or your parents said

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.420 align:middle line:84%
or your brothers or
sisters or friends,

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.527 align:middle line:84%
what would it mean for me to
be happy and to be successful?

00:02:08.527 --> 00:02:10.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of us aren't even
aware that's what's happening.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.010 align:middle line:84%
So we go through tough
times where we don't even

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.560 align:middle line:84%
see the lessons necessarily
because it's so painful.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.660 align:middle line:84%
We go through things
where we're on our own,

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.160 align:middle line:84%
and we don't even
realize that those

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.785 align:middle line:84%
are the times when
we really understood

00:02:20.785 --> 00:02:24.290 align:middle line:84%
perseverance and persistence
and self-reliance.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's really when we
actually pause at any moment

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.600 align:middle line:84%
and we look and say, OK,
wherever I am right now,

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.190 align:middle line:84%
even if is really tough, this
is chapter 4 in the book--

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.240 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of like if you
didn't have this time,

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.740 align:middle line:84%
it wouldn't make the
rest the book exciting.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.990 align:middle line:84%
So what does that mean for
chapter 8, for chapter 10--

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.700 align:middle line:90%
so constantly looking ahead.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.750 align:middle line:84%
>> If one is stuck in life
and they're not feeling

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.650 align:middle line:84%
the abundance that they
really yearn for in life,

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.230 align:middle line:84%
there's probably some part
within ourselves that we have

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.670 align:middle line:90%
abandoned questioning.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.560 align:middle line:84%
Not only abandoned it,
we may have questions

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.670 align:middle line:84%
that have come up, but we
set it aside, push it down,

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.240 align:middle line:84%
or, even worse, betrayed our
natural innate question of,

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.230 align:middle line:90%
is this right?

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.330 align:middle line:84%
Is it really right
that I am coming

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.330 align:middle line:90%
home exhausted every day?

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.080 align:middle line:84%
Is it really right that
I'm showing my children

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.010 align:middle line:84%
that I need to break
my back, break my soul,

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.390 align:middle line:84%
break my health so that
they can have a better life?

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.850 align:middle line:84%
>> When I checked out of the
corporate world it was with no

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.350 align:middle line:90%
grand plan whatsoever.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.930 align:middle line:84%
I just knew the corporate
world was not working for me.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.920 align:middle line:84%
I was a round peg
in a square hole

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.790 align:middle line:84%
in terms of getting
anything done,

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.560 align:middle line:84%
in terms of understanding the
politics, but also just this--

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.620 align:middle line:84%
I never wanted to
lead a normal life.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.620 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to lead the
life that I grew up in.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.720 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in you go to school,
you go to college, you get out,

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.290 align:middle line:84%
and you work for a company for
40 or 45 years or whatever.

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.490 align:middle line:90%
And it just never--

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:05.640 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want that.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.830 align:middle line:84%
>> I remember the day that
I first enjoyed saying,

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.870 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.150 align:middle line:84%
It was so freeing
to be able to say,

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.950 align:middle line:84%
without trying to fudge or
hide or be someone else,

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.660 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.100 align:middle line:84%
It's OK to not know
everything all the time

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.390 align:middle line:90%
or to know it all in advance.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are
times where you do

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.280 align:middle line:84%
need to know where
you're going, what

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.250 align:middle line:84%
you're doing, what your
plan is, what your goal is.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.810 align:middle line:84%
But you have to also have
in there the ability to say,

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't know,
because the truth is

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.420 align:middle line:84%
there are plenty of
times when we don't know.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:45.620 align:middle line:90%
And don't fight that.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.460 align:middle line:90%
Own it.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.260 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy it.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.370 align:middle line:84%
Be present with that
moment of I don't know,

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't have it all
figured out right now.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.300 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.700 align:middle line:84%
When the time comes that
you need that next piece,

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.630 align:middle line:90%
it will be available to you.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.860 align:middle line:84%
Allow it to come to
you in the right time.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:07.490 align:middle line:84%
And for now, allow yourself
to just not know, and it's OK.

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think that the
caterpillar knows what

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:17.810 align:middle line:84%
it's going to become when it
packs itself into its cocoon,

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.650 align:middle line:84%
when it goes within,
when it retreats,

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.640 align:middle line:84%
when it separates itself from
the world so it can become

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.380 align:middle line:84%
something new,
separates and waits?

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.780 align:middle line:84%
Often I think people
don't have patience.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.060 align:middle line:84%
They want that
transformation now.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.290 align:middle line:84%
They want to be what
they want to become now.

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:45.730 align:middle line:84%
And they want to know what
they're going to become.

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:46.570 align:middle line:90%
They want certainty.

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:51.310 align:middle line:84%
They want to know what the
journey has in store for them.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.340 align:middle line:84%
But the caterpillar
doesn't know what's coming.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.070 align:middle line:84%
The caterpillar
doesn't know that he's

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:01.300 align:middle line:90%
going to become a butterfly.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.180 align:middle line:84%
But he knows-- he
follows the imperative,

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:09.070 align:middle line:84%
the natural imperative, and
he just does the next thing.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:14.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm building my cocoon,
and now I'm waiting,

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:19.360 align:middle line:84%
and now I'm squirming,
and now I feel

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.490 align:middle line:90%
constrained and constricted.

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.800 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm poking my
head out of my cocoon.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.510 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm tapping on the
cocoon, breaking it open.

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm stretching, and
now I'm letting my wings dry.

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:37.560 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know what they
are, but they have to dry.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.370 align:middle line:90%
And now I'm flying.

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.336 align:middle line:90%
I've never done that before.

00:06:40.336 --> 00:06:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know how I know
how to do it, but I do.

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:46.720 align:middle line:90%


00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.460 align:middle line:90%
You'll be OK.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.550 align:middle line:84%
You might not necessarily
know what's coming.

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.040 align:middle line:84%
But whatever it is that
you need will be there

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:57.590 align:middle line:90%
when you need it and not before.

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.680 align:middle line:90%
And it'll be OK.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.100 align:middle line:84%
>> One of things that I
believe is the characteristic

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.950 align:middle line:84%
of a highly successful
person today,

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:09.940 align:middle line:84%
one of the characteristics,
is adaptability to change.

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.840 align:middle line:84%
>> It's really important
to let go of things,

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.020 align:middle line:84%
to just be able to let go,
to not have so much judgment

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.920 align:middle line:90%
on yourself, to just let go.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:19.720 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.300 align:middle line:90%
We all make mistakes.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:22.750 align:middle line:90%
There is no perfect world.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Actually, life is actually
pretty messy, and that's OK.

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:27.180 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.810 align:middle line:84%
When something doesn't
work out or you

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:30.670 align:middle line:84%
don't do something
the way you'd hoped

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:34.570 align:middle line:84%
you would or you wanted
to or you had expectations

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:38.045 align:middle line:84%
of how you should be and it
didn't happen that way, let it

00:07:38.045 --> 00:07:38.845 align:middle line:90%
go.

00:07:38.845 --> 00:07:40.390 align:middle line:90%
Move forward.

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:43.600 align:middle line:84%
When you do that, really
you open yourself up

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.330 align:middle line:84%
to the next opportunity,
the next moment.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:47.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Today is new.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:48.730 align:middle line:90%
Today is fresh.

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:52.830 align:middle line:90%
Today is a bed of possibility.

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:55.600 align:middle line:84%
>> So when I got into that
witness place where I was

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.960 align:middle line:84%
observing myself
and healing myself,

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.590 align:middle line:84%
I saw that there may have been a
choice to have a negative story

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:03.640 align:middle line:90%
about my life.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:07.270 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, I felt
so much support around me

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:09.500 align:middle line:90%
to grow and to heal.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.520 align:middle line:90%
And I was making the most of it.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I wasn't doing
something that I hated anymore.

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:17.747 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't running scared.

00:08:17.747 --> 00:08:20.080 align:middle line:84%
I didn't care about anything
except that I had that day.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.600 align:middle line:84%
Like, to me, if
I had a day where

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.230 align:middle line:84%
I knew I had a roof over my
head and I knew I had food,

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:27.900 align:middle line:90%
I was in heaven.

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was not a person
on this planet that was more

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:33.789 align:middle line:84%
happier, more grateful,
more appreciative

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:37.390 align:middle line:84%
that I had just that day that
I could just heal and not

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:40.809 align:middle line:84%
be forced to go out and be in
a cubicle and crunch numbers

00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:43.900 align:middle line:84%
and scream at people
and run scared.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.610 align:middle line:84%
I was the happiest
person in the world.

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:46.930 align:middle line:90%
So I only saw opportunity.

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:48.250 align:middle line:90%
I only saw blessing.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:52.450 align:middle line:84%
And I saw a chance to whatever
it was to overcome it.

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And I only, just
at that time, got

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:58.010 align:middle line:84%
an inkling of how much
healing could take place.

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:00.480 align:middle line:84%
But it started to take on a
life of its own at that point.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:04.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I have back slides all
the time into a more fearful

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:09.370 align:middle line:84%
mindset or a panicked
mindset or a narrow mindset.

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:10.840 align:middle line:90%
It happens all the time.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's just like
a meditation practice.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.650 align:middle line:84%
I notice that I am
back in that space,

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:21.460 align:middle line:84%
and I gently remind myself
to look at a larger picture

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:22.900 align:middle line:90%
and to be still with it.

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:24.910 align:middle line:90%
I have that happen all the time.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't worry
me anymore because it

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:29.530 align:middle line:84%
doesn't make me think
I'm not cut out for this.

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:30.790 align:middle line:90%
It used to.

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:34.420 align:middle line:84%
Now I just recognize it for what
it is, which is an old pattern.

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:36.460 align:middle line:84%
Very often old patterns
will continue to come up

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:37.830 align:middle line:90%
your whole life long.

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:42.085 align:middle line:84%
It's learning that you
are not your old patterns.

00:09:42.085 --> 00:09:43.460 align:middle line:84%
They're just things
that come up,

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:47.710 align:middle line:84%
and you can let them come and
go, and that is totally OK.

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:49.720 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
difference lies.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Making the transition--
for a lot of people,

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.340 align:middle line:84%
making the transition, well,
from scarcity to abundance is

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:55.450 align:middle line:90%
a huge thing.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:10:00.310 align:middle line:84%
But, specifically, from living
within the so-called system,

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:02.590 align:middle line:84%
living within a secure
job, well, I mean,

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:04.620 align:middle line:84%
we've seen that get
blown up completely

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:08.170 align:middle line:84%
because when I entered into
the corporate world whatever,

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:10.717 align:middle line:84%
20 or 30 years ago,
that was the idea

00:10:10.717 --> 00:10:12.300 align:middle line:84%
is you start working
for a big company

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.717 align:middle line:84%
and they take care
of you forever,

00:10:13.717 --> 00:10:15.520 align:middle line:90%
and so you were secure.

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:16.330 align:middle line:90%
It's gone now.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:19.100 align:middle line:84%
People get laid off after
they're with a company.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.560 align:middle line:90%
I mean, people that started--

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.422 align:middle line:84%
my peers in college who worked
for a company for 20 years

00:10:23.422 --> 00:10:24.880 align:middle line:84%
are getting laid
off left and right

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.200 align:middle line:90%
even though they do good jobs.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.290 align:middle line:90%
That's just the reality.

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:30.280 align:middle line:84%
So we know that
security in terms

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.400 align:middle line:84%
of other companies hiring you
is completely out the window.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.480 align:middle line:90%
That's just gone.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.330 align:middle line:84%
But it was always
a facade anyways.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.890 align:middle line:84%
You see, even when
you had that security,

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:42.370 align:middle line:84%
it was like the security
building this life that so

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:44.850 align:middle line:90%
many people didn't want.

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:47.687 align:middle line:90%
And now, for me--

00:10:47.687 --> 00:10:50.020 align:middle line:84%
I can just speak to my own
experience and the experience

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:54.370 align:middle line:84%
I've see in so many of my
peers and even students.

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:58.360 align:middle line:84%
The ultimate security
is having the capability

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.960 align:middle line:84%
to create enormous value in
the world and get paid for it.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.480 align:middle line:84%
There is no security
like that security.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for me, I
literally know--

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:09.890 align:middle line:84%
and I do have fairly
modest tastes,

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:12.550 align:middle line:84%
so I don't want the
latest private jet.

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:16.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to buy that,
but that I can literally

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:19.570 align:middle line:84%
have anything I want at any
point I want because I have

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:21.760 align:middle line:84%
that capability, I have
built up those strengths,

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.490 align:middle line:84%
I've built up
those capabilities,

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:27.120 align:middle line:84%
and I know I can create
enormous value for people.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And I know when I create
that value, I get paid.

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:32.200 align:middle line:84%
So I know that sounds
really big and highfalutin,

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.102 align:middle line:90%
but, I mean, on a very--

00:11:34.102 --> 00:11:35.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm in the
middle of buying

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:39.130 align:middle line:84%
a new property for my
office, for my building,

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:40.930 align:middle line:90%
for my company.

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be a lot of
money, like, a lot of money.

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:48.730 align:middle line:84%
Like, it's going to cost two or
three times what my home costs.

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:51.130 align:middle line:90%
But I know that I can just--

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:52.155 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:11:52.155 --> 00:11:55.910 align:middle line:84%
The next year, I could easily
make all that money and more

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:58.820 align:middle line:84%
just by going out and
creating another project.

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.930 align:middle line:84%
Where can I create more
value, boom, I do it,

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.320 align:middle line:90%
and I bring that money in.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.840 align:middle line:90%
So this isn't 30,000 foot level.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.070 align:middle line:90%
This is very granular.

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:08.810 align:middle line:84%
Once you have
those capabilities,

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:10.200 align:middle line:90%
that is the security.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.360 align:middle line:90%
That is ultimate security.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.940 align:middle line:84%
Whether you're doing it for
yourself or for someone else--

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:15.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could
still work within a job

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:20.270 align:middle line:84%
and build those capabilities
and have that ultimate freedom

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:23.610 align:middle line:84%
because that's the only
security there is these days.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:28.200 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's a part of all
of us that is all powerful,

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.760 align:middle line:84%
all knowing, and all loving, and
it's up to us to connect with

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:32.560 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.018 align:middle line:84%
But when we do you
connect with it,

00:12:34.018 --> 00:12:36.740 align:middle line:84%
we feel total
unconditional love.

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:38.270 align:middle line:84%
It's the greatest
gift you can give

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:41.930 align:middle line:84%
yourself is to spend time trying
to connect with that energy.

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:42.730 align:middle line:90%
It will guide you.

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:43.790 align:middle line:90%
It will support you.

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:45.530 align:middle line:84%
It will energize
you, nourish you,

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:48.800 align:middle line:84%
and you will feel so loved
and so supported in a way

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.050 align:middle line:84%
that you could never
feel in the outside world

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:53.870 align:middle line:84%
because no matter how much money
you have in the outside world,

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:56.430 align:middle line:84%
the stock market could
collapse overnight.

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:58.430 align:middle line:84%
The real estate market
could collapse overnight.

00:12:58.430 --> 00:12:59.240 align:middle line:90%
You could lose your job.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.010 align:middle line:84%
All these things could
happen overnight.

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:03.530 align:middle line:84%
The monetary system
could collapse overnight.

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:05.120 align:middle line:84%
But when you feel
this connection

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:07.195 align:middle line:84%
to this internal
support, you know

00:13:07.195 --> 00:13:09.320 align:middle line:84%
you're always in the right
place at the right time,

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.210 align:middle line:84%
you're doing exactly what
you're meant to be doing,

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:13.160 align:middle line:84%
and you're always going to
get supported because that's

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:14.880 align:middle line:84%
where your real
support comes from,

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.670 align:middle line:84%
and you've got a
connection with it.

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And so when you have that,
you feel a sense of support

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:23.620 align:middle line:84%
that you can't possibly
feel from the outside world,

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:25.490 align:middle line:90%
and that's my experience.

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:28.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Part of abundance
is accepting change.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:31.763 align:middle line:84%
Very important that you are
ready for the changes that are

00:13:31.763 --> 00:13:32.930 align:middle line:90%
going to occur in your life.

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:34.670 align:middle line:84%
If not, you'll just
flip back to lack

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:36.790 align:middle line:84%
because there's too
many reminders around us

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:39.620 align:middle line:84%
and especially if you've been
around a group of people,

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:42.410 align:middle line:84%
and the issue is most
people don't get it.

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:44.060 align:middle line:90%
Most people are in the system.

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:45.710 align:middle line:84%
So you're just going
to go right back

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:49.460 align:middle line:84%
to the way you were before if
you aren't ready for change.

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:53.640 align:middle line:84%
So abundance and prosperity
means that you embrace change.

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:57.620 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a lot of pressure
that we have in today's world

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:00.590 align:middle line:84%
to have it all figured
out all the time.

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:04.730 align:middle line:84%
You have to know what to do
and be polished all of the time

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:06.680 align:middle line:90%
and have it all figured out.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.410 align:middle line:84%
But really that
doesn't serve you

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:13.160 align:middle line:84%
because life is going to change
many times over and over again.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.790 align:middle line:84%
Even in the course of a
day, many things can happen.

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:21.140 align:middle line:84%
Really, one key
thing to remember

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:27.140 align:middle line:84%
is what is the next right
step, not the next 20 steps,

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:30.870 align:middle line:84%
not having everything all
figured out in advance,

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:36.450 align:middle line:84%
but what is the next indicated
step for me at this time?

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:40.430 align:middle line:84%
How can I be authentic right
now, in alignment right now?

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Two major things that have
helped me in my abundance,

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:44.612 align:middle line:90%
two major things--

00:14:44.612 --> 00:14:46.070 align:middle line:84%
one is from the
Course in Miracles.

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:46.670 align:middle line:90%
I carry it around.

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:47.470 align:middle line:90%
It's a little card.

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.970 align:middle line:84%
It says, "I can choose
peace instead of this."

00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:52.220 align:middle line:84%
So whatever situation
is, I know I can

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.020 align:middle line:90%
choose peace instead of this.

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:57.130 align:middle line:84%
And the other one is, when
I was really struggling,

00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:00.220 align:middle line:84%
that I am open to receive,
that I'm open to receive.

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:04.160 align:middle line:84%
And those two statements
have really helped me a lot.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.470 align:middle line:84%
>> So I felt like I had to
uncondition myself is what I

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:08.270 align:middle line:90%
felt like.

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:11.360 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I had been
wound up with years

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:14.310 align:middle line:84%
and years of programming and I
had to decompress and deprogram

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:15.110 align:middle line:90%
myself.

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And I lived in this place that
was 50 miles from anywhere.

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:22.220 align:middle line:84%
It was in the middle of nowhere,
and I just decompressed.

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And I did affirmations and
visualizations and meditations

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:30.980 align:middle line:84%
and self-love and prayer and
guidance to just deprogram

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:33.420 align:middle line:84%
and decompress all
the misinformation

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:35.660 align:middle line:84%
that I had been
given my entire life.

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:40.580 align:middle line:84%
>> I am what you might
call a spiritual pragmatist

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:46.190 align:middle line:84%
or an optimistic pragmatist
because I believe sometimes you

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:49.850 align:middle line:84%
just have to open yourself up to
that leap of faith and you have

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:54.320 align:middle line:84%
to trust and you
have to be open,

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.660 align:middle line:84%
and I also believe in keeping
your eyes open and staying

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:57.590 align:middle line:90%
aware.

00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:01.430 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes I think people
make a leap of faith,

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:03.890 align:middle line:84%
but they forget the keeping
your eyes open part.

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:05.270 align:middle line:90%
There's two sides of it.

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:07.400 align:middle line:84%
So taking a leap
of faith doesn't

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.920 align:middle line:90%
mean you quit paying attention.

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:14.900 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that you close
your eyes and jump off a cliff.

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:17.930 align:middle line:84%
It means that you
are open to what is

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:21.990 align:middle line:84%
and you have a basic trust
that the universe is basically

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:26.930 align:middle line:84%
a beautiful place, a positive
place, a source of goodness,

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:32.450 align:middle line:84%
and at the same time you are
open to a good and useful path

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:33.500 align:middle line:90%
for you.

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:40.880 align:middle line:84%
>> And I believe that the
more we become aware of life,

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:45.500 align:middle line:84%
the more we become aware
of what's really happening,

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.420 align:middle line:84%
there's no shortage
of resources.

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:49.560 align:middle line:90%
There's no shortage of tools.

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.320 align:middle line:90%
There's no shortage of money.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:52.790 align:middle line:90%
There's no shortage of health.

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:54.230 align:middle line:90%
There's no shortage of love.

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:59.130 align:middle line:84%
There's no shortage of
anything in the universe.

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And so if there's
no shortage, how do

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:03.950 align:middle line:90%
we become one with abundance?

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:08.359 align:middle line:84%
How do we become one with
there is more than enough

00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:11.119 align:middle line:90%
of everything for everybody?

00:17:11.119 --> 00:17:15.770 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1976, the year of
the American Bicentennial,

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:21.230 align:middle line:84%
I walked in to a drug store to
buy vitamins and walked past

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:25.667 align:middle line:84%
a magazine rack
that had a magazine.

00:17:25.667 --> 00:17:27.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know what
the magazine was now,

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.960 align:middle line:84%
but it was the
picture on the cover

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.960 align:middle line:84%
was the American flag
flying against a night sky

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:34.910 align:middle line:84%
with fireworks in
the background.

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And to me that said
freedom and opportunity.

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.800 align:middle line:84%
That was the image of
freedom and opportunity.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And I picked that up, and
I looked at the picture

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:47.760 align:middle line:84%
and was feeling this energy
of freedom and opportunity.

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:51.362 align:middle line:84%
And as fate would have
it, I opened the magazine

00:17:51.362 --> 00:17:53.570 align:middle line:84%
thinking there's going to
be more stuff about freedom

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:55.820 align:middle line:84%
and opportunity and I came
to that Henry David Thoreau

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:57.260 align:middle line:90%
quote--

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:01.020 align:middle line:84%
"the mass of men lead lives
of quiet desperation."

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And it was the dichotomy
between those two,

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:06.990 align:middle line:84%
that image on the cover
of freedom and opportunity

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:09.240 align:middle line:84%
and "the mass of men lead
lives of quiet desperation,"

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.250 align:middle line:84%
and for me at the
time that was true.

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:14.970 align:middle line:84%
It was true of me and
everybody else I knew.

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And that wide difference in
those two spaces created for me

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:24.150 align:middle line:84%
and an effect, an
event for me that

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:26.550 align:middle line:84%
was a significant emotional
event that was this

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:27.900 align:middle line:90%
is not all right.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.390 align:middle line:84%
It's not all right
with me, not for me

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:32.200 align:middle line:84%
or for anybody
else on the planet.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.480 align:middle line:90%
This is not all right.

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And if that's true,
then that's a problem,

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:38.610 align:middle line:90%
and that problem has--

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:41.750 align:middle line:84%
every problem has a solution,
and I'm going to find it.

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:43.740 align:middle line:84%
That set me on the
path that I've been on

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:47.920 align:middle line:90%
since 1976 to find the answer.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:50.580 align:middle line:84%
So to move people
from quiet desperation

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:54.870 align:middle line:84%
to joyous celebration, that's
where we should be living.

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:56.220 align:middle line:90%
We should be living--

00:18:56.220 --> 00:19:00.390 align:middle line:84%
I want the statement to
be the massive humanity

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:02.940 align:middle line:84%
live lives of
joyous celebration.

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:04.910 align:middle line:84%
But there's only
one authentic power.

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:07.420 align:middle line:90%
That's yours and mine and yours.

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:10.320 align:middle line:84%
So if we're living
authentically,

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.720 align:middle line:84%
we can't be following
anybody else's journey.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.190 align:middle line:90%
I did that for years.

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:16.770 align:middle line:84%
I would read those
success books,

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:19.250 align:middle line:84%
do this and do this and
this and follow this path,

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:22.170 align:middle line:84%
and it's going down an
avenue, and suddenly you're

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:24.828 align:middle line:84%
up against a brick wall, and
you're gone, oops, wrong path.

00:19:24.828 --> 00:19:26.370 align:middle line:84%
And you turn around,
and you go back,

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:29.730 align:middle line:84%
and you try something else,
and you realize wrong path.

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And although that path
was perfect for them

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:34.650 align:middle line:84%
because it was their
authentic path,

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:37.290 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't my authentic path.

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:40.860 align:middle line:84%
And so part of that process,
part of authenticity

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:42.600 align:middle line:84%
is learning your
path, and yours is

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:45.404 align:middle line:84%
different from everybody
else's on the planet.

00:19:45.404 --> 00:19:51.180 align:middle line:84%
So if I don't know what I am
and who I am authentically,

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:55.050 align:middle line:84%
if I don't know my own passions,
if I don't know my own mind,

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:57.930 align:middle line:84%
if I don't expand
in my own direction,

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:00.000 align:middle line:84%
then I'm doing
somebody else's path.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to hit
some brick walls.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:05.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to run down a path
and waste a lot of years

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.490 align:middle line:84%
and get to the end and
go, oops, wrong path,

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:10.640 align:middle line:90%
because it wasn't mine.

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:18.688 align:middle line:90%
