00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Sherry Buffington--

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.430 align:middle line:90%
I love Sherry Buffington's work.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.420 align:middle line:84%
One of the things she says
is that collective abundance

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.800 align:middle line:90%
precedes individual abundance.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's a
very important thing

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.690 align:middle line:84%
for us to understand-- that
if we're going to be abundant,

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.900 align:middle line:84%
it's actually not something
that we do in isolation.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.880 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
that we do on our own.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.740 align:middle line:84%
Abundance is something
that we do together.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.990 align:middle line:84%
Abundance as an
individual is something

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.790 align:middle line:84%
I can access only
because the community

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.990 align:middle line:84%
society, or collective,
provides the opportunity for me

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.890 align:middle line:90%
to access it.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.570 align:middle line:84%
>> So I was going through a
lot of my first experience

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.570 align:middle line:84%
as an entrepreneur trying
to read lots of books,

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.570 align:middle line:90%
trying to learn it all--

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.945 align:middle line:84%
which is a little
bit like trying

00:00:58.945 --> 00:01:01.070 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to ride a
bicycle through books.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.810 align:middle line:84%
No matter how good
you think it might be,

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.727 align:middle line:84%
if, at the end of the
day, you get on the bike

00:01:04.727 --> 00:01:06.588 align:middle line:84%
and you think you
can ride, you're

00:01:06.588 --> 00:01:08.630 align:middle line:84%
going to be surprised to
find yourself fall over.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.780 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.970 align:middle line:84%
It's like real, true
entrepreneurship

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.520 align:middle line:84%
and understanding
how to harness flow

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.583 align:middle line:84%
and the ideas of abundance,
you can't get from books.

00:01:16.583 --> 00:01:18.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, books are helpful
to actually give you

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.373 align:middle line:90%
some guideposts.

00:01:19.373 --> 00:01:20.790 align:middle line:84%
But really, at the
end of the day,

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.998 align:middle line:84%
it's about going out there
and really practicing it--

00:01:22.998 --> 00:01:25.100 align:middle line:84%
and most importantly,
practicing it with others

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.440 align:middle line:84%
so you're not having to figure
it all out for yourself.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Every day is a battle.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.190 align:middle line:84%
Every day, to find peace
is really a challenge,

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.900 align:middle line:90%
because we live in chaos.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.290 align:middle line:90%
We live in a system.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.720 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to
surround yourself

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.000 align:middle line:84%
with tools and resources that
can help you get through that.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.915 align:middle line:84%
>> I think any time
you're making a--

00:01:43.915 --> 00:01:46.040 align:middle line:84%
you're really going for it
and making a big change,

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.280 align:middle line:84%
you're going to the next level,
the more you can get people

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.900 align:middle line:84%
around you that
are like-thinkers

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.675 align:middle line:84%
or who will support
your thinking,

00:01:53.675 --> 00:01:55.393 align:middle line:84%
the better off
you're going to be.

00:01:55.393 --> 00:01:56.810 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
many people we've

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.142 align:middle line:84%
seen who are ready
to make a big change,

00:01:59.142 --> 00:02:01.100 align:middle line:84%
and somebody in their
family will say something

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.610 align:middle line:90%
to try to pull them back down.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.610 align:middle line:84%
>> So yeah, you're going
to have family members,

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.985 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have friends,
you're going to have people

00:02:06.985 --> 00:02:11.180 align:middle line:84%
around you that love you
and tell you, keep that job.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.010 align:middle line:90%
So every day is a challenge.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.970 align:middle line:90%
We all have that.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.430 align:middle line:84%
>> What you'll find is that
people who really love you,

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.780 align:middle line:84%
the people who really care about
you, are happy for your growth,

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.600 align:middle line:84%
and they're happy for you
growing and becoming what

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.520 align:middle line:90%
you're supposed to become.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.830 align:middle line:84%
And the relationship
can stay the same.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.270 align:middle line:84%
But there are some people that
can't allow that to happen.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.950 align:middle line:90%
It has nothing to do with you.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.790 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with them
not feeling like they

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.470 align:middle line:90%
can accept the change.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Find people who can model
for you a way to get to that new

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.940 align:middle line:90%
place.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.150 align:middle line:90%
>> We are communal people.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.810 align:middle line:90%
We're a communal species.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't come together
as a community, we've lost that.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.230 align:middle line:90%
We've lost that over the years.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And when you go into
small towns and you

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.290 align:middle line:84%
find people who still
have a sense of community,

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.040 align:middle line:84%
they're so much happier
than people in large cities

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.810 align:middle line:90%
who've lost that connection.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And so it's understanding
that no man is an island--

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.970 align:middle line:90%
literally--

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.980 align:middle line:84%
and that we can't do
anything grand on our own.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.670 align:middle line:84%
There's just no way to do
anything grand on our own.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And so we come out, we
connect with other people.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.230 align:middle line:84%
First we discover
who we are, and then

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.850 align:middle line:84%
we discover who they are, and
we connect with the right people

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:26.900 align:middle line:90%
in a community.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And the bigger the
community, the better.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.123 align:middle line:84%
>> I've been brought up in
places like Papua New Guinea.

00:03:31.123 --> 00:03:33.560 align:middle line:84%
I currently live in Bali,
where the communities there

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.330 align:middle line:90%
are not born into scarcity.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.530 align:middle line:84%
There's a girl who's
in our village in Bali,

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.530 align:middle line:84%
and most of the
villages-- they end up

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.840 align:middle line:84%
in education within
the actual island,

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.350 align:middle line:84%
and she had an opportunity
to go and travel to Europe.

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you need
actual money to do that,

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.673 align:middle line:84%
and actually to go
into college in Europe.

00:03:56.673 --> 00:03:58.340 align:middle line:84%
Everyone in the village
just chipped in,

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.840 align:middle line:84%
and she had the
money, and she went.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.490 align:middle line:84%
It really wasn't an issue,
because at the end of the day,

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:03.980 align:middle line:84%
everyone's supporting
each other.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.290 align:middle line:90%
So that's not an economy.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.560 align:middle line:90%
That's an ecology.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.360 align:middle line:90%
It's not a system.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.590 align:middle line:90%
It's an ecosystem.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>> There's no one who's
so individualistic that

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.600 align:middle line:90%
they're doing this on an island.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.410 align:middle line:84%
You do want to get out
and find a new village

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.580 align:middle line:84%
to be part of, a new
community to be part of.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.910 align:middle line:84%
It's not about having to do
it all yourself and make up

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.510 align:middle line:90%
every role yourself.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.650 align:middle line:84%
It's really more about
finding the other people

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.140 align:middle line:84%
on this planet whose
values resonate

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.980 align:middle line:84%
better with what you're doing
than where you were before.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.660 align:middle line:84%
You totally need that
tribe when you go

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.440 align:middle line:90%
through your moments of doubt.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.150 align:middle line:84%
It's the best thing
in the world to be

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.420 align:middle line:84%
able to have somebody you can
Skype or call or email and say,

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm freaking out.

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And the person can say, dude,
I was freaking out yesterday.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:50.650 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about it.

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:51.680 align:middle line:90%
Let's work it out.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Napoleon Hill, who wrote
"Think and Grow Rich," said,

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.250 align:middle line:84%
a number of times, surround
yourself with people who are

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.710 align:middle line:84%
thinking the way you
want to be thinking.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.680 align:middle line:84%
That way, that's where
the interaction will go.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.710 align:middle line:90%
That'll elevate you.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.170 align:middle line:84%
If you're around
people who are thinking

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.598 align:middle line:84%
a lot of limiting thoughts
or negative thoughts

00:05:08.598 --> 00:05:10.140 align:middle line:84%
or complaining
thoughts, that's where

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.390 align:middle line:90%
it's going to take your energy.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.060 align:middle line:84%
We know, now, with mirror
neurons that there's even

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.470 align:middle line:90%
a scientific basis for that.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.080 align:middle line:84%
So surround yourself with
people whose beliefs are

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.370 align:middle line:90%
going to take you somewhere.

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.750 align:middle line:84%
>> I think everything in
life has seasons and cycles,

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.960 align:middle line:84%
and it may be that people who
were very dear to you at one

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.800 align:middle line:84%
point of your life,
who are good people,

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.460 align:middle line:84%
have elements of their
personality or their thinking

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.840 align:middle line:84%
that are toxic, and you didn't
see it when you were in that

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.980 align:middle line:90%
same toxicity.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.100 align:middle line:84%
You didn't see how
toxic that was.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.560 align:middle line:84%
You see this in relationships
that are just bona

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.320 align:middle line:90%
fide abusive.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.110 align:middle line:84%
Children love their
abusive parents,

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.440 align:middle line:84%
and that love will
always be there.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.220 align:middle line:84%
I think that there's nothing
wrong with setting boundaries.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't mean you
cut people out of your life

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.500 align:middle line:84%
who might be good
people, but it also

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.630 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean that you spend
all your time with them either.

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.650 align:middle line:90%
And I think a lot of us--

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.250 align:middle line:84%
maybe it's a scenario with early
childhood friends, high school

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.280 align:middle line:90%
friends, or our families--

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.780 align:middle line:84%
we might still
love those people.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:23.153 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that you have
to buy into their values.

00:06:23.153 --> 00:06:24.570 align:middle line:84%
You may not buy
into their values.

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:27.660 align:middle line:84%
You may still love
them, still honor them.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.180 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that
everything that they say

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.040 align:middle line:84%
has to be the way that
you live your life.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:37.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And whether it be drinking,
whether it be smoking,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.720 align:middle line:84%
whether it be a
toxic relationship,

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.010 align:middle line:90%
whether it be certain foods--

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:48.840 align:middle line:84%
whatever-- I've had to
distance myself from elements

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.470 align:middle line:84%
that weaken my spirit,
and that weaken

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:59.400 align:middle line:84%
my resolve, because I think
conviction is a tricky thing.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.920 align:middle line:90%


00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.710 align:middle line:84%
We can say be strong,
but the truth is--

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.380 align:middle line:90%
for me, anyway--

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:11.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm not strong--
not all the time.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:12.720 align:middle line:90%
I stumble.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.070 align:middle line:90%
I am vulnerable.

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:20.490 align:middle line:84%
I have my times when I'm
down and I'm susceptible.

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.750 align:middle line:84%
That's why I have
to distance myself.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:28.710 align:middle line:84%
Not because there's anything
wrong with those people,

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:32.880 align:middle line:84%
not because I judge them,
but because I know that when

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:39.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm feeling vulnerable
and down and susceptible,

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:44.820 align:middle line:84%
they can influence me, and
I won't be able to fight it.

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:47.580 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the people around
you can have a huge influence

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.610 align:middle line:90%
on your perception of yourself.

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And whether that's your family
or someone that you're dating,

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:54.350 align:middle line:90%
we take--

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:56.430 align:middle line:84%
unfortunately, at
times-- our cues

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:58.320 align:middle line:90%
from how people perceive us.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And I grew up as the
youngest in a family,

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.030 align:middle line:90%
so my opinions were dismissed.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And I learned to ask for
advice, partly because I

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.660 align:middle line:84%
trust other people's
opinions over my own,

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.970 align:middle line:84%
and partly as a way I
think, in retrospect,

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:15.810 align:middle line:84%
to gain some greater
connection to them, some love,

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:19.320 align:middle line:84%
because if they were helping
me, they were engaged with me.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And I started not
trusting my own thoughts

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.882 align:middle line:90%
and my own opinions.

00:08:23.882 --> 00:08:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very
tricky place to get to,

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:28.050 align:middle line:84%
because you're a slippery
slope, then, of always asking

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:30.750 align:middle line:84%
for advice and
taking, as I said,

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:35.070 align:middle line:84%
your cues from how
people perceive you.

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:36.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Growing up in an
East Indian family--

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.080 align:middle line:90%
[? Gudrapi ?] Indian family--

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.330 align:middle line:84%
a lot of my self-worth
imprints were

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:46.410 align:middle line:84%
related to what
education I had, what

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:51.720 align:middle line:84%
circles I'm circulating in,
what degrees I've gotten,

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:55.830 align:middle line:84%
what Kudos I'm getting
from community.

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And I started recognizing
that after a while,

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:01.050 align:middle line:84%
those things are
going to fall away.

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And why should I care about
what other people are thinking?

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:08.630 align:middle line:90%
We're tribal beings.

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:10.710 align:middle line:84%
We're animalistic,
also, in nature.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:14.700 align:middle line:84%
Spiritual, but also, we have an
animal side-- a pack mentality.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.420 align:middle line:84%
We wish to be accepted
into the pack.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:21.780 align:middle line:84%
And that remnant that's left in
our being, in our psychology,

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:25.860 align:middle line:84%
in our neurology, our cellular
level, this feeling of we

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:29.010 align:middle line:84%
must gain acceptance-- it's
not just a mental thing.

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:33.150 align:middle line:84%
If we don't have acceptance
with our core group in society,

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:34.545 align:middle line:90%
then we'll be the reject.

00:09:34.545 --> 00:09:37.800 align:middle line:90%
And the rejects, in nature, die.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that we
find as we develop ourselves,

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.430 align:middle line:84%
as we become more full
and more functional,

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:47.070 align:middle line:84%
is that there are people in our
environment that just don't fit

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:47.680 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.500 align:middle line:84%
They're not healthy
to keep those people

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:50.530 align:middle line:90%
in the environment.

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:52.765 align:middle line:84%
If they're family members,
that makes it difficult.

00:09:52.765 --> 00:09:55.140 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to distance
yourself from them physically,

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:56.970 align:middle line:84%
but you can step
away psychologically.

00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:59.070 align:middle line:90%
You can step away emotionally.

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:02.850 align:middle line:84%
You can step into that same
wild, crazy, dysfunctional

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:08.040 align:middle line:84%
dynamic as an observer, and
learn so much from those people

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.370 align:middle line:84%
without having to completely
eliminate them from your life

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:12.280 align:middle line:90%
if they're family.

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.240 align:middle line:84%
But there are also
friends that are toxic.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.657 align:middle line:84%
There are people that just
don't need to be in that system

00:10:16.657 --> 00:10:17.530 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And so with that expansion,
part of that is pruning--

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:26.140 align:middle line:84%
pruning away what
doesn't work anymore.

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:29.500 align:middle line:84%
And as we do that and we
start to build the community,

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.710 align:middle line:84%
then we recognize
that there are levels.

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And one level is me-- what
I bring to the community.

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And the other level's what
the community brings to me,

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:44.200 align:middle line:84%
and what we, as a collective
whole, bring to the world,

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.900 align:middle line:84%
because that's that
generative force, ultimately.

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:52.780 align:middle line:84%
That's that larger, bigger than
me, bigger than life energy

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:55.842 align:middle line:84%
that we can all tap into for
the benefit of everybody.

00:10:55.842 --> 00:10:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And we ultimately get there,
but there's a pruning process,

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:01.020 align:middle line:84%
sometimes, before we
can get to that space.

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:04.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Unfortunately, that
mechanism is still running in us

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:10.600 align:middle line:84%
and twisting distorting our
true individual soul's desire

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:14.540 align:middle line:84%
for abundance and its
creation of abundance.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:17.290 align:middle line:90%
That's specific to self.

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:21.760 align:middle line:84%
So what I've
recognized is is that

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.360 align:middle line:84%
once I start to
relax the importance

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:29.350 align:middle line:84%
that I used to place on what
other people think about me--

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:31.420 align:middle line:84%
I just dialed down
the importance.

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:35.170 align:middle line:84%
What will people who are
watching this think about me?

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:37.250 align:middle line:84%
What will my friends
think about me?

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:41.470 align:middle line:84%
What will my parents think
about me, my aunts, my uncles,

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:44.380 align:middle line:90%
those I love and I value?

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:47.680 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps that I may even
go beyond them in income.

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.440 align:middle line:84%
I may go beyond them
in life experiences

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.830 align:middle line:90%
and freedom-gaining.

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:59.500 align:middle line:84%
To me, it's imperative
to start relaxing

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.810 align:middle line:90%
all our self-reflection.

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:02.610 align:middle line:90%
Huh?

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:03.740 align:middle line:90%
Am I doing right?

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:03.910 align:middle line:90%
Huh?

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:04.990 align:middle line:90%
Do you agree with me?

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:06.220 align:middle line:90%
Huh?

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:07.630 align:middle line:90%
Are you approving of this?

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:11.740 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's subtle,
that mechanism--

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:14.020 align:middle line:84%
although it was good
for thousands of years--

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:16.300 align:middle line:90%
is no longer valid.

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.700 align:middle line:84%
It's an old thing
we're operating.

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:23.190 align:middle line:84%
For me, to help reduce that,
just lower the importance--

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:24.620 align:middle line:90%
on all of it.

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:27.130 align:middle line:84%
>> There are always going
to be people who are going

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:31.255 align:middle line:84%
to criticize, or have a better
idea of how things should work,

00:12:31.255 --> 00:12:33.820 align:middle line:90%
and tell you their way.

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:38.050 align:middle line:84%
When you're living a life of
following your authentic self

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:40.930 align:middle line:84%
and your intuition,
you can realize

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:44.890 align:middle line:84%
that you don't have to listen
to other people's opinions,

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:48.580 align:middle line:84%
but you also don't have to even
tell them what you're doing.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.040 align:middle line:84%
You really want to hold
and protect your space

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.760 align:middle line:84%
so that when you know
that so-and-so always

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:58.723 align:middle line:84%
criticizes everything you say,
well, you can not tell them.

00:12:58.723 --> 00:13:00.640 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to tell
them what you're doing.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:04.000 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to tell
them your creative--

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.010 align:middle line:84%
your new, beautiful idea
that's coming about.

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:07.810 align:middle line:90%
Hold it.

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:08.410 align:middle line:90%
Protect it.

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:09.210 align:middle line:90%
Keep it safe.

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:11.230 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to share
that with anyone else.

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>> As I go on my
journey in life,

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:15.962 align:middle line:90%
I encounter different people.

00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:17.170 align:middle line:90%
I encounter different groups.

00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:20.250 align:middle line:84%
I may become a part of
a group for a while,

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:23.230 align:middle line:84%
and they may influence me,
and I may allow that influence

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:24.580 align:middle line:90%
to happen.

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:27.040 align:middle line:84%
But I still have
to know, who am I?

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.610 align:middle line:90%
What do I want?

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:30.580 align:middle line:90%
What am I true to?

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:33.000 align:middle line:90%
What do I believe?

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.690 align:middle line:84%
So that that's
something that I can

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:40.470 align:middle line:84%
take with me to my next
place, or my next adventure,

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:46.170 align:middle line:84%
or my next journey, my next
group that I interact with.

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:47.430 align:middle line:90%
And I'm in control of that.

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:48.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm in control of
what I believe.

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:54.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm in control of
what I want to become.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.040 align:middle line:90%
I choose.

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.710 align:middle line:90%


00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:04.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't always choose right, or
there's no perfection about it.

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:06.880 align:middle line:90%
It's a journey.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:11.175 align:middle line:84%
But I'm choosing who to be, how
to show up, what to believe.

00:14:11.175 --> 00:14:13.550 align:middle line:84%
>> I have made a conscious
choice I would not go anywhere

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:16.850 align:middle line:84%
near anyone that had negative
energies that I thought would

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:20.300 align:middle line:84%
weaken me, or had beliefs that
would undermine my beliefs,

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:23.450 align:middle line:84%
or get into discussions or
arguments about my beliefs with

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:28.070 align:middle line:84%
anyone, because it might
interrupt my own belief

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:31.100 align:middle line:84%
in the beliefs I was adopting,
and I did that for quite

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:32.160 align:middle line:90%
a while.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.570 align:middle line:84%
>> It is the best feeling in
the world, and we all have it.

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:37.400 align:middle line:90%
That's one of the great myths--

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:40.057 align:middle line:84%
is that somehow, if you
follow your own path,

00:14:40.057 --> 00:14:41.390 align:middle line:90%
you're never going to freak out.

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:42.660 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
freak out, and you're

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:43.640 align:middle line:84%
going to need somebody
to help you out.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.515 align:middle line:84%
You're going to need
somebody's hand to hold.

00:14:45.515 --> 00:14:50.820 align:middle line:84%
And that is not something you
should feel bad or sad about.

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:52.520 align:middle line:90%
It's part of the journey.

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:55.778 align:middle line:84%
>> And so if you're out there
giving, giving, giving, giving,

00:14:55.778 --> 00:14:58.460 align:middle line:84%
giving, giving, it may not come
back from the person you gave

00:14:58.460 --> 00:14:59.740 align:middle line:90%
to, or the people you gave to.

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:03.860 align:middle line:84%
But it certainly will come
back from people, places

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:07.140 align:middle line:90%
that you've never even imagined.

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And so we all need other
people, whether it's

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:14.630 align:middle line:84%
for financial reasons,
for emotional reasons,

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:17.750 align:middle line:84%
for knowledge reasons, for
guidance-- or whatever it is.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.330 align:middle line:90%
We all need other people.

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:23.820 align:middle line:90%
And they all need us as well.

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:28.010 align:middle line:84%
And if we have this
healthy relationship

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:30.410 align:middle line:84%
with giving as much
as we can, we'll

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:35.450 align:middle line:84%
receive more than we ever
thought humanly possible.

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And my belief is
that we're all here

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:41.180 align:middle line:84%
to help each other, that we're
all here to give each other

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:43.460 align:middle line:84%
and to love each other,
to care for each other.

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.670 align:middle line:84%
>> One awesome
thing about today,

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:51.950 align:middle line:84%
about the world we're in now,
is a lot more people are taking

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:54.070 align:middle line:84%
this leap-- whatever
you want to call it,

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:57.470 align:middle line:84%
choosing your
self-directed path--

00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:01.440 align:middle line:84%
a lot more people are coming
up with ways to do it.

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:04.220 align:middle line:90%
So there are communities.

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.340 align:middle line:90%
A lot of them are online.

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:07.340 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you might get
lucky and find something

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:09.240 align:middle line:90%
you can do face-to-face.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.760 align:middle line:90%
There are masterminds.

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:16.310 align:middle line:84%
There are communities
online, and communities

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:19.190 align:middle line:84%
you can connect with
other people who are

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:20.930 align:middle line:90%
doing this crazy thing, too.

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:22.700 align:middle line:90%
And find one of them.

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:24.170 align:middle line:90%
They are out there.

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:28.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the ecology around you,
the environment in which you

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:31.010 align:middle line:90%
operate, is critical--

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:35.600 align:middle line:84%
for all kinds of reasons,
from logistics, to mindset.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.860 align:middle line:84%
So as you move in
a new direction,

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:40.460 align:middle line:84%
you want to make sure to
bring around you and attract

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:43.030 align:middle line:84%
to yourself the people who
are going to support you

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:45.620 align:middle line:84%
in all kinds of ways,
and to make sure

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:49.850 align:middle line:84%
that they see not necessarily
your goal or your vision,

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:51.380 align:middle line:90%
because they may not have it.

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:54.050 align:middle line:84%
Only you might be the
person to see that.

00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:59.200 align:middle line:84%
But they believe in you, and
they encourage you forward.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:03.970 align:middle line:84%
>> The intersection of my life
with my first mentors I believe

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:10.599 align:middle line:84%
was a result of me searching
for what else is there out there

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:14.530 align:middle line:90%
other than my current reality?

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:18.910 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I
was ready to seek,

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:22.060 align:middle line:84%
question an answer
to a question,

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:26.359 align:middle line:84%
that reality brought
itself to me.

00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:28.359 align:middle line:84%
And although I was
afraid, although I

00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:31.000 align:middle line:84%
had to move 500 kilometers,
although I didn't have

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.280 align:middle line:84%
a nickel in my
pocket, I just had

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:37.530 align:middle line:84%
to trust that he
knew more than I did.

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:43.390 align:middle line:84%
>> I actually remember a moment
when I knew I had found the new

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:49.150 align:middle line:84%
group of people, the new tribe
that could show me the values

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:52.570 align:middle line:84%
and the beliefs
of this new life.

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:53.500 align:middle line:90%
I was at a conference.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:55.542 align:middle line:84%
It was a blogging conference
called [INAUDIBLE],,

00:17:55.542 --> 00:17:59.020 align:middle line:84%
which was a wonderful small
conference here in the States.

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And I do remember a
palpable feeling of calm

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:08.590 align:middle line:84%
when I realized there
were other people who

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:11.500 align:middle line:84%
lived this weird way I thought
I might be able to live.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:14.110 align:middle line:84%
>> It's essential--
it's essential--

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:19.360 align:middle line:84%
that you surround yourself
with people who support

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:22.090 align:middle line:90%
your good way of thinking.

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:23.710 align:middle line:84%
So they don't have
to think exactly

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:27.190 align:middle line:84%
like you do, but are
supportive of who you are

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:32.890 align:middle line:84%
and how it is that you
express your authentic self.

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:34.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, they may express
their authentic self

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.450 align:middle line:90%
completely differently.

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:37.250 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:39.460 align:middle line:90%
But they support you.

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:44.290 align:middle line:84%
These are people who hold
you, and honor you, and take

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:47.950 align:middle line:84%
care of really seeing the
truth about who you are.

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:50.170 align:middle line:84%
Those are the people
that you want to be with.

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:52.510 align:middle line:84%
Those are the people
you want in your circle.

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:56.500 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the first thing is to
recognize that anything you are

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:59.290 align:middle line:84%
struggling with is something
that somebody else is

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:00.490 align:middle line:90%
struggling with.

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:04.880 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's just as simple
as standing up and saying,

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.730 align:middle line:90%
this is how I feel.

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:10.480 align:middle line:84%
This is what's
making me sad today.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:11.892 align:middle line:90%
This is what's hurting me today.

00:19:11.892 --> 00:19:13.600 align:middle line:84%
This is what's hurting
my feelings today,

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:17.920 align:middle line:84%
or this is what's making
me doubt myself today.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:20.050 align:middle line:84%
If we can just share
even that vulnerability,

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:22.878 align:middle line:84%
that can be a tremendous
source of strength.

00:19:22.878 --> 00:19:24.670 align:middle line:84%
It's a source of strength
for other people,

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:26.212 align:middle line:84%
but it's a source
of strength for you

00:19:26.212 --> 00:19:29.620 align:middle line:84%
too, because when
you get a voice, then

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:31.660 align:middle line:90%
it takes its rightful place.

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And it stops being a
big, scary demon that's

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.970 align:middle line:84%
controlling your
life, and it just

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:40.420 align:middle line:84%
becomes a very normal part
of being a human being.

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's normal, and it's
natural, and it's OK.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:46.930 align:middle line:84%
>> We can be present
to each other.

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:50.410 align:middle line:84%
We can be supportive
of each other.

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:54.250 align:middle line:84%
We can refrain from
judging each other.

00:19:54.250 --> 00:20:00.010 align:middle line:84%
We can be the best version
of ourselves that we can be.

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:02.920 align:middle line:84%
We can be compassionate
to each other.

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.230 align:middle line:90%
We can love each other.

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:08.230 align:middle line:84%
But I can't fix you,
and you can't fix me.

00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And furthermore, there's
nothing wrong with you,

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:11.950 align:middle line:84%
and there's nothing
wrong with me.

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:14.170 align:middle line:84%
>> I've learned that coaching
and masterminding are

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:16.360 align:middle line:84%
so critical, because you need
somebody who's going to call

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:18.130 align:middle line:84%
you out, and somebody who's
going to help you get through

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:19.120 align:middle line:90%
those changes.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.940 align:middle line:84%
>> I wouldn't want to give the
impression that I quit my job,

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:26.800 align:middle line:84%
and then immediately I was
this evolved, successful,

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:30.270 align:middle line:84%
stress-free, happy person,
because I was not--

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:31.540 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:34.150 align:middle line:90%
I was stressed out of my mind.

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:36.230 align:middle line:90%
I was very fearful.

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:40.240 align:middle line:84%
I was the sole breadwinner
for my household,

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:43.810 align:middle line:90%
and I was very frightened.

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And being frightened
made it very hard

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:49.750 align:middle line:84%
for me to make smart
decisions, and it also

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:54.010 align:middle line:84%
made it very hard for people
to want to do business with me.

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:57.250 align:middle line:84%
So I had to do a lot of
work, that first year,

00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:02.530 align:middle line:84%
on a lot of mindset issues,
on a lot of cultivating

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:07.900 align:middle line:84%
a sense of curiosity
instead of a sense of terror

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:13.630 align:middle line:84%
and being completely up
shit creek without a paddle.

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:17.710 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I had a lot of
work to do that year.

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:19.090 align:middle line:90%
And I was fortunate.

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:22.060 align:middle line:84%
I had a wonderful
coach I was working

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:26.410 align:middle line:84%
with who helped me relax
when I tightened up,

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:31.150 align:middle line:84%
and who helped me see a bigger
picture when I was looking

00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:33.730 align:middle line:84%
at a very tiny slice of
something that was freaking me

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:34.900 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.960 align:middle line:84%
So I was very fortunate
to have that person.

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:42.760 align:middle line:84%
>> We had one group who met
weekly for an entire year

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:46.180 align:middle line:84%
on the phone, and the whole
focus of the phone call was

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:48.890 align:middle line:84%
to identify these limiting
beliefs that they all had,

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:51.460 align:middle line:84%
and to change, and then
to work with each other.

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And it was incredible to
see how every single one

00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:58.930 align:middle line:84%
of these people's lives changed
in terms of them attracting

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:01.360 align:middle line:84%
more wealth into
their lives, having

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:04.450 align:middle line:84%
happier family relationships,
and also having

00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:08.020 align:middle line:84%
higher self-esteem and feeling
better about themselves.

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:10.600 align:middle line:84%
So it's a good idea
to form a mastermind,

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:14.110 align:middle line:84%
or get with other people who
are like-minded like you,

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:17.770 align:middle line:84%
and really work to create
positive change together.

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:21.670 align:middle line:84%
>> If you happen to not be
living in a collective--

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:25.330 align:middle line:84%
in a society, in a social
class, in a social grouping,

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:29.230 align:middle line:90%
in a company--

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:33.820 align:middle line:84%
anywhere that you feel isn't
conducive to your pursuit

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:37.285 align:middle line:84%
of abundance in your life,
you do have a choice.

00:22:37.285 --> 00:22:41.030 align:middle line:90%


00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:44.080 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to be a victim.

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:48.950 align:middle line:84%
You can choose abundant
actions in your life.

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:51.220 align:middle line:84%
No matter what your
circumstances are,

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:53.860 align:middle line:84%
you can start
choosing abundance.

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And that choosing of
abundance has a ripple effect.

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:01.840 align:middle line:84%
It will affect the
people around you.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.370 align:middle line:90%
It may take time.

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:07.120 align:middle line:84%
It took a long time for women
to get the right to vote.

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:12.670 align:middle line:84%
It took a long time for women to
start to be recognized equally

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:14.540 align:middle line:90%
in the workforce.

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:17.230 align:middle line:84%
We still haven't
got equal pay, OK?

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:19.930 align:middle line:90%
It's not over.

00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:27.610 align:middle line:84%
But if you behave concurrently,
if you act as if it's already

00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:31.510 align:middle line:84%
like that, you
will affect change

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:35.150 align:middle line:84%
in consciousness of
the people around you.

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:37.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's the best
that you can do.

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:41.050 align:middle line:84%
If you want abundance,
be abundant.

00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:44.590 align:middle line:90%
If you want freedom, be free.

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:49.090 align:middle line:84%
If you want liberation,

Be that which you seek,
and it won't be wasted.

00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:57.890 align:middle line:90%
It's never wasted.

>> For me, the best way out of
that has always been to teach

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:05.540 align:middle line:84%
something small, to show
yourself that you actually are

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:08.150 align:middle line:84%
somebody who has something to
value by teaching something

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:09.490 align:middle line:90%
small to another person.

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:12.620 align:middle line:84%
Giving some small measure
of help to somebody else,

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:15.140 align:middle line:84%
you can show yourself that
actually, you do have something

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.510 align:middle line:84%
to offer, and you
do have something

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:21.170 align:middle line:84%
to contribute to this world,
and to your fellow human being.

This is someone who was
living within a very

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:34.700 align:middle line:90%
oppressive, violent society--

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:39.320 align:middle line:84%
with respect to the social
group that he belonged to--

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.930 align:middle line:90%
and he chose his own truth.

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:44.570 align:middle line:90%
He chose peace.

00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:47.870 align:middle line:84%
He chose what he
believed always.

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:54.920 align:middle line:84%
No matter what they threw
at him, he chose his truth,

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:57.050 align:middle line:90%
and it changed everything.

00:24:57.050 --> 00:25:02.780 align:middle line:84%
One person sticking to their
truth, one person choosing

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:10.030 align:middle line:84%
peace, choosing abundance in
that sense, changed everything.
