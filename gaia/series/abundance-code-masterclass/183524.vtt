[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.472 --> 00:00:12.400 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.860 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm a psychotherapist,
and my field--

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.453 align:middle line:84%
it has this background of find
out what caused your problems,

00:00:18.453 --> 00:00:19.870 align:middle line:84%
and who's to blame
and everything.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think we got
to the end of that.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.492 align:middle line:84%
There's all sorts
of stories or ideas

00:00:24.492 --> 00:00:25.700 align:middle line:90%
that you can have about that.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.918 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, even
if you find that stuff,

00:00:27.918 --> 00:00:29.460 align:middle line:84%
you have to figure
out how to change.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And so I've come up
with this saying,

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.840 align:middle line:84%
and it's no one's to blame,
and everyone's responsible.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.310 align:middle line:90%
Everyone's accountable.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.650 align:middle line:84%
So at this moment, no
matter where you came from

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.690 align:middle line:90%
or who contributed to that--

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.430 align:middle line:84%
your genetics or your parents
or your childhood traumas

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.250 align:middle line:84%
or whatever-- at this
moment, this is the moment--

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.660 align:middle line:90%
this is the focal moment--

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.300 align:middle line:84%
when you have the
possibility of shifting.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And instead of focusing
on blame at this moment,

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.460 align:middle line:84%
you focus on accountability
and responsibility.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.967 align:middle line:84%
This is your moment to
take back your power.

00:01:00.967 --> 00:01:03.550 align:middle line:84%
It's not like forgiving them for
the terrible things they did,

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:04.819 align:middle line:90%
or letting them off the hook.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:06.236 align:middle line:84%
It's really taking
back your power

00:01:06.236 --> 00:01:09.340 align:middle line:84%
and saying, at this
moment, I can change this.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.900 align:middle line:84%
No matter what my
background was,

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.817 align:middle line:84%
no matter what my
conditioning, no matter what

00:01:12.817 --> 00:01:16.680 align:middle line:84%
my trauma, my genetics,
my culture, my old beliefs

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.200 align:middle line:84%
and what got me here, this
is the moment of change.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.100 align:middle line:84%
>> I definitely spent
time looking into my past.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.560 align:middle line:84%
I done a lot of
that exploration,

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.270 align:middle line:90%
a lot of that learning.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And I think, at the same time,
some of the most valuable

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.580 align:middle line:84%
experiences and perspectives
that brought me out of that

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.855 align:middle line:84%
were not the ones that were
punitive and blame-oriented,

00:01:40.855 --> 00:01:42.730 align:middle line:84%
but the ones that said,
look, whoever it was,

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.490 align:middle line:90%
whatever the person--

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.317 align:middle line:84%
whoever, whatever
their role in my life,

00:01:48.317 --> 00:01:50.650 align:middle line:84%
the recognition that they
were doing the best they could

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.870 align:middle line:90%
with what they had at that time.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.650 align:middle line:84%
So it was a detaching
from the blame,

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.050 align:middle line:84%
and taking ownership and
saying, OK, well, I'm here.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.940 align:middle line:90%
How can I move forward?

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.130 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of people want
to change the world.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they want
to change the world

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.960 align:middle line:84%
just because they don't
feel OK about themselves.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And they perceive the
world to be wrong,

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.090 align:middle line:84%
and they perceive the
world to need fixing.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's really just them
saying, I feel like I'm wrong.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.340 align:middle line:90%
I feel like I need fixing.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.040 align:middle line:90%


00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.290 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to change the
world, the place to start

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.060 align:middle line:90%
is change yourself.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And when I say
change yourself, I

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.290 align:middle line:84%
don't mean make yourself better,
and strive, and be different,

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.660 align:middle line:84%
and be someone that you're not
or conform to someone else's

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.390 align:middle line:90%
ideal of what you should be.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.370 align:middle line:90%
I mean examine your beliefs--

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.690 align:middle line:84%
beliefs about yourself, beliefs
about everything in the world,

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.340 align:middle line:90%
and change those.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll
change the world--

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.990 align:middle line:90%
the world that you experience.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.940 align:middle line:84%
>> What we found, often with the
things that people have grown

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.320 align:middle line:84%
up with-- the rules,
the "supposed to bes"

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.003 align:middle line:84%
that you have as a
child, you grew up with,

00:03:08.003 --> 00:03:10.420 align:middle line:84%
and that gives you-- it does
give you a sense of security,

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:17.890 align:middle line:84%
because it's the sideboards
to keep you safe, in a sense.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.980 align:middle line:84%
What can happen is
when people think

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.010 align:middle line:90%
about going to the next level--

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.820 align:middle line:84%
we've interviewed lots
of people about this--

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.740 align:middle line:90%
there's no next level.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:28.990 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing in their mind.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.610 align:middle line:90%
You say, so, what's your dream?

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And they go-- there's
nothing there.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.410 align:middle line:84%
They haven't created
a dream, because that

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.080 align:middle line:84%
goes beyond this reality
that they're living in.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And if it does, they don't know
what's there, and it's scary.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.400 align:middle line:84%
Imagine going into a dark
room with nothing in it,

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.140 align:middle line:84%
and you don't know
what's out there.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And so I think when
people know what

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.517 align:middle line:84%
they think the rules are and the
way things are supposed to be,

00:03:52.517 --> 00:03:54.100 align:middle line:84%
they can operate
within that structure

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.740 align:middle line:84%
and have a relative amount
of success and safety.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.800 align:middle line:84%
They may never really
have the life they want.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.800 align:middle line:84%
They may never really have the
life that's possible for them.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.710 align:middle line:84%
But they may have
the kind of security

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.140 align:middle line:84%
that is more immediate,
and that they

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.890 align:middle line:84%
think they need based on their
limiting ideas about things.

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.470 align:middle line:84%
>> When I first
moved to Australia,

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.190 align:middle line:84%
after I had basically given up
everything and started living

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:27.280 align:middle line:84%
real simply, my first knee-jerk
reaction was to try to recreate

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.430 align:middle line:90%
what I understood.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.580 align:middle line:90%
So I applied to law school.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.980 align:middle line:84%
I applied to a couple of
different business jobs.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And it was amazing how
everything I applied to,

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.000 align:middle line:90%
I didn't get accepted.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.580 align:middle line:84%
It was actually
hilarious, because I've

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.680 align:middle line:84%
got a degree in economics from
the Wharton School of Business.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.230 align:middle line:84%
I was a chairman of
a brokerage company.

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.392 align:middle line:84%
And I was applying
for jobs online,

00:04:52.392 --> 00:04:54.100 align:middle line:84%
and I wasn't getting
a single interview--

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.330 align:middle line:84%
to the point where I
even applied to just work

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.780 align:middle line:84%
for the RSPCA asking for
donations on the street,

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.920 align:middle line:84%
just to see if somebody
would interview me.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.145 align:middle line:84%
Nobody would interview
me for a job.

00:05:08.145 --> 00:05:10.270 align:middle line:84%
It was just like the universe
was saying to me, no.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.960 align:middle line:84%
This is not the direction
that you're meant to go.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.730 align:middle line:84%
But there was this knee-jerk
reaction that I had to recreate

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.310 align:middle line:90%
that in this new situation--

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:19.630 align:middle line:90%
until I finally gave that up.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.210 align:middle line:84%
And when I gave
that up, then I went

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.120 align:middle line:90%
on a totally different path.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.030 align:middle line:84%
>> It was kind of letting
go of the certainty.

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.350 align:middle line:90%
That's what I had to let go of.

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.670 align:middle line:84%
I had to let go of certainty
that I knew how the world was,

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:39.970 align:middle line:84%
and that I knew what was
true, because I don't--

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.900 align:middle line:84%
not on a belief level,
not on a mental level.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that truth
resides on that level.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.640 align:middle line:84%
Truth-- real truth, I
think, is beyond the mind.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And so I think I got to a place
where I realized that-- well,

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.290 align:middle line:90%
these are just tools.

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:02.100 align:middle line:84%
I can believe something in
order to achieve something.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.530 align:middle line:84%
I can have a belief that
is congruent with achieving

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:08.890 align:middle line:90%
a goal.

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:13.470 align:middle line:84%
And when I have
achieved that goal

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.000 align:middle line:84%
and I want to go
to the next goal,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.690 align:middle line:84%
I might need a new belief in
order to get to the next stage.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.820 align:middle line:84%
They're not things
that are set in stone.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.460 align:middle line:84%
They're just things that I can
choose to take on because they

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.260 align:middle line:90%
serve me at the time.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And then I can choose
to let them go in,

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.200 align:middle line:84%
and choose a new belief
that will serve me

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.100 align:middle line:90%
for where I want to go next.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.683 align:middle line:84%
>> I didn't have enough money
to live for the rest of my life.

00:06:35.683 --> 00:06:38.693 align:middle line:84%
I had enough money to
subsist day to day,

00:06:38.693 --> 00:06:40.110 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't know
what I was going

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:41.360 align:middle line:90%
to do for the rest of my life.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.630 align:middle line:90%
And my wife was pregnant.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.630 align:middle line:84%
We were due to have a
child in two months.

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:50.810 align:middle line:84%
And I asked my brother,
what should I do?

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And he's a very
religious person,

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.410 align:middle line:84%
and he said, pray--
pray for guidance.

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:56.850 align:middle line:90%
Ask for guidance.

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:01.860 align:middle line:84%
So I sat down in a room, and
I just prayed for seven hours.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.120 align:middle line:90%
I just said, please guide me.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:03.780 align:middle line:90%
Please guide me.

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:04.440 align:middle line:90%
Please guide me.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:04.900 align:middle line:90%
Please guide me.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.900 align:middle line:84%
I said it over and over
again-- please guide me.

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.230 align:middle line:90%
Please guide me.

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:12.500 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
that seven hours,

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.110 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I had made
some sort of connection

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:19.320 align:middle line:90%
with myself, with some guidance.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.900 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what I was going
to do for the rest of my life,

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.240 align:middle line:84%
but I had made a
connection inside myself

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.590 align:middle line:90%
with some inner guidance.

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.320 align:middle line:84%
>> I think, for a long time, I
believed that everyone else had

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:34.060 align:middle line:84%
a formula, and for some reason
I had not been given the secret

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:34.860 align:middle line:90%
code.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.160 align:middle line:90%


00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:44.010 align:middle line:84%
Everyone else must know, and
everyone else has a plan.

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:46.560 align:middle line:90%
Everyone else has a map but me.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
ask their advice so

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:50.040 align:middle line:90%
that they can show me the map.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I get kind of
preaching about it,

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.580 align:middle line:84%
but I really think that people
need to live by their own

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:55.380 align:middle line:90%
rules--

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.200 align:middle line:84%
as long as you're not hurting
people, lying to people.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:01.197 align:middle line:84%
I was absolutely inculcated
in the rules of what

00:08:01.197 --> 00:08:02.780 align:middle line:84%
I was supposed to
do to be successful,

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.400 align:middle line:84%
and I sucked at
following them properly.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.860 align:middle line:84%
>> When we talk about abundance,
I don't want to say that

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:09.660 align:middle line:90%
I've arrived.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:12.360 align:middle line:90%


00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.215 align:middle line:90%
I'm on the journey.

00:08:13.215 --> 00:08:16.210 align:middle line:90%


00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:20.400 align:middle line:84%
I might have things to
share about my journey that

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.940 align:middle line:84%
could help other people who
are also on the journey,

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:25.950 align:middle line:90%
but I haven't arrived anywhere.

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:29.100 align:middle line:90%


00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:37.500 align:middle line:84%
The only place I could arrive,
I suspect, is home to myself.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:41.429 align:middle line:84%
>> And the people who do the
best really make it up as they

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:42.630 align:middle line:90%
go along.

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:46.830 align:middle line:84%
They create their experience
from the inside-out.

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And we call that type of
thinking "bring forthism."

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And "bring forthism" is really
about how we consciously

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.780 align:middle line:84%
create our experience,
because we're always

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.540 align:middle line:90%
creating our life experience.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's about making
a conscious choice

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.940 align:middle line:84%
about how you go through life,
and it's really lining up

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.940 align:middle line:84%
your beliefs with your
higher self and your mission

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.760 align:middle line:84%
and who you are in the
world, and really aligning

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.580 align:middle line:84%
your inner thinking
with what you want.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And when you get all
those things lined up,

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:20.340 align:middle line:84%
then literally it's like
you bring forth a whole new

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:24.510 align:middle line:84%
reality, and you're generating
that from the inside-out,

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:26.730 align:middle line:90%
instead of the outside-in--

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:28.740 align:middle line:84%
which is what a
lot of people do.

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:33.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Nothing is for everybody, but
everybody can find a path that

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.470 align:middle line:90%
makes sense for them.

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:35.970 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
work for yourself.

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:38.168 align:middle line:84%
It's not about
working for yourself.

00:09:38.168 --> 00:09:39.960 align:middle line:84%
It's about working in
an environment that's

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.090 align:middle line:90%
meaningful and has dignity.

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And you can create
that yourself,

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:48.570 align:middle line:84%
or you might find a group of
people who are doing that.

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:52.210 align:middle line:84%
But I think that a lot of the
negativism and the negativity

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:56.610 align:middle line:84%
and the naysaying comes from
people who took the shot,

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:59.010 align:middle line:84%
didn't make the shot,
and they scuttled

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:02.490 align:middle line:84%
back to what was
comfortable, and nobody

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:05.250 align:middle line:90%
shut up and let them be brave--

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:07.590 align:middle line:84%
which is sad; which
is really sad.

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:12.900 align:middle line:84%
>> The only way I know of to
stay true to the new vision is

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:16.860 align:middle line:84%
to know who you are,
is to be authentic,

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:20.400 align:middle line:84%
to step into your own authentic
space and live that life

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.870 align:middle line:84%
authentically, because
from an authentic space,

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:24.720 align:middle line:90%
we can't be anything but true.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.570 align:middle line:84%
If we know who we
are authentically,

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:29.850 align:middle line:84%
if we know what our
authentic path looks like,

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:34.140 align:middle line:84%
if we know what our values are,
if they're so important to us

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:37.320 align:middle line:84%
that we would never
compromise those values,

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:42.470 align:middle line:84%
then nothing outside of us is
going to take us off our path.

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:45.070 align:middle line:84%
That's like your true
north on a compass.

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:46.400 align:middle line:90%
That's your true north.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.030 align:middle line:84%
If I know who I am and
what's important to me

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:54.410 align:middle line:84%
and what is important
to life, then

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:58.195 align:middle line:84%
whatever happens outside
myself isn't going to--

00:10:58.195 --> 00:10:59.570 align:middle line:84%
no matter what
direction you turn

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:01.195 align:middle line:84%
when you've got a
compass in your hand,

00:11:01.195 --> 00:11:02.930 align:middle line:90%
it always points true north.

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:08.650 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel we all have a
responsibility to tune

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:12.680 align:middle line:84%
in and dial into
our soul's calling.

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And that calling has a
particular type of voice.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:21.040 align:middle line:90%
It's not verbal for most people.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:24.415 align:middle line:90%
It's a feeling of deep comfort.

00:11:24.415 --> 00:11:28.350 align:middle line:90%


00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:30.460 align:middle line:84%
I feel we have a
responsibility to align

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:37.350 align:middle line:84%
that feeling of deep comfort
with our intellect as well.

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:41.220 align:middle line:84%
Not to degrade our
intellect, but to unify

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:45.030 align:middle line:84%
our soul and our
mind together, which

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:48.180 align:middle line:84%
makes for such a
harmonious activation.

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:50.850 align:middle line:90%


00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:53.880 align:middle line:84%
The responsibility
is simply that--

00:11:53.880 --> 00:12:03.270 align:middle line:84%
the ability to respond to that
deep comfort as a navigation

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:05.670 align:middle line:84%
tool for do I go
down that route?

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:06.660 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:10.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm not comfortable at my core.

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:12.660 align:middle line:90%
Do I go down that route?

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:13.740 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:20.140 align:middle line:84%
That feels relaxed,
wholesome, natural.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:26.150 align:middle line:84%
Ah, then my ability to
respond to that is my action.

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:30.420 align:middle line:84%
Ability is action--
concerted action

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:34.140 align:middle line:84%
in the marketplace of
life, as my mentor,

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:35.820 align:middle line:90%
[? Stewie, ?] told me.

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:41.070 align:middle line:84%
He says, when you're listening,
when you're tuning in,

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:44.530 align:middle line:90%
life will slow down.

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:46.880 align:middle line:84%
But then your ability to
listen will allow your ability

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:51.230 align:middle line:84%
to magnify your ability
to act, so that you're not

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:55.520 align:middle line:84%
doing extraneous or
excessive actions.

00:12:55.520 --> 00:13:00.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes it's the things
that are so easy for you,

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:05.000 align:middle line:84%
that are your greatest assets
and gifts, that we don't see.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.800 align:middle line:90%
When I was a kid--

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.350 align:middle line:90%
13, 14, 15, 16, 17--

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:11.300 align:middle line:84%
when I got home
from school, I would

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:16.430 align:middle line:84%
be on the telephones
for 4, 5, 6 hours a day.

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And my parents would always
go, "Get off the phone!

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:22.255 align:middle line:84%
What are you doing on
the phone for so long?

00:13:22.255 --> 00:13:23.630 align:middle line:84%
Who are you talking
to?" and they

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:26.510 align:middle line:84%
would try to get me
to stop communicating.

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:27.740 align:middle line:90%
But it was natural for me.

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:29.780 align:middle line:90%
It was easy for me.

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, you're
wasting your time.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.790 align:middle line:90%
You're not becoming anything.

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:36.860 align:middle line:84%
Why are you talking
to so many people--

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:37.693 align:middle line:90%
guys, girls?

00:13:37.693 --> 00:13:39.110 align:middle line:84%
At the time, there
were loop lines

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:41.428 align:middle line:84%
where you could talk to a
variety of different people.

00:13:41.428 --> 00:13:42.470 align:middle line:90%
I was like, I don't know.

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:44.580 align:middle line:90%
I just like talking to people.

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And I remember them
saying, well, you'll

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.680 align:middle line:84%
never amount to anything
just talking on the phone.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.740 align:middle line:84%
You need to develop
a skill somehow.

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:55.460 align:middle line:84%
We joke today that
I get paid what

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:57.320 align:middle line:84%
seems to be crazy
amounts of money

00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:00.860 align:middle line:84%
to speak on stage for
an hour and share things

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:03.680 align:middle line:84%
that I've learned with
people from a skill

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:07.210 align:middle line:84%
that my parents told
me, stop using it.

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:08.420 align:middle line:90%
Stop growing it.

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:11.090 align:middle line:84%
You'll never make any
money talking to people.

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:12.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of us are
great with people,

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:13.970 align:middle line:90%
and we're quite disorganized.

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:16.790 align:middle line:84%
Some of us are really
great at the detail,

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:19.640 align:middle line:84%
but we're actually a little bit
less extroverted when it comes

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.547 align:middle line:90%
to being around other people.

00:14:21.547 --> 00:14:23.630 align:middle line:84%
Every one of us has a
different energy between us,

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:25.130 align:middle line:84%
and when we actually
start realizing

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:27.140 align:middle line:84%
what that natural path
is, there is no question

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.210 align:middle line:84%
that there is a pathway
we can follow which

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:30.830 align:middle line:90%
doesn't feel like hard work.

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:32.270 align:middle line:84%
That was one of
the first lessons

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:34.880 align:middle line:84%
that I got from
one of my mentors.

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:36.350 align:middle line:84%
If it feels like
hard work, you're

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:37.640 align:middle line:90%
already doing the wrong thing.

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:41.150 align:middle line:84%
>> I think you've got
to put the effort in.

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:43.310 align:middle line:84%
You've got to put the
effort into what you love,

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:46.430 align:middle line:84%
and what comes naturally
and easy for you,

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:50.090 align:middle line:84%
and get really good at what's
natural and easy for you.

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
universe opens up.

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:54.260 align:middle line:90%
That's where you play.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.595 align:middle line:84%
>> So if you're good
at the stock market,

00:14:56.595 --> 00:14:58.970 align:middle line:84%
you invest in the stock market,
your money starts to make

00:14:58.970 --> 00:14:59.330 align:middle line:90%
money.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.220 align:middle line:84%
Or if you invest in real
estate and you're good at that,

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:03.230 align:middle line:84%
your money starts
to make money there.

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:07.100 align:middle line:84%
Or you figure out ways to work
that start to separate time

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:07.940 align:middle line:90%
from money--

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:09.350 align:middle line:90%
sources of passive income.

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:11.090 align:middle line:84%
I write books, and
I get royalties.

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:12.970 align:middle line:84%
I do a lot of work
at the beginning,

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:14.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't do so much
work, and they

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:16.910 align:middle line:84%
send me checks every
once in a while.

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:17.990 align:middle line:90%
That's kind of cool.

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:20.660 align:middle line:84%
So if you can figure out this
money game-- because money's

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:23.960 align:middle line:84%
just this made-up
agreement that we have,

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.810 align:middle line:84%
and how to separate
time from money,

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:29.390 align:middle line:84%
and then you can figure out
what you're really on the planet

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:30.190 align:middle line:90%
for.

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:33.950 align:middle line:84%
So it's that self-care,
generosity towards yourself,

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:36.260 align:middle line:84%
generosity towards other
people, and starting

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.080 align:middle line:84%
to feel that abundance
of time and money.

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:42.620 align:middle line:84%
>> What I started doing everyday
is deepening that connection.

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:46.670 align:middle line:84%
So every morning, I would
meditate and ask for guidance,

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:47.870 align:middle line:90%
and I would get guidance.

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:49.470 align:middle line:84%
I got guidance on
how to lose weight,

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:52.700 align:middle line:84%
and I lost all my
weight; guidance on how

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:56.060 align:middle line:84%
to practice visualization,
how to create in the world,

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:59.030 align:middle line:90%
how to feel supported--

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:01.820 align:middle line:90%
just everyday, I got guidance.

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And I started writing,
every day, the guidance

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:05.840 align:middle line:90%
that I was getting.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.720 align:middle line:84%
>> So one way that you
can become more conscious

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.880 align:middle line:84%
of your ongoing beliefs--
especially your limiting

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.610 align:middle line:90%
beliefs-- is to journal.

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:13.820 align:middle line:90%
One of the things I find--

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:15.590 align:middle line:84%
I get up in the
morning, and I journal

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:17.840 align:middle line:84%
about how I feel,
what I'm experiencing,

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.403 align:middle line:84%
how I think the day's
going, how my life is.

00:16:20.403 --> 00:16:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And then I don't read
it for a few days.

00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:25.580 align:middle line:84%
I can look back and see,
a-ha, that looks like it

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:27.080 align:middle line:90%
could be a limiting belief.

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And if I ask certain questions
like, that's true because--

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:32.630 align:middle line:84%
and answer it, or, what
does that mean exactly,

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:34.190 align:middle line:90%
or what does that mean about me?

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:36.630 align:middle line:84%
Then I can start finding
my own limiting beliefs.

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:41.270 align:middle line:84%
>> One derailer is looking at
the ease with which you can

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:45.080 align:middle line:84%
change your mind, because
changing your mind and choosing

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:48.230 align:middle line:84%
a new path is a quick
and easy thing sometimes.

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:49.760 align:middle line:84%
Just because we
have new awareness,

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.530 align:middle line:90%
now we can step into new space.

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And for many people who've
been taught that progress

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:58.400 align:middle line:84%
has to be difficult,
progress has to be hard,

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:01.655 align:middle line:84%
the ease is sometimes the
thing that derails us.

00:17:01.655 --> 00:17:04.280 align:middle line:84%
It's sometimes-- oh, it
can't possibly be that easy,

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:07.579 align:middle line:84%
and it can't possibly
be that simple.

00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:10.819 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't have missed this,
and it be that easy And

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:15.810 align:middle line:84%
so sometimes, just that message
that we are telling ourselves--

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:17.089 align:middle line:90%
that it can't be that easy--

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:18.710 align:middle line:84%
is the very thing
that prevents us

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:20.849 align:middle line:84%
from stepping into
that new space.

00:17:20.849 --> 00:17:23.817 align:middle line:84%
>> I think a lot of people think
that change is really hard,

00:17:23.817 --> 00:17:25.609 align:middle line:84%
and change is something
you have to strive.

00:17:25.609 --> 00:17:28.460 align:middle line:84%
For I know I spent a lot of
years striving, striving,

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:29.900 align:middle line:90%
striving, striving.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And all it got me
was exhaustion.

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:35.660 align:middle line:90%
I don't think I changed.

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:37.230 align:middle line:90%
I didn't change much at all.

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:41.900 align:middle line:84%
I kept myself so busy so
I wouldn't have to change.

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:44.870 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it wasn't
in the striving.

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:47.750 align:middle line:90%
It was in the letting go.

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:50.560 align:middle line:90%
And the letting go--

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:52.160 align:middle line:90%
it's not that it was hard.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:56.440 align:middle line:90%
I just had to do it.

00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:00.550 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't that it took time.

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:03.310 align:middle line:84%
It was instantaneous
when it happened.

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:04.840 align:middle line:90%
I just had to choose it.

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:06.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Change happens fast.

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:07.930 align:middle line:84%
People think, a lot
of times, change

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:09.940 align:middle line:84%
is a slow, arduous,
forever process

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:13.410 align:middle line:84%
or takes all this
cognitive energy.

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:17.230 align:middle line:84%
But I learned early in my NLP
career, working with people,

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:18.590 align:middle line:90%
that it can happen this fast.

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:19.960 align:middle line:90%
>> There's a voice.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:20.890 align:middle line:90%
Live it.

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:22.630 align:middle line:90%
Just step into it.

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:24.210 align:middle line:84%
That's what I have
to say about that.

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:28.140 align:middle line:84%
It's much simpler than what
anyone makes it out to be.

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:35.755 align:middle line:90%
