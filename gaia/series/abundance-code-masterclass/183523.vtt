00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:18.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Carl Jung wrote a thesis
called "Falsification of Type."

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And "Falsification
of Type" talks

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.610 align:middle line:84%
about the physical
consequences to not

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.890 align:middle line:90%
being true to who you are.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.570 align:middle line:84%
And they range everywhere
from emotional discomfort

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.580 align:middle line:84%
to full-blown illness-- heart
disease, cancer, diabetes,

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.610 align:middle line:90%
arthritis, all kinds of things.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And when you understand how
the subconscious mind works,

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.810 align:middle line:90%
you see how that goes.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.680 align:middle line:84%
Because we all have
this absolutely perfect

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.200 align:middle line:90%
internal compass.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.530 align:middle line:90%
It's flawless.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And it lets you know whether
you're on your right path

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.090 align:middle line:90%
or off emotionally.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.150 align:middle line:84%
So if you're on the right path,
you're happy, you're joyous,

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.480 align:middle line:84%
you're content, you're feeling
satisfied, you're energized.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.910 align:middle line:84%
That's your own internal
compass telling you

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.260 align:middle line:90%
you're on your path.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.720 align:middle line:84%
When you're angry,
when you're frustrated,

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.410 align:middle line:84%
when you're fearful,
that's your compass saying,

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:12.580 align:middle line:90%
you're off your path.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.700 align:middle line:84%
>> When you play the game
by someone else's rules,

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.120 align:middle line:90%
you're so off.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.150 align:middle line:90%
And you're sacrificing family.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.560 align:middle line:84%
You're sacrificing
relationships.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.685 align:middle line:84%
You're sacrificing your
relationship with yourself.

00:01:24.685 --> 00:01:26.400 align:middle line:84%
You're sacrificing
a relationship

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.690 align:middle line:84%
with the natural world,
is a big one for me,

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.220 align:middle line:84%
your community, with
your spiritual self.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.290 align:middle line:84%
So often, when you get
stuck in those boxes,

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.970 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't allow you to live
your biggest, fullest life.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Prosperity is about health.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.510 align:middle line:84%
Prosperity is about
relationships.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.280 align:middle line:90%
Prosperity is about love.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.420 align:middle line:84%
Prosperity is
about spirituality.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.960 align:middle line:84%
It's about all
encompassing areas of life.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.360 align:middle line:84%
You really can't
be truly prosperous

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.270 align:middle line:84%
if one area is just
totally lacking

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.688 align:middle line:90%
and other areas are taking over.

00:01:55.688 --> 00:01:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's what happens
for a lot of people

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.470 align:middle line:90%
within the system.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.580 align:middle line:84%
They get so financially driven
that everything else suffers.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.780 align:middle line:90%
Their relationship suffers.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.190 align:middle line:90%
Their spirituality suffers.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.930 align:middle line:84%
And then they end
up in a place where

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.630 align:middle line:84%
they're in quiet
desperation once again.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And they don't feel what
they really need to feel.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.530 align:middle line:90%
So what do they do?

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.080 align:middle line:84%
They either go buy, or
they'll do something

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.300 align:middle line:84%
to try to solve that,
or self-medicate.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's why there's a
lot of pain in the world.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.150 align:middle line:84%
>> I remember coming home
one day and there was this

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.350 align:middle line:90%
commotion on the street.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And it was down in
front of my house.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And then I could see
Renata was in the front.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:30.660 align:middle line:90%
And she was crying.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.160 align:middle line:84%
She was actually
out on the pavement

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.810 align:middle line:84%
and she was arguing
with somebody.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And she had Kathleen
on her arms.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.210 align:middle line:84%
And there were-- the neighbors
had come out, as well.

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And the person who
she was arguing with

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.960 align:middle line:84%
was a tow truck driver who
had come to tow our car.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.720 align:middle line:84%
So we clearly had gotten
letters which I hadn't even

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.430 align:middle line:84%
read saying, you're
on your final payment.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.740 align:middle line:90%
And this guy had come.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.560 align:middle line:90%
And he was-- the car was up.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.870 align:middle line:84%
And I, obviously,
kind of came over.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And I was saying,
no, we can pay it.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.480 align:middle line:90%
I can sort it out.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.628 align:middle line:84%
And he was the wrong
guy to even say that to.

00:03:02.628 --> 00:03:04.170 align:middle line:84%
He's like, you know,
here's the chit.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.400 align:middle line:90%
You go phone the number.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.840 align:middle line:90%
But I'm off.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.550 align:middle line:90%
And we pleaded it for a while.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And Renata and I were
in this massive divide,

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.590 align:middle line:84%
where she was so upset,
embarrassed, like totally--

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.990 align:middle line:84%
like visibly shaken
by the experience.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.900 align:middle line:90%
I was, too.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.810 align:middle line:90%
The tow truck driver left.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.690 align:middle line:90%
The neighbors left.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.000 align:middle line:90%
Renata went back in the house.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And I was there, right on my
own, like on the pavement,

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.690 align:middle line:84%
thinking, there's something
wrong with this picture.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:31.490 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.060 align:middle line:84%
There something wrong with
the way I'm living my life.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.480 align:middle line:84%
>> We all have an
abundance of something.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.020 align:middle line:84%
Many people have an abundance
of things they don't want.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.760 align:middle line:84%
The goal is to discover the
path, the right combination,

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.140 align:middle line:84%
so that you have an abundance
of things you do want.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.550 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, the burnout studies
in the late 1970s and early

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.600 align:middle line:84%
'80s would find out that
people would burnout in a job.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.560 align:middle line:84%
And so what they do
is they would say,

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.580 align:middle line:90%
I can't stand this job.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:57.538 align:middle line:90%
I don't like this boss.

00:03:57.538 --> 00:03:59.200 align:middle line:90%
And they get a different job.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.617 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon, they'd get
all the same burnout symptoms.

00:04:01.617 --> 00:04:03.908 align:middle line:84%
So then they'd say, well,
I'm going to try my own work.

00:04:03.908 --> 00:04:06.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to work for me, then
I won't have this lousy boss

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.530 align:middle line:90%
pushing me around.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.308 align:middle line:84%
Then they'd find
that the same issues.

00:04:09.308 --> 00:04:11.600 align:middle line:84%
Because the change has got
to be from the inner change,

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.950 align:middle line:90%
not that external change.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.269 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was in my early 20s,
because of working so hard,

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.070 align:middle line:84%
I developed something
called ulcerative colitis,

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.030 align:middle line:84%
which is having
ulcers in your colon.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And, for those who don't
understand what that means,

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.118 align:middle line:84%
if you have bleeding
ulcers in your colon,

00:04:30.118 --> 00:04:32.160 align:middle line:84%
you really don't have any
bowel control movement.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.440 align:middle line:84%
Because your colon
swells up and there's

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.170 align:middle line:84%
less room for anything
to pass through.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up with
this disease that

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.450 align:middle line:84%
had me taking 25 pills
a day, when I was 22.

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.470 align:middle line:84%
I was doing two
cortisone enemas a day.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.040 align:middle line:84%
I was doing a
colonoscopy once a month.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.340 align:middle line:84%
And this happened-- it went
on for about two years.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:02.200 align:middle line:84%
>> I was always in a state of
severe mental pain, always.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.660 align:middle line:84%
There was not-- unless I was
anesthetizing myself through

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.370 align:middle line:90%
some sort of distraction--

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.170 align:middle line:90%
food or entertainment.

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:11.490 align:middle line:90%
I was always in pain.

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.500 align:middle line:90%
I mean, always in pain.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.570 align:middle line:90%
I always hated it.

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And then when-- my body
manifested that pain because,

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.260 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden, I'm in a
body that's 300-400 pounds.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's a living
nightmare, you know?

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.785 align:middle line:90%
That's a prison, in a sense.

00:05:25.785 --> 00:05:26.910 align:middle line:90%
That's the ultimate prison.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.600 align:middle line:84%
Because your body-- you know,
if you're trapped in your body,

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.300 align:middle line:84%
if your body doesn't feel
good, you're trapped in a way

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.290 align:middle line:84%
that you're not trapped
in any other way.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.590 align:middle line:84%
So it was-- there
was pain in every way

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.692 align:middle line:84%
that there could
be pain basically.

00:05:39.692 --> 00:05:42.150 align:middle line:84%
>> It's really important in
talking about abundance that we

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.660 align:middle line:84%
encompass this area of
understanding the depth

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.420 align:middle line:84%
of life, that it
encompasses all areas.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.690 align:middle line:84%
You can't have one lacking
and be truly prosperous.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.390 align:middle line:84%
You really need to work
on all facets of life.

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.990 align:middle line:84%
>> As soon as I understood
that I may be, maybe,

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.640 align:middle line:84%
at cause of this, I said, well,
what would be a process for me

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.060 align:middle line:84%
to put myself in the
state of at ease.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.520 align:middle line:90%
So I started to meditate daily.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.260 align:middle line:90%
I started to visualize daily.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.400 align:middle line:84%
I started to write my
health affirmations.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.900 align:middle line:90%
I started to eat properly.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:16.875 align:middle line:90%
I started to exercise.

00:06:16.875 --> 00:06:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And I started to put myself
in a totally different

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:22.480 align:middle line:90%
energetic space.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.800 align:middle line:84%
I started to really nourish
my body, mind, and spirit.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.580 align:middle line:84%
And, as much as I didn't have
any clue about spirituality

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.460 align:middle line:84%
at the time, I read
enough about it

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.650 align:middle line:84%
that I believed that there
was some power there.

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And maybe I can tap into
this power to help me.

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:42.850 align:middle line:84%
And within five weeks, I had
cured myself of a disease

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:44.860 align:middle line:90%
that I had for two years.

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And I was totally,
totally healthy.

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.310 align:middle line:84%
I remember having a
colonoscopy done, which, ,

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:54.100 align:middle line:84%
obviously is not very
pleasant, and the doctor says,

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.510 align:middle line:90%
what have you done?

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:56.310 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, why?

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.280 align:middle line:84%
He says, because
you're totally healed.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.525 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I've
been doing meditation.

00:07:01.525 --> 00:07:02.775 align:middle line:90%
I've been doing visualization.

00:07:02.775 --> 00:07:03.858 align:middle line:90%
I've been eating probably.

00:07:03.858 --> 00:07:04.778 align:middle line:90%
I've been exercising.

00:07:04.778 --> 00:07:06.070 align:middle line:90%
I've been writing affirmations.

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.400 align:middle line:84%
I've been saying these
health affirmations.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.930 align:middle line:84%
He says, well, I've not
seen this type of a reversal

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:19.235 align:middle line:84%
in the stage of a colon
like yours before.

00:07:19.235 --> 00:07:20.860 align:middle line:84%
>> One of our
colleagues, Randy Kunkel,

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.440 align:middle line:84%
did a bunch of research and
found that people had three

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.830 align:middle line:84%
responses to burnout when
they were playing by the rules

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.360 align:middle line:84%
and not getting
the abundant life.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.870 align:middle line:90%


00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:33.990 align:middle line:84%
Some people would take a
sort of a geographical cure.

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:36.000 align:middle line:84%
They would move to a
different environment.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.230 align:middle line:90%
They'd take a different job.

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.940 align:middle line:84%
Or they would start
their own business.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the problem
would travel with them.

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:43.963 align:middle line:84%
And they would have
it all over again.

00:07:43.963 --> 00:07:45.630 align:middle line:84%
But the vast majority
of people would do

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:47.520 align:middle line:90%
something he called "lock in."

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.190 align:middle line:84%
They'd rationalize their
current stuck space

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:52.410 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, you know,
if I'd left this job

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:54.180 align:middle line:84%
I would have to
start over again.

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:55.690 align:middle line:90%
I won't get as much money.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:57.270 align:middle line:84%
You know, I might
as well stay here.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.040 align:middle line:90%
I've got good benefits.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.280 align:middle line:84%
I'll make my life happy by
doing hobbies or something

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.500 align:middle line:90%
outside of work.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.055 align:middle line:84%
And so they never get the
fulfillment that they want.

00:08:06.055 --> 00:08:08.555 align:middle line:84%
A small percentage of people
actually made the inner changes

00:08:08.555 --> 00:08:10.680 align:middle line:84%
and they're the
ones who blossomed

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.890 align:middle line:84%
and didn't have to experience
burnout symptoms any longer.

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:15.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Most people don't
do that though.

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:18.190 align:middle line:84%
Most people ignore
their emotions.

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens is the
subconscious mind goes,

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:22.410 align:middle line:90%
OK, you're ignoring emotions.

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:24.270 align:middle line:84%
So I'll up the
ante a little bit.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And the way it ups the ante is
muscle tension, and headaches,

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.260 align:middle line:84%
and just minor things,
minor disturbances.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.539 align:middle line:84%
If you ignore those--
and many people do--

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:35.250 align:middle line:84%
then it ups the ante
a little further,

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.530 align:middle line:84%
all in an attempt to get
you on your true path.

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:38.669 align:middle line:90%
That's all this is--

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:40.980 align:middle line:84%
an attempt to get
you on your path.

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:43.020 align:middle line:84%
So it keeps upping the
ante until now you've

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:44.490 align:middle line:90%
got full-blown disease.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:48.680 align:middle line:84%
Something will stop
you and make you aware.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And if we understand
that disease is often

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.450 align:middle line:84%
the subconscious
mind's way of letting

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.450 align:middle line:84%
you know you're off your
path and trying really,

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:58.080 align:middle line:84%
really hard to get
you back on, then we

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.430 align:middle line:90%
can know what to adjust.

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:01.570 align:middle line:90%
We know where to begin.

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:03.360 align:middle line:84%
We begin with our
belief systems.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.130 align:middle line:84%
>> If somebody is in
a prison right now,

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:06.750 align:middle line:84%
or they feel like
they're in a prison,

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:09.350 align:middle line:84%
if they feel like they're a
victim of their circumstances,

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:12.900 align:middle line:84%
if they feel like they're
a victim of anything

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:16.650 align:middle line:84%
in their lives right
now, first and foremost,

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:20.340 align:middle line:84%
is I would share with
them, don't blame yourself.

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:21.510 align:middle line:90%
Don't be ashamed.

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:22.680 align:middle line:90%
Don't feel guilty.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.010 align:middle line:84%
>> The first place most
people go is, it's me.

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:27.780 align:middle line:90%
I have a problem.

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:30.300 align:middle line:84%
The second place they go
is, well, wait a minute.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:31.890 align:middle line:90%
There's something more.

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:33.990 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
people in this boat.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.725 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of people who
are feeling what I'm feeling.

00:09:36.725 --> 00:09:38.350 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
people who are lost.

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:40.080 align:middle line:90%
There are a lot of people--

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.667 align:middle line:84%
and there is an
increase in medication.

00:09:43.667 --> 00:09:45.000 align:middle line:90%
There is an increase in illness.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.040 align:middle line:84%
All kinds of
illnesses, everything

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:51.720 align:middle line:84%
from diabetes to cancer, there's
an increase in everything.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.630 align:middle line:84%
Medication being
dispensed like candy.

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:58.260 align:middle line:84%
You know, something's
wrong with the system.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:02.788 align:middle line:84%
And it's that backing up
and looking beyond yourself

00:10:02.788 --> 00:10:03.830 align:middle line:90%
and going, wait a minute.

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:05.460 align:middle line:90%
It isn't just me.

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:07.410 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot of people.

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:10.890 align:middle line:84%
I share this dilemma
with a lot of people.

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:13.420 align:middle line:84%
There's something
wrong with the system.

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And when we can
look systemically

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:20.970 align:middle line:84%
instead of personally, now
we can step back and say, OK,

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:23.340 align:middle line:84%
since it isn't me,
since I'm not broken,

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.680 align:middle line:84%
now I can start
looking for answers.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.780 align:middle line:84%
We don't look for answers
if we believe it's us.

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:30.050 align:middle line:84%
We look for answers if we
believe it's the system.

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:32.310 align:middle line:84%
>> I had a kind of a life
changing experience back

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:33.300 align:middle line:90%
in 2001.

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.760 align:middle line:84%
I was almost on one
of the planes that

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.100 align:middle line:90%
was hijacked on 9/11.

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:41.820 align:middle line:84%
Flight 93, United
Airlines flight 93.

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And I was supposed
to be on that flight.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't, by
just a fluke of fate.

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.730 align:middle line:84%
I was supposed to
go to San Francisco

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:52.688 align:middle line:84%
to meet with a large
brokerage company

00:10:52.688 --> 00:10:54.480 align:middle line:84%
to talk about selling
my brokerage company.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And it was supposed
to be the meeting

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:57.838 align:middle line:84%
that, if I had sold
my brokerage company,

00:10:57.838 --> 00:10:59.638 align:middle line:84%
I would have all the
money that I'd ever

00:10:59.638 --> 00:11:00.930 align:middle line:90%
needed for the rest of my life.

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:02.670 align:middle line:84%
It was that kind
of thing, right?

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And I was supposed to
fly on September 11

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.070 align:middle line:90%
to San Francisco from New York.

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And, anytime I ever flew from
New York to San Francisco,

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.930 align:middle line:84%
I always flew out of Newark
because I lived in New Jersey.

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And there's only
two direct flights

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.830 align:middle line:84%
that go from Newark
to San Francisco.

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:21.613 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
United Airlines flights.

00:11:21.613 --> 00:11:24.030 align:middle line:84%
One's in the afternoon and it
doesn't get until 12 o'clock

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:24.820 align:middle line:90%
at night.

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:25.860 align:middle line:90%
And the other's the morning one.

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.480 align:middle line:84%
So the only flight I ever took
when I went to San Francisco--

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.620 align:middle line:84%
and I went fairly frequently--
was the United Airlines flight

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:34.140 align:middle line:84%
from Newark to San
Francisco in the morning.

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And I happened to have been
away when the flight was booked.

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:41.130 align:middle line:84%
I was out at a seminar,
a weight loss seminar.

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And I asked my business
partner to book the flight.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And he found a cheaper
flight out of LaGuardia that

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.185 align:middle line:90%
connected through Cincinnati.

00:11:51.185 --> 00:11:52.060 align:middle line:90%
And here's the thing.

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:55.230 align:middle line:84%
So we saved $150 on
the flight, right?

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:57.570 align:middle line:84%
But it meant that I had
to drive through New York

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:01.470 align:middle line:84%
into LaGuardia, it would
cost me $300 more in parking,

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:03.450 align:middle line:84%
plus I had to stop
over in Cincinnati

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:05.790 align:middle line:90%
for an hour and a half.

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:07.077 align:middle line:90%
And we were saving $150.

00:12:07.077 --> 00:12:09.660 align:middle line:84%
It was the only time in my life
I've ever been mad at this guy

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:14.538 align:middle line:84%
because he's sort of like my
guardian angel, this person.

00:12:14.538 --> 00:12:16.080 align:middle line:84%
It's the only time
I've ever been mad

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.420 align:middle line:84%
at him in my entire life
was to buy this flight that

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:21.120 align:middle line:90%
made no sense whatsoever.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.722 align:middle line:90%
And he ended up saving my life.

00:12:22.722 --> 00:12:24.180 align:middle line:84%
Because if I had
booked the flight,

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:26.180 align:middle line:84%
I would have booked that
United Airlines flight.

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:29.153 align:middle line:84%
>> When I have enough money
to do this, then I'll be free.

00:12:29.153 --> 00:12:31.070 align:middle line:84%
When I get enough time
off from this and this,

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:34.680 align:middle line:84%
then I'll be able to
do what I really enjoy.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.770 align:middle line:90%
That's total hogwash.

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:40.050 align:middle line:84%
That only gets worse
and worse and worse.

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:42.690 align:middle line:84%
People bury themselves
worse and worse and worse.

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:47.400 align:middle line:84%
And that burying itself,
the illnesses, I believe,

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.610 align:middle line:84%
are a symptom of our
soul going, uh uh.

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:53.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to break you down.

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:55.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to let you
go down someone else's

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:57.510 align:middle line:90%
path of fulfillment.

00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:03.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to let you
pursue this longer and longer.

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:06.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to give you symptoms.

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:09.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give you
signs for you to slow down,

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:13.920 align:middle line:84%
to recalibrate, to
get away from it all,

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:18.580 align:middle line:84%
to listen to what's
true for you.

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:24.510 align:middle line:84%
So, for me, diseases, illness,
stress, muscular tension,

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:29.310 align:middle line:84%
headaches, are aspects of
our very own self aiming

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:34.230 align:middle line:84%
to talk to us in a non-verbal
way to give us wisdom

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:38.080 align:middle line:90%
that we are off plan.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.900 align:middle line:84%
We are off our soul
and mind's unity.

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:42.220 align:middle line:90%
>> I used to live in scarcity.

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:43.428 align:middle line:90%
I know what that was like.

00:13:43.428 --> 00:13:44.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going back there.

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:46.055 align:middle line:90%
You can invite me all you want.

00:13:46.055 --> 00:13:47.180 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to live there.

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:49.103 align:middle line:90%
It's not a fun place to live.

00:13:49.103 --> 00:13:50.770 align:middle line:84%
>> That was a huge
turning point for me.

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:54.640 align:middle line:84%
Because I felt like,
here I am killing myself

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:58.210 align:middle line:84%
and living for this
someday, and now I'm

00:13:58.210 --> 00:13:59.380 align:middle line:90%
living on borrowed time.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:02.540 align:middle line:84%
The universe just gave
me a second chance.

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:04.960 align:middle line:84%
And I decided that
I was not going

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.910 align:middle line:90%
to live for someday anymore.

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:09.510 align:middle line:90%
I was going to live for today.

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And I was going to do in
each day exactly what I

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:15.830 align:middle line:84%
wanted to do, what fulfilled
me, not so that someday I'd

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:16.630 align:middle line:90%
be happy.

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:19.162 align:middle line:84%
I was going to live
for today, right now.

00:14:19.162 --> 00:14:21.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Your thought is what creates
your experience of reality.

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:23.420 align:middle line:84%
If you're thinking
negative things,

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:27.410 align:middle line:84%
or limiting things, or scarcity
things, or looking at the lack,

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:29.230 align:middle line:84%
that's the life you're
going to experience.

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's just the
way it works, period.

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.310 align:middle line:90%
>> I sold my business.

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:36.140 align:middle line:84%
I moved to a small town
in Western Australia.

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:38.810 align:middle line:90%
I bought a small property.

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:43.190 align:middle line:84%
And I started growing my own
food, and living off the land,

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:47.172 align:middle line:84%
and just basically
meditating, and visualizing,

00:14:47.172 --> 00:14:48.380 align:middle line:90%
and taking care of my health.

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:49.922 align:middle line:84%
>> That was the
turning point for me.

00:14:49.922 --> 00:14:53.420 align:middle line:84%
It was that real kind of like
deep experience of scarcity

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:55.340 align:middle line:84%
at an emotional
level, where you say,

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:57.370 align:middle line:84%
I never want to be in
this position again.

00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And when you have that
and it's strong enough

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.730 align:middle line:84%
that you say, never
again, you clearly

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:03.530 align:middle line:84%
need to change the way
you're doing things,

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:05.390 align:middle line:84%
because those things
which keep you in fear

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:07.745 align:middle line:84%
or keep you chasing,
no longer-- and when

00:15:07.745 --> 00:15:10.370 align:middle line:84%
you do that, the liberation that
comes out of it is incredible.

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:14.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Can I bring myself to
thinking, and feeling,

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:16.580 align:middle line:84%
and believing, and doing
something a little bit

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:17.380 align:middle line:90%
differently?

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.570 align:middle line:90%
The answer is everybody can.

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And so we start with
what you can do.

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And we start with what
I call micro yeses.

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:28.870 align:middle line:90%
Micro commitments to change.

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And in making a micro
commitment to change, then what

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:39.090 align:middle line:90%
you're making a decision to--

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:42.390 align:middle line:84%
or decision for-- is
a different future

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:45.360 align:middle line:90%
than your present reality is.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And everybody is
capable of doing that.

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:51.230 align:middle line:90%
