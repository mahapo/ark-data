00:00:02.928 --> 00:00:11.720 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:17.780 align:middle line:84%
>> There's something deep in
my being that wishes to serve.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.530 align:middle line:90%


00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:28.780 align:middle line:84%
There's something in my
purpose, my soul's purpose,

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.040 align:middle line:90%
that is about service.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.570 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if that's
the case for everyone.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.250 align:middle line:84%
But I know that my desire to
serve has served me very well.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.100 align:middle line:90%


00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:49.780 align:middle line:84%
My desire to serve is the
basis for much of my abundance.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.950 align:middle line:90%


00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.800 align:middle line:84%
I can't really point to
any abundance in my life

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.750 align:middle line:84%
that has come through doing
anything other than trying

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.580 align:middle line:90%
to be of service to people.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.040 align:middle line:84%
>> If you'd like to have
more financial abundance,

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.590 align:middle line:84%
you truly have to have a
value on serving people.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.420 align:middle line:84%
You have to have
a value on wealth.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And you have to have
value on yourself.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.997 align:middle line:84%
If those are not
in your top values,

00:01:12.997 --> 00:01:15.330 align:middle line:84%
you're probably going to bang
your head against the wall

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.970 align:middle line:84%
and keep having these same
things keep happening.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.110 align:middle line:84%
>> I was asked to speak about
my financial success when I was

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.260 align:middle line:90%
very young in my early 20s.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.600 align:middle line:84%
So I was put in
the position to get

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.040 align:middle line:84%
in front of people
and share how I

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.090 align:middle line:84%
was able to earn six figures
a year in my early 20s.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.660 align:middle line:90%
And then people--

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.707 align:middle line:90%
I saw people's lights went on.

00:01:41.707 --> 00:01:43.290 align:middle line:84%
There were people
in the audience that

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.870 align:middle line:84%
were in their 30s,
40s, 50s, 60s, and 70s

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.700 align:middle line:90%
when I was in real estate.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.990 align:middle line:84%
And in my early 20s,
I was asked to share

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.870 align:middle line:84%
what I was doing, what I was
thinking, what I was feeling.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.580 align:middle line:90%
What was my daily ritual like?

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.300 align:middle line:84%
What was I doing to
get those results?

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.710 align:middle line:84%
Because people
wanted those results.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And so I was given
the opportunity to,

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.150 align:middle line:84%
again, just use the
communication skills

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:14.410 align:middle line:84%
that came easy for me and just
say, hey, here's what I did.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.842 align:middle line:90%
And here's what I do.

00:02:15.842 --> 00:02:16.800 align:middle line:90%
And here's how I think.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.222 align:middle line:84%
And this is not what
I thought before.

00:02:19.222 --> 00:02:20.430 align:middle line:90%
And this is what I think now.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.800 align:middle line:90%
And this is why I think now.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.950 align:middle line:84%
>> So I had a young
guy, for example,

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.730 align:middle line:84%
who was speaking to
an important group.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:27.730 align:middle line:90%
And he was nervous.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:28.530 align:middle line:90%
He was sweating.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.580 align:middle line:90%
He was closed down.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.980 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what's going on?

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.620 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, I want to
prove that I'm valuable.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.730 align:middle line:84%
I said, OK, that
is the key word--

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.170 align:middle line:84%
prove-- because
it's about himself.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.880 align:middle line:84%
I said, you have
information they don't.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.072 align:middle line:84%
What if we shift that word
and swapped in "to share"?

00:02:47.072 --> 00:02:48.030 align:middle line:90%
So it's not "to prove."

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.170 align:middle line:84%
It's "to share," which is about
service, to help, to give.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.820 align:middle line:84%
So he reframed his intention
from "to prove" to "to share."

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.440 align:middle line:90%
And all of a sudden, he relaxed.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.620 align:middle line:90%
It was about service.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:01.500 align:middle line:90%
It was about giving.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.530 align:middle line:84%
It was about helping,
providing information to people

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.040 align:middle line:90%
who didn't have that before.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.420 align:middle line:90%
So it made him feel better.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.540 align:middle line:90%
It made them feel better.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And it made the
speech transcendent.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Good people hold themselves
back because they think being

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.610 align:middle line:84%
powerful means becoming
some kind of a dictator.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I think the
total opposite is true.

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.220 align:middle line:84%
I think if you have somebody
in your past who's a dictator,

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.190 align:middle line:84%
it's because that person
had a side of themselves

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.110 align:middle line:84%
that was very small
and powerless and tiny.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.027 align:middle line:84%
And that person was suffering
from a lack of vision.

00:03:38.027 --> 00:03:40.360 align:middle line:84%
That person might just have
been a horrible human being.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what made
them what they are.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.600 align:middle line:84%
But don't let that model of a
dictator that's in your past

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.550 align:middle line:84%
keep you from
claiming your power.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:51.900 align:middle line:90%
Power is not about that.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.680 align:middle line:84%
One of my quotes business quotes
is from Paul Newman, who said,

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.260 align:middle line:90%
always take the work seriously.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.270 align:middle line:90%
Never take yourself seriously.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's a
great motto to live by.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.890 align:middle line:84%
The more you can approach
your life, your friends,

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.992 align:middle line:84%
your community, and yourself
with some open-heartedness

00:04:10.992 --> 00:04:13.200 align:middle line:84%
and some humor, the better
life you're going to have.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.870 align:middle line:84%
>> It's very easy with
self-help and self-development

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.420 align:middle line:84%
and personal development
to get serious.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.920 align:middle line:90%
I mean, who laughs in yoga?

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.160 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's so
serious about yoga.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.560 align:middle line:90%
But years ago, I took a class.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And it was just
great because there

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.270 align:middle line:84%
was a lot of laughing
in it when we

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.950 align:middle line:84%
couldn't get a
position or the teacher

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.480 align:middle line:90%
was explaining something.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.700 align:middle line:84%
And it was such a freeing
class because it didn't

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.600 align:middle line:90%
have to be so self-important.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.200 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's a great sign.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.370 align:middle line:84%
If you're having any kind of
humor through the process,

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.420 align:middle line:84%
you're going to move
so much more quickly.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.540 align:middle line:84%
>> A powerful tool
for living an aligned,

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.900 align:middle line:90%
abundant life is amusement.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.530 align:middle line:84%
Imagine how seriously we
take ourselves all the time.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.770 align:middle line:84%
When you have a
sense of amusement,

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.750 align:middle line:84%
you bring a lightness to
your life, a lightheartedness

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:02.550 align:middle line:90%
to your life.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.550 align:middle line:90%
And that spreads pretty quickly.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.960 align:middle line:84%
Think of a room you walk into
where everyone's very serious.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.090 align:middle line:84%
And you add a little
bit of amusement.

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.990 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be too much,
just enough to bring lightness

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.940 align:middle line:90%
into the world, into your life.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.090 align:middle line:90%
It really makes living fun.

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.630 align:middle line:90%
It makes it joyous.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And it really increases your
sense of abundance in life.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I would watch a
James Bond movie.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And I would see James Bond
tied down to something

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.210 align:middle line:84%
as some evil tyrant is about
to burn him in two with a laser

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.010 align:middle line:90%
beam.

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.810 align:middle line:90%
And here he is.

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:46.890 align:middle line:84%
He says something
hilarious, silly, gleefully.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.600 align:middle line:90%
I know it's a movie.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.410 align:middle line:84%
But the idea of facing
death, the worst thing that

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.020 align:middle line:84%
can happen, being burned
in two, and putting out

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.730 align:middle line:84%
some smirk, some light humor,
some giggle, some joy--

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:05.540 align:middle line:84%
for me, humor is the
wink of the universe.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.060 align:middle line:90%
It's the wink.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.910 align:middle line:90%
It's the deep wink in our being.

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.320 align:middle line:84%
>> If you see the Dalai Lama all
the time, he's always laughing.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.950 align:middle line:90%
And I think that shows you.

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.550 align:middle line:84%
You have to be able to laugh
at yourself more than anything.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:23.290 align:middle line:84%
Pretty much all the real
big spiritual teachers and--

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.570 align:middle line:84%
they all laugh at
themselves and tell stories

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.510 align:middle line:84%
about themselves and all
the dumb things they did

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:31.280 align:middle line:84%
and how they've learned
from those things.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.010 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's essential.

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:36.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So I can't think of anything
else I would rather do than

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.280 align:middle line:84%
to help people find out what
they're really here for, help

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.500 align:middle line:84%
them identify what is
really most meaningful,

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.380 align:middle line:84%
most inspiring, that they
can have the most gratitude

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.830 align:middle line:84%
and love for their life about,
and allow them to share that

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:48.940 align:middle line:90%
with the world.

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And helping people
do that, helping

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:52.870 align:middle line:84%
them get what they
want in life like that

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.658 align:middle line:84%
is more than rewarding
than you can imagine.

00:06:55.658 --> 00:06:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>> The ironic thing was,
when I was in that state

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.420 align:middle line:84%
of vulnerability and surrender
to this higher aspect

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.960 align:middle line:84%
of myself, I felt no
shame, no sense of failure,

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.100 align:middle line:90%
nothing negative.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:10.750 align:middle line:84%
I felt completely loved
and supported and nourished

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:14.110 align:middle line:90%
and forgiven and understood.

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:16.612 align:middle line:84%
There was no
judgment whatsoever.

00:07:16.612 --> 00:07:21.250 align:middle line:84%
It was just the most beautiful,
loving, energetic presence

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:23.290 align:middle line:90%
that would occupy my body.

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And when it did, I just felt
totally understood and totally

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.520 align:middle line:90%
loved.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.780 align:middle line:84%
>> I do believe from experience
that being able to be

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:36.040 align:middle line:84%
vulnerable, being able to face
that vulnerability is a real

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.180 align:middle line:90%
source of strength.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:40.060 align:middle line:84%
>> When people live
authentically and congruently

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.940 align:middle line:84%
to their highest values, they
grow the greatest self-worth.

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:44.650 align:middle line:90%
They get the most inspiration.

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:48.190 align:middle line:84%
They become the most profound
in their impact on the planet.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:51.040 align:middle line:84%
And they're destined to leave
a legacy that's immortalizing

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.870 align:middle line:90%
their outcome in life.

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:56.900 align:middle line:84%
>> At the end of the
day, we're all one.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:57.700 align:middle line:90%
They're proving it.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:58.720 align:middle line:90%
Physics is proving it.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:59.560 align:middle line:90%
We're all attached.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.850 align:middle line:90%
Everything's connected.

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:03.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And I honestly believe
when you talk about purpose,

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:05.570 align:middle line:90%
what's the purpose of life--

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:08.350 align:middle line:84%
and when we think about
purpose, we think of,

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:10.330 align:middle line:84%
is my purpose to be
a doctor or a lawyer?

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.190 align:middle line:90%
It's some kind of doing thing.

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.230 align:middle line:84%
And what I've learned
is that everybody

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:16.000 align:middle line:90%
has the exact same purpose.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.120 align:middle line:84%
>> It's only going to take
a few people to show that we

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.890 align:middle line:90%
don't have to live in scarcity.

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:22.520 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to be afraid.

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:25.210 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to hoard.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:26.710 align:middle line:84%
That's not what
abundance is about.

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:28.210 align:middle line:90%
We can be generous.

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:30.830 align:middle line:90%
We can be gracious.

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:31.930 align:middle line:90%
We can be compassionate.

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:36.370 align:middle line:84%
We can be giving not only
to others, but to ourselves.

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:39.650 align:middle line:90%
That is part of abundance.

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:42.580 align:middle line:84%
Sharing, doing it together,
being a community--

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:44.290 align:middle line:90%
that is part of abundance.

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:45.730 align:middle line:90%
We don't do it on our own.

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>> I think we were all meant to
be channels of our higher self

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.510 align:middle line:84%
to bring energy into the world
for an agenda that we know

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:53.560 align:middle line:90%
nothing about.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.000 align:middle line:84%
So the way my life is
unfolding, I have no agenda.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where
it's going to be.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And I could never
have planned it.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.330 align:middle line:84%
But it's going
according to an agenda.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.720 align:middle line:84%
I can see how all the
different activities that I'm

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:09.910 align:middle line:84%
involved in all fit together
like a music performance

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:11.410 align:middle line:84%
that I could never
have constructed.

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And all I'm doing is
getting out of the way.

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:15.228 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like the
highest you could possibly

00:09:15.228 --> 00:09:17.170 align:middle line:90%
be in your life is--

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:19.085 align:middle line:84%
nothing is completely
out of the way

00:09:19.085 --> 00:09:20.960 align:middle line:84%
and allowing this energy
to work through you.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
that is my purpose.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.135 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it's
everyone's purpose--

00:09:24.135 --> 00:09:26.920 align:middle line:84%
is to connect with that energy
and let it run through us.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.040 align:middle line:84%
>> So find out what you want
to do, where you want to go,

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.480 align:middle line:90%
and then let it go.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.160 align:middle line:90%
And let it start to occur.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.720 align:middle line:90%
And be patient.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.550 align:middle line:90%
And write your story.

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:39.280 align:middle line:84%
Turn the page, and
write another page.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And stop worrying about
instantaneous gratification

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:44.680 align:middle line:84%
and being a victim
if it hasn't yet.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:45.670 align:middle line:90%
Do the work.

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:49.270 align:middle line:84%
Row, row, row the boat,
and life is amazing.

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:53.200 align:middle line:84%
>> For me, abundance is having
a total connection with this

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:57.460 align:middle line:84%
loving, supportive, nurturing
energy that comes through me

00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:01.390 align:middle line:84%
and allowing it to work through
me and manifest however it

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:03.860 align:middle line:84%
wants to manifest
to heal the world.

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:07.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Everything that we're looking
for in this world really--

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:10.520 align:middle line:84%
what we're looking for is
a quality of our true self.

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And when you know that, when
you know that we're not just

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:17.620 align:middle line:84%
here to search for happiness
but to follow our joy,

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.930 align:middle line:84%
when you know that we're not
just here to look for love

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:22.150 align:middle line:84%
but to actually be
a loving person,

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:24.040 align:middle line:90%
then we can turn it around.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And then we can
see that actually,

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.110 align:middle line:84%
instead of having, having,
having in order to be,

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:31.160 align:middle line:84%
what if we started
with the being?

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.600 align:middle line:84%
What if we said, today I'm
going to be a loving person?

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.670 align:middle line:84%
Today I'm going to
be guided by love.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:38.350 align:middle line:84%
>> All the disciplines,
the 29,000,

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:41.140 align:middle line:84%
almost 30,000 books
that I've now devoured,

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:45.190 align:middle line:84%
have led me to see the matrix,
the inner hidden order that

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:48.550 align:middle line:84%
goes on in daily life that
most people never get to see.

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:50.547 align:middle line:84%
Most people are
like animals looking

00:10:50.547 --> 00:10:52.630 align:middle line:84%
for that which is unobtainable
and trying to avoid

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:54.310 align:middle line:90%
that which is unavoidable.

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:57.350 align:middle line:84%
But I now realize that
that's not what it's about.

00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:58.740 align:middle line:90%
It's about love.

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And love is a balancing
force in the universe

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:03.880 align:middle line:84%
that maximizes the growth
of all biologic organisms,

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.230 align:middle line:90%
including human beings.

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's why-- as my
mother was trying to tell me,

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:11.500 align:middle line:84%
when she just loved
me and appreciated me,

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:12.700 align:middle line:90%
that was the key to growth.

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:14.320 align:middle line:84%
That was the key
of transformation.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.675 align:middle line:84%
That's when I transcended
my darkest moment

00:11:16.675 --> 00:11:17.968 align:middle line:90%
and turned on the light.

00:11:17.968 --> 00:11:20.260 align:middle line:84%
That's when I realized I was
going to go out and master

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.060 align:middle line:90%
this thing.

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:23.290 align:middle line:84%
That's when I woke up my
vision and my mastery.

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:27.670 align:middle line:84%
>> If you can just be present
and curious to some person

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:30.790 align:middle line:84%
in your life who might have
very different values to you,

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:33.610 align:middle line:84%
you will bring a lot of
richness to yourself.

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:37.420 align:middle line:84%
I think that we get very
actually ego caught up

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:40.660 align:middle line:84%
in having to convince everybody
to think the exact same way we

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:41.650 align:middle line:90%
do.

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's just
another ego trap.

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.810 align:middle line:84%
It's as much of a
trap as the cubicle.

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:49.120 align:middle line:84%
It's as much of a trap
as anything else--

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.830 align:middle line:84%
is this idea that
everybody in the world

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:55.030 align:middle line:84%
has to be converted to
our particular world view.

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And the more that you can stay
open, curious, lighthearted,

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:00.700 align:middle line:90%
sit down with a friend--

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:04.570 align:middle line:84%
that friend might think what
you do for a living is crazy.

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:06.100 align:middle line:90%
That's totally OK.

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.000 align:middle line:90%
It's totally OK.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:08.830 align:middle line:90%
Be curious.

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:09.880 align:middle line:90%
Be open.

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.140 align:middle line:90%
Make it about them.

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:14.155 align:middle line:84%
Talk to them about what they're
doing, feeling, thinking.

00:12:14.155 --> 00:12:15.780 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't always
have to be about you.

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:18.405 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't always have to be
about you recruiting everybody

00:12:18.405 --> 00:12:21.400 align:middle line:84%
in the world to how
you see the world.

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.140 align:middle line:84%
You don't have all
the answers either.

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:25.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't have all
the answers either.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.892 align:middle line:84%
My answers might be totally
inappropriate for that person.

00:12:28.892 --> 00:12:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And I have to make some
peace with that instead

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:34.900 align:middle line:84%
of trying to convince them that
I have found the one true way.

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:38.410 align:middle line:84%
I need to be open, curious,
accepting, and light hearted

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:43.300 align:middle line:84%
about who they are as a person
and try and see their heart.

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.610 align:middle line:84%
They might have something
wonderful and amazing

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:46.840 align:middle line:90%
to teach me.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.207 align:middle line:90%
I would just shut up and listen.

00:12:48.207 --> 00:12:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you just
want to shut up and listen.

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's a great thing
to learn how to do.

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:56.500 align:middle line:84%
>> What would I do if I was
simply dropped on the planet

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:59.260 align:middle line:84%
again, and I had
nothing to prove?

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:00.420 align:middle line:90%
I had nothing to get.

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:01.960 align:middle line:90%
I had nothing to experience.

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:03.370 align:middle line:84%
I was just here
on a bonus round.

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:05.200 align:middle line:90%
This was a bonus life.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.938 align:middle line:90%
And I changed everything.

00:13:07.938 --> 00:13:10.146 align:middle line:84%
That was when I basically
said, all that's left to do

00:13:10.146 --> 00:13:10.620 align:middle line:90%
is to give.

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:11.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what's left but
to go out and serve.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.090 align:middle line:90%
That's all you can do.

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And from that moment onwards,
I shifted my whole thinking.

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:18.557 align:middle line:84%
And everything that I
did was about service.

00:13:18.557 --> 00:13:19.390 align:middle line:90%
It was about giving.

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:21.410 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't about
chasing anything.

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:25.600 align:middle line:84%
There was no need to prove
yourself or to do anything.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And I remind myself
every day when I wake up.

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:32.200 align:middle line:90%
This is a bonus life.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Abundance is really about
being able to help more people.

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And I know that sounds
kind of goody two shoes,

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:41.960 align:middle line:90%
but there is a charge you get.

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.950 align:middle line:84%
There's an energy charge you
get when you help someone out.

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:50.020 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing I found in
terms of stuff or comforts

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:52.930 align:middle line:90%
that can match that charge.

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:54.910 align:middle line:84%
But you have to
discover it for yourself

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:58.690 align:middle line:84%
because when you read
about it or hear about it,

00:13:58.690 --> 00:13:59.590 align:middle line:90%
you don't get it.

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:01.780 align:middle line:84%
You don't get how
amazing you can be.

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>> If we begin to shift our
own mindset towards abundance

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:11.230 align:middle line:84%
and towards thinking not
about how we're limited,

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:16.250 align:middle line:84%
not about how our lives
are mired in scarcity--

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:19.750 align:middle line:84%
if we start going to, how
can I be abundant right?

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:22.460 align:middle line:90%
Now what do I have to give?

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:23.650 align:middle line:90%
What do I have to offer?

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:26.980 align:middle line:90%
Can I plant a tree?

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:30.190 align:middle line:90%
Can I start a community garden?

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:34.330 align:middle line:84%
Can I offer comfort to
someone who needs it?

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.120 align:middle line:90%
Can I give kindness?

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:42.430 align:middle line:84%
Can I be present to someone
who is in pain emotionally

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:44.770 align:middle line:90%
or physically--

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:48.730 align:middle line:84%
if we start to go to
those types of abundance

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:58.400 align:middle line:84%
that we can access, then
that's a place to start.

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:03.230 align:middle line:84%
We can't change the world
until we change the way that we

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:04.550 align:middle line:90%
interact with the world.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:07.280 align:middle line:84%
But changing the way we
interact with the world

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.170 align:middle line:90%
can change the world.

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:13.460 align:middle line:84%
>> There isn't a bigger gift
in the world than being able

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:16.730 align:middle line:84%
to touch somebody's life
with something that you say

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:20.450 align:middle line:84%
or something that you've
discovered that you can share

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:24.620 align:middle line:84%
with them that helps them
transform their lives.

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:28.640 align:middle line:84%
To know that you had a little,
itty-bitty piece of that

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.330 align:middle line:84%
is the biggest
blessing in the world.

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:35.390 align:middle line:84%
It's probably the biggest
addiction I have--

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:38.570 align:middle line:84%
is to somehow touch the
lives of as many people

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:42.440 align:middle line:84%
as I can in a positive
way so that their life is

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:45.350 align:middle line:84%
a little bit easier, more
fun, more loving, more

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:47.190 align:middle line:90%
joyful for them.

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:50.780 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the most amazing
things of moving into abundance

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:55.490 align:middle line:84%
and the abundance that is in
my life is what it allows me

00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:57.770 align:middle line:90%
to contribute to the world.

00:15:57.770 --> 00:15:59.350 align:middle line:90%
This is really for me.

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And everyone's got
different drivers.

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:02.420 align:middle line:84%
But I know enough
about myself where

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.790 align:middle line:84%
the thing that really
drives me is making

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:07.480 align:middle line:90%
an impact, a positive impact.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And specifically for me,
I help entrepreneurs.

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.450 align:middle line:90%
And I think entrepreneurs--

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:14.100 align:middle line:84%
I help them build
their businesses.

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:17.340 align:middle line:84%
And I think entrepreneurs are
the people that are really

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:18.830 align:middle line:90%
creating mass abundance.

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:22.130 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones that
are creating progress.

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:24.113 align:middle line:84%
And they're the ones
that are creating jobs.

00:16:24.113 --> 00:16:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And they're the ones
that are creating wealth.

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:28.680 align:middle line:84%
They're the great
magnifiers in this world.

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And I get to focus
on helping them.

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it
builds my business.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And it brings more
material abundance for me.

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:39.830 align:middle line:90%
So that's wonderful.

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:41.400 align:middle line:90%
It's just great.

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:44.840 align:middle line:84%
But being able to make that
impact and being able to

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.390 align:middle line:84%
wake up in the morning
thinking about that impact

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:50.660 align:middle line:84%
and how to leverage that
impact and make it greater

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:54.560 align:middle line:84%
and how to take it even beyond
building businesses, but just

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:59.360 align:middle line:84%
building just more
positive impact-- it could

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.100 align:middle line:90%
be digging wells in Africa.

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.800 align:middle line:84%
It could take any
number of forms.

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:06.109 align:middle line:90%
It could be helping nonprofits.

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:13.329 align:middle line:84%
But the idea that
I am able to focus

00:17:13.329 --> 00:17:17.750 align:middle line:84%
on helping people leverage their
positive impact is just-- it's

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:18.730 align:middle line:90%
like a dream come true.

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:21.909 align:middle line:84%
It's absolutely a
dream come true.

00:17:21.909 --> 00:17:29.472 align:middle line:90%
