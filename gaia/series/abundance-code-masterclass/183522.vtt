00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.040 align:middle line:84%
>> I was taught growing up
that in order to be successful

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.220 align:middle line:90%
in life, you had to try hard.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.350 align:middle line:84%
You had to be faster,
smarter, better, that there

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.650 align:middle line:84%
was a lot of scarcity in the
world, a lot of limitation,

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.369 align:middle line:84%
a lot of suffering, that
you could be kicked out

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.350 align:middle line:84%
of your house, not
have enough to eat,

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.930 align:middle line:84%
lose everything if you
weren't on top of it,

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.000 align:middle line:84%
if you didn't have a
really good education,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.920 align:middle line:84%
and if you didn't work
really, really hard,

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.890 align:middle line:90%
and really basically struggle.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of the background
or story that I lived with

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.240 align:middle line:84%
and come from has to do with
early childhood and moving from

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.850 align:middle line:84%
Israel, where I was born, and
learned how to speak Hebrew,

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.790 align:middle line:84%
and went to kindergarten, and
then being moved from Israel,

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.800 align:middle line:84%
where I had my comfort
zone, to Montreal,

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.260 align:middle line:84%
Canada and put in grade one,
not understanding the French

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.380 align:middle line:84%
language or the English
language and feeling at a very,

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.500 align:middle line:84%
very young age that I didn't fit
in, that I wasn't smart enough,

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.680 align:middle line:84%
and I wasn't deserving enough
of the teacher's attention

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.950 align:middle line:90%
or the other kids' attention.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.430 align:middle line:84%
And that started, I guess,
an early childhood insecurity

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.500 align:middle line:84%
in me that really lasted
till my early 20s.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.520 align:middle line:84%
That led me to doing some things
when I was in my early teens--

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.390 align:middle line:84%
got in trouble with the law,
got in trouble in school,

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.240 align:middle line:84%
got involved in a small
little street gang where we

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.250 align:middle line:90%
did things that were illegal.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.390 align:middle line:90%
And it was where I fit in.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.830 align:middle line:84%
I felt good with these kids
and all the other misfits.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I had learning
problems as a child

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.330 align:middle line:84%
and my first grade teacher
told me I would never be able

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.213 align:middle line:84%
to read, or write,
or communicate,

00:02:02.213 --> 00:02:04.380 align:middle line:84%
never amount to anything,
never go very far in life.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.030 align:middle line:84%
>> You need to
have a profession.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.560 align:middle line:90%
You need to be serious.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.400 align:middle line:90%
You need to work.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.110 align:middle line:84%
And from that, I
learned that lesson.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And I went on to
business school.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And I went to the Wharton
School of Business,

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.510 align:middle line:84%
and got a degree in finance, and
started working on Wall Street.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.880 align:middle line:84%
>> No matter what, no matter
what you do in your life,

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.097 align:middle line:84%
if you live your life based
on other people's standards

00:02:24.097 --> 00:02:26.430 align:middle line:84%
and other people's judgments,
you're setting yourself up

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.630 align:middle line:90%
for failure.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.420 align:middle line:84%
>> I definitely felt
pressure to go a certain path

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.020 align:middle line:84%
for my career, partly
from family pressure,

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.690 align:middle line:84%
the world I grew up in,
which was highly academic.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And being an actor, which I
was trying to do, was not OK.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.090 align:middle line:84%
>> There are a set
of people, I believe,

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.210 align:middle line:84%
at Princeton University,
who came up with this idea

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.490 align:middle line:84%
of a premature
cognitive commitment.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's an idea
that we will form,

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.370 align:middle line:84%
as a result of our
experience, some belief

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.140 align:middle line:84%
about the world
that will hold fast

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.640 align:middle line:84%
during a certain
developmental time.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes our
perceptive reality forever.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.280 align:middle line:84%
A really good example
of that is in India

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.940 align:middle line:84%
when they train baby elephants,
they will chain the elephant

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.670 align:middle line:90%
to a big, heavy post.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.430 align:middle line:84%
Baby elephant tries like crazy
to get away, can't get away,

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.980 align:middle line:84%
and after awhile will
develop a belief called

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.390 align:middle line:84%
a premature cognitive commitment
that whenever something's

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.060 align:middle line:84%
wrapped around its
leg, it's stuck there.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
reading about that

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.090 align:middle line:84%
and then remembering
when I was a kid,

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.860 align:middle line:84%
watching a newsreel or
a news program on TV

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.090 align:middle line:84%
where there was this
building on fire in India.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And there was an elephant
tied up in front of it,

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.910 align:middle line:84%
and was screaming and trying
to get away, but it wouldn't.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:39.870 align:middle line:90%
It wouldn't walk away.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And it just had a little
rope around its foot.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.880 align:middle line:84%
Finally, some person
came and led him away.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, that elephant
just could have kicked the rope

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.430 align:middle line:84%
off like that and walked
away, but thought he couldn't.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.810 align:middle line:84%
And human beings
operate the same way.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of us get beliefs
and ideas that we can't do

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.480 align:middle line:90%
anything.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.650 align:middle line:90%
And so we just give up.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that makes
the situation a bit worse.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.882 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the challenges I
think people have is that once

00:04:03.882 --> 00:04:05.340 align:middle line:84%
you've developed
a limiting belief,

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.190 align:middle line:84%
whether you got it from
learning from your mom and dad,

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.520 align:middle line:84%
or it's our culture, or it's
some set of experiences you

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.010 align:middle line:84%
had, you'll tend to operate
through that as though

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.150 align:middle line:90%
it's reality.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of times
you won't consider

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.690 align:middle line:84%
anything else
because your reality

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.550 align:middle line:90%
is what this limiting belief is.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:24.270 align:middle line:84%
>> The subconscious mind wants
two things for you, just two.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.430 align:middle line:84%
It wants your physical
survival, and it

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.450 align:middle line:90%
wants your conceptual survival.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.680 align:middle line:84%
Most of us have formed
a concept of who we are

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.310 align:middle line:84%
and what life is about
by the age of 10.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And so we've literally
got this 10-year-old

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.510 align:middle line:90%
running our life force.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.940 align:middle line:90%
>> My father was a taxi driver.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.660 align:middle line:84%
He made, at the time,
$20,000 to $25,000 a year.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.050 align:middle line:84%
My mother worked as a seamstress
at a local department store.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.340 align:middle line:84%
When people bought their
clothes that they needed hemmed,

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.650 align:middle line:90%
she was the person who helped.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.200 align:middle line:90%
And so we lived a modest life.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.490 align:middle line:90%
We had food on the table.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.420 align:middle line:84%
We had clothes on our backs,
but we didn't have anything

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.530 align:middle line:90%
more than that.

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I remember
is there was always

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.800 align:middle line:84%
fighting in my
home around money,

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.190 align:middle line:84%
or maybe the lack of money is
where the fighting came in.

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.330 align:middle line:84%
My father had a gambling
addiction to horses and cards.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.060 align:middle line:84%
So he would work from
5:30 in the morning

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:26.460 align:middle line:84%
till 5, 6 o'clock at night,
make his money for the day,

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.610 align:middle line:84%
come home for dinner,
then go out and play cards

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:29.810 align:middle line:90%
or go to the horse racing.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And by the end of the
night, most days there

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.930 align:middle line:84%
was no more money, so
he went back to work.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And they always fought about
there wasn't enough money.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.380 align:middle line:84%
We used to joke that there
was always too much month

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.350 align:middle line:90%
left at the end of the money.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.750 align:middle line:84%
But it was a constant fight
between my parents, myself,

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.570 align:middle line:90%
and my brother, and my sister.

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.770 align:middle line:84%
We used to close our door
so we wouldn't have to hear

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:56.950 align:middle line:90%
the fighting between them.

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.840 align:middle line:84%
>> I was very focused on getting
ahead in life by the only means

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.380 align:middle line:84%
I understood how,
which was go to school,

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.810 align:middle line:84%
get a good education,
get a good job,

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:15.130 align:middle line:84%
and succeed in the system that
is available to me to succeed

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:16.140 align:middle line:90%
within--

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:19.200 align:middle line:84%
play the game by
the rules and win.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.520 align:middle line:84%
>> I worked really hard for a
couple years and figured that

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.900 align:middle line:84%
maybe if I started
my own business,

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.950 align:middle line:84%
I would be more successful and
then get to this place where I

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:33.060 align:middle line:84%
could be happy, and fulfilled,
and have everything I want.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.160 align:middle line:90%
And I started my own business.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And I worked like a
maniac all the time.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:44.170 align:middle line:84%
I was checking the markets
every two hours in the evenings.

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.590 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't sleeping, so I
was checking the markets

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:52.440 align:middle line:84%
and basically working
in a job that I hated,

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.433 align:middle line:90%
but I was good at it.

00:06:53.433 --> 00:06:55.350 align:middle line:84%
>> I think this idea
where people need to play

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:58.650 align:middle line:84%
by the rules comes off
and out of our childhoods,

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.912 align:middle line:84%
where in our family system
it was the way to behave.

00:07:01.912 --> 00:07:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And so we learned how to
behave in that system,

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:05.040 align:middle line:90%
and it actually worked.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it was the best
choice we could possibly make.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And as we get older,
that way of behaving

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.835 align:middle line:84%
doesn't necessarily fit
in the bigger world,

00:07:14.835 --> 00:07:16.710 align:middle line:84%
and we have to really
identify that and begin

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:18.720 align:middle line:90%
to drop those things off.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.970 align:middle line:84%
I think most of us
can remember times

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:23.490 align:middle line:84%
when we were outside our
family system as a child

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.970 align:middle line:84%
and we started noticing other
families didn't necessarily

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.280 align:middle line:90%
have the same rules as we do.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.810 align:middle line:90%
But we still operate out of--

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:32.518 align:middle line:84%
those are the rules
that worked as a kid.

00:07:32.518 --> 00:07:33.643 align:middle line:90%
This is the way I get love.

00:07:33.643 --> 00:07:34.870 align:middle line:90%
This is the way I get ahead.

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.290 align:middle line:90%
It's why I get appreciation.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And so I think
recognizing that belief

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:45.400 align:middle line:84%
set that get installed
as kids may have worked

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.650 align:middle line:84%
in that context, but it won't
work in the bigger world

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:48.900 align:middle line:90%
necessarily.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.980 align:middle line:84%
>> And so when you're
looking at these programs,

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.290 align:middle line:84%
much of what goes
awry with people,

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:58.350 align:middle line:84%
much of what seems to be
dysfunction is actually

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:02.580 align:middle line:84%
the subconscious mind trying to
sustain your concept of who you

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:04.410 align:middle line:90%
are, to be true to your concept.

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:07.355 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the primary
rules of the subconscious mind,

00:08:07.355 --> 00:08:09.230 align:middle line:84%
one of the primary things
that it tries to do

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:10.860 align:middle line:90%
is make you right.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.620 align:middle line:84%
So if you think you're an
idiot, the subconscious mind

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.570 align:middle line:84%
is going to allow you
to only notice things

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:20.280 align:middle line:84%
that you do that are
idiotic so that you sustain

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.530 align:middle line:90%
that belief in what you hold.

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And so to change the trajectory
that any individual, even

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:30.180 align:middle line:84%
in a group of
individuals, is to change

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:33.120 align:middle line:84%
their concept, the
concept of, who am I

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:38.159 align:middle line:84%
as a human being, who are we
as a community, who are we

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:39.340 align:middle line:90%
as a world?

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:40.710 align:middle line:90%
What are we here for?

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:41.850 align:middle line:90%
Those are all concepts.

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And we can change
those concepts.

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:47.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And I see so many people that
are not enjoying this process.

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:48.960 align:middle line:90%
They're not living their life.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And again, go to the mall,
just look in their eyes.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.190 align:middle line:90%
They're not home.

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:55.093 align:middle line:84%
They're not enjoying
this process.

00:08:55.093 --> 00:08:56.760 align:middle line:84%
They're thinking,
when I get this dress,

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.650 align:middle line:90%
maybe he's going to like me.

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:02.670 align:middle line:84%
When I buy these shoes,
maybe I'll be cool at school.

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:03.570 align:middle line:90%
You're already cool.

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:04.620 align:middle line:90%
Be vulnerable.

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:05.730 align:middle line:90%
Be real.

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:06.780 align:middle line:90%
Find your tribe.

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:07.650 align:middle line:90%
Find your group.

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:08.850 align:middle line:90%
That's what abundance is.

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:11.410 align:middle line:84%
Believe me, there's billions
of people in the world.

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:13.593 align:middle line:84%
There's people that love
everything that you do,

00:09:13.593 --> 00:09:14.760 align:middle line:90%
but you've got to find them.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And how you find them,
you don't find them

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:19.740 align:middle line:84%
by being fake and trying
to be somebody you're not.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.853 align:middle line:84%
You find them by
being real, authentic,

00:09:21.853 --> 00:09:23.520 align:middle line:84%
and living your life
because that's what

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.320 align:middle line:90%
other people are attracted to.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:29.580 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was doing the
things in my teens that I

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:32.210 align:middle line:84%
shouldn't have been doing, I
think the dominant emotion was

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:33.010 align:middle line:90%
fear.

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:35.940 align:middle line:84%
>> There was a certain point
at which I realized that

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:41.340 align:middle line:84%
in my striving, in my intense
determination and dedication

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:44.370 align:middle line:84%
to the cause of
being successful,

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:46.620 align:middle line:84%
becoming knowledgeable,
getting a good job,

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:51.510 align:middle line:84%
succeeding in life and career,
that actually what I was doing

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:53.160 align:middle line:90%
was running.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:57.300 align:middle line:84%
I was running from
my fear of scarcity.

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:01.050 align:middle line:84%
I was so scared that I would
end up back in a position

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:04.320 align:middle line:84%
where I didn't have
material abundance.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.230 align:middle line:84%
>> I always had this thought
that there was a someday.

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:09.450 align:middle line:84%
Someday it was all
going to come together,

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:12.860 align:middle line:84%
and someday I was going to
have enough money to retire,

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:16.440 align:middle line:84%
and I wasn't going to have to
take anybody's stuff anymore,

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.510 align:middle line:90%
and I could be my own person.

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:19.760 align:middle line:90%
There was always that someday.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And that someday was always
six months away, a year away,

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.390 align:middle line:84%
five-- whatever it
was, it was always--

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:29.600 align:middle line:84%
it's like a carrot that kept
getting dangled a little bit

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.860 align:middle line:90%
further in front of me.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:35.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Ernest Holmes said that life
is a mirror and that whatever

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.860 align:middle line:84%
you think will be
reflected back to you.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And so when people are
filled with scarcity thinking

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:46.730 align:middle line:84%
and they're thinking fearful
thoughts, then that's what gets

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:48.290 align:middle line:90%
reflected back to them.

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And I know that sounds like
it's sometimes hard to be true,

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:56.960 align:middle line:84%
but if you think about the
reticular activating system

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.290 align:middle line:84%
in our brain, that's
the part of our brain

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:03.380 align:middle line:84%
that allows us to filter
information in and filter

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:05.360 align:middle line:90%
information out.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.820 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens
is if you're coming

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:10.340 align:middle line:84%
from scarcity-type
thinking, then that's

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:12.485 align:middle line:84%
what you're going to be
sorting for unconsciously,

00:11:12.485 --> 00:11:14.360 align:middle line:84%
and that's what you're
going to draw back in.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.700 align:middle line:84%
So it gets reflected back
to you like a mirror.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And so the first action
that people can really take

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:22.970 align:middle line:84%
is to begin to start
monitoring what

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:24.830 align:middle line:90%
their internal thoughts are.

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:30.350 align:middle line:84%
>> When you are living an
intuitive, authentic life,

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:33.170 align:middle line:90%
that's where true safety is.

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:35.090 align:middle line:90%
It's not in following the rules.

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:37.340 align:middle line:84%
It's not in doing things
the way someone else

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:39.920 align:middle line:90%
tells you how to do them.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:45.740 align:middle line:84%
It's when you are listening to
your true, authentic, intuitive

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:46.550 align:middle line:90%
self.

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:48.920 align:middle line:90%
>> So security is not in a job.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.170 align:middle line:84%
No one else can
give you security.

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:54.077 align:middle line:84%
Security comes from you
and your capabilities,

00:11:54.077 --> 00:11:56.660 align:middle line:84%
and your capabilities to create
value for other people and get

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:57.130 align:middle line:90%
paid for it.

00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:58.595 align:middle line:84%
That's the only
security there is.

00:11:58.595 --> 00:12:01.940 align:middle line:84%
There is no other
security, in my opinion.

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:10.140 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a paradox that
our fears about scarcity,

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:17.630 align:middle line:84%
our fears about our safety lead
us to a place that's unsafe,

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:22.500 align:middle line:84%
that scarcity is the
place that's not safe,

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.560 align:middle line:84%
that abundance is the
place where the safety is.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Abundance is the place
where the love is.

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:34.180 align:middle line:84%
Abundance is the place
where generosity can be.

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:38.320 align:middle line:84%
Abundance is the place
where we can be, and thrive,

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:42.760 align:middle line:84%
and grow together,
where we're not alone,

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:49.230 align:middle line:84%
where we're connected,
where we're interconnected.

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:53.370 align:middle line:84%
Abundance is the place,
the internal place.

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:57.420 align:middle line:84%
The external place comes
from that internal place.

00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:00.330 align:middle line:84%
That internal place of
abundance is where all of that's

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:01.710 align:middle line:90%
possible.

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:04.540 align:middle line:90%
It's not happening in scarcity.

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:07.450 align:middle line:90%
It's not happening in fear.

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:11.590 align:middle line:84%
It's not happening in
competition, and envy,

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:15.210 align:middle line:90%
and adversity, and jealousy.

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:19.360 align:middle line:84%
The good stuff
doesn't exist there.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:28.100 align:middle line:84%
The good stuff exists in
love and abundance of love.
