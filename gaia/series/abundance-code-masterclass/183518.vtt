[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.374 --> 00:00:11.580 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.390 align:middle line:84%
>> I started realizing so
much of my ideas of abundance

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.090 align:middle line:84%
and success came
from my parents,

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.150 align:middle line:84%
came from just other
people around me.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.360 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't from here.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And when I got that, I
started asking myself,

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.080 align:middle line:90%
what is my abundance?

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.240 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean to me?

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And as I started asking
that with real inquiry,

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.050 align:middle line:84%
real genuineness,
almost a yearning

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.770 align:middle line:84%
for my heart for a
deeper happiness,

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.120 align:middle line:90%
I started getting clues.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.760 align:middle line:84%
I started getting-- the right
people would come along.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.620 align:middle line:90%
The right book would come along.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.590 align:middle line:84%
The right mentor would
show up because I feel

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.680 align:middle line:90%
my soul was already abundant.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.210 align:middle line:84%
>> So when I was
in my early 20s,

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.160 align:middle line:90%
I got my very first credit card.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And I went on a big,
giant spending spree

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.010 align:middle line:84%
and ran up a bill and
got in all kinds of debt.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And the credit card
had 22% interest on it.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.890 align:middle line:90%
I didn't realize it at the time.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.830 align:middle line:90%
And it really ballooned.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And it became a
horrible fear for me

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.620 align:middle line:84%
that I was never ever
going to get out of debt.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.920 align:middle line:84%
And it got so bad this
fear and the depression

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.730 align:middle line:84%
around being in debt that
I couldn't sleep at night.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.870 align:middle line:90%
And it just really ate on me.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, I
was a news reporter.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And I had this belief that
I'm a struggling artist.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm a struggling writer.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm never going to make money.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be in debt forever.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And there was this fellow
who was a financial analyst

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.640 align:middle line:90%
and investor.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And he asked me to write
an article about him

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.140 align:middle line:90%
and what he does.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And so I spent about six
months researching him.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And during this time, I was
in all this horrible debt.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.490 align:middle line:84%
But the title of
the article ended up

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.009 align:middle line:84%
becoming "The Psychology
of Money Prosperity

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.880 align:middle line:90%
and Abundance".

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And what I learned during that
six months from this gentleman

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.320 align:middle line:84%
is that wealth is
really a state of mind

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.960 align:middle line:84%
and that our beliefs
are tied into that

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.260 align:middle line:84%
and that this fear-based
thinking I had about

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.410 align:middle line:84%
never getting out of
debt and the depression

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.770 align:middle line:84%
was actually recursive
that was all feeding into.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.540 align:middle line:84%
So once I switch to that, I
mean literally just like that,

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.260 align:middle line:84%
I completely got out of
debt within about six months

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.760 align:middle line:90%
from writing the article.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.030 align:middle line:84%
>> One fun exercise when you're
trying to figure out what to do

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.350 align:middle line:84%
is to get a big poster board
sheet of paper or a couple

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.800 align:middle line:84%
of them and some colorful,
bright-colored markers.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.630 align:middle line:84%
So in the center of your poster
board what you want to do

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.290 align:middle line:84%
is write out either the
question or just the topic

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.540 align:middle line:84%
of what it is that you're
considering and then circle it.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.930 align:middle line:84%
And then write
everything that comes

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.690 align:middle line:84%
to mind with all
the different colors

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.560 align:middle line:84%
and do it as
quickly as you want.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.560 align:middle line:84%
You can draw little
pictures, whatever it is.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.370 align:middle line:84%
Write as many things that
come to your mind about this.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And then the thing to do is
to step back and just see

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.880 align:middle line:90%
what you've created.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.110 align:middle line:84%
You can pin it up on a
wall for a couple of days.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.520 align:middle line:84%
And what you'll begin to
notice is that certain colors

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.080 align:middle line:90%
start to pop out to you.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.070 align:middle line:84%
You think, oh, wow, I
never even thought of that.

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.710 align:middle line:84%
Or certain things that
you just knew for sure

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.950 align:middle line:84%
you were going to do with
this question or the situation

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.780 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden, maybe
they're not so bold anymore.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And what it does it allows
your subconscious mind

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.130 align:middle line:84%
to start to create new ways of
understanding your situation.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.690 align:middle line:84%
You see, you have all the
information inside of you.

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.750 align:middle line:84%
In your body, you
have everything

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.750 align:middle line:84%
you need to get the best
answer for your life.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And this is another way
that you can discover it.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Another way you can start to
work with your limiting beliefs

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.630 align:middle line:84%
once you begin to discover what
they are is to find some inner

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:13.630 align:middle line:90%
mentors.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.800 align:middle line:84%
The mentors could be
people that believe in you.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:21.750 align:middle line:84%
They could be people who like
your parents or family members.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.100 align:middle line:84%
It could be places
that mean a lot to you.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.900 align:middle line:84%
A place can be a mentor,
like being part of the ocean.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.760 align:middle line:90%
It could be a historical figure.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.350 align:middle line:84%
Gandhi's always been kind of
a historical figure for me.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.400 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, I think,
well, if Gandhi were here,

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.335 align:middle line:90%
what would he say?

00:04:37.335 --> 00:04:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's one thing to ask
that, but it's another thing

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.820 align:middle line:90%
to imagine Gandhi's right here.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.020 align:middle line:84%
Slip into Gandhi, look through
his eyes at you saying that.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.800 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find that you often
get very different information.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's surprising
how you often come up

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.450 align:middle line:84%
with things you'd never come
up with without shifting

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:55.577 align:middle line:90%
that perspective.

00:04:55.577 --> 00:04:57.660 align:middle line:84%
You have to make a sincere
effort to really become

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.800 align:middle line:84%
that other person
with their beliefs,

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.348 align:middle line:90%
values, and understandings.

00:05:01.348 --> 00:05:03.390 align:middle line:84%
Often, you get totally
different information that

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.720 align:middle line:90%
would not have occurred to you.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.280 align:middle line:84%
>> I always believed that
even when I was in high school

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.660 align:middle line:84%
and everything, like I wrote
papers about what would be when

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:13.740 align:middle line:90%
I was successful.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.440 align:middle line:84%
I always said, I'm going to
have a million dollars by 40

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.750 align:middle line:84%
and be able to retire by
50 and all these things.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.570 align:middle line:84%
And pretty much every single
thing I wrote on those papers

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.150 align:middle line:90%
came true over the years.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.900 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know I was
doing affirmations or positive

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.970 align:middle line:90%
thinking or a vision board.

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.780 align:middle line:84%
>> I try to visualize being
in a different feeling state,

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.160 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily what life is
going to be like when I have

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:50.020 align:middle line:84%
a manor house in France or I
spend 10 months of the year

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.820 align:middle line:90%
on the beach.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.740 align:middle line:90%
It's not necessarily about that.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.510 align:middle line:84%
It's about having a
vision of what will it

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.270 align:middle line:84%
be like to feel
calm and centered

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.290 align:middle line:84%
and open and present
with the things that

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.020 align:middle line:90%
are in my life today.

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.270 align:middle line:90%
I don't live in a fancy house.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.450 align:middle line:84%
I live in the same house I
lived in when I was in a job

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:11.230 align:middle line:90%
that I didn't particularly like.

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:12.060 align:middle line:90%
I like my house.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.060 align:middle line:90%
My house is comfortable.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:13.920 align:middle line:90%
It suits me.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:14.720 align:middle line:90%
It feels good.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.850 align:middle line:90%


00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.860 align:middle line:84%
But I have a very
different presence

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.660 align:middle line:90%
that I bring to every day.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.580 align:middle line:84%
For me, I actually tend
to visualize things

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.470 align:middle line:90%
like feeling states.

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:29.790 align:middle line:84%
I imagine a future in which
I'm going to be more calm,

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:33.090 align:middle line:84%
have a better sense of
humor, be more engaged,

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.490 align:middle line:90%
be more present for my family.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.920 align:middle line:84%
That's the
visualization that I do.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.250 align:middle line:84%
That's the future state
that I put myself in.

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's not to say I don't
have some awesome things

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:46.920 align:middle line:90%
that a person might want.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.870 align:middle line:84%
It's not to say I
don't have a cool car.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:50.940 align:middle line:90%
I do have a cool car.

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.130 align:middle line:84%
It's not to say I'm not
going to go on a cool trip.

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:54.900 align:middle line:90%
I do go on cool trips.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.010 align:middle line:84%
But the visualization for me is
not about some shiny lifestyles

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:01.230 align:middle line:90%
of the rich and famous future.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.153 align:middle line:84%
It's about what kind of
person am I going to be?

00:07:04.153 --> 00:07:05.820 align:middle line:84%
What kind of sense
of humor and openness

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:10.570 align:middle line:84%
am I going to bring to my
life and continue to develop?

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.390 align:middle line:90%
That's what I visualize.

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:14.520 align:middle line:90%
And that's what gives me juice.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.130 align:middle line:90%
That's what gives me energy.

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:18.313 align:middle line:84%
>> And, of course, with
any habit shifting,

00:07:18.313 --> 00:07:20.730 align:middle line:84%
there's that plateau where you
don't see the results right

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:21.530 align:middle line:90%
away.

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:24.360 align:middle line:84%
But little by little, you
start to get momentum.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's tough when
you're beating yourself

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.600 align:middle line:90%
up in the process.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.550 align:middle line:90%
You have to be excited.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:30.890 align:middle line:90%
You have to want to do it.

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:33.960 align:middle line:84%
It has to come from a place
of interest and curiosity,

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.145 align:middle line:90%
otherwise, you'll give up.

00:07:35.145 --> 00:07:37.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Any time we're living
according to someone

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.520 align:middle line:84%
else's values, which are
not our highest values,

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.895 align:middle line:84%
we end up going lower, lower
levels of fulfillment, less,

00:07:41.895 --> 00:07:43.490 align:middle line:90%
less meaningfulness.

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:46.372 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of it, we
go into shrinking ourselves

00:07:46.372 --> 00:07:48.330 align:middle line:84%
and end up looking for
immediate gratification.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's where our
addictive behaviors emerge.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:55.140 align:middle line:84%
>> There's four different levels
to the interchange experience.

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And the first level is
where you don't even

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:01.060 align:middle line:84%
know that you don't know
that there's a problem.

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's where you're
sitting around on the couch,

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:07.680 align:middle line:84%
and you're drinking
your 12th beer.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:13.770 align:middle line:84%
And you're watching your
fourth rerun of some show.

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And you don't even know
that there's an issue.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.730 align:middle line:84%
But clearly, from the outside,
if people were to look in,

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:24.000 align:middle line:84%
they would know
there's an issue.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.170 align:middle line:84%
The second level
of interchange is

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:30.810 align:middle line:84%
where you know that
there's something wrong,

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:32.669 align:middle line:90%
but you don't know what it is.

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:35.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's like there's
something there on the surface,

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:37.750 align:middle line:84%
and you're just not feeling
right, and it's bothering you.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:41.669 align:middle line:84%
But you just don't
know what it is.

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's like an itch
that you want to scratch,

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.110 align:middle line:84%
but you don't know
where to scratch.

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And the third level of change
is where the pain really

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.850 align:middle line:84%
begins to kick in
because this is where

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:59.320 align:middle line:84%
you know there's
something wrong,

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.340 align:middle line:84%
and you actually
know what it is.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.920 align:middle line:90%
But you don't know what to do.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is the most painful
place that you can be.

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And typically, anybody that's
on a personal development path,

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:15.990 align:middle line:84%
they're going to find
themselves at this place.

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's where those
dark nights happen.

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And the best way to move
out of that into what I call

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.730 align:middle line:84%
the fourth level of change is
where you create the change,

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:30.270 align:middle line:84%
and you start living
the life that you want.

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:33.930 align:middle line:84%
The best way to turbocharge
out of that third place

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:36.150 align:middle line:84%
is to begin to work
on your inner self

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.630 align:middle line:84%
and to work on your
inner development.

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>> I actually started to see
myself as a child that needed

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.470 align:middle line:90%
healing.

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And I started to step
into that part of me that

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.520 align:middle line:90%
could heal myself.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And I started being very loving
with myself and very gentle.

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:52.950 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I could take
care of myself in a way

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:56.790 align:middle line:84%
that I've never done before
by stepping into that witness

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:58.830 align:middle line:84%
place where I was
observing myself.

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:03.870 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was 22, I was
living with a guy, Kevin,

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:05.290 align:middle line:90%
a friend of mine.

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:06.810 align:middle line:90%
We were both in real estate.

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And I was doing really
well, and he was struggling.

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:15.180 align:middle line:84%
And in September
of 1982, I decided

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:17.405 align:middle line:90%
to go travel around the world.

00:10:17.405 --> 00:10:19.530 align:middle line:84%
So I was going to go for
a year, a year and a half.

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:22.480 align:middle line:84%
I'd made some pretty good
money in real estate.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.660 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'm going
to go see the world.

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:28.680 align:middle line:84%
And I said, hey, I'm
going to give you

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:33.390 align:middle line:84%
an opportunity that if you
want could really transform

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:34.830 align:middle line:90%
your real estate business.

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:37.725 align:middle line:90%
And he's also in his early '20s.

00:10:37.725 --> 00:10:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I have
these cassette

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:44.580 align:middle line:84%
tapes on how to
think properly, how

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.950 align:middle line:84%
to master your emotions
a little bit more,

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:48.960 align:middle line:84%
and how to sell
more real estate.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.450 align:middle line:84%
I said, but I'm going to
charge you $500 for them

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:52.950 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
I paid for them.

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And I've been listening to
them every day for 30 minutes

00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:00.690 align:middle line:84%
to an hour a day like my
mentors taught me to listen to.

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:03.000 align:middle line:90%
And he was like, what? $500?

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:03.930 align:middle line:90%
Are you crazy?

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:07.710 align:middle line:84%
I said, listen, it's helped
me make a lot of money

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:10.800 align:middle line:84%
investing in real estate, as
well as selling real estate.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.920 align:middle line:84%
So if you want them,
I'll sell them to you,

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.750 align:middle line:84%
and I'll buy them back
from you when I come back.

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:19.690 align:middle line:90%
So he gave me $500 back in 1982.

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:22.170 align:middle line:90%
And I gave him my cassettes.

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And he started to
listen to them.

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And by the time I came back,
it was November of 1983,

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:34.140 align:middle line:84%
14 months later, he
had made six figures,

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:36.930 align:middle line:90%
over $100,000 in real estate.

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And when I asked
him, what happened?

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.650 align:middle line:84%
He says, well, I
paid you $500, and I

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:45.510 align:middle line:84%
started listening
to those cassettes

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:48.420 align:middle line:84%
on my way to work and
back home every day

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:50.910 align:middle line:84%
for 30 minutes to
45 minutes a day.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I really
don't know what happened,

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.690 align:middle line:84%
but I started to
think differently.

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:58.350 align:middle line:90%
I started to feel differently.

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And I started selling
more real estate.

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And I remember saying, well,
I want those cassettes back.

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:08.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And when I hit a
barrier on my journey,

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.920 align:middle line:90%
it's always a belief barrier.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:15.480 align:middle line:84%
It's never anything other
than a belief barrier.

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.060 align:middle line:84%
It's never anybody
else's fault. It's

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:21.360 align:middle line:84%
never that I'm a victim
of my circumstances.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:27.690 align:middle line:84%
It's never that there's nothing
I could have done or said

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:30.210 align:middle line:90%
or thought differently.

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:34.260 align:middle line:84%
It's always a function
of how I am in the world

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:38.640 align:middle line:90%
and what I believe to be true.

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.590 align:middle line:90%
And that is what I meet.

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:45.660 align:middle line:84%
I meet my truth, whatever
it is at the time.

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:50.080 align:middle line:84%
It's reflected back
to me in the world.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And if I don't like the truth
that's being reflected back

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:56.130 align:middle line:84%
to me, then the place
to put my effort

00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:58.530 align:middle line:84%
is not to try and
change the world.

00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:02.820 align:middle line:84%
The place to put my effort
is to change what I believe,

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:06.540 align:middle line:84%
and the world that
I see will change.

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:13.680 align:middle line:84%
>> I could recite those audio
cassettes verbatim today from

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:19.500 align:middle line:84%
what I listened to 31
years ago, verbatim.

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:24.720 align:middle line:84%
I could recite every script,
every question, every answer

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.370 align:middle line:90%
because I did it religiously.

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:31.650 align:middle line:84%
I did it as a very,
very serious practice.

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And I was told back
then that repetition

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:36.630 align:middle line:84%
was the mother of
skill, and repetition

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:41.430 align:middle line:84%
was the mother of learning
and that you had to practice

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:43.270 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over again.

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:46.550 align:middle line:84%
One time we were training the
wealthy-minded in Australia.

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:48.127 align:middle line:84%
And when we were
there, we decided

00:13:48.127 --> 00:13:49.710 align:middle line:84%
if we were going to
go that far, we're

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:52.290 align:middle line:84%
going to go to Cairns and
the Great Barrier Reef.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:54.143 align:middle line:90%
And we went and visited that.

00:13:54.143 --> 00:13:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And then, we're going on
to Sydney for the training.

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:59.400 align:middle line:84%
And so we called a taxi
to take us from our hotel

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.870 align:middle line:90%
to the airport.

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:02.820 align:middle line:90%
And this fellow picks us up.

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And he's driving a
little bit, and he said,

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:08.700 align:middle line:84%
I can tell that you're from
America by your accent.

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:10.140 align:middle line:90%
And he said, you're so lucky.

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:13.020 align:middle line:84%
He said, you can never get
ahead in the Australian economy.

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.658 align:middle line:90%
It's utterly impossible.

00:14:14.658 --> 00:14:16.200 align:middle line:84%
He went on to tell
us how horrible it

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.262 align:middle line:90%
was and impossible it was.

00:14:18.262 --> 00:14:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And he said, so
what have you done?

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.977 align:middle line:84%
And we said, well, we went
to the Great Barrier Reef,

00:14:21.977 --> 00:14:23.560 align:middle line:84%
and we went up to
this wonderful beach

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.590 align:middle line:90%
place called Port Douglas.

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:27.302 align:middle line:90%
And he said Port Douglas?

00:14:27.302 --> 00:14:28.510 align:middle line:90%
I'd never go to Port Douglas.

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:29.620 align:middle line:90%
That's for rich people.

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And he went on and on about how
impossible it was in Australia

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:34.420 align:middle line:90%
to ever get ahead.

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:38.500 align:middle line:84%
So we got to the airport,
got on an airplane,

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.210 align:middle line:84%
flew to Sydney
where we were going

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:43.990 align:middle line:84%
to be driven to our hotel,
and a taxi driver drives up.

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And he jumps out,
and he goes, hello.

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And he says, where
are you going?

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:49.240 align:middle line:90%
And we said The Gazebo Hotel.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.970 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
I'll tell you what.

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:54.970 align:middle line:84%
I can drive you a couple of
streets off of how I normally

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:57.370 align:middle line:84%
go, and I'll show you a
great view of Sydney Harbor

00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:59.177 align:middle line:90%
that you'll never see otherwise.

00:14:59.177 --> 00:15:00.010 align:middle line:90%
Would you like that?

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:01.593 align:middle line:84%
He said, I won't
even charge you more.

00:15:01.593 --> 00:15:04.290 align:middle line:84%
We said, well, sure,
that'd be great.

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:05.410 align:middle line:90%
He's talking to us.

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:07.570 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, I'm
going to miss this job.

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:09.140 align:middle line:90%
And we said, miss this job?

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:09.940 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:12.285 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, he said, my
wife and I are retiring.

00:15:12.285 --> 00:15:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And we said, oh, well, so
what are you going to do?

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:15.800 align:middle line:84%
He said, we're
retiring up north.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.530 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, north,
what's up there?

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:18.652 align:middle line:90%
Brisbane, Gold Coast.

00:15:18.652 --> 00:15:20.110 align:middle line:84%
I said, is that
where you're going?

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh no, we're
going much further north.

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:27.010 align:middle line:90%
We're retiring in Port Douglas.

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:30.130 align:middle line:84%
And it was a story that's
always really stuck with me

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:34.180 align:middle line:84%
because it's the same
economy, the same job, and one

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:37.390 align:middle line:84%
person had a belief system
that enabled him to create

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:40.030 align:middle line:84%
the life he wanted, and the
other one was stuck in his rut.

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:43.360 align:middle line:84%
>> It wasn't something
that I was born with.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.540 align:middle line:90%
It was a skill that I learned.

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And as I've studied other people
in every area of their life--

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.950 align:middle line:84%
health, wealth, relationships,
career, business,

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:55.960 align:middle line:90%
spiritual growth--

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:59.410 align:middle line:84%
everybody goes through the ebb
and flow of life-- everybody.

00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:02.980 align:middle line:84%
There's no human being
that's impervious to it.

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:05.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't care if
you're a monk that

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:09.400 align:middle line:84%
is meditating for eight
hours a day in Dharamshala.

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.130 align:middle line:84%
You go through highs
and lows, ups and downs.

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:15.820 align:middle line:84%
And there are moments that
thoughts bring you down.

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And you can develop the
skill of observation.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:23.350 align:middle line:84%
You can develop the
skill of nonjudgment.

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:26.440 align:middle line:84%
You can develop the
skill of awareness.

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:31.660 align:middle line:84%
You can develop the skill of
allowing things to happen.

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:35.710 align:middle line:84%
>> I went through a process
of actively and consciously

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:37.720 align:middle line:90%
reprogramming my beliefs.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:42.310 align:middle line:84%
I used very specific steps that
I had learned and developed

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:44.830 align:middle line:84%
through my process to
reprogram my beliefs.

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:49.600 align:middle line:84%
I saw my beliefs as either
an asset or a liability.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.340 align:middle line:84%
I didn't care if they
were real or not.

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:53.560 align:middle line:84%
I just cared if they were
an asset or a liability.

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:56.650 align:middle line:84%
I just saw that the ones that
would benefit me were assets.

00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:58.058 align:middle line:90%
And I instilled them.

00:16:58.058 --> 00:17:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And the ones that were
liabilities, I got rid of.

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And I did that process
on a daily basis

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:05.770 align:middle line:84%
through affirmations
and visualizations

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:07.420 align:middle line:90%
and mental training.

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:11.200 align:middle line:84%
I absolutely recreated my
belief system, step-by-step,

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.560 align:middle line:84%
brick-by-brick, no
question about it.

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:17.204 align:middle line:84%
>> The good news is the
brain can change at any time.

00:17:17.204 --> 00:17:18.579 align:middle line:84%
So if you jump
out of that groove

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:21.819 align:middle line:84%
and if you challenge those
old beliefs, old patterns,

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:24.400 align:middle line:84%
old environments, and you
get into new environments,

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.700 align:middle line:90%
you can change.

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:30.239 align:middle line:84%
So the past is an advisor,
not a determinant.

00:17:30.239 --> 00:17:37.366 align:middle line:90%
