00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.100 align:middle line:84%
>> So the current system that's
in place around the world is

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.800 align:middle line:90%
about competition, separation.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.990 align:middle line:84%
But it could be
about cooperation,

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.510 align:middle line:84%
but we have to elevate the
consciousness of the species.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.780 align:middle line:84%
>> We have two ways
to approach life.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.560 align:middle line:84%
One is competitively,
and one is cooperatively.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.229 align:middle line:90%
And they're mutually exclusive.

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:35.070 align:middle line:84%
You're either competing,
or you're cooperating.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And we have been sold
the idea that competition

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.220 align:middle line:84%
is how you succeed, it's
how you get to the top.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.380 align:middle line:84%
You have to climb over everybody
else's bodies to get there.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.350 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that a lot of times
when I would do business deals

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.530 align:middle line:84%
or business ventures, there's
always this feeling like this

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.278 align:middle line:84%
person's probably going
to try to screw me.

00:00:56.278 --> 00:00:57.820 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I'm going to
try to screw them.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.362 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, but
I know that there's

00:00:59.362 --> 00:01:01.240 align:middle line:90%
a limited amount of resources.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And I've got to take that where
they're going to take that,

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.590 align:middle line:84%
and I've got to be a little bit
smarter maybe, a little more

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.050 align:middle line:90%
clever to protect my side of it.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.770 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the ways that I coped
with that system was to compete

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.300 align:middle line:84%
for awhile, compete for
whatever resources there were

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:25.900 align:middle line:84%
for whatever the measurements
were at the time to just

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:32.090 align:middle line:84%
compete and somehow feel better
than because when I was winning

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.620 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.770 align:middle line:84%
>> If somebody else was
successful, I was jealous.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.900 align:middle line:84%
If I was successful,
they were jealous.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.800 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.570 align:middle line:84%
That was definitely
a way of life.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.090 align:middle line:84%
>> You've got to be
very cautious of letting

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.323 align:middle line:90%
your material things own you.

00:01:45.323 --> 00:01:46.240 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I see.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.610 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people let their
possessions own them,

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.860 align:middle line:84%
and they lose themselves
in their possessions.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.940 align:middle line:90%
And that's not prosperity.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.810 align:middle line:84%
>> So every thought that you
have is motivated by fear,

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.070 align:middle line:84%
which means it's going to
be greed, jealousy, envy,

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.750 align:middle line:90%
all of these different things--

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.380 align:middle line:84%
selfishness-- because you're
coming from that survival

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.180 align:middle line:90%
brain.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.220 align:middle line:84%
You're coming from a brain
that's saying, it's me or them.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.840 align:middle line:90%
And I got to work harder.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.990 align:middle line:90%
I got to do this.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And I got to take from
them in order to survive.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.110 align:middle line:84%
>> I got as caught up as anybody
in trying to win the game,

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.560 align:middle line:84%
trying to play the hierarchy,
getting obsessed with things

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.170 align:middle line:84%
like when am I going
to make director,

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.460 align:middle line:84%
and then when am I going to get
the good office with the good

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.015 align:middle line:90%
window.

00:02:33.015 --> 00:02:35.380 align:middle line:84%
It's a very natural
game to play.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.440 align:middle line:90%
We all get caught up in that.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.170 align:middle line:84%
For me, the game of
playing the corporate game

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.340 align:middle line:84%
was all about fixing all
the ways I was broken.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.960 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not a good
enough negotiator.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go
study negotiation.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.753 align:middle line:90%
I don't have an MBA.

00:02:51.753 --> 00:02:53.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't have a
piece of paper that

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.360 align:middle line:84%
says I'm more qualified
than the person.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.400 align:middle line:90%
I know I'm more qualified then.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.190 align:middle line:90%
So do I go out and get the MBA?

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.970 align:middle line:84%
>> And then we might try,
well, if it's not going to work

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.870 align:middle line:84%
for me as a worker, then
maybe I'll be an owner.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.880 align:middle line:90%
And maybe that'll work for me.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.940 align:middle line:84%
But if we're still in
the paradigm of scarcity,

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.010 align:middle line:84%
then being an owner
doesn't really work either.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.530 align:middle line:84%
It's just another
kind of prison.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.350 align:middle line:84%
It's another kind of place
where we do long hours,

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.970 align:middle line:84%
and we sacrifice our health,
and we sacrifice our family

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.090 align:middle line:84%
because we don't really
believe in abundance.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.265 align:middle line:84%
We're still believing
in scarcity.

00:03:33.265 --> 00:03:36.190 align:middle line:90%


00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.890 align:middle line:84%
So people can
spend a lot of time

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.700 align:middle line:84%
in that little vortex where
they haven't really challenged

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.610 align:middle line:90%
the core belief in scarcity.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Awareness is the first
thing that we have to do.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.310 align:middle line:84%
You have to be aware
that you are in a system

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.053 align:middle line:84%
and be able to step
back from that.

00:03:53.053 --> 00:03:54.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Because when you
compete with other people,

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.010 align:middle line:84%
someone's got to
lose and someone--

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.650 align:middle line:84%
in order for someone to
win, someone has to lose.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.490 align:middle line:84%
When I compete with myself, it's
a very different experience.

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:09.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm now just trying to be my
best self in a very different

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.160 align:middle line:90%
way than I was then.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.070 align:middle line:84%
>> I prefer to think that
there's more than enough

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.140 align:middle line:90%
of everything for everybody.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.230 align:middle line:90%
And I live my life that way.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And I live my life playing
at a plane of not competing

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.910 align:middle line:90%
but of cooperation.

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.460 align:middle line:84%
>> We could end
disease, poverty,

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.920 align:middle line:90%
and hunger today as a species.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.240 align:middle line:90%
There's plenty.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.540 align:middle line:84%
But because of separation,
because of lack,

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.700 align:middle line:84%
we are creating pain
all over the world.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.770 align:middle line:84%
>> When you talk to
people about money,

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.890 align:middle line:84%
why they strive for money,
why they want money,

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.340 align:middle line:84%
and you get down to the-- you
start asking the why question,

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.155 align:middle line:90%
you get down to the core of why.

00:04:53.155 --> 00:04:55.900 align:middle line:84%
Why is never, never,
never about money.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.010 align:middle line:90%
Why is about happiness.

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.540 align:middle line:84%
Why is about because I want
my family to be taken care of.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.190 align:middle line:90%
I want to be connected.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.410 align:middle line:84%
I want-- it's a whole
different thing when

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.450 align:middle line:90%
you get beneath what it is.

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:08.680 align:middle line:90%
Money is a symbol.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Given the belief systems
of our family systems,

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.550 align:middle line:84%
our culture, the part of even
the country we grew up in lead

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.000 align:middle line:84%
us to believe there's
a pathway to success,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.590 align:middle line:90%
to being a good person.

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.390 align:middle line:84%
And often these are
other people's ideas

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.113 align:middle line:84%
and aren't about what you
think you want for you.

00:05:25.113 --> 00:05:27.280 align:middle line:84%
And so the most important
thing I think you could do

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.100 align:middle line:84%
is step back and say,
what's my heart's desire?

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.896 align:middle line:90%
What do I really want in life?

00:05:31.896 --> 00:05:34.840 align:middle line:90%
Not what is somebody else's--

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.635 align:middle line:84%
what is somebody else's
definition of success?

00:05:37.635 --> 00:05:41.420 align:middle line:84%
Success is, I think, what
really feeds your spirit

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.320 align:middle line:84%
and makes you feel
good about your life,

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.548 align:middle line:84%
makes you want to get up
every morning and go for it.

00:05:46.548 --> 00:05:49.090 align:middle line:84%
>> It is so important to be able
to find out what you really,

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.218 align:middle line:84%
really, really are inspired
and love to do in your career,

00:05:52.218 --> 00:05:54.010 align:middle line:84%
so you're not doing it
because you have to.

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.900 align:middle line:84%
You're doing it
because you love to.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.370 align:middle line:84%
That's when you're
most creative.

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.170 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a great
expression that,

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.840 align:middle line:84%
you can never get enough of what
you didn't need in the first

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.220 align:middle line:90%
place.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And when we put our enoughness
from within and say,

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.900 align:middle line:84%
I am enough as I
am, then you can

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.510 align:middle line:84%
quit chasing all that
nonsense because you can chase

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.700 align:middle line:90%
nonsense the rest of your life.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.372 align:middle line:84%
You can chase nonsense forever,
and you will never get there.

00:06:19.372 --> 00:06:20.830 align:middle line:84%
The house will
never be big enough.

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.595 align:middle line:84%
The car will never
be swanky enough.

00:06:23.595 --> 00:06:25.720 align:middle line:84%
You're never going to be
thin enough, young enough,

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.620 align:middle line:90%
whatever it might be.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.970 align:middle line:84%
You have to find that
abundance within who you are.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:37.400 align:middle line:84%
>> So I think that there's four
levels that we can be living

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.200 align:middle line:90%
in.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.770 align:middle line:84%
One is a scarcity
mentality where

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:46.990 align:middle line:84%
we think that there isn't enough
for us or for anybody else.

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.560 align:middle line:90%
The other is a security mindset.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And security is that
there's just enough for me

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.690 align:middle line:90%
to be secure.

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:57.970 align:middle line:84%
The other is a
success mindset, which

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.810 align:middle line:84%
is that there's enough for me,
and there's more than enough

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:02.980 align:middle line:90%
for me.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a
significance mindset.

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And the significant mindset is
that there's more than enough

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.840 align:middle line:90%
for me and everybody else.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:14.890 align:middle line:84%
>> For me I spent so much of
my time running from myself,

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.950 align:middle line:84%
running from my fears,
running from my anxieties,

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:22.030 align:middle line:84%
trying to dampen them down,
trying to strive to be better,

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:27.310 align:middle line:84%
to be more, to be
worthy, to be deserving.

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.560 align:middle line:84%
All that striving was
about me not feeling

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.130 align:middle line:84%
like I was good enough,
not feeling like I was OK,

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:38.060 align:middle line:84%
and being afraid of
that, being afraid of not

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:38.860 align:middle line:90%
being good enough.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:44.100 align:middle line:90%


00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And now I see that there was
so much abundance in my life,

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:52.810 align:middle line:84%
always, no matter what my
financial circumstances were.

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:54.600 align:middle line:84%
But I couldn't see
it because I was

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:58.070 align:middle line:90%
too busy running from myself.

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:02.870 align:middle line:84%
And now I see that
through abundance from me

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:05.870 align:middle line:84%
resides in when I'm
present to my life, when

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:07.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm present to what
I have, when I'm

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:12.140 align:middle line:84%
present to all of
the good things,

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:15.000 align:middle line:84%
and appreciating all the good
things and conscious of them

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.250 align:middle line:84%
and grateful for
them, noticing them.

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't possible
for me to do that

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:27.110 align:middle line:84%
when I was always
running from myself.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:33.049 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't be here when I
was running from who I was.

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:36.919 align:middle line:84%
>> And the biggest surprise
that's come for me from all

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:41.059 align:middle line:84%
of the belief change work I've
done and also all of the act

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:45.230 align:middle line:84%
of wealth consciousness work
I've done is my relationship

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:50.700 align:middle line:84%
with myself because when I was
younger, I didn't like myself.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't really like
who I was in the world.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.960 align:middle line:84%
And what's happened
is I've really

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.350 align:middle line:84%
developed a good
relationship with myself.

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's allowed me to
have more love in my life.

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And my relationships with
my friends and family

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.270 align:middle line:90%
are really good.

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And every night
when I go to bed,

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:14.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm always so grateful that all
of the relationships in my life

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.150 align:middle line:90%
are harmonious.

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And that has come out of
all the work that I've done.

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's a really
nice surprise.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
about this work

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:28.250 align:middle line:84%
is that when you start
working on your beliefs

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:31.220 align:middle line:84%
about money and
wealth, everything

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:35.690 align:middle line:84%
will change for you because
money is a metaphor for who

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:37.440 align:middle line:90%
you are in the world.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:41.060 align:middle line:84%
>> It's great to have
gratitude and appreciation.

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:45.170 align:middle line:84%
But remember to also have
compassion for yourself.

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:47.960 align:middle line:84%
Every single day, you're
doing the best you can.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.820 align:middle line:90%
We're all doing the best we can.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.570 align:middle line:84%
>> One way you can begin
to break through this kind

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:57.800 align:middle line:84%
of scarcity mindset is to create
an abundant mindset, which is,

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:01.720 align:middle line:84%
in many ways, creating a state
of gratitude for what you have.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.070 align:middle line:84%
If you can truly appreciate
things, appreciate life,

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:06.860 align:middle line:84%
appreciate your possessions,
appreciate your skills,

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:11.180 align:middle line:84%
appreciate yourself,
appreciate the people with you,

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.100 align:middle line:90%
that's a wealthy mindset.

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And what's funny and
interesting about that

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.910 align:middle line:84%
in all of our
travels, when people

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:19.430 align:middle line:84%
adopt that way of thinking,
then the material things

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:21.230 align:middle line:90%
come anyway.

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:22.670 align:middle line:90%
And then they're not important.

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:26.680 align:middle line:84%
>> One of my mentors said
when you want what you have,

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.840 align:middle line:90%
you will have what you want.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:30.830 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:34.160 align:middle line:84%
So now I look around my
day and not what do I want,

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.850 align:middle line:90%
but what do I already have?

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:38.360 align:middle line:90%
And make it I want that.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.340 align:middle line:90%
Turn it into I want that.

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:43.790 align:middle line:90%
I want the house I'm living in.

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:46.430 align:middle line:90%
I want the body I have.

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:48.500 align:middle line:84%
I want the
relationship I already

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:52.640 align:middle line:84%
have with all the
imperfections already in there.

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:58.710 align:middle line:84%
That releases this profound
abundance activation energy

00:10:58.710 --> 00:10:59.510 align:middle line:90%
in self.

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:02.860 align:middle line:90%
