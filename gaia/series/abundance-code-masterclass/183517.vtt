00:00:11.592 --> 00:00:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>> We've had the good fortune
in our work of getting to teach,

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.210 align:middle line:84%
and train, and travel all over
the world and teaching about

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.280 align:middle line:90%
wealth, and money, and beliefs.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And the very most common belief
that we have found in our world

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:31.730 align:middle line:90%
travels--

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.147 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't
matter what culture

00:00:33.147 --> 00:00:37.460 align:middle line:84%
it is, whether it's Russia, or
Greece, or Japan, or Europe,

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.870 align:middle line:90%
or the US.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.450 align:middle line:84%
The most common
belief is you have

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.390 align:middle line:90%
to work hard to make money.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is that
that's just a belief.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.830 align:middle line:90%
It's not true.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>> A scarcity mindset tends to
be self-perpetuating when we do

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.660 align:middle line:90%
get into the fear mode.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.800 align:middle line:84%
And to step away from that
is literally a leap of faith.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.700 align:middle line:84%
It requires that we
first look at ourselves.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And most people aren't
taught to do that.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Another common belief
that people seem to have,

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.960 align:middle line:84%
at least that I've run across in
my private work that I do with

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.270 align:middle line:90%
people-- my private coaching--

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.110 align:middle line:84%
is that you need a college
degree to get ahead.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And so I've worked with
several people over the years

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.590 align:middle line:84%
where they had a belief
that because they didn't

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.390 align:middle line:84%
have a college degree,
they could never

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.950 align:middle line:90%
create what they want.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.800 align:middle line:84%
They could never
have what they want.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And years ago, I worked with a
woman who had that very belief.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.820 align:middle line:90%
And so we changed the belief--

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.480 align:middle line:84%
or she changed the belief to,
I can create whatever I want.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And it comes quickly
and easily to me.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And a couple of months
later, after she

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.000 align:middle line:84%
had changed that
belief, she contacted

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.460 align:middle line:84%
me to tell me that all of
her dreams were coming true,

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.635 align:middle line:84%
that she'd actually
bought a house.

00:01:57.635 --> 00:01:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And her dream was
to have a house

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.450 align:middle line:84%
and to turn that into
a training center.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.030 align:middle line:84%
And so her basement was big
enough that she could do that.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And the basement
opened up to a lake.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And it just seemed like
everything was working for her

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.910 align:middle line:90%
after she changed that belief.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And she reported back that it
made such a huge difference

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.840 align:middle line:90%
to let go of that.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.330 align:middle line:90%
And so they're just beliefs.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.560 align:middle line:90%
And they're really powerful.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.665 align:middle line:84%
And once you begin to change
them, you can create anything.

00:02:27.665 --> 00:02:30.860 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that a lot
of my schoolmates said when I

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.842 align:middle line:84%
went to Scotland for
school is they said.

00:02:32.842 --> 00:02:34.550 align:middle line:84%
yeah, you got to watch
out for the sheep.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.098 align:middle line:90%
They're constantly surprised.

00:02:36.098 --> 00:02:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what do
you mean by that?

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.380 align:middle line:84%
He says, they have
such bad memories,

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.860 align:middle line:90%
that everyday they're surprised.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:41.660 align:middle line:90%
They'll be there.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.410 align:middle line:90%
And they'll see the sun.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And they go, oh,
there's the sun.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.330 align:middle line:90%
And then the sun will disappear.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.530 align:middle line:84%
And they'll go, oh,
the sun is gone.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And the next morning, they've
forgotten about the sun.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.853 align:middle line:84%
They didn't even
know the sun existed.

00:02:48.853 --> 00:02:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, this big,
fiery ball comes out.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:51.710 align:middle line:90%
They go, oh, my gosh.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:52.683 align:middle line:90%
What is that thing?

00:02:52.683 --> 00:02:53.600 align:middle line:90%
And they're like, wow.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And they were looking
at this thing.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:55.580 align:middle line:90%
This is incredible.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.570 align:middle line:84%
Then they kind of
forget about it.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:57.080 align:middle line:90%
And it goes.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And this keeps on
happening every day.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.340 align:middle line:84%
They just constantly
surprise themselves.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing how much
we as humans every day

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.010 align:middle line:84%
constantly surprise
ourselves that we're still

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.552 align:middle line:84%
in the same situation we were
in yesterday, without realizing

00:03:06.552 --> 00:03:08.878 align:middle line:84%
at any moment we can just
say this isn't necessary.

00:03:08.878 --> 00:03:10.670 align:middle line:84%
We can actually be a
very different person.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.310 align:middle line:84%
>> What we really found is when
we explored the beliefs that

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.400 align:middle line:84%
people had that held them
back or kept them from being

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.140 align:middle line:84%
successful, they're all about
beliefs about themselves

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.390 align:middle line:90%
and what they were capable of.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:21.432 align:middle line:90%
And that's where it's at.

00:03:21.432 --> 00:03:27.540 align:middle line:84%
>> The quest, the question,
is this all there is?

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.340 align:middle line:90%
Isn't there more?

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.450 align:middle line:90%
Isn't there a better way?

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:35.120 align:middle line:84%
That's what propels
us forward to continue

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.075 align:middle line:90%
to seek the state of abundance.

00:03:38.075 --> 00:03:41.470 align:middle line:84%
>> But I'd say the majority
of people never make the first

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.860 align:middle line:84%
step, that they are
stuck in the same way--

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.620 align:middle line:90%
do the same thing over and over.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.110 align:middle line:84%
Like they say, the
definition of insanity

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:52.730 align:middle line:84%
is doing the same
thing over and over

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.110 align:middle line:84%
and expecting a
different result.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.900 align:middle line:90%
And people do that all the time.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.967 align:middle line:84%
And they don't even
realize it or realize

00:03:58.967 --> 00:04:00.800 align:middle line:84%
that it could be any
different, because they

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.880 align:middle line:90%
don't know any different.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>> The other thing is once you
have a belief system in place,

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:07.705 align:middle line:90%
you're in it.

00:04:07.705 --> 00:04:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And you can't really
change it until you

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.455 align:middle line:84%
get some distance from it and
take a look at what it is.

00:04:12.455 --> 00:04:14.330 align:middle line:84%
Like in our trainings,
we spend a lot of time

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.120 align:middle line:84%
helping people become conscious
of their limiting beliefs.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.269 align:middle line:84%
And really, you can learn
a lot about yourself

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.400 align:middle line:84%
if you really take a
half day and explore

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.360 align:middle line:84%
your personal history and
what your belief structure is,

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.970 align:middle line:84%
what your parents believed
and start saying, well,

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.165 align:middle line:90%
how does that impact me now?

00:04:30.165 --> 00:04:32.540 align:middle line:84%
So it's like stepping back
from it, getting a sense of it

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:33.340 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.460 align:middle line:84%
If you don't do that, if you
don't take that opportunity

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.515 align:middle line:84%
to take a look at
your thinking to go--

00:04:39.515 --> 00:04:41.420 align:middle line:84%
in other words, to go
beyond your thinking,

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.760 align:middle line:84%
look back at it, you could
be stuck in it forever,

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.060 align:middle line:84%
because it's just that
reality that you're in.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.650 align:middle line:84%
>> For me, it was really
helpful when I went to Japan,

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:57.320 align:middle line:84%
only because I removed
myself from my conditioning.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.170 align:middle line:84%
I went to a completely
different culture

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.890 align:middle line:90%
and lived there for five years.

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.200 align:middle line:84%
I was able to get some serious
distance between myself

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.946 align:middle line:84%
and the conditioning I had
taken on in my childhood.

00:05:10.946 --> 00:05:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And many of the
things that I saw

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.660 align:middle line:84%
as beliefs that were
held by people in Japan

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.140 align:middle line:84%
in the Japanese culture were
very different to the beliefs

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.650 align:middle line:84%
that I had taken
on in my childhood.

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:30.630 align:middle line:84%
Neither one of those sets of
beliefs are necessarily true.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.790 align:middle line:84%
But I was at least
able to see clearly

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.910 align:middle line:84%
that different cultures,
different people have

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.050 align:middle line:90%
very different beliefs.

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.541 align:middle line:84%
And different beliefs can lead
to very different outcomes.

00:05:41.541 --> 00:05:46.830 align:middle line:84%
That helped me to see that
I needed to choose carefully

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:52.500 align:middle line:84%
what I believed if I wanted
to influence my outcome.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.250 align:middle line:84%
If I wanted to get the
same thing I'd always got,

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.080 align:middle line:84%
then I didn't need
to do anything

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.790 align:middle line:90%
with respect to my beliefs.

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:01.690 align:middle line:84%
But if I wanted a
different outcome,

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.615 align:middle line:84%
then I needed to
change what I believed.

00:06:03.615 --> 00:06:07.290 align:middle line:84%
>> There's been a lot of
research done with lottery

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.240 align:middle line:84%
winners, people who win the
lottery or where they come

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.060 align:middle line:90%
into a lot of money.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And then within a
couple of years,

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.620 align:middle line:90%
they're completely bankrupt.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's like their inner
world doesn't match what's

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.410 align:middle line:90%
happened on the outer world.

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And who they are as a
person at the identity

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:30.150 align:middle line:84%
level and their self-worth can't
sustain that level of wealth.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:35.010 align:middle line:84%
And so they unconsciously
sabotage that experience

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:36.120 align:middle line:90%
of winning the money.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And they eventually
become bankrupt.

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really
important to make sure

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:44.490 align:middle line:84%
that there's a true
alignment between who

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.760 align:middle line:84%
you are as a person at
the level of identity

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.250 align:middle line:84%
and also, your beliefs
about money and wealth.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.690 align:middle line:84%
Because another scenario
that really often happens to

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:58.110 align:middle line:84%
people is that they'll begin
to make a lot of money.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:01.530 align:middle line:90%
And then sabotage will kick in.

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And they'll do something that
will sabotage their success.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And that sabotage is directly
related to their beliefs

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.830 align:middle line:90%
about who they are in the world.

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:15.270 align:middle line:84%
>> It wasn't until I saw that
the belief was driving that

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:20.400 align:middle line:84%
cycle and went inwards
and changed the belief,

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.570 align:middle line:84%
over-wrote the belief to be one
that didn't need to have this

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:29.690 align:middle line:90%
constant cycle of gain and loss.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:34.210 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't until I did that,
that the cycle stopped.

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to
grow my wealth,

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:39.970 align:middle line:84%
and continue to grow
my wealth, and not

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:43.660 align:middle line:84%
have to experience growth
and loss, growth and loss,

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.275 align:middle line:90%
and not really get anywhere.

00:07:45.275 --> 00:07:47.608 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was a little kid,
I remember I had this little

00:07:47.608 --> 00:07:48.408 align:middle line:90%
bank.

00:07:48.408 --> 00:07:49.460 align:middle line:90%
It was a car.

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.040 align:middle line:90%
And I put my little coins in it.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.270 align:middle line:90%
And one day, I decided--

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.910 align:middle line:84%
I was four years old, and opened
it up, and get my money out.

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And I took the
money out and went

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.630 align:middle line:84%
to a store that was four
or five streets away

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:00.970 align:middle line:84%
and came back and probably
had candy all over me.

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And my mother said,
where'd you get that?

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.305 align:middle line:84%
And she said, did
you get in your bank?

00:08:04.305 --> 00:08:06.210 align:middle line:90%
And I said no.

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:07.635 align:middle line:90%
But she knew I did.

00:08:07.635 --> 00:08:08.510 align:middle line:90%
And I got in trouble.

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I made
up a belief about that,

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.760 align:middle line:84%
that I thought, well,
money is for other people.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.468 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was mine,
but it's not mine.

00:08:14.468 --> 00:08:17.650 align:middle line:84%
So I went through
life thinking--

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:19.060 align:middle line:84%
not considering
things that would

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.170 align:middle line:84%
have to do with money,
or abundance, or wealth,

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:23.200 align:middle line:84%
but trying to make it
up in some other way,

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.720 align:middle line:84%
like getting more education,
or being more of service,

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.300 align:middle line:90%
or finding some other path.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And later I realized-- and
when we started working

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:32.460 align:middle line:90%
with beliefs, I changed that.

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:33.940 align:middle line:90%
And I asked my mom about it.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.159 align:middle line:84%
And I said, were you angry
that I broke in the bank?

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:37.539 align:middle line:90%
And she said, oh, no.

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:40.000 align:middle line:84%
She said, I was angry that
you crossed three big streets

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.405 align:middle line:90%
without permission.

00:08:41.405 --> 00:08:43.467 align:middle line:84%
That you were--
it was dangerous.

00:08:43.467 --> 00:08:45.550 align:middle line:84%
So what I read as anger--
and it wasn't my money--

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:47.367 align:middle line:90%
was really fear.

00:08:47.367 --> 00:08:48.700 align:middle line:90%
You could have gotten hurt here.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:52.210 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's very important
to notice the things that you

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:57.340 align:middle line:84%
need to work on and to pay
attention to those things.

00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:01.090 align:middle line:84%
So if you notice that you
have a problem asking for help

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:05.500 align:middle line:84%
or if you notice that you
have a problem in any aspect

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.470 align:middle line:84%
of your life or your
business, that once

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:10.480 align:middle line:84%
you start noticing
that pattern, you're

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:14.600 align:middle line:84%
going to start seeing it
repeated over and over again.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And just paying attention
to and naming the problem

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:21.645 align:middle line:84%
can help you just
as much as anything.

00:09:21.645 --> 00:09:24.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Would you drive
your children crazy?

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:28.148 align:middle line:84%
Would you drive your
children into doing

00:09:28.148 --> 00:09:30.190 align:middle line:84%
things that are going to
break their bodies down,

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:35.290 align:middle line:84%
their health down, their
sense of peace down?

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:36.790 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't do that
to our children,

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:41.220 align:middle line:90%
but we do it to ourselves.

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:45.430 align:middle line:84%
We do it to ourselves,
because we're

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:49.600 align:middle line:84%
thinking one day in the
future, I'll be free

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.460 align:middle line:90%
when I've done X, Y, and Z.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Once you start getting an
idea of what your limiting

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.680 align:middle line:84%
belief is, if you step back
and watch yourself and listen

00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:00.640 align:middle line:84%
to yourself as though you're
at a distance saying it,

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.080 align:middle line:84%
often you get a whole
new perspective on it.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And if you were to give
that self over there that's

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:10.076 align:middle line:84%
making that statement some
advice, would you do it?

00:10:10.076 --> 00:10:12.010 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that
I think could be

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:14.440 align:middle line:84%
helpful is to say, well,
if this belief is true,

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.082 align:middle line:84%
the belief I'm holding to be
true, would I teach kids this?

00:10:17.082 --> 00:10:18.790 align:middle line:84%
Would I go down to
the elementary school,

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:21.190 align:middle line:84%
gather up all the six-year-olds
and say, OK, kids,

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:22.900 align:middle line:90%
you'll never have what you like.

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:26.530 align:middle line:84%
You'll never have what you want
because you don't deserve it.

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:28.190 align:middle line:90%
We would never do that.

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:30.370 align:middle line:84%
But that often can
convince some part of us

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:32.820 align:middle line:84%
that this limiting belief
isn't worth holding any longer.

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:37.130 align:middle line:84%
>> People question their
deservingness a lot.

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:37.930 align:middle line:90%
I know I did.

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:40.770 align:middle line:90%


00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think people think that
extraordinary abundance only

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.756 align:middle line:90%
comes to extraordinary people.

00:10:45.756 --> 00:10:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And probably nobody feels
like they're extraordinary,

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:54.420 align:middle line:84%
unless they're some
kind of megalomaniac.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.650 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:59.060 align:middle line:84%
But most people feel
like they're just

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.400 align:middle line:90%
an ordinary, normal person.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.355 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm just an
ordinary, normal person.

00:11:04.355 --> 00:11:08.660 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the first thing is to
recognize that anything you are

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.450 align:middle line:84%
struggling with is something
that somebody else is

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:13.100 align:middle line:90%
struggling with.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you
see that, you can

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.150 align:middle line:84%
start to think
about how you might

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:21.830 align:middle line:84%
help other people with
this thing you struggle

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:27.200 align:middle line:84%
with, whether it's your
confidence or an external thing

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:31.150 align:middle line:90%
like your studies or health.

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:33.000 align:middle line:84%
If you're struggling
with something,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.790 align:middle line:84%
if you can open up to see
all the other people who

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:39.150 align:middle line:84%
are having this
difficulty, you will

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:43.350 align:middle line:84%
start to see a way that
you can help others.

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that,
you will get out

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:50.070 align:middle line:84%
of this narrow,
uncomfortable, tight space

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:51.270 align:middle line:90%
that you're in right now.

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:53.520 align:middle line:84%
>> When you start to
make that shift mentally,

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.040 align:middle line:90%
that's when huge things occur.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.110 align:middle line:84%
So make sure you're working
on yourself every day

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:00.417 align:middle line:84%
to get that mental
shift going, so you

00:12:00.417 --> 00:12:03.000 align:middle line:84%
get a little bit more positive
and a little bit more negative.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.966 align:middle line:90%
And you'll see massive changes.

00:12:04.966 --> 00:12:10.020 align:middle line:84%
>> The good news is what's
more challenging than changing

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.000 align:middle line:90%
the belief is identifying it.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.480 align:middle line:84%
Once you can identify it,
it's pretty easy to change.

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.960 align:middle line:84%
>> So I think a big
part for me, at least,

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.930 align:middle line:84%
of the shift to abundance,
to a feeling of abundance,

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:25.680 align:middle line:84%
to an abundance mindset is when
you can really start to see

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:26.820 align:middle line:90%
the--

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:28.770 align:middle line:84%
when you can look
in any situation

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:31.080 align:middle line:90%
and see multiple possibilities.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.740 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you're faced
with a challenge, a problem

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:35.250 align:middle line:90%
that you can see.

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:39.030 align:middle line:84%
I think whoever can see the
most possibilities wins.

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that was
a monumental shift.

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:46.700 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:52.139 align:middle line:90%
