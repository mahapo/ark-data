00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to "Thrive,
Self-healing with Ayurveda."

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.070 align:middle line:10%
Namaste.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.100 align:middle line:10%
My name is Justine Lemos.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.130 align:middle line:10%
I hold a PhD in
cultural anthropology,

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.010 align:middle line:10%
and I'm an Ayurvedic
practitioner.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.450 align:middle line:90%
Ayurveda is the science of life.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.260 align:middle line:84%
It is a system of
medicine and wellness

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.230 align:middle line:84%
that originates
in ancient India.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.620 align:middle line:84%
In Ayurveda, we have
three primary energy

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.890 align:middle line:84%
and constitutional
types called doshas.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.310 align:middle line:84%
These are vata,
pitta, and kapha.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.590 align:middle line:84%
In this video, I'm
going to be teaching you

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.670 align:middle line:84%
how to make Ayurvedic
churnas, or spice mixtures.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.810 align:middle line:84%
These spice mixtures can be used
to create balance in the body

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.930 align:middle line:84%
and can be used to
strengthen our digestion.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.200 align:middle line:84%
Strong digestion is
a key to good health,

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.170 align:middle line:84%
according to the
system of Ayurveda.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.440 align:middle line:84%
All you need to make your
own fresh spice mixtures

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.580 align:middle line:84%
is a clean coffee grinder
and the freshest ingredients

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.020 align:middle line:90%
you can find.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, the first churna that
we'll make is tri-doshic.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.410 align:middle line:90%
It's good for everyone.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.260 align:middle line:84%
It can be used to
stimulate digestion

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.230 align:middle line:84%
and to create balance
in the physiology.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.610 align:middle line:84%
In this spice mixture, we'll
use six parts of fennel seed.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.670 align:middle line:84%
We'll use two parts
of coriander seed.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:38.680 align:middle line:84%
We'll use two parts of cumin
seed, and one part of turmeric.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, a fennel seed is one of
my first go-tos for anyone

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.240 align:middle line:84%
who's experiencing digestive
gas, pain, or bloating.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.120 align:middle line:84%
It's known as the
grounded soother.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.670 align:middle line:84%
It promotes healing flow in our
lower chakras of 1, 2, and 3,

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.110 align:middle line:90%
and it's very soothing.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.080 align:middle line:84%
Coriander is the same-- it
comes from the same plant

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.340 align:middle line:84%
as cilantro, though
you wouldn't know it.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.949 align:middle line:84%
It has a very different
flavor and texture.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And coriander is very
good for all three doshas.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.320 align:middle line:84%
Really, it's good for everyone.
it pacifies all the doshas.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.560 align:middle line:84%
Cumin is known as the
hot kidney cleanser.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.190 align:middle line:84%
It really helps to scrape
ama, or undigested gunk

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.590 align:middle line:90%
from our intestinal walls.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.120 align:middle line:84%
In its heating properties,
it reduces metabolic waste

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.640 align:middle line:90%
and gunk in the kidneys.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.660 align:middle line:84%
Turmeric has been cultivated
for at least 3,000 years.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.130 align:middle line:84%
It detoxifies the blood and
promotes a healing flow.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.740 align:middle line:84%
So to create a basic
churna, I'm going

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.160 align:middle line:84%
to just simply put six
parts of fennel seed

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.630 align:middle line:90%
into a coffee grinder.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.160 align:middle line:84%
Or you can also use a more
traditional mortar and pestle.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.400 align:middle line:84%
What I find is that
using a coffee grinder

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.670 align:middle line:84%
really mixes the spices
well and releases

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.720 align:middle line:90%
a lot of their pungency.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I cook with
these spice mixtures,

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:12.990 align:middle line:84%
I can place them into oil to
allow their flavor and aroma

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.310 align:middle line:90%
to really expand.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.640 align:middle line:84%
I can also just use
the spice mixture

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.510 align:middle line:84%
sprinkled on food
to create a healing

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.540 align:middle line:90%
meal from really anything.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.760 align:middle line:84%
If I go out to eat, I can
just put the spice mixture

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.800 align:middle line:84%
in my purse, take it with me
and sprinkle it on my meal.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.890 align:middle line:84%
So I've placed the
ingredients in the grinder,

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.880 align:middle line:90%
and now I'm going to grind it.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:45.270 align:middle line:90%
[GRINDER WHIRRS]

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.220 align:middle line:90%
The smell is really delicious.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:53.170 align:middle line:84%
So this is a basic churna that's
really good for everybody.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.440 align:middle line:84%
To use it in cooking,
I can saute it lightly

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.870 align:middle line:90%
with oil or with vegetables.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And I can use churnas,
really, in soups,

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.250 align:middle line:84%
in dals, when I make vegetables,
really anything that's savory.

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't generally put
them into sweet meals.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.740 align:middle line:90%
Now vata dosha is cold and dry.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And if you're experiencing
a vata dosha imbalance,

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.420 align:middle line:84%
you might have constipation,
or dry skin, or anxiety,

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.610 align:middle line:84%
because vata dosha rules
the nervous system.

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.580 align:middle line:84%
So the vata churna
is going to be

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.850 align:middle line:84%
a bit more heating than the
last churna that we made.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.290 align:middle line:84%
For this, I'm going to use
fennel, coriander, cumin,

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.980 align:middle line:84%
turmeric, ginger, and
hing, or asafoetida.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.230 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to
worry about taking notes.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.520 align:middle line:10%
Everything is listed in
the PDF with this video.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.740 align:middle line:84%
So to make a vata
churna, I'm going

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.740 align:middle line:90%
to use six parts of fennel.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.410 align:middle line:84%
Again, fennel is so soothing and
it really helps our digestion,

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.750 align:middle line:84%
so I'm going to use it for both
the basic churna and the vata

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:55.620 align:middle line:90%
churna.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.720 align:middle line:84%
Six parts of fennel,
two parts of coriander.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.830 align:middle line:84%
Remember, coriander is really
good for all the doshas.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll use
three parts cumin.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.850 align:middle line:84%
Because cumin is heating and
because vata dosha is cold,

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.050 align:middle line:84%
we want to allow the physiology
to get a little bit of warmth

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.180 align:middle line:90%
through this spice mixture.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.510 align:middle line:84%
Then we'll use one
part of turmeric,

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.000 align:middle line:90%
and one part of ginger.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.540 align:middle line:90%
Ginger is really heating.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:26.640 align:middle line:90%
It's very pungent.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And so for vata dosha,
which is cold and dry,

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.500 align:middle line:84%
it's going to warm
up the physiology.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.400 align:middle line:10%
Now, the last spice
that I'm going to use--

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.380 align:middle line:10%
and it's actually an
herb-- in this churna

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.720 align:middle line:10%
is called hing, or asafoetida.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.960 align:middle line:10%
And this is a very
pungent spice.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.570 align:middle line:10%
It is very heating and it's
very good for constipation,

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.500 align:middle line:10%
which is a typical kind
of vata dosha ailment.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.840 align:middle line:10%
A little bit goes a long way.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.510 align:middle line:10%
You can find this spice at
most natural foods stores

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.160 align:middle line:10%
or at Indian groceries.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.270 align:middle line:10%
It's got a very
strong smell to it.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.510 align:middle line:10%
So again, I just put them
all in a coffee grinder

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.670 align:middle line:10%
or in a mortar and
pestle, and then I'm

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:03.903 align:middle line:10%
going to grind them up.

00:06:03.903 --> 00:06:07.354 align:middle line:90%
[GRINDER WHIRRS]

00:06:07.354 --> 00:06:15.750 align:middle line:90%


00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.170 align:middle line:10%
So this has a more heating,
more pungent smell to it.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the color is
slightly different in this vata

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.110 align:middle line:90%
dosha churna.

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.590 align:middle line:10%
The next thing I'm going to do
is make a pitta dosha churna.

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, pitta dosha is responsible
for the flames, the fires

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.970 align:middle line:84%
of the body, so our
transformation, our digestion,

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:36.300 align:middle line:90%
our metabolism.

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.590 align:middle line:10%
And if you're experiencing
a pitta dosha imbalance,

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.130 align:middle line:10%
you might be afflicted
with early morning wakings,

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:46.430 align:middle line:10%
night sweats,
irritability, rashes.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.400 align:middle line:84%
Or you might just have a
more fiery, concentrated,

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.490 align:middle line:84%
constitution, very direct,
very intense, very focused.

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.210 align:middle line:10%
So to make a
pitta-taming churna,

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.910 align:middle line:10%
I want to use more
cooling ingredients.

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:00.860 align:middle line:10%
So again, here I'm
going to use the funnel.

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to use even more
fennel, 10 parts of fennel,

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.940 align:middle line:84%
because fennel is
cooling, and fennel

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.050 align:middle line:84%
is soothing to the
intensity of pitta dosha.

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.200 align:middle line:10%
So 10 parts of fennel,
four parts of coriander,

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.120 align:middle line:10%
because again,
coriander is cooling.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.290 align:middle line:90%


00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:22.930 align:middle line:84%
You'll see in our
video on chutneys

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:27.580 align:middle line:84%
that we used cilantro in
the pitta chutney, which

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:28.690 align:middle line:90%
is also very cooling.

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:31.420 align:middle line:84%
And again, coriander
and cilantro

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.360 align:middle line:84%
are the same plant,
from the same plant.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.960 align:middle line:84%
I'll use just two parts of cumin
to give a little bit of heat

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.350 align:middle line:84%
to help with digestion
and detoxification.

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:43.420 align:middle line:90%
And then one part of turmeric.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:46.750 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we also include
mint, which is very cooling,

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:48.753 align:middle line:90%
in a pitta chutney.

00:07:48.753 --> 00:07:52.134 align:middle line:90%
[GRINDER WHIRRS]

00:07:52.134 --> 00:07:54.070 align:middle line:90%


00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:57.100 align:middle line:10%
So for a pitta dosha
churna, we could also

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:00.330 align:middle line:10%
add something like mint,
either fresh or dried,

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:03.370 align:middle line:10%
to give it even more
of a cooling property.

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.890 align:middle line:84%
So this pitta dosha
churna, it has

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:10.550 align:middle line:84%
a more cool kind of flavor
to it, or cool kind of scent

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:11.350 align:middle line:90%
to it.

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:14.740 align:middle line:10%
It just really smells
absolutely delicious.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:18.250 align:middle line:10%
Now, the last churna that
I'll show you how to make

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:19.870 align:middle line:10%
is for kapha dosha.

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And kapha dosha is
like earth and water.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:27.040 align:middle line:10%
It's slow, it's
cold, it's heavy.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:30.850 align:middle line:10%
And someone who is having
an imbalance of kapha dosha

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:35.049 align:middle line:10%
might experience water
retention, weight retention,

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:38.500 align:middle line:10%
or heaviness in
their body, swelling.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:43.299 align:middle line:10%
So this churna is going to
have more spice, more pungency,

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:46.610 align:middle line:10%
in order to get anything
that's stuck moving.

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:50.380 align:middle line:10%
So this is a heating kind
of churna or spice mixture.

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.360 align:middle line:10%
So for this spice
mixture, again I'm

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.580 align:middle line:10%
going to use the
six parts of fennel,

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:57.460 align:middle line:10%
because fennel is really
your friend when it comes

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:00.310 align:middle line:10%
to digestion, and
these spice mixtures

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:05.620 align:middle line:10%
are primarily for maximizing
and strengthening our digestion.

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:08.920 align:middle line:10%
Six parts of fennel, three
parts of coriander here.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.370 align:middle line:10%
One, two, and three.

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:15.430 align:middle line:10%
And then I'm going to use
three parts of cumin, which

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:16.650 align:middle line:10%
has a more heeding effect.

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:20.360 align:middle line:90%


00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:26.360 align:middle line:10%
And then one part of turmeric,
which has a detoxifying effect.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.180 align:middle line:84%
It's also very good for
inflammation in the body.

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:30.310 align:middle line:90%
One part of ginger.

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:34.790 align:middle line:10%
This has a very pungent,
digestive stimulating effect.

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:37.930 align:middle line:10%
Then a half part of cinnamon.

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:40.000 align:middle line:10%
And really, these parts
can be whatever you like.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.970 align:middle line:10%
You can use a half
teaspoon, a full teaspoon.

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:45.160 align:middle line:10%
You can make a whole
lot of spice mixture.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.530 align:middle line:10%
You can put it in
a jar and put it

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:49.360 align:middle line:10%
on your shelf for
about a month and just

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:53.470 align:middle line:10%
have it ready to
use in your cooking.

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:55.320 align:middle line:10%
And then a half part of cloves.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.050 align:middle line:10%


00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:00.980 align:middle line:10%
The clove has a
very drying effect,

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.320 align:middle line:10%
and that's very good
for kapha dosha, which

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:08.060 align:middle line:10%
tends to be watery, very heavy,
and needs that drying effect

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:09.030 align:middle line:10%
of the clove.

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:11.600 align:middle line:10%
And then just a
quarter part of pepper

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.220 align:middle line:10%
to really give it some spice.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.020 align:middle line:90%
So same thing.

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.772 align:middle line:84%
I just put it in a
clean coffee grinder.

00:10:17.772 --> 00:10:19.730 align:middle line:84%
You want to use a coffee
grinder that has never

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:22.400 align:middle line:84%
been used for coffee, because
once you grind coffee in it,

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.960 align:middle line:90%
you won't get the smell out.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.210 align:middle line:10%
So a clean, fresh coffee
grinder that you just

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:28.440 align:middle line:10%
reserve for your spice
mixtures is best.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.080 align:middle line:10%
Or you can use a
mortar and pestle.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:34.310 align:middle line:10%
I really like to use a coffee
grinder because it is easy

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:37.190 align:middle line:10%
and I really get a good
consistency of the spices.

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:53.510 align:middle line:10%
And this is going to have a more
spicy, pungent kind of scent

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:54.480 align:middle line:10%
to it.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:57.000 align:middle line:84%
When I smell it, it really
starts to make me get hungry.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.200 align:middle line:90%
It's really nice.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.610 align:middle line:10%
Now, you can make
these spice mixtures

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:02.990 align:middle line:10%
and you can keep them in jars.

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:05.810 align:middle line:10%
You can put them in your purse,
take them to a restaurant.

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:08.870 align:middle line:10%
You can also use
them in your cooking.

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:11.600 align:middle line:10%
I cook them in everything
that is savory,

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.540 align:middle line:10%
so soups, vegetables, dals.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:18.020 align:middle line:84%
You'll place them in a saute
pan with a little bit of oil

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:19.700 align:middle line:84%
and just heat them
enough until you

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:23.460 align:middle line:84%
smell the smell of the
spices kind of come alive

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:24.761 align:middle line:90%
or flower and blossom.

00:11:24.761 --> 00:11:26.010 align:middle line:90%
And that's when they're ready.

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:29.270 align:middle line:10%
And then you can put in whatever
else you're cooking with them.

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:32.750 align:middle line:10%
Another way you can use them
is, if you have a family that

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:36.380 align:middle line:10%
has different constitutions
or different imbalances,

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:38.290 align:middle line:10%
is you can use them
as a condiment.

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:41.000 align:middle line:10%
Just sprinkle it
on a single meal

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.130 align:middle line:10%
that you make for everyone.
