00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:15.320 align:middle line:90%


00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Namaste.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.540 align:middle line:84%
My name is Kishan Shah
and welcome to "Thrive--

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.280 align:middle line:90%
Self-healing with Ayurveda."

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.640 align:middle line:10%
I'm a longtime practitioner of
Ayurvedic medicine and teacher

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.949 align:middle line:10%
of yoga and meditation.

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.240 align:middle line:84%
In this video, I'm going to
share with you some morning

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.460 align:middle line:90%
ritual practices.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.070 align:middle line:84%
They are a part of an Ayurvedic
self-care daily routine called

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.330 align:middle line:90%
Dinacharya.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.510 align:middle line:10%
These practices, along with
the self-massage and mouth care

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.510 align:middle line:10%
videos will create a complete
morning program for you

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.320 align:middle line:10%
in your daily regimen towards
radiant health and wellness.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.900 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, many of
us use our cell phone

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.280 align:middle line:90%
as our alarm clock.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.340 align:middle line:84%
So naturally many people's
response, the first step

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.660 align:middle line:84%
in the morning, is to check
for emails, text messages,

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.810 align:middle line:84%
and social media
likes or comments.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.580 align:middle line:10%
And then immediately
what can happen then

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.490 align:middle line:10%
is we become fragmented
into the demands of others

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.085 align:middle line:10%
and fall back into that modern
dilemma of self-gratification

00:01:03.085 --> 00:01:06.160 align:middle line:10%
and validation from
external sources.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.980 align:middle line:84%
Beginning your morning
routines with self-care

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.130 align:middle line:84%
is a truly beautiful way
to honor your body, mind,

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.230 align:middle line:90%
and spirit.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.000 align:middle line:84%
You're going to love
implementing these

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.590 align:middle line:90%
into your lifestyle.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.610 align:middle line:84%
So start by setting your alarm
clock in the morning to wake

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.890 align:middle line:90%
before the rising of the sun.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And when you wake up, roll
onto your back and smile.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And then place your right
hand over your heart

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.750 align:middle line:90%
and then your left hand on top.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.310 align:middle line:90%


00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.880 align:middle line:84%
Breathe into your heart slowly
and out through your nose.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.000 align:middle line:90%


00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.240 align:middle line:84%
Breathe into your nose
and guide that breath down

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.040 align:middle line:90%
into your heart space.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.050 align:middle line:90%
And then exhale out your mouth.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.140 align:middle line:84%
Notice the warmth in your
internal landscape that washes

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.470 align:middle line:90%
over you when you do this.

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Next, I invite you to
create a morning incantation

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.840 align:middle line:84%
or personal prayer that you
can recite every morning.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.759 align:middle line:84%
It will probably change as
you practice it more and more,

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.760 align:middle line:84%
so don't worry about getting
it perfect from the start.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.510 align:middle line:84%
Begin with gratitude for
your life, for your family,

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.400 align:middle line:90%
and for your health.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.790 align:middle line:90%
Self acknowledgment.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.820 align:middle line:84%
Your beautiful body and all
of your talents and strengths.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.810 align:middle line:84%
Gratitude for the awareness of
simply bringing these practices

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.600 align:middle line:84%
into your life and
the powerful impact

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.260 align:middle line:90%
they're going to have on you.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.930 align:middle line:84%
Acknowledge the love that
you have in your heart

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.210 align:middle line:84%
and begin sending
it out consciously

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.940 align:middle line:90%
to the loved ones in your life.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.360 align:middle line:84%
Feel them receiving
these blessings.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.160 align:middle line:84%
Bring your attention
to the beautiful work

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.330 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to
set out and do today.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.030 align:middle line:84%
See the things that
you're going to create,

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.940 align:middle line:84%
the discussions and meetings
you're going to have.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.190 align:middle line:84%
Envision them moving forwards
in the best possible outcome.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.810 align:middle line:84%
Give thanks to God
or whatever you

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.560 align:middle line:84%
believe in for the gift of life
and the magic that is going

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.830 align:middle line:90%
to happen in the day to come.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.640 align:middle line:84%
Smile again and let
all of that radiate

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.920 align:middle line:90%
through your entire body.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.380 align:middle line:84%
Take a few long, deep
breaths in through your nose.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.870 align:middle line:90%
Exhale softly out the mouth.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.940 align:middle line:90%
And now for a little bed yoga.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.950 align:middle line:84%
These postures will
help relieve any tension

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.130 align:middle line:84%
that you have in your back from
sleeping through the night.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.150 align:middle line:84%
In Sanskrit, we call this
Pawanmuktasana Cycle.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.630 align:middle line:84%
It will also tell the large
intestine that you're awake,

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.770 align:middle line:84%
and shortly, it'll be
time for a bowel movement.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.490 align:middle line:90%


00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.540 align:middle line:90%
So let's begin.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.780 align:middle line:84%
Lying on your back in bed,
start by drawing your right knee

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.120 align:middle line:84%
into your chest and
holding it there,

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.520 align:middle line:84%
extending your left leg
out in front of you.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.020 align:middle line:84%
This is called power
Pawanmuktasana.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And then take your time and
begin slowing your breath down.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.500 align:middle line:84%
Be mindful to soften your belly,
and as you breathe into it,

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.840 align:middle line:90%
allow it to expand out.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.080 align:middle line:84%
Taking a few breaths here, feel
yourself dropping beautifully

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.890 align:middle line:84%
into your body and becoming
more and more relaxed with each

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.070 align:middle line:90%
and every passing exhalation.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.500 align:middle line:84%
On the next exhale, slowly
take that right knee

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.610 align:middle line:84%
all the way over to
your left hand side.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.130 align:middle line:84%
Coming into a twist, extend the
right arm out and just pause,

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.360 align:middle line:90%
relax into your body.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.030 align:middle line:90%
Close your eyes.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.790 align:middle line:84%
Feel that dream state
you just came out of.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.300 align:middle line:90%
Take a few breaths there.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.410 align:middle line:84%
Take a big breath in
through your nose.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.570 align:middle line:90%
Exhale out the mouth.

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.140 align:middle line:84%
And then slowly come
onto your backs again.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.690 align:middle line:84%
Draw both knees into
the chest and then we'll

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:50.690 align:middle line:90%
do the other side.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.710 align:middle line:84%
So keeping the left knee in,
extend the right leg out,

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.014 align:middle line:90%
pause there in Pawanmuktasana.

00:04:56.014 --> 00:04:57.055 align:middle line:90%
Take a couple of breaths.

00:04:57.055 --> 00:05:01.020 align:middle line:90%


00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.270 align:middle line:90%
Soften and relax.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.340 align:middle line:90%
One more breath in.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.140 align:middle line:90%
And then exhale.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.350 align:middle line:90%
Come on over into the twist.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.150 align:middle line:90%
Opposite side.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.050 align:middle line:84%
Take your left knee all the way
over to the right hand side.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.520 align:middle line:90%
Extend the left arm out.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And then guide your breath
down into those spaces

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.690 align:middle line:90%
that may feel tight or tension.

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.370 align:middle line:90%
Breathe into those spaces.

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.800 align:middle line:84%
Let them feel like
they're expanding

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.180 align:middle line:84%
and then release that
tension as you exhale.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.620 align:middle line:84%
We'll take one more
breath like that.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.060 align:middle line:90%
Breath in through the nose.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.880 align:middle line:90%
Exhale softly out of the mouth.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:36.680 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.370 align:middle line:90%
Come back to your back.

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.660 align:middle line:90%
Draw both knees into the chest.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:41.500 align:middle line:90%
Pause there.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.340 align:middle line:90%


00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.960 align:middle line:84%
Maybe bringing a smile
back to your face.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:47.760 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Maybe even a laugh
will come out now.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.330 align:middle line:84%
So once you feel good
and present in your body,

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.150 align:middle line:84%
it's now time to sit
up in bed and gaze

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.550 align:middle line:84%
into those incredible
hands of yours.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.900 align:middle line:84%
These tools that you were
given to take hold of your day

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.350 align:middle line:84%
in beautiful ways
and create with.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:11.940 align:middle line:84%
Then bring your hands together
in prayer close to your heart

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:17.420 align:middle line:84%
and bow your head in reverence
to simply being alive

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:22.230 align:middle line:84%
and the opportunity to
step into a new day.

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:24.570 align:middle line:84%
The right and left
hand sides of your body

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:27.060 align:middle line:84%
are associated with
different energies.

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.520 align:middle line:84%
So check in with the kind
of day that you're expecting

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.690 align:middle line:90%
to have in front of you.

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And if you're
feeling like you're

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.760 align:middle line:84%
going to have more
of a creative day,

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.450 align:middle line:84%
then step out of bed with your
left foot hitting the ground

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:40.620 align:middle line:90%
first.

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.820 align:middle line:84%
If you feel like you need
for more intellectual prowess

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.670 align:middle line:84%
and masculine might, step out
of bed leading with your right

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:49.450 align:middle line:90%
foot first.

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:54.899 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to drop
into Malasana Yogic Squat.

00:06:54.899 --> 00:06:56.940 align:middle line:84%
So bring your elbows to
the insides of the knees.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.740 align:middle line:90%
Let your tailbone drop low.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.554 align:middle line:90%
And then sit up nice and tall.

00:07:00.554 --> 00:07:01.970 align:middle line:84%
Then first, we're
going to connect

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:05.400 align:middle line:84%
to the energy of the Earth
by placing hands down

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.600 align:middle line:90%
onto the ground.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.010 align:middle line:90%
Bow your head in.

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.310 align:middle line:90%
Take a big breath in here.

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:11.680 align:middle line:90%
And then exhale.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.480 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.420 align:middle line:84%
Bringing that energy up,
touching your fingertips

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.990 align:middle line:84%
from the right hand to the
heart and to the forehead.

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And now we'll sit
up into Malasana.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.700 align:middle line:84%
So elbows to the
insides of the knees.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And then breathe-- breathe
down into your belly.

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.240 align:middle line:84%
You ever see a frog
breathe into their throat?

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.240 align:middle line:84%
That's how I want you to
breath into your belly.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.250 align:middle line:90%
Let it balloon out.

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And then imagine a column of
all violet white light coming in

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.540 align:middle line:84%
through the crown of the head
as you inhale into your belly.

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And then as you exhale, envision
red color coming down and out

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.460 align:middle line:84%
through the base
of the tailbone.

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:50.190 align:middle line:84%
We're going to influence
with that kind of breath

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:53.730 align:middle line:84%
Prana coming in through the
crown, down to the belly,

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:57.840 align:middle line:84%
and then Apana-Vayu,
grounding energy.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.440 align:middle line:84%
So walk over to your window
and look outside into nature

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.140 align:middle line:84%
or spend some time
appreciating a beautiful plant

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:05.800 align:middle line:90%
inside your home.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.890 align:middle line:84%
One of Ayurveda's
chief understandings

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:10.620 align:middle line:84%
is to be in tune with
the rhythms of nature--

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.630 align:middle line:84%
the Mother Earth
that we live upon

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:14.910 align:middle line:84%
and the vehicles to
our soul, the body,

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.820 align:middle line:84%
are to be tuned
together in harmony.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:21.690 align:middle line:84%
In this way, we can better
maintain our health and balance

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:24.270 align:middle line:84%
energy in order to
live fruitful lives.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.280 align:middle line:84%
Empower yourself
with the knowledge

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.470 align:middle line:84%
to harmonize your health
and enjoy your life.

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:30.270 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy.

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:31.710 align:middle line:90%
