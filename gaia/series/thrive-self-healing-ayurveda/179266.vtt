00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:12.390 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Find a comfortable seat.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.835 align:middle line:10%
Allow your eyes to fall shut.

00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:22.490 align:middle line:90%


00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:29.450 align:middle line:84%
Become aware first of
your physical body,

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:35.810 align:middle line:84%
the sensations in the physical
body, the places where

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:46.490 align:middle line:84%
the physical body touches the
floor, the mat, or the cushion,

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:52.470 align:middle line:84%
the sensation of
air on your skin,

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:58.840 align:middle line:84%
the sensation inside your
mouth, behind the closed eyes.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.640 align:middle line:90%


00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.730 align:middle line:84%
How does it feel to be in
your body at this moment?

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:16.420 align:middle line:90%


00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:24.610 align:middle line:84%
Next, become aware
of your breath

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.696 align:middle line:84%
and the flow of
your inhalations,

00:01:31.696 --> 00:01:33.200 align:middle line:90%
of your exhalations.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:42.750 align:middle line:90%


00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:54.370 align:middle line:84%
And notice any feeling of
inner tremoring or aliveness,

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:00.640 align:middle line:84%
feeling into the energy
of the body, your prana,

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:14.067 align:middle line:84%
your vitality, noticing if
you feel awake or sleepy,

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:21.810 align:middle line:84%
and just noticing the flows
of vital energy in the body.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:38.230 align:middle line:90%


00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.940 align:middle line:84%
Next, become aware
of your mind--

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:51.130 align:middle line:84%
your perceiving mind, the mind
that's perceiving my voice

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:58.090 align:middle line:84%
and the mind that's perceiving
outside noises or colors,

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.195 align:middle line:84%
sensations, simply
witnessing and allowing.

00:03:04.195 --> 00:03:14.040 align:middle line:90%


00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:22.020 align:middle line:84%
Next, move your mind between
the eyebrows and up a bit

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:28.380 align:middle line:84%
and then inside of
the skull cavity,

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:35.770 align:middle line:84%
gathering the focus here about
two inches inside of the skull

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.280 align:middle line:84%
and up above the soft
palate of the mouth.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:47.100 align:middle line:90%


00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:55.810 align:middle line:84%
Feel the spaciousness
of this place

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.625 align:middle line:84%
as you gather your
attention here.

00:03:58.625 --> 00:04:04.630 align:middle line:90%


00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:05.950 align:middle line:90%
Inhale deeply.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.700 align:middle line:90%


00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And with your exhalation,
drop your awareness down

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.210 align:middle line:90%
to the center of your chest.

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:29.180 align:middle line:90%


00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And with your attention at
the space of your heart,

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.040 align:middle line:84%
imagine what sound
you would make

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:48.580 align:middle line:84%
if you had received your
heart's innermost desire

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.000 align:middle line:84%
or wish, that which
would make you

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:01.790 align:middle line:84%
completely satisfied, completely
whole, completely fulfilled.

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:09.464 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps it would be a
deep sigh, like, ahh,

00:05:09.464 --> 00:05:12.548 align:middle line:90%
or a sound like, mmm.

00:05:12.548 --> 00:05:18.850 align:middle line:90%


00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:31.180 align:middle line:84%
Allow yourself to internally
silently hear this sound,

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.960 align:middle line:90%
the sound of great contentment.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:45.580 align:middle line:84%
Allow it to move in and out
of the space of the heart

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.900 align:middle line:84%
without focusing the mind
on it, simply allowing

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:58.090 align:middle line:84%
the sound of deep contentment,
deep fulfillment to radiate

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:03.715 align:middle line:84%
out and back in to the
space of the heart.

00:06:03.715 --> 00:06:18.300 align:middle line:90%


00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:24.170 align:middle line:84%
If you are moved to, you can
make this sound again out loud.

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:30.400 align:middle line:84%
Or simply allow it
to silently vibrate

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:37.690 align:middle line:84%
in the space of
the heart, allowing

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:45.190 align:middle line:84%
it to ring every 5 or
10 seconds very gently,

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:48.120 align:middle line:84%
almost as if you are
listening for it to be there.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:07:15.240 align:middle line:90%


00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And then allowing the sound
to drop away for a moment,

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:30.780 align:middle line:84%
feel into the space of the
heart and notice what is there.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.000 align:middle line:90%
Does it feel dark or light?

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.080 align:middle line:90%


00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.210 align:middle line:90%
Is there any sadness?

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:42.160 align:middle line:90%


00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.220 align:middle line:90%
Is there any fear or worry?

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:48.000 align:middle line:90%


00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.990 align:middle line:84%
Noticing what emotion,
what sensation

00:07:54.990 --> 00:08:00.920 align:middle line:84%
you feel at the space of
the heart and allowing,

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.010 align:middle line:90%
inviting in whatever is there.

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:09.610 align:middle line:90%


00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:17.830 align:middle line:84%
Noticing what sensation,
what emotion is there

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:26.650 align:middle line:84%
present at the heart's face and
inviting in whatever is there.

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:37.909 align:middle line:90%


00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:47.490 align:middle line:84%
As you invite in any
sensation, any emotion,

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:51.120 align:middle line:84%
notice how it may
begin to shift.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:55.980 align:middle line:90%


00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:03.996 align:middle line:84%
And new sensation, new feeling
state, new thought may arise.

00:09:03.996 --> 00:09:10.410 align:middle line:90%


00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:12.440 align:middle line:90%
Allow this in, too.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:20.430 align:middle line:90%


00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And notice what is under
all of these feelings,

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:30.840 align:middle line:90%
these sensations.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:37.770 align:middle line:90%


00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:42.150 align:middle line:84%
You may find yourself
moving into a state

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:53.620 align:middle line:84%
of deep joy, of deep
relaxation, of deep bliss.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:10:01.770 align:middle line:84%
Or you may find yourself
in an emotional state.

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:09.570 align:middle line:84%
Welcome in whatever is
present for you now.

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:14.120 align:middle line:90%
And in welcoming, allow shift.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:18.200 align:middle line:90%


00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:26.550 align:middle line:84%
Again, move back to this sound,
the sound of great contentment,

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:33.250 align:middle line:84%
allowing it to fill the
heart and to move in and out

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:42.900 align:middle line:84%
the front, the back of
the heart, to all sides,

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.210 align:middle line:84%
allowing it to flow
with your breath

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:49.020 align:middle line:84%
or without the
flow of the breath.

00:10:49.020 --> 00:11:10.290 align:middle line:90%


00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:16.870 align:middle line:84%
You can effortlessly
stay with this sound

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:23.630 align:middle line:84%
of great contentment,
moving in and out

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:34.070 align:middle line:84%
of the fronts and the back of
the heart in all directions

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:35.640 align:middle line:90%
for as long as you would like.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:42.250 align:middle line:90%


00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:43.050 align:middle line:90%
Namaste.

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:46.950 align:middle line:90%


00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:50.000 align:middle line:90%
