00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.240 align:middle line:10%
>> Come into a nice upright
seated posture and close

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.940 align:middle line:10%
your eyes.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.280 align:middle line:84%
We're going to turn your
palms to face up, and then

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.620 align:middle line:84%
bring the tips of
your index finger

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.600 align:middle line:84%
and thumbs together into
what is known as Chin Mudra.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.540 align:middle line:90%
Palms up in receptivity.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:37.480 align:middle line:84%
This meditation is to
fill your inner body

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.080 align:middle line:90%
with healing light and energy.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.650 align:middle line:84%
We're going to learn the
Dhanvantari Gayatri mantra.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.700 align:middle line:84%
So as I go through this
mantra word by word,

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.800 align:middle line:84%
we're going to show it right
here up on your screen.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.590 align:middle line:84%
And so you can follow
that and read it.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.010 align:middle line:84%
It's really nice to follow
it with your eyes closed,

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.760 align:middle line:90%
so you can learn it by ear.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.660 align:middle line:84%
But if you need to,
you can look at it.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to take you
through it word by word.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.820 align:middle line:84%
And we'll do that
together twice,

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.290 align:middle line:90%
breaking it down each word.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.590 align:middle line:84%
And I'll leave a pause
for you to repeat it back.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.440 align:middle line:84%
After that, we'll do it
together seven more times.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And then from there, we'll move
into a guided still meditation.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.299 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a breath together.

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:26.340 align:middle line:90%
Inhale through your nose.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:35.500 align:middle line:90%


00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.890 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
chant Aum together.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:38.690 align:middle line:90%
Breath in--

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.141 align:middle line:90%


00:01:42.141 --> 00:01:43.127 align:middle line:90%
(CHANTING) Aum.

Take a breath in, we'll
chant Aum together.

00:06:19.655 --> 00:06:23.826 align:middle line:90%


00:06:23.826 --> 00:06:24.800 align:middle line:10%
(CHANTING) Aum.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:36.020 align:middle line:90%


00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:43.770 align:middle line:84%
And then slowly, coming
into a calm, smooth breath.

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:49.490 align:middle line:90%


00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to
bring your attention

00:06:51.130 --> 00:07:00.440 align:middle line:84%
to the center of your
chest, visualizing

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:11.080 align:middle line:84%
a vibrant, golden light, a
radiant sphere of golden light

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.400 align:middle line:90%
at the center of your chest.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.000 align:middle line:90%


00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.155 align:middle line:90%
Breathe into that space.

00:07:17.155 --> 00:07:20.740 align:middle line:90%


00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And as you breathe into it,
notice it getting brighter.

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:30.840 align:middle line:90%


00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And as you exhale,
allow this golden light

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:41.620 align:middle line:84%
to wash throughout
the entire body,

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:53.430 align:middle line:84%
feeling the healing energy,
inhaling into the chest.

00:07:53.430 --> 00:08:01.490 align:middle line:84%
A vibrant orb of golden light,
building and gathering energy.

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:07.720 align:middle line:90%


00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And as you exhale,
watch it disperse

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.060 align:middle line:84%
from the center of your
chest out to all peripheries

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:13.860 align:middle line:90%
of the body.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:17.740 align:middle line:90%


00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:25.410 align:middle line:84%
And we'll just continue
with this healing breath

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:28.490 align:middle line:90%
in stillness on your own.

00:08:28.490 --> 00:13:03.060 align:middle line:90%


00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:06.280 align:middle line:84%
Take a slow breath
in through your nose.

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:10.540 align:middle line:84%
Bring your hands together,
gently rub the palms together.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.701 align:middle line:84%
Let's get a little
bit of warmth.

00:13:13.701 --> 00:13:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And before you open
your eyes, we just

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.150 align:middle line:84%
want you to bring your
palms to your forehead

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:23.270 align:middle line:84%
and wipe them over the back
of the head, down the back

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:24.070 align:middle line:90%
of your neck.

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:26.630 align:middle line:90%


00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:29.500 align:middle line:84%
Bring your left hand
to your right shoulder

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:36.340 align:middle line:84%
and swipe down the arm, opposite
hand to the opposite shoulder,

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:39.770 align:middle line:90%
and swipe down the arm.

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And then take your two hands
to the front of your chest

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:48.550 align:middle line:84%
and pull down the front of your
body all the way to the hips.

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And then run your hands
down along the tops

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:56.320 align:middle line:84%
of the thighs to those
beautiful feet of yours.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And then bringing the
hands back to the chest,

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:03.790 align:middle line:84%
bowing the chin down
and towards the heart.

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:07.450 align:middle line:90%


00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:14.170 align:middle line:84%
Opening your eyes halfway into
your palms, a nice, gentle

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:15.535 align:middle line:90%
smile across your face.

00:14:15.535 --> 00:14:19.909 align:middle line:90%


00:14:19.909 --> 00:14:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And now, this
meditation is complete.
