>> Ayurveda conceptualizes
that there are intelligences

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.130 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, and these
intelligences are comprised

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.450 align:middle line:84%
of the five great elements,
which are earth, water, fire,

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.750 align:middle line:90%
air, and ether.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.270 align:middle line:10%
And these elements,
these great elements

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.770 align:middle line:10%
combine to make
what we call doshas.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And the doshas are Vata, which
is comprised of air and ether,

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.380 align:middle line:84%
Pitta, which is
comprised of fire

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.920 align:middle line:84%
with a little bit of
moisture, and Kapha, which

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.550 align:middle line:90%
is like earth and like water.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.050 align:middle line:10%
>> We all have all of
these five elements,

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.400 align:middle line:10%
except we are dominant in
one, two, or all three.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.620 align:middle line:84%
A single dominant
constitution can

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.920 align:middle line:84%
be a Vata constitution
or a Pitta Constitution,

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.580 align:middle line:90%
or a Kapha constitution.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.590 align:middle line:84%
When I look at myself, the
way I see my constitution

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.720 align:middle line:84%
is a Pitta Vata constitution,
which is a dual constitution.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.690 align:middle line:84%
So there is Vata,
Pitta, and Kapha.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.440 align:middle line:10%
There is Vata Pitta, Pitta
Kapha, and Kapha Vata

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.710 align:middle line:10%
Constitution, and there
are a few people who

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.320 align:middle line:10%
are dominant in
all three doshas,

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.520 align:middle line:10%
and they are called a
tridoshic type of constitution.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.850 align:middle line:84%
So knowing your
constitution in Ayurveda

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.170 align:middle line:84%
becomes the fundamental
thing to even know ourselves.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.120 align:middle line:90%
And how do we know that?

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.110 align:middle line:84%
We are born in
that genetic pool.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.840 align:middle line:84%
The constitutions
that we are born into

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.080 align:middle line:90%
comes from our parents.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.610 align:middle line:10%
The sperm and the ovum come in
with their own constitutions,

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.270 align:middle line:10%
and in their union is
what we come out of.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.880 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine
how many millions

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.880 align:middle line:84%
of people with different
permutations and combinations

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.070 align:middle line:84%
are born with their
unique constitution.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.740 align:middle line:84%
In Ayurveda, each one
is very different.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.320 align:middle line:90%
It's not one size fits all.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.200 align:middle line:90%


00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.870 align:middle line:84%
>> If you're trying to
understand what a dosha is,

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.290 align:middle line:84%
when you look at yourself in the
mirror, if you're a Vata dosha,

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.340 align:middle line:84%
then you are going to
be very slim, petite,

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.180 align:middle line:84%
but either very short,
petite, or very thin and tall.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.990 align:middle line:84%
Your muscles will be
slender, and your eyes

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.720 align:middle line:90%
will be kind of small.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.570 align:middle line:84%
You cannot stay in one
place for a long time,

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.120 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
be very talkative.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.830 align:middle line:90%
You're prone to anxiety.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.600 align:middle line:90%
You're prone to worrying a lot.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.600 align:middle line:84%
For a Pitta constitution,
you're going

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.800 align:middle line:84%
to have a medium build
with very defined muscles.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.120 align:middle line:84%
You're also going to be
very sharp in your features

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.670 align:middle line:84%
and very crisp in
your talk, and you

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.370 align:middle line:84%
are going to be the
person who is very hungry.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
eat, you're going

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.150 align:middle line:90%
to be very irritable and angry.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.860 align:middle line:90%
So for you, food comes first.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:57.160 align:middle line:84%
So you have to eat
and then speak.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And if you're a Kapha person,
your frame is going to be big.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.110 align:middle line:84%
When I say big, your
skeleton, your bone structure,

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.630 align:middle line:84%
your muscles, they're
going to be bulky.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.820 align:middle line:84%
It's nothing to
do with being fat.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.100 align:middle line:90%
You're just a big person.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's genetically,
that's how you will be.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.751 align:middle line:84%
But you're going
to have big eyes.

00:04:16.751 --> 00:04:18.209 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
have a lot of hair.

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.870 align:middle line:84%
You are going to be
very calm and composed.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.060 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
rush into things.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.390 align:middle line:84%
You're going to take
time, and you move slowly.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.870 align:middle line:84%
One drawback is you tend
to become lethargic,

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.780 align:middle line:84%
so you have to become
mindful about that.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.740 align:middle line:84%
>> At the moment of conception,
our constitution is formed.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.920 align:middle line:84%
And then after that
moment of meeting,

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.310 align:middle line:84%
we deviate from
that constitution

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.310 align:middle line:84%
into various states
of imbalance.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.220 align:middle line:84%
So someone with a more
fiery constitution,

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.920 align:middle line:84%
what we would say a more
Pitta constitution, someone

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.480 align:middle line:84%
who is direct, someone who is
kind of type and athletic, they

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:04.630 align:middle line:84%
could develop a Vata imbalance,
an imbalance of air and ether,

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.510 align:middle line:84%
because they're eating
a lot of drying foods.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.410 align:middle line:84%
They're engaging in a lot
of mental stimulation.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.630 align:middle line:84%
They're anxious,
they're hurrying,

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.580 align:middle line:84%
and so they might
actually develop

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.630 align:middle line:84%
signs of what we call a Vata
imbalance in a Pitta person.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.500 align:middle line:84%
Then someone who is more
Kapha in their constitution

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.980 align:middle line:84%
or someone who is having
a Kapha dosha imbalance

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.720 align:middle line:90%
will accumulate.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.610 align:middle line:90%
Kapha dosha is heavy.

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.170 align:middle line:90%
It's cold.

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:36.490 align:middle line:84%
It's like water and earth
mixed together, like mud.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.250 align:middle line:84%
So they might
experience swelling.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.340 align:middle line:84%
They might experience
weight gain.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.840 align:middle line:84%
They might experience
water retention,

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.130 align:middle line:84%
or the symptoms of a lot of
mucus in the nasal passages.

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.340 align:middle line:84%
That's an accumulation
of Kapha dosha.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.760 align:middle line:84%
So we're always looking at the
relative state of imbalance

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.400 align:middle line:84%
in the body and trying
to apply measures

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.810 align:middle line:84%
that will bring us into greater
balance and greater harmony.

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.200 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the beauties of
Ayurveda is that not only does

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.210 align:middle line:84%
it understand nature, it
utilizes the language of nature

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.820 align:middle line:84%
in order to help us
understand balance.

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And so we look at things
like fire, earth, water,

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.850 align:middle line:90%
and space, air.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.880 align:middle line:84%
The ancients weren't so naive
as to think that the body was

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.280 align:middle line:90%
actually composed of these.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.190 align:middle line:84%
They understood that
the body's functions

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:29.170 align:middle line:90%
will pattern after those.

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And if we can understand
that patterning

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.730 align:middle line:84%
and learn just one simple
rule, that like increases like,

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:41.650 align:middle line:90%
we are able to create balance.

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:47.080 align:middle line:84%
>> In Ayurveda, like increases
like, and opposites balance.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.490 align:middle line:84%
Say, suppose, there is a
very hot summer season.

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.650 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, you're
going to feel very hot.

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:56.720 align:middle line:84%
So heat increases
heat in your body.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And the only way you can
balance that is to cool it down,

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.260 align:middle line:90%
the opposite.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.220 align:middle line:84%
>> And so unlike me going
through medical school

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:11.360 align:middle line:84%
and three years of residency
before I could understand how

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:17.240 align:middle line:84%
to treat someone, with
Ayurveda, you can understand

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.160 align:middle line:90%
the elements.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.170 align:middle line:84%
And if you can
describe something

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:24.140 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the elements,
you know what its effect

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.720 align:middle line:90%
is on the physiology.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:31.130 align:middle line:10%
>> The body that we are born
with is a blueprint of what we

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:38.510 align:middle line:10%
come with, but then how we want
to live is a compilation of not

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:45.500 align:middle line:10%
just what we eat, also what
we think, how we think,

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:50.450 align:middle line:10%
and our practices to maintain
this body and nourish this body

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:52.320 align:middle line:10%
to live a long and healthy life.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.420 align:middle line:90%


00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.930 align:middle line:84%
>> When we look at
the primary elements,

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:02.620 align:middle line:84%
we see that they
tend to pair up.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:09.340 align:middle line:84%
This pairing up helps us to
be able to not only describe

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.650 align:middle line:84%
commonalities that
we see in nature,

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:14.350 align:middle line:84%
but also to describe
everything in nature,

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:18.172 align:middle line:84%
just as we could with
the individual elements.

00:08:18.172 --> 00:08:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And what is very
common, very popular

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.200 align:middle line:84%
is that people want to
understand themselves.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.970 align:middle line:84%
So they want to
describe themselves.

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And so they look to oh, OK,
am I more of that Vata type?

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.690 align:middle line:84%
Am I more of that Pitta type,
more of that Kapha type?

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:35.169 align:middle line:84%
And there's great
wisdom in that,

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:38.320 align:middle line:84%
but it's also limiting
because you can apply this

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.330 align:middle line:90%
to everything in nature.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:44.380 align:middle line:84%
You can apply this to
everything in your life.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:48.810 align:middle line:84%
>> The doshas in Ayurveda are
intelligences inside the body.

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And we break things down
into five elementals,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:58.740 align:middle line:84%
these physical things that we
can touch and smell and see

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.350 align:middle line:90%
and taste and feel.

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:04.860 align:middle line:10%
They need some sort of
animating principle, some sort

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.030 align:middle line:10%
of intelligence behind them.

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:09.210 align:middle line:84%
This is what we
call as the doshas.

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's when they
become imbalanced,

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.090 align:middle line:84%
they like to fine we can
tissues and take up residence.

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:17.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we'll see
a physical symptom come

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.390 align:middle line:90%
about inside the body.

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:23.000 align:middle line:84%
So the doshas essentially are
working behind the scenes.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.312 align:middle line:84%
Vata dosha is actually
the animating or principal

00:09:27.312 --> 00:09:28.520 align:middle line:90%
to the Pitta and Kapha dosha.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.840 align:middle line:84%
When you say in Ayurveda
that Pitta and Kapha are

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.940 align:middle line:84%
lame in nature, they don't
have that underlying movement

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:35.740 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:38.290 align:middle line:84%
And so it's Vata that
gives them their movement.

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:41.040 align:middle line:84%
So one of the ways
in which we practice

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.880 align:middle line:84%
is always making sure
Vata is balanced first.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.820 align:middle line:90%


00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:50.860 align:middle line:84%
When we see an
imbalance in it, we'll

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:55.440 align:middle line:84%
see not enough movement, which
is like paralysis, no movement.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.880 align:middle line:84%
When we see too much
air elemental in it,

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.970 align:middle line:84%
we'll see too much movement,
like a twitching in your eye

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:04.690 align:middle line:84%
or something extreme,
like Parkinson's disease,

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:07.110 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:10.280 align:middle line:84%
Pitta dosha is the
transformative intelligence,

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:16.040 align:middle line:84%
from transforming your food into
nutrients to all the way down

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.420 align:middle line:90%
to the cellular level.

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:20.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's composed
of fire and water.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.490 align:middle line:10%
The fire elemental
being in excess,

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:24.950 align:middle line:10%
we'll see too much
transformation,

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:29.300 align:middle line:10%
such as gastric ulcer, skin
irritations, and rashes.

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And then too much
water element into it,

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:33.182 align:middle line:84%
we'll see not enough
transformation.

00:10:33.182 --> 00:10:34.640 align:middle line:84%
What happens when
you eat your food

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.990 align:middle line:84%
and it comes out looking on
the other side like diarrhea,

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:37.790 align:middle line:90%
for example?

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:43.040 align:middle line:84%
This is too much watered down
Pitta dosha inside the body.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:47.610 align:middle line:84%
For Kapha dosha, we look at
as strength and stability.

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:49.340 align:middle line:84%
One of the misnomers
that's out there

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:52.170 align:middle line:84%
is the association of
Kapha dosha as being fat

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:53.600 align:middle line:90%
into the body, right?

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:58.340 align:middle line:84%
But really, what we want is a
lot of healthy balance of Kapha

00:10:58.340 --> 00:10:59.900 align:middle line:84%
dosha in the body,
because this is

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:05.640 align:middle line:84%
going to give you your strength
and your stability inside.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:09.510 align:middle line:84%
Too much water element,
we'll see edema, swelling.

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:13.590 align:middle line:84%
Too much earth element, we'll
see blockage, not enough flow,

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:16.830 align:middle line:84%
and the creation of a
growth, like a cyst, a tumor,

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:18.310 align:middle line:90%
or cancer.

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:23.130 align:middle line:84%
So we understand these as being
very subtle inside the body.

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And when they are in balance,
they are essentially invisible,

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:34.740 align:middle line:84%
governing all the physiological
functions inside of your body.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:38.330 align:middle line:84%
>> People may ask, is my
dosha my constitution,

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.460 align:middle line:90%
or is my dosha my imbalance?

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:44.580 align:middle line:84%
And you know, we all have
all three of these doshas.

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:47.150 align:middle line:84%
Actually, everything
in the universe

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:51.710 align:middle line:84%
has or can be conceptualized
as having these doshas.

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:55.010 align:middle line:84%
They are simply ways
of describing qualities

00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:59.040 align:middle line:84%
and describing energies and
describing intelligences.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:03.350 align:middle line:84%
So yes, you have a
doshic constitution

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:06.770 align:middle line:84%
that can be determined
by visual examination,

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:09.320 align:middle line:84%
by examination of your
Vedic astrological chart,

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.150 align:middle line:90%
by various different measures.

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:14.910 align:middle line:84%
And you likely-- unless you're
in perfect balance at this

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:15.710 align:middle line:90%
moment--

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:18.670 align:middle line:84%
it is likely that you may
have an imbalance, which

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:20.600 align:middle line:90%
is a doshic imbalance.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:25.610 align:middle line:84%
>> The idea is to catch symptoms
as they arise before they

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:27.260 align:middle line:90%
physically appear.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Another way that Ayurveda is
able to help us with prevention

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:35.630 align:middle line:10%
is understanding for
my unique physiology,

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:39.440 align:middle line:10%
what is it that is
going to promote health?

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:43.370 align:middle line:84%
What is going to be
most aligned with me?

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:45.590 align:middle line:84%
Being able to
describe ourselves,

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:48.930 align:middle line:84%
our nature in terms
of these tendencies,

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:53.360 align:middle line:84%
these qualities, that
affords us a blueprint

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:58.130 align:middle line:84%
for us to be able to then
organize diet, organize

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:00.830 align:middle line:84%
routine, organize
activities, organize

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:06.080 align:middle line:84%
supplements in order to prevent
things from going out of whack.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:09.770 align:middle line:84%
And so each
individual needs to be

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:15.030 align:middle line:84%
able to attune their diet
to what's best for them.

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:18.050 align:middle line:84%
So somebody who is very
light and very airy,

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:22.400 align:middle line:84%
they'll have a tendency for
that to cause the nervous system

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.750 align:middle line:90%
to get frazzled.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:25.530 align:middle line:84%
They'll be bouncing
all over the place.

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:27.590 align:middle line:84%
They'll be so
enthusiastic about things

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:29.950 align:middle line:84%
that over time, they'll
fatigue the nervous system

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:31.700 align:middle line:84%
and they'll draw it
out of balance because

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.710 align:middle line:84%
of that airiness
and that tendency

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:36.650 align:middle line:84%
to flit from one thing
to the next to the next.

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:39.830 align:middle line:84%
Knowing that, we can then
take preventive measures.

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:42.480 align:middle line:84%
We can do foods
that are grounding.

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:47.750 align:middle line:84%
We can do routine that is
very regular and settled

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:51.085 align:middle line:84%
and forms a structure
For that groundingness

00:13:51.085 --> 00:13:54.860 align:middle line:90%
that that airy individual needs.

00:13:54.860 --> 00:14:00.590 align:middle line:84%
So you can apply this knowledge
of the doshas everywhere.

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:03.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's where its
greatest power is, not just

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:07.850 align:middle line:84%
in knowing our proclivity,
our tendencies,

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:13.580 align:middle line:84%
but really to know how
to utilize anything

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:16.320 align:middle line:90%
to create balance.

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:19.730 align:middle line:84%
So there are many
angles of prevention

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:23.750 align:middle line:84%
that Ayurveda holds,
that it is not

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:28.910 align:middle line:84%
only tuned in to the doshas
that make up our physiology,

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:32.660 align:middle line:84%
but also tuned in to
the qualities in nature,

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:35.430 align:middle line:84%
the qualities in food,
spices, herbs, and so forth.

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:38.470 align:middle line:90%


00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:41.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Ayurveda has been kind
of popularized in the West,

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:44.200 align:middle line:84%
especially as it's
come in with yoga.

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And the benefit of that is
many people are learning about

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:48.970 align:middle line:90%
Ayurveda. .

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:51.910 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes it
can be in a way that

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:56.050 align:middle line:84%
isn't as deep as the vast
knowledge of Ayurveda

00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:59.890 align:middle line:84%
in its holistic,
scientific way expresses

00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:02.050 align:middle line:90%
the properties of the universe.

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:05.830 align:middle line:84%
We often think about us
having a constitutional type,

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:08.020 align:middle line:84%
or I'll hear people
say, what is your dosha,

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:10.810 align:middle line:84%
almost like 15 years ago they
might have said, like, what

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:11.740 align:middle line:90%
is your sign?

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:13.240 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like a
pick up line now,

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:16.100 align:middle line:84%
like, well, my dosha is
this and your dosha is that,

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.270 align:middle line:84%
so we shouldn't
date or something.

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:21.130 align:middle line:84%
But this is a kind
of superficial way

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:23.230 align:middle line:90%
to look at the dosha.

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:25.480 align:middle line:84%
>> This is what's very
interesting about how do I see,

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.700 align:middle line:84%
these dosha
questionnaires online,

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.610 align:middle line:84%
is that a lot of the
questions, for me,

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:34.120 align:middle line:84%
I would want people to ask more
about how have you been feeling

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:37.390 align:middle line:84%
in the last month, right, or how
you've been feeling in the last

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:38.710 align:middle line:90%
two days?

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And then really honestly answer
those questions based on that.

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:46.120 align:middle line:84%
They're going to get a better
idea about what the dosha

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:48.310 align:middle line:84%
imbalances are in
their body and then

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:50.890 align:middle line:84%
correctly choose I need
something that's more

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:54.310 align:middle line:84%
Vata balancing or Pitta
balancing or Kapha balancing.

00:15:54.310 --> 00:16:00.550 align:middle line:84%
Tuning into what is your
ability to process thoughts,

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:01.780 align:middle line:90%
that's a very simple thing.

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:03.460 align:middle line:90%
How focused can you be?

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:07.330 align:middle line:84%
That is a very subtle way
of tuning into how are you

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:08.440 align:middle line:90%
feeling inside?

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:11.470 align:middle line:84%
What is your inner
core frequency,

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:13.630 align:middle line:84%
in terms of your
emotional state?

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:16.570 align:middle line:90%


00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:20.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Just as we can talk about
having a particular doshic

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.680 align:middle line:84%
constitution or body type and
we can talk about our states

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.560 align:middle line:84%
of imbalance in
terms of the dosha,

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.530 align:middle line:84%
we can also talk about the
phases of the life that

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:32.830 align:middle line:84%
everyone moves through
in terms of the dosha.

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:38.380 align:middle line:84%
So childhood has a more
Kapha nature to it.

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:41.410 align:middle line:84%
Kapha is comprised
of earth and water.

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:42.610 align:middle line:90%
It's slow.

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:43.510 align:middle line:90%
It's heavier.

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:44.770 align:middle line:90%
It's mucusy.

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:48.940 align:middle line:84%
Children need to nap
all the time, every day,

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:50.440 align:middle line:84%
and they're always
getting colds.

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.750 align:middle line:84%
They're always mucusy
and dripping snot.

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:55.240 align:middle line:84%
That's because they
have more Kapha dosha.

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:59.290 align:middle line:84%
Kapha is responsible for
our strength, our stability,

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:00.740 align:middle line:90%
and our immunity.

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And so a child is growing, and
their strength is developing.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And Kapha dosha we can
see also in springtime,

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:12.460 align:middle line:90%
when plants begin to grow.

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:17.859 align:middle line:84%
So a child in its growing
state is more Kapha dosha.

00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:21.880 align:middle line:84%
Then when we move into
our middle age years,

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.480 align:middle line:90%
we tend to be focused.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.650 align:middle line:90%
We tend to be working on career.

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:28.240 align:middle line:90%
We might be having a family.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.260 align:middle line:90%
We might be very active.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And this is the time of
life that we characterize

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:34.840 align:middle line:90%
as being more Pitta dosha.

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:37.010 align:middle line:90%
We have fire, we have drive.

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:39.250 align:middle line:90%
We're getting things done.

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And then the later years in
life are more Vata dosha.

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:45.590 align:middle line:90%
They're more dry.

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:46.660 align:middle line:90%
They're more brittle.

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:49.960 align:middle line:84%
When we look at the elderly,
they tend to become fragile.

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:51.730 align:middle line:84%
They often might
develop something

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:55.510 align:middle line:84%
like osteoporosis, which is
actually the bones becoming

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:56.520 align:middle line:90%
very brittle.

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And their tissues
tend to dry out.

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And this is because
in old age, we

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:03.040 align:middle line:84%
are entering into a
phase that is dominated

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.900 align:middle line:90%
by the energy of Vata dosha.

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:07.680 align:middle line:90%


00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>> As long as we stay
in our own constitution,

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:12.180 align:middle line:90%
we are in balance.

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:14.580 align:middle line:84%
That is why it becomes
very important for us

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:18.500 align:middle line:84%
to know our constitution
and to keep it in balance.

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:20.730 align:middle line:84%
>> I had a wonderful
mentor who used to say,

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:24.600 align:middle line:84%
give me an hour with any person
and I can teach them the effect

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:29.100 align:middle line:84%
of any substance in the
universe on their body.

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And what he would teach are
the fundamental elements.

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:37.830 align:middle line:84%
>> We are all made up of matter,
and matter composes of all five

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:39.960 align:middle line:90%
elements.

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:44.880 align:middle line:84%
Everything is within
ourselves in our body.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:48.750 align:middle line:84%
It becomes more
important for us to live

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:55.860 align:middle line:84%
in that state of consciousness
and be in that biorhythm.

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:59.730 align:middle line:84%
That's where we are in
balance and we are in harmony.

00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:03.770 align:middle line:90%


00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:07.280 align:middle line:84%
