00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.350 align:middle line:10%
>> Find a comfortable seat.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.080 align:middle line:10%
Allow your eyes to fall shut.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.900 align:middle line:90%


00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.722 align:middle line:84%
Become aware of the flow of your
inhalations and exhalations.

Move the mind down to the base
of the spine, into the Root,

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.845 align:middle line:90%
into Muladhara chakra.

00:00:42.845 --> 00:00:50.090 align:middle line:90%


00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:57.900 align:middle line:84%
Here, find your way into
a sense of stability,

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:04.319 align:middle line:84%
a sense of rootedness, a
resting into the earth element.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:14.360 align:middle line:90%


00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:22.980 align:middle line:10%
Allowing yourself to be
supported and grounded,

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:30.340 align:middle line:10%
and feeling your seat,
and feeling the places

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.550 align:middle line:10%
where you connect into
the earth, or the floor,

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:35.350 align:middle line:10%
or your cushion.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.220 align:middle line:90%


00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:49.040 align:middle line:84%
Here, at the base of the spine,
imagine, or see, or visualize

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:59.810 align:middle line:84%
a yellow square, four
sides equal in length,

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.685 align:middle line:90%
a golden yellow color.

00:02:01.685 --> 00:02:10.669 align:middle line:90%


00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And then coming into the
Bija, or seed mantra,

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:24.610 align:middle line:84%
the seed sacred sound current
of the Root chakra will sound

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:33.190 align:middle line:84%
or internally sound the
mantra "laang," L-A-A-N-G,

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.060 align:middle line:84%
creating a resonance up through
the soft palate of the mouth,

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.810 align:middle line:84%
vibrating the skull, and
feeling the sound at the base

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:42.610 align:middle line:90%
of the spine.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.296 align:middle line:90%


00:02:45.296 --> 00:02:46.096 align:middle line:90%
Laang.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:16.920 align:middle line:84%
Moving up in to the sacrum, the
pelvis, and the watery places

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.290 align:middle line:84%
of the body, the container
of our urinary bladder,

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.595 align:middle line:90%
of the sexual organs.

00:03:23.595 --> 00:03:27.160 align:middle line:90%


00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.445 align:middle line:90%

Svadhishthana chakra,
the second chakra--

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.270 align:middle line:90%


00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.740 align:middle line:84%
here, we'll see, or
imagine, or visualize,

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:59.830 align:middle line:84%
a white crescent moon slung
between the two hip points

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.170 align:middle line:84%
with the bowl of
the moon downward.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.840 align:middle line:90%


00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:16.886 align:middle line:84%
And the seed sound we'll use
here is "vaang," V-A-A-N-G.

00:04:16.886 --> 00:04:17.686 align:middle line:90%
Vaang.

00:04:17.686 --> 00:04:25.284 align:middle line:90%


00:04:25.284 --> 00:04:26.084 align:middle line:90%

00:04:32.694 --> 00:04:33.494 align:middle line:90%
Vaang.

00:04:33.494 --> 00:04:41.940 align:middle line:90%


00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:51.070 align:middle line:84%
Moving up to the navel, Manipuri
chakra, in the City of Jewels,

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.685 align:middle line:84%
in the seat of flame in
our body, of our fires.

00:04:55.685 --> 00:04:58.620 align:middle line:90%


00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Draw the mind to the navel
and feel your inner flame,

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.440 align:middle line:84%
your spark of passion,
your inspiration,

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.835 align:middle line:84%
the fire of your digestion,
your individual spark.

00:05:14.835 --> 00:05:18.280 align:middle line:90%


00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.930 align:middle line:84%

the sound "raang," R-A-A-N-G.

00:05:40.543 --> 00:05:41.343 align:middle line:90%
Raang.

00:05:41.343 --> 00:05:48.431 align:middle line:90%

00:05:57.119 --> 00:06:05.530 align:middle line:90%


00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:12.910 align:middle line:84%
Moving up to the space of
the heart, Anahata chakra,

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.100 align:middle line:90%
our heart center.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.880 align:middle line:90%


00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And this is a spacious,
airy center in the body,

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.930 align:middle line:84%
quite literally where
our lungs reside

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.805 align:middle line:90%
as the wings of our heart space.

00:06:26.805 --> 00:06:32.210 align:middle line:90%


00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:39.750 align:middle line:84%
At the heart, visualize, see,
or imagine a six-pointed green

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:45.450 align:middle line:84%
star, two interlaced
triangles, one pointing up,

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:48.270 align:middle line:90%
one pointing downward--

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:53.490 align:middle line:84%
the meeting place of the
upward flows and downward flows

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:57.810 align:middle line:84%
in the body, the meeting
place of the masculine

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:04.680 align:middle line:84%
and the feminine, of
transcendent consciousness

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.960 align:middle line:90%
and individualized awareness.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.530 align:middle line:90%


00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:21.923 align:middle line:84%

00:07:29.572 --> 00:07:30.372 align:middle line:90%
Yaang.

00:07:30.372 --> 00:07:37.027 align:middle line:90%

Moving up to the throat,
Vishuddha chakra,

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:57.810 align:middle line:84%
and the source of our
speech, the source of purity.

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:02.330 align:middle line:84%
Here, we'll imagine,
or see, or visualize

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:08.420 align:middle line:84%
a beautiful white, lunar
disc, a perfect round circle,

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:13.130 align:middle line:90%
flat and white, shining.

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:23.188 align:middle line:84%
We'll use the Bij mantra

00:08:23.188 --> 00:08:29.783 align:middle line:90%


00:08:29.783 --> 00:08:30.583 align:middle line:90%

00:08:36.192 --> 00:08:36.992 align:middle line:90%
Haang.

00:08:36.992 --> 00:08:41.429 align:middle line:90%


00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:46.770 align:middle line:84%
Moving to the Ajna chakra, the
third eye between the eyebrows

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:50.880 align:middle line:84%
and a bit up, our
connection to insight.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.650 align:middle line:90%


00:08:53.650 --> 00:09:00.070 align:middle line:84%
Here, imagine, see, or
visualize a golden triangle

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:01.120 align:middle line:90%
pointed downward.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.680 align:middle line:90%


00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:12.945 align:middle line:84%
Here, we'll use the Bij sound
ksham to awaken our intuition.

00:09:12.945 --> 00:09:13.745 align:middle line:90%
Ksham.

00:09:13.745 --> 00:09:19.328 align:middle line:90%


00:09:19.328 --> 00:09:20.128 align:middle line:90%
Ksham.

00:09:20.128 --> 00:09:25.220 align:middle line:90%

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:33.230 align:middle line:84%
And then moving up all
the way to the crown

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:40.760 align:middle line:84%
of the head, Sahasrara
chakra, imagining, or seeing,

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:45.380 align:middle line:84%
or visualizing a
flower with thousands

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:52.280 align:middle line:84%
upon thousands of petals gently
unfolding, feeling ourselves

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:59.320 align:middle line:84%
connect to our highest
source, our divinity.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:04.120 align:middle line:84%
We'll chant the
mantra "om" one time

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.360 align:middle line:90%
to complete our meditation.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.424 align:middle line:90%


00:10:09.424 --> 00:10:10.224 align:middle line:90%
Om.

00:10:10.224 --> 00:10:20.870 align:middle line:90%


00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And you can feel free to stay
in this meditative state for as

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:28.170 align:middle line:90%
long as you like.

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:28.970 align:middle line:90%
Namaste.

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:33.170 align:middle line:90%
