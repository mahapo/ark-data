00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.970 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to Thrive
Self-healing with Ayurveda.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.500 align:middle line:10%
My name is Justine Lemos, and
I am an Ayurvedic practitioner.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.990 align:middle line:90%
Ayurveda is the science of life.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.840 align:middle line:84%
It's a holistic form
of wellness that has

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.450 align:middle line:90%
its origins in ancient India.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.400 align:middle line:84%
In this video, I'm
going to share with you

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.880 align:middle line:84%
Ayurvedic rituals
for blissful sleep.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.150 align:middle line:84%
Most people agree that sleep is
a key to good health and health

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.290 align:middle line:90%
maintenance.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And in Ayurveda we
have an understanding

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.780 align:middle line:84%
of the cycles of the day
that allows us to attune

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.940 align:middle line:90%
our natural bio rhythms.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.420 align:middle line:84%
Sleep is foundational
to good health.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.460 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the
pillars of good health.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And yet so many people are
afflicted with poor sleep.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, in Ayurveda we
understand the cycle

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.230 align:middle line:84%
of the day in terms
of the three doshas.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.080 align:middle line:90%
These doshas are intelligences.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.730 align:middle line:84%
They are vata, which
is cold, dry, and fast.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.270 align:middle line:84%
Pitta, which is like
fire, is intense.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.780 align:middle line:84%
It's that which promotes
digestion in the body.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And kapha is like
earth and water.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.610 align:middle line:90%
It's heavy.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.510 align:middle line:90%
It's stable.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.920 align:middle line:90%
It's grounded.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.050 align:middle line:84%
Each segment of
the day or night is

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.600 align:middle line:90%
ruled by one of these doshas.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And that gives each segment of
the day a particular energy.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.970 align:middle line:84%
So times of day that are ruled
by what we call vata dosha,

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.860 align:middle line:84%
which is like air
and ether, are times

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.100 align:middle line:84%
of the day that are
very light and restless.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.010 align:middle line:84%
These are the times of the
day when the nervous system is

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.170 align:middle line:90%
naturally stimulated.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.330 align:middle line:84%
Vata rules the
early morning hours

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.190 align:middle line:84%
between 2:00 AM and 6:00 AM,
when sleep is naturally light.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.720 align:middle line:84%
It also rules in the daytime
from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.610 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever
worked in an office,

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.790 align:middle line:84%
you may notice that
the hours of 2:00

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.039 align:middle line:84%
PM to when people go home
is a time when people

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.410 align:middle line:90%
tend to chat or wander around.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.930 align:middle line:84%
Less work gets done often
than in the morning.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.700 align:middle line:84%
And the energy is different
than in the morning,

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.260 align:middle line:84%
which is ruled by pitta
dosha, which is like fire.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.900 align:middle line:84%
Times of the day that
are ruled by pitta dosha

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.430 align:middle line:84%
are when digestion
is at its highest.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.610 align:middle line:84%
In the daytime, this is when
our digestive fire is stronger.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.720 align:middle line:90%
So from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And then from 10:00 PM
to 2:00 AM in the night.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, you might notice that if
you stay up past around 11:00

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.970 align:middle line:90%
PM you get a second wind.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.620 align:middle line:90%
You might want a midnight snack.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.560 align:middle line:84%
You'll notice that your
body might start to rev up.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is actually working
against our natural biorhythms.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Because this is the time
when we should be digesting

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.870 align:middle line:90%
the experience of the day.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.670 align:middle line:84%
So kapha dosha, which is
heavy, like water and mud.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.560 align:middle line:90%
It's cold and wet.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And the times of the day
that are ruled by kapha dosha

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.360 align:middle line:90%
are slower moving.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.370 align:middle line:84%
Kapha dosha periods are
between 6:00 PM and 10:00 PM,

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.130 align:middle line:90%
and 6:00 AM and 10:00 AM.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.930 align:middle line:84%
Notice how the morning hours
are often cold and dewy.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.970 align:middle line:84%
We often feel slow
in the morning.

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.230 align:middle line:84%
This is because of the
energy of kapha dosha.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, healthy sleep
depends upon us

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.600 align:middle line:84%
working with our body's natural
rhythms throughout the day.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.740 align:middle line:84%
Insomnia is generally caused
by increased vata dosha,

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.720 align:middle line:84%
or pressure in the
nervous system.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And when vata dosha
is out of balance,

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.150 align:middle line:84%
this can create
difficulty falling asleep.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.360 align:middle line:84%
One key is to make sure that
the evening hours between 6:00

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.450 align:middle line:84%
PM and 10:00 PM, when kapha
dosha is ruling those hours

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.020 align:middle line:90%
should be settled and rounded.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.860 align:middle line:84%
Insomnia is also associated
with pitta imbalance,

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.510 align:middle line:84%
or what becomes the energy of
the liver becoming too heated.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.830 align:middle line:84%
This aggravated vata and
pitta can vitiate kapha,

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.920 align:middle line:90%
resulting in sleep disturbance.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, the most common
sleep disturbance

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:20.630 align:middle line:84%
associated with the
energy of the liver

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:26.270 align:middle line:84%
is in an early morning waking
between 2:00 AM and 4:00 AM.

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And all of these factors
can be causative in sleep

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.190 align:middle line:90%
disturbances.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.180 align:middle line:84%
Irregular routine,
mental, emotional stress,

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.650 align:middle line:84%
excessive mental or
physical activities,

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.650 align:middle line:90%
especially in the evening.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.500 align:middle line:84%
Pain in the body can
result in poor sleep.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.120 align:middle line:90%
Poor digestion.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.450 align:middle line:84%
Even excessive talking or
singing just before bed.

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.110 align:middle line:84%
A foundational practice for
rectifying sleep disturbances

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.690 align:middle line:84%
is the creation of a
soothing evening ritual.

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.820 align:middle line:84%
This sets ourselves up for
a night of blissful sleep.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.700 align:middle line:84%
I like to start my evening
ritual by doing a soothing

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.920 align:middle line:90%
practice of oil massage.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.330 align:middle line:84%
You can see my how to video on
Abhyanga, or daily oil massage,

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.510 align:middle line:84%
to get more information
on this soothing ritual.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.550 align:middle line:84%
If I don't have time to
massage my entire body,

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.740 align:middle line:90%
I might just do my feet.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.730 align:middle line:84%
And what's important is
that the oil is warm,

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:24.350 align:middle line:84%
and that you follow the oil
massage with a warm shower.

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.400 align:middle line:84%
Next I like to take about
3/4 of a cup of warm milk.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And in Ayurveda we
like to boil milk,

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.360 align:middle line:90%
because it changes its proteins.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And we add some spices to
make it more digestible.

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:38.570 align:middle line:84%
Two pinches of nutmeg
and a pinch of cardamom

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.940 align:middle line:90%
powder while we boil the milk.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.390 align:middle line:84%
This makes the boiled
milk more digestible.

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:46.790 align:middle line:84%
The cardamom helps
with digestion.

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.640 align:middle line:84%
And the nutmeg is
a sleep inducer.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.310 align:middle line:84%
We can also use a
dairy free milk.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.240 align:middle line:84%
But the milk provides a lot
of vitality to the body,

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.490 align:middle line:90%
and can help put us to sleep.

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And even if you think that you
can't take milk, cow's milk,

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.190 align:middle line:84%
goat milk, dairy, boiling the
milk and adding the spices

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.700 align:middle line:84%
makes it so much more digestible
that often people even who

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.820 align:middle line:84%
think they have a dairy
intolerance or lactose

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.030 align:middle line:84%
intolerance can
actually take some milk.

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.710 align:middle line:84%
By this time in
the evening, I like

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.380 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that all
my screens are off

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.510 align:middle line:84%
and that the lights
are set to low,

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.450 align:middle line:84%
or I'm just enjoying
candlelight.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:30.050 align:middle line:84%
It's also very important
that we reserve our beds just

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.780 align:middle line:84%
for sleep and for
lovemaking, because we're

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.200 align:middle line:90%
setting up our consciousness.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.710 align:middle line:90%
We're setting up our mind.

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.460 align:middle line:84%
We're telling our minds
that our bed is for sleep.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.030 align:middle line:84%
Our bed isn't for scrolling
through screens or watching TV.

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.870 align:middle line:84%
We want to associate our
beds with blissful sleep.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And activities like reading
and watching TV in bed

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.790 align:middle line:84%
can disturb our
biorhythms, and make

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:56.930 align:middle line:84%
it difficult to fall asleep,
and then to stay asleep.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.780 align:middle line:84%
While sipping on milk, it's
nice to listen to some very

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.140 align:middle line:90%
relaxing and peaceful music.

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:07.020 align:middle line:84%
I also like to place some drops
of essential oils in water.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.980 align:middle line:90%
And I place them by the bedside.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.020 align:middle line:84%
If you have pets, be
careful that the pets

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.190 align:middle line:90%
can't drink the water.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.020 align:middle line:84%
If you have difficulty
falling asleep,

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:19.210 align:middle line:84%
you could try essential oil
of sweet orange, or bergamot,

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.150 align:middle line:90%
or lavender essential oil.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.540 align:middle line:84%
If you have early morning
wakings, you could try rose,

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.840 align:middle line:84%
or Lang Lang, or
sandalwood essential oil.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.460 align:middle line:84%
There are some
great formulas that

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.730 align:middle line:84%
can be very useful in
calming the nervous system,

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:36.130 align:middle line:84%
and helping with
difficulty falling asleep,

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:39.070 align:middle line:84%
and helping with difficulty
in staying asleep.

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:41.440 align:middle line:84%
So you can talk to an
Ayurvedic practitioner

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.310 align:middle line:90%
about these herbal remedies.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:45.640 align:middle line:84%
But I also recommend that
you talk to your health care

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:49.850 align:middle line:84%
provider prior to starting
any other herbal formulas.

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:53.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can repeat this
video to be reminded

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:57.970 align:middle line:84%
about the cycles of the day,
about how to rectify difficulty

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:01.420 align:middle line:84%
falling asleep and
early morning wakings.

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.430 align:middle line:10%
You can explore the
rest of this series

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:06.400 align:middle line:10%
to learn more about
unique self-care tips

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.770 align:middle line:10%
and rituals for vital health.

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:10.840 align:middle line:84%
Empower yourself
with the knowledge

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.790 align:middle line:84%
to harmonize your
health and your life.

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:14.830 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy your rest.
