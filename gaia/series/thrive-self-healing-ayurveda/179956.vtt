>> When we look at
this truth of life,

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.660 align:middle line:84%
and we look at what it
takes in order to thrive,

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.310 align:middle line:84%
what we understand is that
if we're out of balance,

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.660 align:middle line:84%
out of tune with
our true nature,

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.230 align:middle line:84%
and we don't understand the laws
of nature that govern our life,

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.110 align:middle line:90%
then we become imbalanced.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.650 align:middle line:90%


00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.680 align:middle line:10%
Disconnection from
the flow of life,

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.220 align:middle line:10%
from the flow of life force,
from the flow of our energy--

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.970 align:middle line:10%
that is the set up for
disharmony and disease.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.950 align:middle line:10%


00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.820 align:middle line:10%
>> Disease in Ayurveda
is defined as imbalance

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.380 align:middle line:10%
in our doshas.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.400 align:middle line:84%
The imbalance is caused
with extraneous factors

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.650 align:middle line:90%
and intrinsic factors.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.920 align:middle line:10%
There could be
imbalances because

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.840 align:middle line:10%
of our genetic composition,
our genetic tendencies, that

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.990 align:middle line:10%
can be triggered
because of how we live,

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.480 align:middle line:10%
what we put in our body.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.360 align:middle line:10%


00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.430 align:middle line:10%
>> When people feel stuck in
their lives, in their bodies,

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.690 align:middle line:10%
on any of these
layers of the self,

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.060 align:middle line:10%
Ayurveda describes this
stuck physical matter

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.592 align:middle line:10%
in the digestive tract as ama.

00:01:39.592 --> 00:01:43.080 align:middle line:84%
Ama is the product of
anything that's undigested.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.460 align:middle line:10%
It is gunk factor that
accumulates on any

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.490 align:middle line:10%
of the layers of the self.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Ayurveda also has
this wonderful knowledge

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.220 align:middle line:90%
of digestion.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.050 align:middle line:84%
And so understanding digestion
doesn't just apply to food.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.570 align:middle line:90%
It applies to emotion.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.500 align:middle line:84%
It applies to everything that
we take in through the senses.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.100 align:middle line:90%
All of life gets metabolized.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And if we're able to do
that efficiently, if we're

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.650 align:middle line:84%
able to do that thoroughly,
then we have vibrancy.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.520 align:middle line:90%
If not, then we have stress.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.930 align:middle line:84%
The ancient sages understood
that consciousness comes out

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.030 align:middle line:84%
of this underlying unified
field in different frequencies.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And they had this
concept of blockages.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.970 align:middle line:84%
The free flow of that
intelligence and that energy,

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.950 align:middle line:84%
if it gets blocked, that is
what we call ama in Ayurveda.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.740 align:middle line:84%
The blockages can be on any
level, from the spiritual,

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.620 align:middle line:84%
to the mental blocks,
to the emotional blocks,

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.050 align:middle line:84%
energetic blocks, to
the physical blocks.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And those will
affect, ultimately,

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.750 align:middle line:84%
that perfect expression
of our physiology

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.600 align:middle line:84%
that we were designed
to be manifesting.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.740 align:middle line:84%
So ama are those
blockages that will

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.620 align:middle line:84%
get in the way of us manifesting
that perfect physiology,

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.770 align:middle line:84%
that perfect wholeness
into our life.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.810 align:middle line:90%


00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.410 align:middle line:84%
>> So we can talk about ama,
which will be undigested food

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.540 align:middle line:90%
in the digestive tract.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.750 align:middle line:84%
It travels throughout the
body on the blood stream.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.540 align:middle line:84%
It gets lodged in
places in the body.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.830 align:middle line:84%
And it creates chronic
illness and chronic pain.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.010 align:middle line:84%
>> The first stage of the
disease is accumulation

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.900 align:middle line:90%
of toxins.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.590 align:middle line:90%
That will increase, vitiate.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.220 align:middle line:90%
We call it vitiation.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And then it flows into
the areas of your body

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.110 align:middle line:84%
where you have
the weakest links.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.940 align:middle line:84%
And once it flows to those
areas, there is stagnation.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.242 align:middle line:84%
And then there is
manifestation of a disease.

00:03:52.242 --> 00:03:54.270 align:middle line:84%
>> The doshas-- from an
Ayurveda perspective,

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.560 align:middle line:84%
we look at them in terms
of five elementals, right?

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's when they
become imbalanced--

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.440 align:middle line:84%
they like to find weakened
tissues and take up residence.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we'll
see physical symptom come

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.620 align:middle line:90%
about inside the body.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.490 align:middle line:10%
Too much water element,
we'll see edema, swelling.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.600 align:middle line:10%
Too much earth element, we'll
see blockage, not enough flow,

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.640 align:middle line:10%
and the creation of a
growth-- like a cyst, a tumor,

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.440 align:middle line:10%
or cancer.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.890 align:middle line:90%


00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Likewise, we can also
have undigested emotion.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And that will cause
us a lot of pain.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.170 align:middle line:84%
As we repress those emotions, we
don't deal with those emotions,

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.420 align:middle line:90%
we can have undigested stress.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.670 align:middle line:90%
We can have undigested thought.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:45.050 align:middle line:10%
So while we want to take
measures to strengthen

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.540 align:middle line:10%
our physical
digestion, we also want

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.860 align:middle line:10%
to take measures to
strengthen emotional digestion

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.340 align:middle line:10%
and mental digestion.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:58.130 align:middle line:84%
So this is why meditation is
such a key aspect to Ayurveda

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.040 align:middle line:90%
as a holistic science.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.040 align:middle line:84%
>> So in what way
does diet, yoga,

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.980 align:middle line:84%
and meditation help to take care
of this thing in Ayurveda we

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.500 align:middle line:90%
call ama?

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:16.680 align:middle line:84%
A lot of ama, or blockage in
the flow, begins energetically.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.850 align:middle line:84%
So if we're fine-tuning
with yogic and meditation

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.980 align:middle line:84%
techniques, our inner
core frequency--

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.800 align:middle line:84%
meaning our nervous system
and the state of the mind--

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.220 align:middle line:84%
being able to shed
and release emotions

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.970 align:middle line:84%
that we don't need to carry on,
that are not beneficial for us,

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.060 align:middle line:84%
and then tune in
with proper diet.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.680 align:middle line:84%
These three things,
very much so,

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.720 align:middle line:84%
help to regulate ama production
in the body and proper disposal

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.520 align:middle line:90%
of it.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.070 align:middle line:90%


00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.410 align:middle line:84%
One of the beautiful things
of just doing simple Sun

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.710 align:middle line:84%
Salutations is that it
squeezes every muscle

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.320 align:middle line:84%
in your entire body,
which squeezes and moves

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.780 align:middle line:84%
the lymphatic system
inside the body.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.330 align:middle line:84%
We have this beautiful heart
inside of us which pulses.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And with each pulse,
blood gets driven

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:00.840 align:middle line:90%
throughout the entire body.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.440 align:middle line:84%
But the lymphatic
system is something

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.580 align:middle line:84%
that needs to be
squeezed and pumped.

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.830 align:middle line:84%
>> It's on the
level of meditation,

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.990 align:middle line:84%
which in Ayurvedic terms, is
connecting directly to source.

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.020 align:middle line:10%
It is something that
allows us to release

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.270 align:middle line:10%
a lot of the egoic
patterning that

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:25.940 align:middle line:10%
can serve as frequent triggers
for stressful reactions.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.730 align:middle line:84%
And so that direct
connection to source

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:33.820 align:middle line:84%
creates for us this
thing that we call ojas.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:37.410 align:middle line:84%
Ojas is that liveliness,
that glow of health

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.500 align:middle line:84%
that comes when we have that
connection, when we're strongly

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.790 align:middle line:84%
connected to our life
force and into our source.

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:48.810 align:middle line:10%
So ultimately, ojas
is an expression

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:53.160 align:middle line:10%
that comes to the
physiology from the highest

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.030 align:middle line:10%
level of our existence.

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:58.950 align:middle line:84%
So we have, then, really
three imperatives for health.

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:01.860 align:middle line:84%
Our connection to
source has to be strong.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.840 align:middle line:90%
There has to be no blockages.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.150 align:middle line:10%
And we have to have
balance, in terms

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.410 align:middle line:10%
of how that energy expresses
itself in the physiology.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:13.260 align:middle line:90%


00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:18.030 align:middle line:84%
>> So in our innermost self,
the self that is most connected

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:22.650 align:middle line:84%
and closest to consciousness,
is our body of bliss.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:27.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is really the
closest to our true self.

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:33.135 align:middle line:84%
And for us to be truly healthy,
truly well in a holistic way,

00:07:33.135 --> 00:07:36.300 align:middle line:84%
the light that is
consciousness shines

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.600 align:middle line:84%
through all of these
layers of ourselves--

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.170 align:middle line:84%
through our bliss body,
through our karmic body,

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:46.200 align:middle line:84%
through our mental
perceptive body,

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:50.890 align:middle line:84%
through our energetic body,
and into our physical body.

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:56.860 align:middle line:84%
The state of bliss
is a state of truth.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:01.800 align:middle line:84%
It's not just an over-layering
of false positivity

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:05.580 align:middle line:90%
or a grasping of happiness.

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:09.840 align:middle line:84%
It's when experience
and emotion and food

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.080 align:middle line:90%
is all metabolized and digested.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And the product
of that digestion

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:21.060 align:middle line:84%
on all the layers of the
self is this deep state

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:25.380 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, of alignment,
of truth, and of, we could say,

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.930 align:middle line:84%
light shining through
an individual.

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:32.559 align:middle line:90%


00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:34.250 align:middle line:84%
>> From an Ayurvedic
perspective,

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:37.520 align:middle line:84%
feeling vital health inside
your body in balance--

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.340 align:middle line:90%
what does that look like?

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:43.400 align:middle line:84%
Waking up and feeling
energetic and not

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:47.450 align:middle line:84%
sluggish in the morning,
that's a big piece.

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:50.030 align:middle line:84%
Being able to step
into your day feeling

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:55.100 align:middle line:84%
grounded into your body,
and not in an anxious place,

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:58.430 align:middle line:84%
feeling really positive
inside yourself.

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:03.140 align:middle line:84%
Your energetics throughout the
day, ideally, are sustained.

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:08.420 align:middle line:84%
And your mental state is
in a beautiful place--

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:12.350 align:middle line:84%
not to focus on negative
thought patterns

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:18.220 align:middle line:84%
and being more in
service to the world.

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:21.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Vitality in Ayurveda
is called prana.

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:24.430 align:middle line:84%
So when we are depleted
in our vitality,

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:26.710 align:middle line:84%
we just cannot
function properly.

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:30.610 align:middle line:84%
We experience symptoms like
fatigue, lack of energy,

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:33.290 align:middle line:84%
and just not motivated
to do anything.

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And the way in Ayurveda is to
boost or vitality or our prana.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:44.140 align:middle line:84%
We can do that by getting the
right amount of sleep every day

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:49.410 align:middle line:84%
and by eating healthy
foods, and also by being

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:52.800 align:middle line:90%
in sync with the nature.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.960 align:middle line:90%
That's very important.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.070 align:middle line:84%
Waking up early
morning and meditating

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:01.020 align:middle line:84%
as soon as we get
out of our bed,

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:04.050 align:middle line:90%
we actually salute mother Earth.

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:07.770 align:middle line:90%
And then we cleanse ourself.

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And when we cleanse ourself,
we appreciate who they are.

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And we also appreciate
the divine within us.

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:19.720 align:middle line:90%


00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:25.600 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that we
encourage patients and clients

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:29.650 align:middle line:84%
to do is to use their intuition,
be able to become sensitive

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:33.820 align:middle line:84%
to what it is that's happening
within the physiology.

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:36.220 align:middle line:84%
So it's one thing to
have general guidelines.

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:39.910 align:middle line:84%
It's another thing to
have that consciousness.

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:43.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Right from childhood, we
are all nothing but conditioned

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:45.040 align:middle line:90%
beings.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.010 align:middle line:84%
So it is how we want
to condition ourselves.

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:50.020 align:middle line:84%
Do we want to be
conditioned to chaos that's

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:51.610 align:middle line:90%
going to create imbalance?

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:54.190 align:middle line:84%
Or do we want to be
conditioned to being

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:58.690 align:middle line:84%
with the rhythm of nature and in
harmony with our body and mind?

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:02.370 align:middle line:84%
That is a question that
we need to ask ourselves.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.960 align:middle line:84%
And when we do that,
it's OK to take time.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.320 align:middle line:90%
And this is lunchtime.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:12.280 align:middle line:84%
It is my personal time
with my food, which

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:16.660 align:middle line:84%
is going to help me
increase my vitality

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:21.010 align:middle line:84%
and fill me up with this
energy that I need to perform.

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:24.070 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be very
effective in whatever

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:27.370 align:middle line:84%
you do if you increase
your vitality,

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:30.370 align:middle line:84%
and to also focus
on your breath.

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:32.410 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we are
put in situations

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:34.810 align:middle line:84%
that we have to work
hard these days,

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:38.140 align:middle line:84%
and we have to
over-work ourselves.

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:40.280 align:middle line:90%
Watch how you are breathing.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.710 align:middle line:84%
You will notice,
when you're going

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:46.630 align:middle line:84%
through these type of emotions
your breath becomes shallow,

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:50.170 align:middle line:84%
and the types of thoughts
you're engaged in.

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:51.250 align:middle line:90%
Take a break.

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:52.510 align:middle line:90%
Break the circuit.

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:55.330 align:middle line:84%
Create that space between
you and your thoughts.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And anchor yourself
with your breath.

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:03.130 align:middle line:84%
When you do that every day
for about even 10 minutes,

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:05.410 align:middle line:90%
there is a big difference.

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:09.330 align:middle line:84%
If you have to go to work,
you cannot find time,

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:12.420 align:middle line:84%
sit in your car in the
parking lot and do it.

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:16.810 align:middle line:84%
You will be only with yourself
there, before you go to work.

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:19.670 align:middle line:84%
If you have to face
a stressful day

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:23.380 align:middle line:84%
or if you have to face that
boss who you don't like,

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:27.475 align:middle line:84%
get into that quiet space
first before you go.

00:12:27.475 --> 00:12:31.190 align:middle line:84%
You're going to feel
a whole lot better.

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:34.180 align:middle line:84%
How can you run a car
without gas, right?

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:38.470 align:middle line:84%
So vitality is nothing
but the gas, the energy,

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:40.660 align:middle line:84%
the battery that
we need to charge

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:44.160 align:middle line:84%
to function the way we need
to function, optimally,

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.700 align:middle line:90%
and produce real good effects.

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:50.195 align:middle line:90%


00:12:50.195 --> 00:12:52.320 align:middle line:84%
>> This is why consciousness
and its development is

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.390 align:middle line:90%
so fundamental in Ayurveda.

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:56.860 align:middle line:10%
With that enhanced
awareness, we can

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:59.260 align:middle line:10%
listen to the
intelligence of the body

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.620 align:middle line:10%
and know what qualities
it is calling for,

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:05.500 align:middle line:10%
what diet it needs,
and therefore

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:13.780 align:middle line:10%
empower ourselves with a diet
that is truly uniquely ours.

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:18.040 align:middle line:84%
>> When it comes to food
and accessing more radiance,

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:22.570 align:middle line:84%
more prana, more vitality,
more life energy,

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:26.080 align:middle line:84%
we often say that the
consciousness of the cook is

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.940 align:middle line:90%
the most important ingredient.

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:32.710 align:middle line:84%
Of course, beyond that, we
want to eat consciously,

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:35.800 align:middle line:84%
because that allows
us to digest food.

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And digested food will create
more liveliness, more vitality

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.230 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:47.870 align:middle line:84%
>> So the idea is to choose
foods and lifestyle activities

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:50.390 align:middle line:84%
that align you with your
natural constitution.

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And if we live by
these rules, usually we

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:56.510 align:middle line:84%
don't stray too much to be
creating an excess amount

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:58.620 align:middle line:90%
of ama in the body.

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:02.330 align:middle line:84%
>> When your vitality is
high, you're energized.

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:09.170 align:middle line:84%
You're really high, motivated,
happy, joyful, positive,

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:11.300 align:middle line:90%
healthy.

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.310 align:middle line:90%
And you flow.

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:15.200 align:middle line:90%
You flow.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.090 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is an obstacle.

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:19.490 align:middle line:90%
You're not stressed.

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:21.890 align:middle line:84%
That is why it becomes
very important for us

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:26.140 align:middle line:84%
to know our constitution
and to keep it in balance.

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:28.550 align:middle line:84%
Our body is like a
temple, and how you

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:31.090 align:middle line:90%
want to treat that is up to us.

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:35.190 align:middle line:90%
