00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.300 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.855 align:middle line:84%
>> Come into a nice
upright seated posture.

00:00:14.855 --> 00:00:16.230 align:middle line:10%
And before we
close our eyes, I'm

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.280 align:middle line:10%
just going to show
you what we're going

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.609 align:middle line:10%
to be doing with our hands.

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:20.400 align:middle line:10%
We're going to be
practicing Nadi Shodhana,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.140 align:middle line:10%
alternate nostril breathing.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.910 align:middle line:84%
And to do that, we're
going to take Vishnu

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.380 align:middle line:90%
Mudra in your right hand.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.880 align:middle line:84%
Here I'm using my
left, but you're

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.710 align:middle line:84%
going to be using my right,
so I'm just mirroring you.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.774 align:middle line:84%
We're going to block your
right nostril with your thumb

00:00:32.774 --> 00:00:35.190 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to block your
left nostril with these two

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.090 align:middle line:90%
fingers.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.280 align:middle line:84%
Your left hand is going
to come into Chin Mudra,

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.360 align:middle line:84%
these two fingers
together palm up.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.160 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.980 align:middle line:90%
So now we can close our eyes.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:54.480 align:middle line:10%
Sit up nice and tall,
soften your belly,

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.430 align:middle line:10%
and just begin with
three very long,

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.180 align:middle line:10%
slow balanced breaths into
your abdomen expanding out.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.960 align:middle line:90%


00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.250 align:middle line:90%
Even exhale.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.570 align:middle line:90%
Gently draw your navel in.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.300 align:middle line:90%


00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And as you do this,
just taking notice.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.600 align:middle line:84%
Is your right nostril or your
left nostril a little bit

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.400 align:middle line:90%
more open?

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.350 align:middle line:90%


00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:29.710 align:middle line:84%
Just bringing awareness to your
nasal passages as you slowly,

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.770 align:middle line:84%
equally breathe in and
out through the nose.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.320 align:middle line:90%


00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.120 align:middle line:90%
Nice.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.910 align:middle line:84%
One last long breath in
through both nostrils.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.220 align:middle line:90%
Let the belly expand out.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.340 align:middle line:90%


00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.140 align:middle line:90%
Exhale.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.230 align:middle line:84%
Gently draw the navel in,
completely emptying the lungs.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.080 align:middle line:84%
We always begin and end
with the left nostril.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.350 align:middle line:84%
So blocking your right
nostril, inhale slowly

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.710 align:middle line:84%
in through the left
for five, block

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.945 align:middle line:90%
left, exhale right for five.

00:02:04.945 --> 00:02:11.120 align:middle line:90%


00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.295 align:middle line:90%
Inhale right five.

00:02:12.295 --> 00:02:18.560 align:middle line:90%


00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.580 align:middle line:90%
Block right.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.800 align:middle line:90%
Exhale left five.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:28.680 align:middle line:90%


00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.155 align:middle line:90%
Inhale left five.

00:02:30.155 --> 00:02:36.970 align:middle line:90%


00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.120 align:middle line:90%
Block left.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.870 align:middle line:90%
Exhale right five.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:48.340 align:middle line:90%


00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.755 align:middle line:90%
Inhale right five.

00:02:49.755 --> 00:02:56.860 align:middle line:90%


00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:57.900 align:middle line:90%
Block right.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.385 align:middle line:90%
Exhale left five.

00:02:59.385 --> 00:03:07.270 align:middle line:90%


00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.600 align:middle line:90%
Inhale left five.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.830 align:middle line:90%


00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.210 align:middle line:90%
Block left.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.750 align:middle line:90%
Exhale right five.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:26.570 align:middle line:90%


00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:27.605 align:middle line:90%
Inhale right five.

00:03:27.605 --> 00:03:34.280 align:middle line:90%


00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.150 align:middle line:90%
Block right.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.620 align:middle line:90%
Exhale left five.

Block left.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:55.700 align:middle line:90%
Exhale right five.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:04.100 align:middle line:90%


00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.230 align:middle line:90%
Inhale right five.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:11.320 align:middle line:90%


00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.130 align:middle line:90%
Block right.

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.390 align:middle line:90%
Exhale left five.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:21.670 align:middle line:90%


00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:22.860 align:middle line:90%
Inhale left five.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:30.970 align:middle line:90%

Inhale right five.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:48.650 align:middle line:90%


00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:49.470 align:middle line:90%
Block right.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:50.815 align:middle line:90%
Exhale left five.

00:04:50.815 --> 00:04:58.160 align:middle line:90%


00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.285 align:middle line:90%
Inhale left five.

00:04:59.285 --> 00:05:06.950 align:middle line:90%


00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:07.820 align:middle line:90%
Block left.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.075 align:middle line:90%
Exhale right five.

00:05:09.075 --> 00:05:17.020 align:middle line:90%


00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.180 align:middle line:90%
Inhale right five.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:25.250 align:middle line:90%


00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.290 align:middle line:90%
Block right.

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:27.455 align:middle line:90%
Exhale left five.

00:05:27.455 --> 00:05:36.240 align:middle line:90%


00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.365 align:middle line:90%
Inhale left five.

00:05:37.365 --> 00:05:43.970 align:middle line:90%


00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.150 align:middle line:90%
Block left.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.460 align:middle line:90%
Exhale right five.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:53.920 align:middle line:90%


00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.910 align:middle line:90%
Block right.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.325 align:middle line:90%
Exhale left five.

00:05:57.325 --> 00:05:59.870 align:middle line:90%


00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.570 align:middle line:84%
So now I'd like you to
continue on for three more

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:03.980 align:middle line:90%
rounds on your own.

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.080 align:middle line:90%
Inhale left.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.370 align:middle line:90%
Five counts each.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:32.360 align:middle line:90%


00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.450 align:middle line:90%
That should be one round.

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.070 align:middle line:84%
One round is completing both
sides beginning and ending

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.870 align:middle line:90%
on the left.

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:37.670 align:middle line:90%
Round two.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:07:07.070 align:middle line:90%


00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.495 align:middle line:84%
Should be starting the
third and final round.

00:07:09.495 --> 00:07:38.290 align:middle line:90%


00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:45.300 align:middle line:10%
Exhaling everything out of your
left nostril, keeping your eyes

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.810 align:middle line:10%
closed, slowly lower
the right hand down,

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:52.820 align:middle line:10%
same index finger and thumb
together, palms facing up.

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:56.530 align:middle line:90%


00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to just come into
total stillness for one minute.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:02.860 align:middle line:90%


00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:08.990 align:middle line:10%
And with your
abdomen super soft,

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:12.290 align:middle line:10%
I want you to just lift
your chest up two degrees,

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.125 align:middle line:10%
so just feeling
the sternum rise.

00:08:14.125 --> 00:08:18.080 align:middle line:90%


00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.420 align:middle line:10%
And then now bow your
chin towards your heart

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:25.100 align:middle line:10%
two degrees so you feel
the back of your neck

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.440 align:middle line:10%
slightly lengthen up.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:47.340 align:middle line:90%


00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:49.575 align:middle line:90%
Stillness in the whole body.

00:08:49.575 --> 00:08:52.320 align:middle line:90%


00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.570 align:middle line:10%
Slowly slide the
tip of your tongue

00:08:54.570 --> 00:09:00.570 align:middle line:10%
along the roof of your mouth
along the smooth, soft palate

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:03.990 align:middle line:10%
until you feel the rough edge.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:05.910 align:middle line:10%
And when you feel
that rough edge,

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:09.450 align:middle line:10%
you've gone a
little bit too far.

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:16.020 align:middle line:10%
Bring it back to just
that final smooth edge,

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:19.260 align:middle line:10%
very gently pressing there.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.360 align:middle line:10%
This is known as Kechari Mudra.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:29.700 align:middle line:90%


00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:37.380 align:middle line:10%
Now breathing in, sense
a column of energy,

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:41.400 align:middle line:10%
of flow coming in through
the crown of your head

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:46.740 align:middle line:10%
as you inhale, building
and gathering just

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:47.910 align:middle line:10%
above the navel center.

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:50.560 align:middle line:10%


00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:55.070 align:middle line:10%
Visualize this as a
white violet light.

00:09:55.070 --> 00:10:00.360 align:middle line:90%


00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And as you exhale, I want you
to visualize a column stream

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:12.060 align:middle line:84%
flow of energy coming up from
the bottom tip of the tailbone

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:17.520 align:middle line:84%
up to the same space just
above the navel center.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And visualize it as a
white reddish light.

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:30.150 align:middle line:84%
The union of red inhaling coming
down to the crown of the head,

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:36.270 align:middle line:84%
purple violet white light
building and gathering

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:38.730 align:middle line:84%
as you inhale just
above the navel.

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:41.890 align:middle line:90%


00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:47.260 align:middle line:84%
Exhale from the tailbone
up, reddish white light up

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:51.340 align:middle line:84%
from the tail bone
building and gathering just

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:54.360 align:middle line:90%
above the navel center.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And we'll continue with
this union of breath.

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:02.810 align:middle line:84%
Inhale and exhale purplish
white light coming

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:10.800 align:middle line:84%
in through the crown on the
inhale, reddish white light

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:16.140 align:middle line:84%
coming up from the
tailbone on the exhale.

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:17.740 align:middle line:90%
Continuing on your own.

00:11:17.740 --> 00:12:40.450 align:middle line:90%


00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:48.040 align:middle line:10%
Bowing your chin all the way
down in towards the chest,

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.295 align:middle line:10%
take a slow breath
in through your nose.

00:12:50.295 --> 00:12:53.070 align:middle line:10%


00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:55.360 align:middle line:10%
And like you're fogging
a piece of glass,

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:58.120 align:middle line:10%
exhale softly out the mouth,
bringing your hands together

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:05.390 align:middle line:10%
at the heart center and
slowly opening your eyes.

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:27.552 align:middle line:90%
