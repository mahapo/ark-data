00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:16.720 align:middle line:90%
[SHORT MUSICAL SOUND]

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Namaste, and
welcome to "Thrive,

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.870 align:middle line:90%
Self-healing with Ayurveda."

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.210 align:middle line:10%
In this video, I'm
going to share with you

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.690 align:middle line:10%
several ways that we
can understand our body

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.540 align:middle line:10%
and its state of
balance and imbalance.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.150 align:middle line:84%
Our body is
constantly offering us

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.380 align:middle line:84%
signs that when we read them,
we can understand so much

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.120 align:middle line:84%
about what is going
on in our bodies,

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.160 align:middle line:84%
even prior to developing
symptoms of any disease

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.350 align:middle line:90%
or imbalance.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.040 align:middle line:10%
Ayurveda is a holistic
system of wellness that has

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.260 align:middle line:10%
its origins in ancient India.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.870 align:middle line:84%
But it really has
universal application.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.510 align:middle line:84%
In Ayurveda, we
postulate that there

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.060 align:middle line:90%
are three primary energies.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.510 align:middle line:84%
These are vata,
pitta, and kapha.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.170 align:middle line:84%
These we call the doshas,
which really means "defect."

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.150 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about
doshas, it means the way

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.120 align:middle line:84%
that we are defected
from original source.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.660 align:middle line:84%
And each of us has a
predominance of one

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.640 align:middle line:84%
or maybe more than one of these
doshas in our constitution.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And then throughout
life, because

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.620 align:middle line:84%
of stresses, impacts,
choices, we all

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.950 align:middle line:84%
deviate from our
constitution into states

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.830 align:middle line:84%
of relative imbalance
and balance.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And so in this video, I'm
going to share with you how

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.510 align:middle line:84%
we can read the
signs of the body

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.050 align:middle line:84%
to determine our relative
state of well-being.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And the first area that I'll
talk about is our tongues.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you go to the
mirror with a bright light

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.224 align:middle line:84%
and stick out your
tongue, let it be relaxed.

00:01:49.224 --> 00:01:51.390 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people get really
tense with their tongue,

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.515 align:middle line:84%
and you actually won't see
what you want to see so.

00:01:53.515 --> 00:01:55.770 align:middle line:84%
Let your tongue
relax and just take

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.690 align:middle line:90%
note of what you're seeing.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.210 align:middle line:84%
So first, what is the
shape of your tongue?

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.410 align:middle line:84%
Is it long, short,
swollen, or very narrow?

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.750 align:middle line:84%
All of this will
give us information

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.110 align:middle line:84%
about what is going on
in the body, especially

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.730 align:middle line:90%
in the digestive track.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.610 align:middle line:84%
The tongue is the end
of the whole snake

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.030 align:middle line:90%
of the digestive tract.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.360 align:middle line:84%
And so by reading the tongue,
we can find out what's

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.850 align:middle line:90%
going on inside your digestion.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And then we can take
measures to rectify

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.600 align:middle line:90%
any imbalance that's there.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.680 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, let's look at
what color the tongue is.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.780 align:middle line:90%
Is it red, more white?

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.250 align:middle line:90%
Are there parts that are yellow?

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.730 align:middle line:84%
Are there even parts that
are dark or purple or black?

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.680 align:middle line:84%
Are there areas
that are cracked?

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.240 align:middle line:90%
This is really common.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.950 align:middle line:90%
Is your tongue coated?

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.810 align:middle line:90%
Is the coating very thick?

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.110 align:middle line:84%
Can you remove that coating
with a tongue scraper?

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.730 align:middle line:84%
Each of these
signs in the tongue

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.780 align:middle line:84%
tells us a lot of information
about the state of the body.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And when we assess
our tongues, we

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.960 align:middle line:84%
can begin to understand
the doshas inside

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.000 align:middle line:90%
of our own individuality.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.790 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk a little
bit more about the doshas.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Vata dosha is likened
to air and ether.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:07.920 align:middle line:90%
It's very light.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.690 align:middle line:90%
It's very dry.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And we can see vata
dosha in our tongues

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.510 align:middle line:84%
by the cracks and the
divots in the tongue.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.440 align:middle line:84%
So vata in the tongue
will indicate dryness

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.900 align:middle line:84%
in our digestive tracks
and in our bodies.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.580 align:middle line:84%
So a long, central crack
down the center of the tongue

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.310 align:middle line:84%
indicates a lot of
vata dosha in the body,

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.430 align:middle line:90%
especially in the colon.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And when I see this long crack
down the center of someone's

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.700 align:middle line:84%
tongue, I almost always
can ask them, hey,

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.700 align:middle line:84%
do you suffer from constipation
or anxiety, headaches, or even

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:45.870 align:middle line:90%
IBS?

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And somebody will
always ask me, hey,

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.020 align:middle line:90%
how do you know that about me?

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.567 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just
looking at the crack

00:03:50.567 --> 00:03:51.900 align:middle line:90%
down the center of their tongue.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.280 align:middle line:90%
It's really simple.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And I almost always
see this trait

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.170 align:middle line:84%
in people who drink
a lot of coffee

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.300 align:middle line:90%
because coffee is very bitter.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And the bitter taste transmits
so much dryness, especially

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.980 align:middle line:90%
to the colon.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.560 align:middle line:10%
So also, a tongue that's
very long and narrow

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.580 align:middle line:10%
demonstrates a lot of
vata dosha in the body.

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.620 align:middle line:84%
Also, if you stick out
your tongue, relax it,

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.930 align:middle line:84%
and it starts to
shake or tremor,

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.480 align:middle line:84%
that tremoring, again, is
vata dosha in the body.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.940 align:middle line:10%
If you're seeing a lot of signs
of vata dosha on your tongue,

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.960 align:middle line:10%
you would want to use the vata
churnas, or spice mixtures,

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.380 align:middle line:10%
that I talked to you about
in the video on vata spice

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:40.450 align:middle line:10%
mixtures, or vata chutney to
soothe and tame vata dosha.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.120 align:middle line:90%
Now pitta dosha is like fire.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.790 align:middle line:90%
It's very hot and intense.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:51.010 align:middle line:84%
And we'll see signs of pitta
dosha accumulating in the body,

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.570 align:middle line:84%
especially in a red color
on the sides of the tongue.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And especially if
we see the red color

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.310 align:middle line:84%
on the sides of the
tongue, this is a sign

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.340 align:middle line:84%
that the energy of
our liver, especially,

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.380 align:middle line:84%
which is ruled by
pitta dosha, is

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.050 align:middle line:90%
becoming very hot or inflamed.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And when the energy
of the liver is hot,

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.550 align:middle line:84%
we can experience irritability,
hot flashes, night sweats,

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.690 align:middle line:84%
early morning wakings between
the hours of 2:00 and 4:00 AM.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.470 align:middle line:84%
So if your tongue is very
deep red or red on the sides,

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.770 align:middle line:90%
you'll want to cool things down.

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.470 align:middle line:84%
You'll want to
decrease pitta dosha.

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.920 align:middle line:10%
And cilantro is
especially useful in this,

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.920 align:middle line:10%
as is the pitta chutney that I
offered in the chutney cooking

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.720 align:middle line:10%
video.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.780 align:middle line:10%
This is a very,
very cooling chutney

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.330 align:middle line:10%
that is used with your food.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.760 align:middle line:10%
I often give people with
early morning wakings or night

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.560 align:middle line:10%
sweats, hot flashes--

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.230 align:middle line:10%
I just have them
use pitta chutney,

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.620 align:middle line:10%
and they see a large
decrease in the symptoms

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.530 align:middle line:10%
that they're experiencing
because it's so cooling.

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, you'll see the
third dosha, which

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.070 align:middle line:84%
is called kapha dosha,
on the tongue reflected

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.820 align:middle line:84%
in areas of the tongue
that might be swollen.

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.030 align:middle line:84%
Kapha dosha is like
water and earth.

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.290 align:middle line:90%
It's heavy.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.990 align:middle line:90%
It is hard to move.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.840 align:middle line:10%
And so if you see
swelling in the tongue,

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.380 align:middle line:10%
you might experience
kapha aggravation

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:27.820 align:middle line:10%
in the form of water retention,
in terms of swelling,

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.987 align:middle line:10%
in terms of brain fog.

00:06:29.987 --> 00:06:31.570 align:middle line:10%
And so in this case,
you'd want to use

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:34.510 align:middle line:10%
kapha churna in your
food and kapha chutney

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.070 align:middle line:10%
to regain balance.

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, another thing
that's very important

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:43.560 align:middle line:84%
to look at in your tongue is
the coating of your tongue.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.510 align:middle line:84%
A very thick white
coating indicates

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:50.930 align:middle line:84%
what we call ama, or metabolic
waste in the digestive tract.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:54.190 align:middle line:90%
This is gunk that is undigested.

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And in Ayurveda, we consider ama
to be the product of anything

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.240 align:middle line:90%
that is an digested.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.610 align:middle line:84%
Ama obstructs the flow
of energy in the body

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:07.340 align:middle line:84%
and is the root cause of
many, many types of diseases.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.100 align:middle line:84%
So we'll always
want to take note

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.470 align:middle line:84%
if ama is accumulating
in the body.

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:16.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, that thick, white,
fuzzy coating on the tongue

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.700 align:middle line:90%
is especially indicative of ama.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And we can loosen
and eliminate ama

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.340 align:middle line:84%
very simply through
sipping on hot water

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.770 align:middle line:84%
about every 20 minutes
throughout the day.

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.380 align:middle line:84%
We just take a few
sips of hot water.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And this begins to stimulate the
tongue and the digestive tract.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And this helps the
body eliminate ama.

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:39.760 align:middle line:10%
Every area of the tongue
reflects a different organ

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:40.690 align:middle line:10%
of the body.

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:44.320 align:middle line:10%
So the tip of the tongue relates
to the energy of the heart.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.140 align:middle line:10%
The sides of the tongue relate
to the energy of the gall

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.030 align:middle line:10%
bladder and the liver.

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:51.880 align:middle line:10%
And then the center
of the tongue

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:55.700 align:middle line:10%
relates to the stomach
and the small intestine.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:08:00.340 align:middle line:10%
So we can read the tongue
as a map of our physiology.

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:02.920 align:middle line:84%
We're always carrying
around with us

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.380 align:middle line:84%
inside our mouth
something that we

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.720 align:middle line:84%
can read to tell
us what's going on

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:12.320 align:middle line:84%
in all of our internal
organs that we can't see.

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And modern medical
science would have

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:16.660 align:middle line:84%
to take a picture of
our insides to get

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.010 align:middle line:90%
this kind of information.

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:21.970 align:middle line:10%
We can just read our tongue
and learn so much about what's

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:24.050 align:middle line:10%
going on in our bodies.

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:27.640 align:middle line:10%
The back of our tongue
relates to the energy

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.400 align:middle line:10%
of the large intestine.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.330 align:middle line:10%
And the sides of the back of the
tongue really to the kidneys.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:39.220 align:middle line:10%
An Ayurvedic practitioner can
do a very thorough examination

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:42.340 align:middle line:10%
of the tongue and determine
which herbal remedies might

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:46.450 align:middle line:10%
be most appropriate for you,
other dietary advice, aroma

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:49.150 align:middle line:10%
therapy, so many
different remedies.

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.450 align:middle line:84%
We actually look at hundreds
of signs in the tongue

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:54.310 align:middle line:90%
and can get very specific.

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:57.460 align:middle line:84%
However, in general,
red indicates

00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:59.830 align:middle line:90%
an excess of pitta dosha.

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:03.370 align:middle line:84%
Purple and cracking
indicates vata dosha.

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:06.070 align:middle line:90%
Swelling indicates kapha dosha.

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And ama is indicated by a
white coating on the tongue.

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:13.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, we can also see indications
of the doshas accumulating

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.624 align:middle line:90%
in our faces and in our bodies.

00:09:16.624 --> 00:09:18.040 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm going
to talk about how

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.610 align:middle line:84%
we can read our faces and
faces of those around us

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:25.240 align:middle line:84%
to see states of relative
balance and imbalance.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.990 align:middle line:84%
The forehead that relates
to our large intestine.

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And vata imbalance
will be indicated

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:36.590 align:middle line:84%
by a large horizontal lines
or cracks on the forehead.

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:40.200 align:middle line:84%
This indicates a lot of anxiety,
a lot of mental pressure

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.150 align:middle line:90%
in the nervous system.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:45.960 align:middle line:84%
Pitta imbalance,
indicated by flashing,

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.260 align:middle line:84%
pinkish red skin
color, and red pinpoint

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.900 align:middle line:90%
moles, and/or swelling.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.400 align:middle line:84%
Alcohol really
increases pitta dosha

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.810 align:middle line:84%
because it's so
inflammatory and heating.

00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:59.700 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
when you see somebody

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.960 align:middle line:84%
who's a chronic
drinker, drinks a lot,

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.280 align:middle line:90%
they may have a red nose.

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.110 align:middle line:90%
Like, we see that in cartoons.

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:08.190 align:middle line:84%
That's a sign of pitta
dosha on the face.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:10.830 align:middle line:84%
Kapha imbalance will be
indicated by swelling

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:12.840 align:middle line:90%
or by things like lipomas.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:16.650 align:middle line:84%
Ama will be indicated
by acne, by pimples,

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:19.440 align:middle line:84%
by dull, pasty
skin because ama is

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.080 align:middle line:90%
where there's blockage in flow.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, the cheeks
correspond to our lungs.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.150 align:middle line:84%
A line just below the
cheek ending in the nose

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.010 align:middle line:84%
can indicate
malabsorption when we

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:31.410 align:middle line:90%
aren't reabsorbing our foods.

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:33.510 align:middle line:84%
Blue lines on the
cheeks indicate

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:37.680 align:middle line:84%
lung stress and stagnation
of blood flow in the lungs.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:42.550 align:middle line:84%
Flushed cheeks, again, show
increased pitta in activity.

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:46.211 align:middle line:84%
So doing a lot of exercise will
increase the fires of the body.

00:10:46.211 --> 00:10:47.460 align:middle line:90%
And so you get flushed cheeks.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:50.400 align:middle line:84%
Just like taking alcohol,
your cheeks will flush.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:54.000 align:middle line:84%
Pimples on the cheeks and
show a weakness of digestion

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000 align:middle line:84%
because the cheeks will show
that ama is affecting the lung

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:58.800 align:middle line:90%
area.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.410 align:middle line:84%
We've got some
stagnation in the lungs.

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:04.410 align:middle line:84%
The chin corresponds to
the reproductive organs

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:06.360 align:middle line:90%
or the lower abdomen.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.550 align:middle line:84%
So especially women
oftentimes break out

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:11.340 align:middle line:84%
in their chin around the
time of their moon cycle.

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is because
the chin corresponds

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.900 align:middle line:84%
to our reproductive
organs and hormones.

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:20.820 align:middle line:84%
A horizontal line across the
chin indicates low libido.

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:24.540 align:middle line:84%
Pimples or acne indicate
ama in the lower abdomen,

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:27.030 align:middle line:84%
like the colon, the
reproductive system.

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And a vertical line in the chin
relates to vata aggravation,

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:32.970 align:middle line:90%
especially in the prostate.

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:37.500 align:middle line:84%
As always, you spices, foods,
and herbs that alleviate

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.030 align:middle line:90%
the main dosha imbalance.

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:40.560 align:middle line:90%
So this can be really confusing.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.690 align:middle line:84%
People always get
confused about this.

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:45.180 align:middle line:84%
So if there's a
vata imbalance, you

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:48.630 align:middle line:84%
will use spices,
herbs, other products

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:50.610 align:middle line:90%
that are labeled for vata.

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And what it actually
means is it's vata

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:56.730 align:middle line:84%
reducing because we're trying
to reduce the accumulation

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:58.870 align:middle line:90%
of that dosha in the body.

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:01.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, finally we can
examine our body type

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:05.610 align:middle line:84%
for signs of our dosha
constitution or our propensity.

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many ways to dial
in what is your constitution.

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:12.270 align:middle line:90%
I look at people's bodies.

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:14.460 align:middle line:10%
I also look at Vedic
astrological charts,

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:18.220 align:middle line:10%
or jyotish, to determine
the constitution of a client

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:19.020 align:middle line:10%
when they come in.

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:19.950 align:middle line:10%


00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:22.740 align:middle line:10%
Bodies that find it difficult
to gain weight or tend

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:25.320 align:middle line:10%
towards dry skin
and constipation

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.600 align:middle line:10%
tend to be more vata dosha.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.820 align:middle line:10%
Someone who's more
vata will have

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:33.070 align:middle line:10%
a great deal of enthusiasm.

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:35.460 align:middle line:84%
They can also be anxious,
and their handshake

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:38.250 align:middle line:90%
will be really light and dry.

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:42.510 align:middle line:84%
When someone with a lot of vata
dosha is faced with stress,

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:45.930 align:middle line:84%
they often will say, oh,
my god, what did I do?

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:50.700 align:middle line:84%
They manifest it in an anxiety
drawn back onto themselves.

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:56.130 align:middle line:10%
Now, someone who is more pitta
dosha will have a medium build.

00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:59.070 align:middle line:10%
They'll have a warm,
firm handshake.

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:00.240 align:middle line:10%
They'll be direct.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.770 align:middle line:10%
They'll be intense.

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:04.560 align:middle line:10%
When they are faced with
stress, the person who

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:07.920 align:middle line:10%
is very pitta dosha will
say, what did you do?

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:11.610 align:middle line:84%
They'll tend to place
the blame externally.

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:15.630 align:middle line:10%
Someone who is more kapha dosha
will have a heavier build.

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:17.340 align:middle line:10%
They're the people
who are very warm.

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:18.780 align:middle line:10%
You just want to
give them a hug.

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:20.400 align:middle line:10%
They give the best hugs.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.990 align:middle line:10%
Their handshakes are very--

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:24.720 align:middle line:10%
they're like a
warm, fluffy pillow.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:29.160 align:middle line:84%
And they oftentimes will have
problems with retaining weight

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.110 align:middle line:90%
or heaviness in the body.

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:34.200 align:middle line:84%
So each part of our
body is like a hologram.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And it allows us to
understand every other body

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:40.570 align:middle line:90%
part and the whole body itself.

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.690 align:middle line:84%
So in this video, I
highlighted the tongue,

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:46.920 align:middle line:84%
the face, the whole body
as areas of assessment.

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:50.250 align:middle line:10%
We can also examine
our eyes, our nails,

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:54.600 align:middle line:10%
the tenor of our voice,
our urine, our elimination,

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.030 align:middle line:10%
our skin, all as
assessment tools

00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:00.930 align:middle line:10%
to understand our bodies
unique bio-individual patterns

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:03.630 align:middle line:10%
of balance and imbalance.

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:06.960 align:middle line:84%
A body that is in balance
has deep restful sleep,

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:11.100 align:middle line:84%
strong digestion, regular,
well-formed elimination,

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:14.820 align:middle line:84%
and for women, uneventful
menstruation, so no cramping,

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.110 align:middle line:90%
pain, bloating.

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:18.840 align:middle line:84%
When any of these four
areas are lacking,

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.480 align:middle line:84%
it's an indication
that balance is waning.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And we can use these
simple tools of analysis

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:27.960 align:middle line:84%
to understand how that balance
can be returned to the body

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.592 align:middle line:90%
and to the mind.

00:14:29.592 --> 00:14:31.050 align:middle line:84%
I really hope that
this information

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:32.460 align:middle line:90%
has been useful for you.

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:33.540 align:middle line:90%
I know it's a lot.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And it may be a bunch of
new information for you.

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:37.410 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:40.490 align:middle line:84%
You can take time to watch
this video over and over again.

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:43.210 align:middle line:84%
And each time you'll gain
a deeper understanding

00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:45.700 align:middle line:84%
of your body's symptoms
and how to work

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:48.010 align:middle line:90%
with them to create harmony.

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:51.040 align:middle line:84%
You can empower yourself
with this ancient knowledge

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:54.500 align:middle line:84%
that will allow you to harmonize
your health and your life.

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:55.360 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy.

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.950 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for joining me.

00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:59.110 align:middle line:90%
Namaste.

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:02.050 align:middle line:84%

by watching our docuseries,
yoga practices, meditations,

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:08.080 align:middle line:90%
