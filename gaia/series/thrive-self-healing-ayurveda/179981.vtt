that has its origins
in ancient India.

"Ayur" is life and
"veda" is knowledge.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.400 align:middle line:90%
So it is the knowledge of life.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Ayurveda is not
part of a culture.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.480 align:middle line:84%
It's a universal knowledge that
enlightened sages drew through

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.790 align:middle line:90%
in order to help us.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.680 align:middle line:84%

and wholeness.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And they were able to perceive
with their subtle awareness

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.900 align:middle line:84%
that these elements
were actually

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.740 align:middle line:90%
elements of the quantum field.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.660 align:middle line:84%
That even before
creation has manifested,

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.580 align:middle line:84%
there are these primary
tendencies or energies

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.170 align:middle line:84%
that modern physics
is now characterizing.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And in deep-seated
meditations, they saw,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.740 align:middle line:84%
over periods of time, how these
different aspects of nature

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.930 align:middle line:84%
affected different
parts of our body.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.730 align:middle line:84%
They made a system of wellness,

meaning herbal medicine--

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.739 align:middle line:90%

Things that you can
put into the body

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.560 align:middle line:90%

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.730 align:middle line:84%
they really are, and change
their thinking about how they

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.947 align:middle line:84%

We as human beings are only
a microcosm of the macrocosm.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.500 align:middle line:84%
Whatever is out in
the universe is also

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.140 align:middle line:90%
in every cell in our body.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.290 align:middle line:84%
We are all made up
of matter, and matter

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.840 align:middle line:90%
composes of all five elements.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.930 align:middle line:84%
That is the air, space,
fire, water, and earth.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.460 align:middle line:10%
>> Everything in creation arises
out of one underlying field,

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.080 align:middle line:10%
one unified field of
energy and intelligence.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.080 align:middle line:90%
One field of consciousness.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And our ability to tap into
those different frequencies

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.430 align:middle line:84%
make up the multi-dimensional
nature of our existence.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.660 align:middle line:84%
So the spiritual level
of life is one frequency.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.270 align:middle line:84%
The intuitive level of
life is another frequency.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.630 align:middle line:84%
The mental level is
another frequency.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.630 align:middle line:90%
The emotional, another.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:15.910 align:middle line:90%
The energetic, another.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And then, finally, the physical
is the lowest frequency.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And what they understood
is that things

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:28.030 align:middle line:84%
tended to move from that
highest level into the physical.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And so in terms of a mind-body
medicine, it's the ultimate.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.140 align:middle line:84%
That those things that are
taking place on the highest

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.050 align:middle line:84%
frequency are going
to affect what

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.810 align:middle line:90%
happens with the physical body.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.430 align:middle line:84%
If we look at modern
physics, and we

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.610 align:middle line:84%
look at subatomic particles
and the spin types,

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.680 align:middle line:84%
we find that there
are five spin types.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.310 align:middle line:84%
Lo and behold, there
are five elements.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And that these five spin types
then create a series of three.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.320 align:middle line:84%
They combine to form
three, just as the doshas.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:08.920 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not some fanciful,
cultural, ancient knowledge

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.520 align:middle line:84%
that has just been
passed down as metaphor.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.200 align:middle line:84%
It's really seeing into reality
that is the basis of Ayurveda.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.720 align:middle line:90%


00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:25.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Ayurveda conceptualizes
that there are intelligences

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.730 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And these intelligences
are comprised

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:35.250 align:middle line:84%
of the five great elements which
are earth, water, fire, air

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.020 align:middle line:90%
and ether.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And these elements,
these great elements

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.980 align:middle line:84%
combine to make
what we call doshas.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And the doshas are vata, which
is comprised of air and ether,

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.350 align:middle line:84%
pitta, which is
comprised of fire

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.190 align:middle line:84%
with a little bit of
moisture, and kapha, which

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.910 align:middle line:90%
is like earth and like water.

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.380 align:middle line:84%
>> We all have all of
these five elements,

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.910 align:middle line:84%
except we are dominant in
one, two, or all three.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.430 align:middle line:84%
A single dominant
constitution can

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.730 align:middle line:84%
be a vata constitution,
or a pitta constitution,

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.050 align:middle line:90%
or a kapha constitution.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.570 align:middle line:84%
When I look at myself, the
way I see my constitution

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:26.040 align:middle line:84%
is a pitta-vata constitution,
which is a dual constitution.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And there are a few people
who are dominant in all three

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:34.200 align:middle line:84%
doshas, and they're called the
tridoshic type of constitution.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.020 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is where having
the concept of the doshas,

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.360 align:middle line:84%
and being able to
describe ourselves,

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.070 align:middle line:84%
our nature in terms of these
tendencies, these qualities,

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:49.960 align:middle line:84%
that affords us a blueprint for
us to be able to then organize

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.460 align:middle line:84%
diet, organize routine,
organize activities,

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.790 align:middle line:84%
organize supplements in order
to prevent things from going out

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:58.590 align:middle line:90%
of whack.

I'm a physician by training.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.130 align:middle line:10%
My background is in
internal medicine,

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.850 align:middle line:10%
as well as in
Ayurvedic medicine.

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:11.850 align:middle line:10%
And so, unlike me going through
medical school and three years

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.400 align:middle line:10%
of residency before
I could understand

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.960 align:middle line:10%
how to treat someone,
with Ayurveda,

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.840 align:middle line:10%
you can understand the elements.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And if you can
describe something

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.630 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the elements,
you know what its effect

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:30.220 align:middle line:90%
is on the physiology.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.100 align:middle line:84%
So we have, then, really,
three imperatives for health.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.040 align:middle line:84%
Our connection to
source has to be strong.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.020 align:middle line:90%
There has to be no blockages.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.340 align:middle line:10%
And we have to have
balance in terms

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:46.660 align:middle line:10%
of how that energy expresses
itself in the physiology.

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.710 align:middle line:84%
>> The body that we are born
with is a blueprint of what we

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:51.670 align:middle line:90%
come with.

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:57.100 align:middle line:84%
But then how we want to
live is a compilation of,

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:03.370 align:middle line:84%
not just what we eat, also
what we think, how we think,

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.670 align:middle line:84%
and our practices to
maintain this body

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:11.140 align:middle line:84%
and nourish this body to
live a long and healthy life.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.840 align:middle line:84%
What we put in our
body is like what

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.150 align:middle line:90%
you want to put in your temple.

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.520 align:middle line:84%
Our body is like a
temple, and how you

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.293 align:middle line:90%
want to treat that is up to us.

with the natural rhythms
of what your body needs,

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:07.470 align:middle line:10%

learning how to properly
process your emotions,

and speak out what you need
to speak to feel heard.

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:22.200 align:middle line:84%
This brings a lot of
fulfillment in your life.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.290 align:middle line:84%

we can really

We tend to conceive
of ourselves,

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.520 align:middle line:84%
because we do have
individual self--

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:40.090 align:middle line:84%
as having layers like
an onion, almost.

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And just as if we have a
imperfection, or a disease,

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.540 align:middle line:84%
or a malfunction at one
layer of that onion,

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:53.360 align:middle line:84%
it will ripple out to
all the other layers.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.880 align:middle line:90%
So we have a physical self.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.090 align:middle line:84%
We can all agree that
we have a physical body.

00:09:58.090 --> 00:09:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And in Ayurveda,
they actually talk

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.800 align:middle line:84%
about this as the body
that is made of food.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:06.280 align:middle line:84%
It is our physical self that
is generated out of the food

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.710 align:middle line:90%
that we eat.

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:11.380 align:middle line:84%
Underneath this, or over
it-- we can conceptualize it

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:14.020 align:middle line:84%
either way-- is
our energetic body.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:16.270 align:middle line:84%
The body of prana,
of life force.

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:18.440 align:middle line:10%
And this is where
the chakra reside.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.430 align:middle line:10%
This is where all the nadis,
the nerve endings, the nerve

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:25.810 align:middle line:10%
channels, the meridians reside
in the more subtle body.

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And then layered
on top of that is

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:32.320 align:middle line:84%
our mental body, our perceiving
body, our conceptual body.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.870 align:middle line:90%
That which understands.

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:37.150 align:middle line:90%
So that is our thinking mind.

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And then underneath
that-- either way,

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:42.070 align:middle line:84%
we can go in or out
into the kaleidoscope--

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:44.080 align:middle line:90%
is our deep subconscious.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.660 align:middle line:84%
We can almost think of
this as our karmic body

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:50.770 align:middle line:84%
and/or our deep
subconscious emotional body.

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And then inside of that,
in the innermost heart,

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:56.950 align:middle line:90%
is the body of bliss.

00:10:56.950 --> 00:11:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And this is the closest
to our true nature,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.770 align:middle line:84%
and the closest
to consciousness.

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:05.480 align:middle line:90%


00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:08.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Understanding that
consciousness vibrates

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:12.370 align:middle line:84%
at different frequencies, that
creates the different areas

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:14.860 align:middle line:84%
of the multidimensional
human being.

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:17.310 align:middle line:84%
That creates the
spiritual level of life.

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:19.280 align:middle line:90%
And the intuitive level of life.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.160 align:middle line:84%
The mental, emotional
level of life.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.380 align:middle line:84%
>> That's how Ayurveda
defines consciousness.

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:31.480 align:middle line:84%
If we are disconnected
from that consciousness,

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:35.690 align:middle line:84%
then there is
disorder and disease.

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:38.380 align:middle line:84%
In Ayurveda, it becomes
very important for us

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:39.880 align:middle line:90%
to be connected to the source.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.920 align:middle line:90%
We call it the source.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.770 align:middle line:90%
Connected to that consciousness.

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:50.810 align:middle line:84%
That's where we are in
balance, and we are in harmony.

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:53.510 align:middle line:84%
>> So we look at
this truth of life,

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:57.090 align:middle line:84%
and we look at what it
takes in order to thrive.

00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:00.800 align:middle line:84%
What we understand is that,
if we're out of balance,

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:05.770 align:middle line:84%
out of tune with our individual
nature, with our true nature,

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:10.340 align:middle line:84%
and we don't understand the laws
of nature that govern our life,

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:13.500 align:middle line:90%
then we become imbalanced.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.730 align:middle line:84%
That disconnection
from the flow of life,

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:18.860 align:middle line:84%
from the flow of life
force, from the flow

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:23.015 align:middle line:84%
of our energy, that is the setup
for disharmony and disease.

00:12:23.015 --> 00:12:25.820 align:middle line:90%


00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:29.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Disease in Ayurveda
is defined as imbalance

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:32.270 align:middle line:90%
in our doshas.

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:36.410 align:middle line:84%
We are all born with
our own constitution.

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:39.530 align:middle line:84%
As long as we stay in
our own constitution,

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:40.950 align:middle line:90%
we are in balance.

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:44.630 align:middle line:84%
But when our constitution
becomes imbalanced,

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:46.730 align:middle line:90%
then there is disease.

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:50.665 align:middle line:84%
It's dis-ease, so
we are not at ease.

00:12:50.665 --> 00:12:52.790 align:middle line:84%
>> This is why consciousness
and its development is

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:54.890 align:middle line:90%
so fundamental in Ayurveda.

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:57.320 align:middle line:84%
With that enhanced
awareness, we can

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.750 align:middle line:84%
listen to the
intelligence of the body,

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:03.080 align:middle line:84%
and know what qualities
it is calling for.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.090 align:middle line:90%
What diet it needs.

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, empower
ourselves with a diet

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:14.240 align:middle line:90%
that is truly, uniquely ours.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:18.380 align:middle line:84%
Ayurveda, and how it
can help in modern life,

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:21.440 align:middle line:84%
is a topic that I
love to talk about.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:24.980 align:middle line:84%
In modern medicine,
I'm intimately

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:28.880 align:middle line:84%
familiar with where
the weaknesses are.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.530 align:middle line:10%
Certainly, if you're
in a car accident,

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:32.690 align:middle line:10%
there's nothing like
modern medicine.

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:36.590 align:middle line:84%
But there are these areas
with chronic disease.

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:39.410 align:middle line:84%
There are these
areas of prevention

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:42.260 align:middle line:84%
that modern medicine
is overlooking.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:48.530 align:middle line:84%
This is really where the
potency of Ayurveda is clear.

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:53.180 align:middle line:84%
From a prevention
standpoint, taking the pulse,

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:57.560 align:middle line:84%
we're able to detect
six stages of imbalance.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:00.360 align:middle line:84%
Four of those come before
there are any symptoms.

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And so it's prevention
taken to the ultimate.

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:08.300 align:middle line:84%
Ayurveda looks at
pulse diagnosis.

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:10.100 align:middle line:90%
It looks at tongue diagnosis.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.210 align:middle line:90%
It looks at the skin.

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:17.300 align:middle line:84%
These elements are also in
traditional Chinese medicine.

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:21.020 align:middle line:84%
These elements are in many
of the natural systems

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:25.910 align:middle line:84%
of medicine, because they're all
based on universal principles.

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:29.454 align:middle line:84%
Ayurveda's about
universal principles.

00:14:29.454 --> 00:14:31.370 align:middle line:84%
You can apply this to
everything in your life.

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:33.860 align:middle line:84%
You can apply this to the
quality of your yoga practice.

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:38.370 align:middle line:84%
You can apply this to the
quality of your routine,

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:41.150 align:middle line:84%
whether it's regular, irregular,
whether it is consistent

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:41.950 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:45.140 align:middle line:84%
You can apply this in
the quality of the aromas

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:47.570 align:middle line:84%
and smells that you
fill your house with.

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:53.330 align:middle line:84%
So you can apply this knowledge
of the doshas everywhere.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's where its
greatest power is.

00:14:55.670 --> 00:15:01.160 align:middle line:84%
Not just knowing our proclivity,
our tendencies, but really to

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:08.477 align:middle line:84%
know how to utilize
anything to create balance.

00:15:08.477 --> 00:15:10.310 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you know if
you're out of balance?

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:12.330 align:middle line:90%
That's a really good question.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:15.830 align:middle line:84%
So many people are living
in a almost constant state

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:16.880 align:middle line:90%
of imbalance.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:20.750 align:middle line:84%
So this could almost
seem like their norm.

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:25.220 align:middle line:84%
The idea is to catch
symptoms as they arise

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:27.770 align:middle line:90%
before they physically appear.

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:31.760 align:middle line:84%
So mental focus is one way
to see how you're feeling.

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.920 align:middle line:90%
Two, your energetic level.

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.310 align:middle line:90%
How vibrant do you feel?

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:37.820 align:middle line:84%
Do you need to supplement
with different things outside

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:41.300 align:middle line:84%
of your body, namely
sugar and caffeine?

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:44.660 align:middle line:84%
Do you need those things in
order to thrive in your life?

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:48.500 align:middle line:84%
Or are you thriving
simply without them, just

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:49.970 align:middle line:90%
through eating good food?

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:52.850 align:middle line:84%
Maybe supplementing
with some herbs.

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:56.630 align:middle line:84%
Third, how are you
feeling about your sleep?

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:58.670 align:middle line:84%
Do you fall asleep
really easily?

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:00.410 align:middle line:84%
If your sleep is
troubled, I would

00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:03.770 align:middle line:84%
say that there's definitely some
nervous system things going on

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:05.190 align:middle line:90%
in there.

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:08.100 align:middle line:84%
Probably some emotional
activity as well.

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And these are all resulting
in from our external world,

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:14.090 align:middle line:84%
or the influences of the
external environment,

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:16.850 align:middle line:84%
and people, places, and
things on our bodies.

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:19.400 align:middle line:84%
Another thing is, how
is your digestion?

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.060 align:middle line:84%
Are you processing
your foods well?

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:25.310 align:middle line:84%
Are you experiencing bloating,
constipation, diarrhea?

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:26.810 align:middle line:84%
These are some of
the simple methods

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:32.180 align:middle line:84%
you can choose to see how
you're imbalanced or not.

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:35.420 align:middle line:84%
That's the beauty of
Ayurveda and yoga,

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:39.290 align:middle line:84%
is having a nice,
simplified system

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:41.540 align:middle line:84%
that you can bring into
your everyday life,

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:44.450 align:middle line:84%
and then be able to pick
and choose specific tools

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:48.050 align:middle line:84%
that you need in real
time to bring balance

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:51.110 align:middle line:84%
into your mental state, how
you're feeling in the body,

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:53.570 align:middle line:84%
your nervous system,
your emotional state.

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:57.350 align:middle line:10%
We have herbs that you
can take to help influence

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:59.900 align:middle line:10%
your inner physiology
in your body, which

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:04.140 align:middle line:10%
is going to directly
affect your mind as well.

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:08.839 align:middle line:84%
>> So in our innermost self,
the self that is most connected

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:13.460 align:middle line:84%
and closest to consciousness
is our body of bliss.

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And this is really the
closest to our true self.

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:24.079 align:middle line:84%
And for us to be truly healthy,
truly well in a holistic way,

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:28.280 align:middle line:84%
the light that is consciousness
shines through all

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.410 align:middle line:90%
of these layers of ourselves.

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:33.950 align:middle line:84%
Through our bliss body,
through our karmic body,

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:37.010 align:middle line:84%
through our mental
perceptive body,

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:42.000 align:middle line:84%
through our energetic body
and into our physical body.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.720 align:middle line:84%
>> The truth of life is that
we harmonize with nature.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.610 align:middle line:84%
That's when we have
the greatest success.

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:50.340 align:middle line:84%
That's where we come to
the wholeness that we are.

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:52.960 align:middle line:90%
And that's where we find health.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.720 align:middle line:84%
Our culture has very much
gotten away from nature.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.540 align:middle line:84%
I think because of
the scientific mind,

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:01.570 align:middle line:84%
and the approach we were
trying to conquer nature.

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And as we have found
in looking at ecology

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:06.940 align:middle line:84%
and looking at
various areas, when

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:12.070 align:middle line:84%
we attempt to conquer nature, we
actually create more problems.

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:15.940 align:middle line:84%
In my own journey, rather
than becoming a physician

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:18.250 align:middle line:84%
and then learning
about Ayurveda,

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:20.890 align:middle line:84%
I actually studied
Ayurveda first.

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And I just saw so many people
being helped, people who

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:27.400 align:middle line:90%
were not supposed to be helped.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:31.900 align:middle line:10%
For example, I saw a gentleman
who had been a steelworker,

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:36.550 align:middle line:10%
and had his spine crushed
under a steel beam.

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:39.220 align:middle line:84%
He was not supposed
to walk again.

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And it had been years
that he had been

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:46.150 align:middle line:90%
paralyzed from the waist below.

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:48.790 align:middle line:84%
Through this deeper
understanding

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:51.640 align:middle line:84%
of how nature works,
he was able to start

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:55.450 align:middle line:84%
walking with a walker
within six months.

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:59.640 align:middle line:84%
It's things like this
that inspired me to say,

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.640 align:middle line:84%
this needs to be a part
of modern medicine.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:06.660 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a very simple
logic in Ayurveda.

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:11.280 align:middle line:84%
Anything, for that matter,
can be very logically taken

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.930 align:middle line:90%
care of.

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:15.420 align:middle line:90%
It is not complicated.

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:18.270 align:middle line:84%
We just have to know
who we are, and what

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:21.730 align:middle line:90%
our genetic tendencies are.

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:26.730 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a desperate need for
a science of prevention that is

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:30.210 align:middle line:84%
a true science of prevention,
that detects imbalances long

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:33.990 align:middle line:84%
before the manifestation
of symptoms.

00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:36.540 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's precisely
why we created this series.

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:39.997 align:middle line:84%
To bring you a
solid set of tools

00:19:39.997 --> 00:19:41.580 align:middle line:84%
that you can integrate
into your daily

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:46.180 align:middle line:84%
lives to bring about this
balance inside of mind and body

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:48.630 align:middle line:84%
so you can be more in tune
with your soul, your spirit,

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:50.130 align:middle line:84%
and your life's
calling and purpose.
