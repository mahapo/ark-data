00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.810 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to "Thrive,
Self-healing with Ayurveda."

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm Justine Lemos.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.150 align:middle line:10%
I'm an Ayurvedic practitioner
and yoga teacher.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.040 align:middle line:84%
In this video,
I'll be sharing how

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.820 align:middle line:84%
to make delicious
fresh chutneys.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.340 align:middle line:90%
Ayurveda is the science of life.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.430 align:middle line:84%
It's a holistic system
of wellness that

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.620 align:middle line:90%
originates in ancient India.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.170 align:middle line:84%
So in this video, we'll be
making fresh fruit, spice,

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.270 align:middle line:90%
and vegetable chutneys.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.990 align:middle line:10%
Be sure to check out my video
so that you can find out

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.010 align:middle line:10%
which of these chutneys
would be perfectly matched

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.360 align:middle line:10%
to balance your physiology
and stimulate your digestion.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.860 align:middle line:10%
So let's go ahead
and get started.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.010 align:middle line:10%
The first chutney
that we'll make

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.340 align:middle line:10%
is to balance what
we call vata dosha.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.400 align:middle line:84%
The doshas are the
intelligences of the body,

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.900 align:middle line:84%
and vata dosha is
made of air and ether.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.600 align:middle line:84%
When someone has a lot of
vata dosha in their body,

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.090 align:middle line:84%
it will manifest in things
like dry skin, constipation,

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.750 align:middle line:90%
and anxiety.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.180 align:middle line:84%
So this chutney is warming,
grounding, nurturing,

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.620 align:middle line:90%
and soothing.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.650 align:middle line:84%
I love making these
fresh chutneys.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.130 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, they're like
a hit of a dinner party.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.560 align:middle line:84%
When I have them, they really
impress all of my friends,

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.630 align:middle line:84%
because they're so
delicious and they really

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.920 align:middle line:84%
make every meal have
something special in them.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.160 align:middle line:84%
So our first chutney
is for vata dosha,

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.510 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to contain a
lot of really juicy dates,

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.720 align:middle line:84%
and raisins, and orange
juice-- sweet taste--

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.620 align:middle line:84%
to ground vata dosha and
to stimulate digestion.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.630 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to start with
placing some pitted dates

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.210 align:middle line:90%
into a food processor.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.039 align:middle line:84%
I'll use about a cup
of fresh dates, which

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.250 align:middle line:84%
is going to really be the
base of this fresh chutney.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.530 align:middle line:84%
All of our chutneys
are fresh, as

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.670 align:middle line:84%
opposed to the kind of
sticky jam-like substances

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.560 align:middle line:90%
that you might find in a jar.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.020 align:middle line:84%
They really transmit
a lot of life force,

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.080 align:middle line:90%
or ojas, into whoever eats them.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.840 align:middle line:84%
So I've got about a cup of
dates in the food processor.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm also going to put raisins
in, about a half a cup,

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.120 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.980 align:middle line:84%
And these juicy dried
fruits are going

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.230 align:middle line:84%
to communicate a lot of
nurturing energy to the body.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.750 align:middle line:84%
Next thing, I'm going
to use fennel seeds.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.720 align:middle line:84%
About a teaspoon
of fennel seeds.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And fennel seeds really calm
and soothe the digestion.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.580 align:middle line:84%
So if you have any gas,
or pain, or bloating,

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.015 align:middle line:90%
they're really great for you.

00:02:58.015 --> 00:02:59.940 align:middle line:90%
I'll also use some cumin seeds.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.740 align:middle line:90%
Cumin seeds are very warming.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.870 align:middle line:84%
I'll use about a
half a teaspoon.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.730 align:middle line:84%
So these also act to warm the
body and stimulate digestion.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.320 align:middle line:84%
I'll use some ground coriander,
about a half a teaspoon.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And this really
pacifies all three

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.900 align:middle line:84%
of the doshas, what
we call the doshas.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use some orange
juice, about a half a cup

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.890 align:middle line:90%
of orange juice, in here.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.620 align:middle line:90%
And then fresh ginger root.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And here, I'll use
a few tablespoons

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.970 align:middle line:90%
of fresh ginger root.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.780 align:middle line:84%
That's going to provide the
really pungent, warm flavor

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.580 align:middle line:90%
to this chutney.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.640 align:middle line:84%
So I just put it all
into a food processor.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.765 align:middle line:90%
You can also use a blender.

00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:46.360 align:middle line:90%
It works very well.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.105 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to mix it all up.

00:03:49.105 --> 00:03:52.500 align:middle line:90%
[MACHINE WHIRRS]

00:03:52.500 --> 00:04:02.210 align:middle line:90%


00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going
to have-- the smell

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.600 align:middle line:90%
is so fragrant and delicious.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And I'll have this
delicious fresh chutney.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, the way to use
our fresh chutneys

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.620 align:middle line:84%
is we usually take them,
about a teaspoon or so,

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.330 align:middle line:84%
about 20 minutes before we
eat a main meal, like lunch

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.320 align:middle line:90%
or dinner.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And taking the chutney
before we eat our meal

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.920 align:middle line:84%
acts to kind of excite
and awaken our digestion.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.040 align:middle line:84%
And then, because the
chutneys are so delicious,

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.470 align:middle line:84%
we'll really want to eat
them again with our meal,

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.490 align:middle line:90%
like as a condiment on the side.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.400 align:middle line:84%
So this vata chutney
that I just finished,

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.760 align:middle line:90%
it has a really unusual taste.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.830 align:middle line:10%
It's sweet and
it's also pungent.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.180 align:middle line:10%
So it's warm, it's spicy,
because of the ginger

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.830 align:middle line:10%
and the spices in it.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.870 align:middle line:10%
And when you eat a
little bit of it,

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.240 align:middle line:10%
your whole mouth
starts to salivate.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.540 align:middle line:10%
And really, you can feel how
it gets your digestive enzymes

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.380 align:middle line:10%
working in preparation for the
meal that you're about to eat.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, you may be more familiar
with kind of chutneys

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.360 align:middle line:90%
that are like marmalade.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.560 align:middle line:90%
They come in a jar.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.370 align:middle line:90%
They're preserved.

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.800 align:middle line:84%
They're really sweet,
like mango chutney.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.490 align:middle line:10%
And these fresh chutneys are
really different than that.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.610 align:middle line:10%
The fresh fruit and
fresh ingredients,

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.220 align:middle line:10%
while they stimulate
digestion, they also

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.860 align:middle line:10%
transmit this great
vitality, or what

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.800 align:middle line:10%
we call it ojas in
Ayurveda, in our bodies.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.370 align:middle line:84%
So the second chutney
that I'm going to make

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.770 align:middle line:90%
is for what we call pitta dosha.

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And pitta dosha is
responsible for all the fires

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.690 align:middle line:90%
in our bodies.

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And someone who has more
pitta in their constitution

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.880 align:middle line:90%
will be of medium builds.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.370 align:middle line:90%
They'll be more intense.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.400 align:middle line:84%
If they're experiencing, or
if anyone is experiencing

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.710 align:middle line:84%
a pitta dosha
imbalance, it might

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.960 align:middle line:84%
manifest in early
morning wakings

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.330 align:middle line:84%
between the hours of 2:00 and
4:00 AM, rashes, irritability.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.510 align:middle line:84%
These types of things are
indicative of a pitta dosha

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:12.510 align:middle line:90%
imbalance.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.190 align:middle line:84%
So the ingredients that I'm
going to use in this chutney

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.160 align:middle line:84%
are more cooling
and sweet, which

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.260 align:middle line:84%
are flavors that pacify
what we call pitta dosha.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a combination of
cilantro and apple.

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.240 align:middle line:90%
Or you can use pear.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And I often make
this for friends

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.580 align:middle line:90%
who like to eat a lot of salsa.

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And salsa, because it has
a lot of garlic in it,

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.490 align:middle line:84%
can be too healing
for many people who

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.070 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of pitta dosha
in their constitution.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.250 align:middle line:84%
So I often use it
as a substitute

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:50.000 align:middle line:84%
for a kind of really
intense salsa,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.890 align:middle line:90%
or a heating pungent flavor.

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:54.830 align:middle line:10%
So I'm going to take about a
cup, maybe a little bit more,

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.680 align:middle line:10%
of cilantro, fresh cilantro.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:03.980 align:middle line:10%
And then I'll use
apple, about a cup.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:05.970 align:middle line:90%
One to two apples or pears.

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:10.790 align:middle line:84%
It kind of depends upon
the size of the fruit.

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:14.330 align:middle line:90%
And then lemon juice.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.300 align:middle line:84%
A few tablespoons
to a half a cup.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.840 align:middle line:84%
You want the consistency to
be kind of chunky and fresh

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.880 align:middle line:90%
but not watery.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:29.790 align:middle line:90%
And then a bit of salt.

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.940 align:middle line:90%
And some fresh turbinado sugar.

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.630 align:middle line:84%
And the sweet flavor
of the turbinado sugar

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:40.750 align:middle line:84%
is really cooling and
pacifying to pitta dosha.

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:47.770 align:middle line:90%


00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:53.628 align:middle line:84%
So this pitta chutney has a
very sweet and bright flavor.

00:07:53.628 --> 00:07:56.904 align:middle line:90%
[MACHINE WHIRRS]

00:07:56.904 --> 00:08:00.180 align:middle line:90%


00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:05.140 align:middle line:10%
I'm just going to add a
bit more liquid to this.

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:08.480 align:middle line:10%
So it just depends
upon your ingredients

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.830 align:middle line:10%
and as well as your mixer about
how things are going to mix.

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:17.780 align:middle line:10%
So I'm going to add a
little bit more citrus

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.040 align:middle line:10%
to get it to mix really well.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:23.540 align:middle line:10%
Like I said, you don't want
the consistency too watery,

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:26.260 align:middle line:10%
but you also want it
to all mix together.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.690 align:middle line:10%
[MACHINE WHIRRS]

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:31.830 align:middle line:90%


00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:32.630 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:38.510 align:middle line:90%


00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:40.000 align:middle line:90%
Hmm.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.600 align:middle line:10%
So you can see this chutney
I just made, sometimes it

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.740 align:middle line:10%
comes out more chunky.

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.110 align:middle line:10%
You can also just chop
all your ingredients

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:47.680 align:middle line:10%
and mix them together.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:51.060 align:middle line:10%
This has a more liquidy
kind of constitution.

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.470 align:middle line:10%
And that's really great.

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:55.710 align:middle line:10%
It's kind of the
consistency of pesto.

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:59.250 align:middle line:10%
So you can make it either
more chunky or more smooth.

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:02.430 align:middle line:90%
And this is the pitta chutney.

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:06.080 align:middle line:84%
The final chutney that I'll
make is for kapha dosha.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And kapha dosha is a
constitutional type

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:11.580 align:middle line:90%
that is heavier.

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:13.560 align:middle line:90%
It might retain weight.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:17.040 align:middle line:84%
There might be mucus
or water retention.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:21.180 align:middle line:84%
And so this chutney,
to tame kapha dosha,

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:24.330 align:middle line:84%
uses a lot of pungency,
a lot of heat,

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:28.380 align:middle line:84%
to stimulate digestion
and get things moving.

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:32.190 align:middle line:84%
So in this chutney, we're
going to use some peeled

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:33.780 align:middle line:90%
ginger, quite a lot.

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:37.360 align:middle line:84%
Fresh peeled ginger,
almost a half a cup.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And some raisins,
some soaked reasons

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.510 align:middle line:84%
that are really plumped
up because they've

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:44.370 align:middle line:90%
been soaking in water.

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll add a couple
of tablespoons of lime juice

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.350 align:middle line:90%
to transmit a sour flavor.

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And then orange juice, about
a half a cup of orange juice.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:10:00.130 align:middle line:90%


00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:02.440 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm just going
to place this into a food

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.820 align:middle line:90%
processor or a blender.

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:06.910 align:middle line:84%
Or I can also chop it
all if I don't have

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:09.910 align:middle line:90%
a food processor or a blender.

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:11.089 align:middle line:10%
And--

00:10:11.089 --> 00:10:14.582 align:middle line:10%
[MACHINE WHIRRS]

00:10:14.582 --> 00:10:28.055 align:middle line:90%


00:10:28.055 --> 00:10:32.620 align:middle line:84%
So this chutney is really
gingery, really pungent,

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:33.455 align:middle line:90%
really fiery.

00:10:33.455 --> 00:10:37.910 align:middle line:90%


00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:41.570 align:middle line:84%
So be sure to check out the
other two cooking videos

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:46.040 align:middle line:84%
in this series, which guides you
in creating a complete healing

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.450 align:middle line:90%
Ayurvedic meal.

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:51.800 align:middle line:84%
We've made churnas, which are
Ayurvedic spice mixtures used

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.640 align:middle line:84%
to maximize digestion and
create balance in the body.

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:59.460 align:middle line:10%
And then these chutneys
which I just shared with you.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:02.810 align:middle line:10%
And then my friend Kishan
created khichdi, which

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:06.297 align:middle line:10%
is a balancing Ayurvedic dish.

00:11:06.297 --> 00:11:07.880 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to bring
him in and we're

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.830 align:middle line:84%
going to try some
of this khichdi

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:12.050 align:middle line:90%
with the chutneys and churnas.

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:13.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Hey, Justine,
how are you doing?

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:14.420 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm doing really well.

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:15.253 align:middle line:90%
>> Look what I have.

00:11:15.253 --> 00:11:16.880 align:middle line:90%
A couple of bowls of khichdi.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.760 align:middle line:84%
So khichdi is made
from split mung

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:22.819 align:middle line:84%
bean, which is a very small
yellow bean when it's split.

00:11:22.819 --> 00:11:24.485 align:middle line:84%
But when you see it
in the store-- maybe

00:11:24.485 --> 00:11:26.840 align:middle line:84%
it just has whole mung
bean-- it'll be green.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.730 align:middle line:84%
And what they do is they
break that shell off

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.260 align:middle line:90%
and it's much easier to digest.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And because the
shell is off, you

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:35.600 align:middle line:84%
don't have gas buildup
after digesting it.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:40.010 align:middle line:84%
The second and main ingredient
is white, long basmati rice.

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And there's a mixture of
digestive herbs in there

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:43.690 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:45.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Mmm, it smells so good.

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:45.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:48.110 align:middle line:84%
>> So what do you
want to try it with?

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:50.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's try the-- this one
looks like it's got a lot

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:50.870 align:middle line:90%
of ginger.

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:51.670 align:middle line:90%
I'd love to try that one first.

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:53.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, this is
the kapha chutney,

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.210 align:middle line:90%
so it's really heating.

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:55.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yum.

00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:57.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And I really want to know
what you think about it.

00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:57.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:58.660 align:middle line:90%
Let's do this.

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:03.100 align:middle line:90%


00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:03.900 align:middle line:90%
Mmm.

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:06.970 align:middle line:90%
A little sour and pungent.

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:07.770 align:middle line:90%
Very spicy.

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:08.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Um-hm, super spicy.

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:09.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:10.423 align:middle line:90%
I love that sharp, fresh ginger.

00:12:10.423 --> 00:12:14.070 align:middle line:84%
>> This shouldn't be taken
for people with ulcers.

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:18.630 align:middle line:84%
It's just too heating, and it
could create further imbalance.

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:21.150 align:middle line:84%
So really for people with
a lot of water retention--

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:21.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Loving it.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.380 align:middle line:90%
>> --heaviness in the body.

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:27.020 align:middle line:84%
This is the vata chutney,
or vata pacifying chutney.

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:28.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Evidently, dates.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:29.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Um-hm, and raisins.

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:30.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Sweet, yum.

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:33.242 align:middle line:90%
>> Um-hm, sweet.

00:12:33.242 --> 00:12:34.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Mmm.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:34.920 align:middle line:90%
Oh my gosh.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.340 align:middle line:84%
I just feel that take my
body down into itself.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.140 align:middle line:90%
Really awesome.

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:39.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, super grounded.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:39.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:39.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:39.790 align:middle line:90%
Totally.

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:40.760 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>> And then this is
the pitta chutney.

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:44.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, sweet.

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:44.735 align:middle line:90%
Yum.

00:12:44.735 --> 00:12:45.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:46.300 align:middle line:90%
Super sweet, super grounding.

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:47.800 align:middle line:10%
And you can taste--
it's interesting

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.810 align:middle line:10%
because you can taste
the cumin in there,

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:53.590 align:middle line:10%
which is unusual for most
Westerners, with the dates.

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:56.320 align:middle line:84%
It's like an
unusual combination.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Coriander.

00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:58.030 align:middle line:90%
Or cilantro?

00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:59.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Cilantro, yes.

00:12:59.140 --> 00:12:59.940 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Cilantro, apple, lemon.

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:02.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my gosh.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:06.550 align:middle line:84%
The addition of
the apple really--

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:07.547 align:middle line:90%
it changed it up.

00:13:07.547 --> 00:13:08.630 align:middle line:90%
It's something new for me.

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:08.740 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:08.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:09.740 align:middle line:90%
It's really bright.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:11.656 align:middle line:84%
I always think that the
taste is really bright

00:13:11.656 --> 00:13:14.679 align:middle line:84%
and provides this nice
illumination to the palate.

00:13:14.679 --> 00:13:15.845 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice surprise, thank you.

00:13:15.845 --> 00:13:16.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:16.835 align:middle line:90%
Really. you're welcome.

00:13:16.835 --> 00:13:17.751 align:middle line:90%
>> That was delicious.

00:13:17.751 --> 00:13:20.372 align:middle line:84%
>> You can also add any of these
churnas, or spice mixtures.

00:13:20.372 --> 00:13:21.580 align:middle line:90%
You can just use them on top.

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:24.070 align:middle line:10%
Or when you cook your khichdi,
you can also use them.

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:26.440 align:middle line:10%
So here's a little
bit of churna for you.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:29.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Really amazing.

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:31.450 align:middle line:84%
So the combination
of that churna,

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:35.140 align:middle line:84%
that little bit of churna
on top, and some small taste

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:37.060 align:middle line:84%
of the three chutneys,
along with the khichdi,

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:38.500 align:middle line:90%
is so delicious.

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.000 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for bringing this.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:40.800 align:middle line:90%
