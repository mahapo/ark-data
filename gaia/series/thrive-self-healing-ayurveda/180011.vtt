And when it comes to food

>> One of the things that
excites me about Ayurveda is

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.050 align:middle line:10%
this connection between
diet and the uniqueness

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.980 align:middle line:10%
of the individual.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.880 align:middle line:84%
I, time and time again,
see this tragic view

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.270 align:middle line:84%
that people come
to me for advice,

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.880 align:middle line:84%
and they've whittled
everything away.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.700 align:middle line:84%
They've said, oh, I'm
sensitive to this.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.750 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I've read I
shouldn't be eating that.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.240 align:middle line:84%
Oh, hey, I was told
by this practitioner

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.560 align:middle line:90%
I shouldn't have that.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And there's first this giving
over of the individual's power

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.110 align:middle line:84%
to something external
and not respecting

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.570 align:middle line:84%
the beauty of
intuition, the fact

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.520 align:middle line:84%
that we have within
our own awareness

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.030 align:middle line:84%
the ability to tap into the
intelligence of the body.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And then it's also
tragic the confusion,

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.850 align:middle line:84%
where someone is beating
up on themselves.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.700 align:middle line:84%
They're living by rules
that they can't abide by.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And then they get into guilt
about what they've eaten.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.980 align:middle line:84%
Ayurveda understands
that food is

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.960 align:middle line:84%
to be enjoyed, that the most
important quality of any given

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.570 align:middle line:90%
meal is its enjoyment.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And if it's not
creating that enjoyment,

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.560 align:middle line:84%
it's most likely going to
create problems, toxins, ama.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.980 align:middle line:84%
It's going to block our
ability to digest and absorb.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And so there's nothing
more important.

>> If you are
eating in a rushed,

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.509 align:middle line:84%
hurried way and just gobbling
up your food and you are really

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.230 align:middle line:84%
not succeeding the juices
and giving it time to digest,

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.750 align:middle line:84%
the food is going to pass
through without being digested

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.550 align:middle line:90%
properly.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And it is going to form what
we call as ama in Ayurveda.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.030 align:middle line:90%
That is toxins.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And those toxins are going
to be absorbed in our system

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.640 align:middle line:84%
and manifest in the form
of discomfort or disease.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.720 align:middle line:84%
It is going to put
us out of balance.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.400 align:middle line:84%
That is why, these days,
you see a lot of imbalances,

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.700 align:middle line:84%
whether it is children,
or families, or adults--

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.690 align:middle line:84%
not mindful about
these routines is

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.140 align:middle line:90%
making us more sick than ever.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.250 align:middle line:84%
>> With Ayurveda, every food
is potentially medicine.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.240 align:middle line:90%
Every substance has properties.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And we just need to know
what those properties are

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.240 align:middle line:84%
and how they'll
affect our physiology.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:13.340 align:middle line:84%
So we often talk about creating
our kitchen as a ritual space.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.830 align:middle line:84%
So actually, instead
of buying more,

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.070 align:middle line:84%
there's often a lot
of elimination of food

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.520 align:middle line:84%
that's stale, food
that's leftover,

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.570 align:middle line:84%
food that lacks prana,
food that lacks vitality.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:27.680 align:middle line:90%
And we buy spices.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.120 align:middle line:90%
We buy fresh food.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.680 align:middle line:84%
But generally, there's
nothing extra to buy.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.710 align:middle line:84%
There's no program to buy
that's packaged for you.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.580 align:middle line:84%
Of course, beyond that, we
want to eat consciously.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.670 align:middle line:84%
Because that allows
us to digest food.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And digested food will create
more liveliness, more vitality

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.790 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.370 align:middle line:84%
Using the freshest
possible ingredients,

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:58.940 align:middle line:84%
eating organic, eating seasonal
foods is also very important.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>> These days, there is what
is called mindful eating,

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.980 align:middle line:90%
mindfulness-based eating.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.970 align:middle line:84%
Actually, you're
taught how to eat.

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.710 align:middle line:84%
If you pick up a
piece of carrot,

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.540 align:middle line:90%
how do you feel, the touch?

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.950 align:middle line:90%
What color is it?

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.560 align:middle line:84%
When you actually bring
it close to your mouth,

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.200 align:middle line:84%
just observe the
secretions of your saliva.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.620 align:middle line:90%
And then take a bite.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.420 align:middle line:90%
And feel it.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:21.620 align:middle line:90%
And then chew.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.830 align:middle line:84%
Paying attention
and an intention

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.370 align:middle line:90%
becomes very important.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.510 align:middle line:90%
Start with that small things--

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.210 align:middle line:84%
starting from when you
look at it and pick it up.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.130 align:middle line:84%
Of course, taking all
the gadgets away--

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.630 align:middle line:84%
dining room is a space that
you create for only that.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.650 align:middle line:84%
With the question of, why don't
all diets work for all people,

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.860 align:middle line:84%
it's really ancient
knowledge-- even

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.550 align:middle line:84%
the Greeks knew-- that one man's
meat is another man's poison.

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.690 align:middle line:84%
We have different composition
of different elements within us.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And in order to keep
those in balance,

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.800 align:middle line:84%
we have to be looking at the
elements that make up the diet.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And if the elements go
too far in one direction,

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.080 align:middle line:84%
that's going to pull
us out of balance.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why I say to my
students, there's no bad foods.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.940 align:middle line:84%
If you know the
quality of the food,

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.700 align:middle line:84%
you know when it can
be used to create

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.300 align:middle line:84%
what balance that you need
within someone's physiology.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.600 align:middle line:84%
And so each
individual needs to be

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.400 align:middle line:84%
able to attune their diet
to what's best for them.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.850 align:middle line:84%
Drink warm water with lemon
juice and honey first thing

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:38.710 align:middle line:90%
in the morning.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:39.510 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.850 align:middle line:84%
Also, you can drink
chewing coriander, fennel.

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.120 align:middle line:84%
In terms of what we put in

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.110 align:middle line:90%

For some, it's not.

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.530 align:middle line:84%
It depends on
their constitution.

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.010 align:middle line:84%
Fad diets are promoted so
much through advertisements

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.110 align:middle line:84%
that people just
gravitate towards.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.880 align:middle line:90%
Because they make it look good.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.578 align:middle line:84%
That can be good for a few
but not good for everyone.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.570 align:middle line:84%
Smoothies are a big
thing these days.

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.360 align:middle line:90%
What do we combine in smoothies?

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.870 align:middle line:90%
We put protein powders.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:11.670 align:middle line:90%
We put foods.

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.150 align:middle line:90%
We put nuts.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.510 align:middle line:84%
We had anything and
everything to make it easy

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:17.770 align:middle line:90%
for us to drink.

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.340 align:middle line:84%
And let me tell you,
according to Ayurveda,

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.020 align:middle line:90%
it's not compatible.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.870 align:middle line:84%
They are all individually
very healthy.

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:30.940 align:middle line:84%
But when you mix them
together, it produces toxins.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.440 align:middle line:90%
Smoothies are great.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.050 align:middle line:84%
But the main thing is
to not have combinations

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.230 align:middle line:90%
of dairy and fruit together.

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.610 align:middle line:84%
As an Ayurvedic
doctor, I can tell you,

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:42.950 align:middle line:90%
I have made that mistake.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.730 align:middle line:84%
Just a couple of days
ago, I told myself, well,

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:47.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to treat
myself for a smoothie.

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:51.060 align:middle line:84%
I did exactly what I
shouldn't have done.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.780 align:middle line:90%
In almond milk, I put walnuts.

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:54.880 align:middle line:90%
I put a banana.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.920 align:middle line:90%
I put veggie protein mix.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.450 align:middle line:90%
And I put moringa powder.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:03.010 align:middle line:84%
I put kale and some spinach,
and then blended them all,

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:04.850 align:middle line:90%
and then drank it up--

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:05.650 align:middle line:90%
very good.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:06.970 align:middle line:90%
I said, ah, breakfast done.

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:11.050 align:middle line:84%
I came to my office, and my
stomach was not feeling good.

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:12.820 align:middle line:90%
My intestines started to gurgle.

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:13.720 align:middle line:90%
And there you go.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.050 align:middle line:84%
I had to run to the bathroom
in between my clients.

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:20.530 align:middle line:90%
And that was not good.

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:24.380 align:middle line:84%
All I can say is that it
is toxic to your system.

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't have the
reaction that what I had,

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.360 align:middle line:84%
it can be absorbed as
a toxin in your body

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.090 align:middle line:84%
and go through different
tissues, and systems,

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:38.470 align:middle line:84%
and manifest as skin diseases,
and various other systemic

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:39.470 align:middle line:90%
diseases.

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:41.080 align:middle line:90%
Once or twice, it's OK.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.540 align:middle line:84%
But if you're going to be
doing this all the time,

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:46.690 align:middle line:84%
then it affects
your immune system.

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.930 align:middle line:90%
And then you are out of balance.

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And then you're going
to manifest something.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:58.090 align:middle line:84%
And so, in Ayurveda, we
don't recommend eating fruits

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.730 align:middle line:90%
with grains and not even nuts--

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.320 align:middle line:90%
even with other fruits.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.620 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to fruits, eat
it alone, or leave it alone.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:07.450 align:middle line:90%
That's the rule.

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And we don't mix dairy products
with anything sour or fruits.

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:17.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Raw food, raw vegetables,
have a lot of concentrated

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:18.870 align:middle line:90%
prana.

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:21.610 align:middle line:84%
But that prana can
be hard to extract,

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:24.310 align:middle line:84%
because it can be
very rough, and dry,

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:26.920 align:middle line:84%
and hard for the
digestion to break down.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.520 align:middle line:84%
So Ayurveda really
favors cooked food,

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:35.020 align:middle line:84%
because it's easiest for
the digestion to assimilate.

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:38.320 align:middle line:10%
Weight-loss diets are drinks.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:43.780 align:middle line:84%
Anything that is processed,
anything that is colored,

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:47.380 align:middle line:84%
anything that does
not come naturally

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.750 align:middle line:84%
is definitely not
good for anybody.

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:52.750 align:middle line:90%
That's how we accumulate toxins.

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:57.250 align:middle line:84%
When we are unconscious
and blind to just being

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:59.710 align:middle line:84%
attracted to the
advertisements, that's

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:01.840 align:middle line:84%
how we lose connection
with the source.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.150 align:middle line:84%
If we start to
listen to ourselves,

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:06.460 align:middle line:84%
and listen to our
body, and actually take

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:11.320 align:middle line:84%
some time mindfully to even
see what is in that food that

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.020 align:middle line:84%
is being packaged so
well and sold to you--

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:18.450 align:middle line:84%
even a few minutes will
make a huge difference.

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:24.570 align:middle line:84%
A basic Ayurvedic diet
comprises of mostly vegetarian.

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:27.760 align:middle line:84%
Ayurveda does not tell you
not to eat non-vegetarian.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.630 align:middle line:84%
But don't make that
as your main meal.

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:33.490 align:middle line:84%
There is always a
proportion of foods

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:36.650 align:middle line:90%
that you're supposed to eat--

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:39.590 align:middle line:84%
solids, half your stomach,
liquids, one fourth

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:44.300 align:middle line:84%
of your stomach, and another
one fourth should be left empty.

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:49.880 align:middle line:84%
So your food should be comprised
of grains, fresh vegetables,

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:54.110 align:middle line:84%
lentils, beans, a
little portion of meat--

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:55.640 align:middle line:90%
whatever you're eating.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.620 align:middle line:84%
But I would not recommend
eating red meat,

00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:59.600 align:middle line:90%
unless you really need it.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.930 align:middle line:84%
Eat lots of vegetables,
because our intestines are not

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:05.000 align:middle line:90%
made for meat.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.650 align:middle line:10%
That's why, in
the United States,

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:09.410 align:middle line:10%
there's so much of
constipation-- then

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:14.370 align:middle line:10%
rectal problems because of
a lot of meat consumption.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And when you eat raw salads,
it is very hard on your stomach

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:18.980 align:middle line:90%
to digest.

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:22.160 align:middle line:84%
The cell wall is not
broken down easily.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.250 align:middle line:84%
And the food only stays in
your stomach for some time.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:30.200 align:middle line:84%
So if we cook or steam foods,
that breaks the cell wall.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.050 align:middle line:84%
And you're actually
helping in aiding digestion

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:35.570 align:middle line:84%
easily and absorbing
nutrients in your body.

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:39.260 align:middle line:84%
When you consume the food,
your food is well-digested.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And there is not undigested
food going through

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.120 align:middle line:90%
into the small intestines.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:47.750 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you can have
salads but at lunchtime

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:52.190 align:middle line:84%
when your metabolism is
really strong and high.

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:55.930 align:middle line:84%
After a meal,
Ayurveda tells you--

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.100 align:middle line:90%
and it is very important--

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:03.770 align:middle line:84%
that you take anywhere
from 100 to 200 steps.

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:09.920 align:middle line:84%
Walk-- not brisk walk, not
run, but just a casual walk

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:15.080 align:middle line:84%
just so you help your
food aid in digestion.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.500 align:middle line:84%
Take a casual walk
around your dining table

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:20.180 align:middle line:90%
or around your living room.

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:21.950 align:middle line:90%
Go up and down in your house.

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:24.350 align:middle line:84%
Don't sit on the
couch, and watch TV.

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:28.530 align:middle line:84%
After that, you can relax,
and do what you need to do.

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:32.030 align:middle line:84%
But make sure you go to bed
by 10:00 and not stay up.

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:34.940 align:middle line:84%
Because your body
needs to shut down,

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:38.850 align:middle line:84%
digest, assimilate,
and cleanse internally.

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:40.580 align:middle line:84%
So you have to
give room for that.

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.320 align:middle line:90%


00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:48.560 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that we
encourage patients and clients

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:52.430 align:middle line:84%
to do is to use their intuition,
be able to become sensitive

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:56.600 align:middle line:84%
to what it is that's happening
within the physiology.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:59.030 align:middle line:84%
So it's one thing to
have general guidelines.

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:01.340 align:middle line:84%
It's another thing to
have that consciousness.

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:05.080 align:middle line:90%


00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:10.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Some easy tips that you
can do to help yourself when

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:13.200 align:middle line:84%
you're upset, or when
you're disturbed,

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.740 align:middle line:90%
or when you're worried--

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.370 align:middle line:84%
you should just sit with
yourself, and breathe.

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:19.030 align:middle line:90%
Watch how you're breathing.

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:20.460 align:middle line:84%
You will notice,
when you're going

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:24.750 align:middle line:84%
through these type of emotions,
your breath becomes shallow.

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:29.280 align:middle line:84%
And the types of thoughts
you're engaged in take a break,

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.140 align:middle line:90%
break the circuit.

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:34.710 align:middle line:84%
Create that space between
you and your thoughts,

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:38.160 align:middle line:84%
and anchor yourself
with your breath.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:42.630 align:middle line:84%
When you do that every day
for about even 10 minutes,

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:44.430 align:middle line:90%
there is a big difference.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:47.435 align:middle line:84%
You're going to feel
a whole lot better.

00:12:47.435 --> 00:12:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>> This is why consciousness
and its development is

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.630 align:middle line:90%
so fundamental in Ayurveda.

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:54.090 align:middle line:84%
With that enhanced
awareness, we can

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:56.520 align:middle line:84%
listen to the
intelligence of the body

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.850 align:middle line:84%
and know what qualities
it is calling for,

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:02.790 align:middle line:84%
what diet it needs,
and therefore

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:10.635 align:middle line:84%
empower ourselves with a diet
that is truly uniquely ours.

00:13:10.635 --> 00:13:13.110 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:15.090 align:middle line:90%


00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:17.200 align:middle line:10%
>> So the way we
work from a dietary,

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.840 align:middle line:10%
nutritional standpoint
Ayurvedically is very much

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:24.550 align:middle line:10%
using these concepts of five
elemental theory along with

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:28.660 align:middle line:10%
the six tastes in their
relationship and how they work

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:31.480 align:middle line:10%
to increase or
decrease the doshas.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:35.710 align:middle line:10%
We have the six tastes of sweet,
sour, salty, pungent, bitter,

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:38.420 align:middle line:10%
and astringent.

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:41.840 align:middle line:10%
When we look at the last
two, bitter and astringent--

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.060 align:middle line:10%
if we give someone
foods that are

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.430 align:middle line:10%
rich in bitter and
astringent taste,

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:50.310 align:middle line:10%
these are going to increase
vata dosha in nature.

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:53.060 align:middle line:84%
So the principle
of like increases

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:56.240 align:middle line:90%
like and opposites decrease--

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:59.840 align:middle line:84%
these two concepts that we work
with in Ayurveda with diet.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:03.260 align:middle line:84%
Brumhana, to increasing,
and Langhana,

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.720 align:middle line:84%
of stripping away
and taking away--

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.410 align:middle line:84%
we use the six tastes to
either increase specific things

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:13.250 align:middle line:84%
in the body or to strip
away when there's excesses.

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:18.140 align:middle line:84%
Bitter and astringent are going
to be light, airy, scraping,

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:20.880 align:middle line:90%
dry, more cold in nature.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:24.600 align:middle line:84%
Those are going to
take things away.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.600 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody had that
increase of kapha dosha,

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:31.280 align:middle line:84%
say, overweight, lethargic,
dull in the mind,

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:34.430 align:middle line:84%
we would want to increase
bitter and astringent taste,

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:37.820 align:middle line:84%
and then bring in a little bit
of salt and some slight pungent

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:40.260 align:middle line:84%
to decrease that excess
of earth and water.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.410 align:middle line:84%
So you can kind of see
how the relationship

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:44.770 align:middle line:90%
between these start to play.

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:47.960 align:middle line:84%
Somebody having too much
vata, too much air and space--

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.020 align:middle line:90%
maybe they're emaciated.

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:53.870 align:middle line:84%
They're constantly stressed,
nervous system wired out,

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:55.652 align:middle line:90%
insomnia, these types of things.

00:14:55.652 --> 00:14:57.860 align:middle line:84%
We're going to want to
increase this earth and water.

00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:59.660 align:middle line:84%
We're going to bring
in those last two

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:02.600 align:middle line:90%
tastes of sweet and sour.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.990 align:middle line:84%
Sweet and sour are going to
increase the earth and water

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:09.170 align:middle line:84%
elementals and
decrease vata dosha.

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:13.280 align:middle line:84%
So in this way, we kind of
play with the elementals

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.950 align:middle line:84%
as they relate to
the six tastes.

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And then what we
understand is what

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.830 align:middle line:84%
we can take from outside
in the outside world

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:24.860 align:middle line:84%
to bring it into the body--
this is where we understand food

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:27.550 align:middle line:90%
is medicine and herbs, as well.

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:32.460 align:middle line:84%
We qualify our herbs
based on the six tastes.

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:33.800 align:middle line:90%
>> I had a wonderful mentor.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.110 align:middle line:84%
He used to say, give me
an hour with any person,

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:39.350 align:middle line:84%
and I can teach them the
effect of any substance

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:41.690 align:middle line:90%
in the universe on their body.

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And what he would teach
are fundamental elements

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:48.360 align:middle line:90%
and how like increases like.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:51.980 align:middle line:84%
He talked about this
universal pharmacy,

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:56.910 align:middle line:84%
that if we understand the
quality of something in nature,

00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:59.030 align:middle line:84%
then we know its
effect on our body.

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:01.430 align:middle line:84%
He had this wonderful
lecture that he

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:03.440 align:middle line:84%
gave where he took
things in the room,

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:06.290 align:middle line:90%
like the class was having pizza.

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:09.450 align:middle line:90%
And they were having a soda.

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:12.750 align:middle line:84%
He took each of the
dietary things and said,

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:16.040 align:middle line:90%
OK, what's the quality of soda?

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And being able to
explain that in terms of,

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:22.460 align:middle line:84%
oh, there's that
fuzziness, that lightness--

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:26.300 align:middle line:84%
and then being able to explain,
OK, that has an airiness to it.

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:29.210 align:middle line:84%
That's going to give an
airiness to the physiology.

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And then he asked, well, where
does that airiness come from?

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:34.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's the breakdown
of carbonic acid.

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:37.160 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's very acidic.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.280 align:middle line:84%
So that's going to have a
very fiery effect, as well.

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:43.970 align:middle line:84%
So just taking things and
knowing the qualities,

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:46.990 align:middle line:84%
then we know what's going
to happen to the physiology.

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And if we put someone
on a diet of soda,

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:53.300 align:middle line:84%
that acidity is going
to increase fire.

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to increase
the propensity towards things

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:59.210 align:middle line:84%
like gastritis,
things like ulcers,

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:01.280 align:middle line:90%
and problems with inflammation.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And so Ayurveda, in its
essence, is commonsensical.

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:10.520 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to go through
years and years of training

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:14.900 align:middle line:84%
in order to begin to
apply it to your life.

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:19.480 align:middle line:84%
>> If you have eaten a healthy
breakfast, you are not hungry.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.750 align:middle line:90%
Your mood is going to be better.

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:24.950 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
have quick sugars

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:28.790 align:middle line:84%
or high-caffeinated beverages
for you to function.

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:33.200 align:middle line:84%
Keeping your sugar levels in
balance throughout the day

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:37.130 align:middle line:84%
becomes very important for not
only your body, for your mind

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:38.990 align:middle line:90%
and emotions, too.

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:46.820 align:middle line:10%
So you can always have nuts
to snack on or a fresh fruit

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:52.880 align:middle line:10%
to snack on to keep the
glycemic index even all

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:56.420 align:middle line:10%
throughout the day,

00:17:56.420 --> 00:18:00.230 align:middle line:10%
In Ayurveda, being in
balance becomes so important.

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:03.440 align:middle line:84%
There is a daily routine
that we need to follow.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.870 align:middle line:84%
Even in the rhythm
of the nature, when

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:10.580 align:middle line:84%
we look at the morning
sunrise, the heat of the sun

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:12.600 align:middle line:90%
is not very strong.

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:18.740 align:middle line:84%
So the sun itself is
compared to our metabolism.

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:21.380 align:middle line:84%
So knowing that, in
the early morning,

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:25.580 align:middle line:84%
we are not actually having
that high metabolism.

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:28.500 align:middle line:84%
So a light breakfast in
Ayurveda is recommended.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:32.180 align:middle line:10%
And when we are really hungry,
which is in between 11:00

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:35.000 align:middle line:10%
and 2:00 in the afternoon--
that's our highest metabolic

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:35.960 align:middle line:10%
rate--

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:39.440 align:middle line:10%
that's when we need to
eat our highest protein.

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And towards the evening,
when the sun goes down,

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:44.840 align:middle line:90%
our metabolism is low.

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:48.470 align:middle line:84%
That's when we have to eat,
again, early, light dinners.

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And we have to go to bed
with our stomachs empty.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.710 align:middle line:84%
Another very important
thing in Ayurveda

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:58.580 align:middle line:84%
is not to have
ice in your water.

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:02.240 align:middle line:84%
What that does is it just
extinguishes your fire

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.250 align:middle line:90%
when you're actually eating.

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:08.630 align:middle line:84%
So instead of fueling the
fire, you are putting it out.

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:13.100 align:middle line:84%
>> The idea is to choose foods
and lifestyle activities that

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:15.650 align:middle line:84%
align you with your
natural constitution.

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:18.530 align:middle line:84%
If we're on that
path, we won't be

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:21.320 align:middle line:90%
creating ama inside the body.

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the funny
thing about the 80/20 principle.

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:28.670 align:middle line:84%
The 80/20 principle is eat
super consistent with what

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:30.500 align:middle line:90%
your body absolutely needs.

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And then there's that
20% of play we can have,

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:34.940 align:middle line:84%
where if you want
that ice cream, sure,

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.320 align:middle line:90%
you can have the ice cream.

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And if we live by
these rules usually,

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:42.410 align:middle line:84%
we don't stray too much to
be creating an excess amount

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:44.430 align:middle line:90%
of ama in the body.

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:47.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is where having the
concept of the doshas and being

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:52.220 align:middle line:84%
able to describe ourselves,
our nature in terms of these

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:57.260 align:middle line:84%
tendencies, these qualities,
that affords us a blueprint

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:01.510 align:middle line:84%
for us to be able to
then organize diet,

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:04.190 align:middle line:84%
organize routine,
organize activities,

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:08.660 align:middle line:84%
organize supplements in order
to prevent things from going out

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:10.200 align:middle line:90%
of whack.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:13.250 align:middle line:84%
Knowing that, we can then
take preventive measures.

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:15.900 align:middle line:10%
We can do foods
that are grounded.

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:19.070 align:middle line:10%
We can do routine
that is very regular,

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:22.850 align:middle line:10%
and settled, and
forms a structure

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:26.730 align:middle line:10%
for that grounding-ness that
that airy individual needs.

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:30.140 align:middle line:84%
So there are many
angles of prevention

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:32.020 align:middle line:90%
that either Ayurveda holds--

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:38.480 align:middle line:84%
that it is not only tuned in
to the doshas that make up

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:43.160 align:middle line:84%
our physiology but also tuned
in to the qualities in nature,

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:47.670 align:middle line:84%
the qualities in foods,
spices, herbs, and so forth.

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:52.690 align:middle line:84%
>> So Ayurveda really
values regular meal times.

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:55.550 align:middle line:84%
It really values
sitting down to eat,

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:58.880 align:middle line:84%
sitting and eating in
a relaxed atmosphere

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:02.780 align:middle line:84%
with gentle conversation,
with devices

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:05.420 align:middle line:84%
all put away on a
beautiful table that's

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:08.960 align:middle line:90%
cleared of anything extraneous.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And this ritual of eating
with friends or with family

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:22.430 align:middle line:84%
allows us to extract the
most nutrition from the food.

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:25.120 align:middle line:84%
It allows us to
extract livelihood,

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:28.540 align:middle line:84%
liveliness from the
food that we're eating.

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:30.950 align:middle line:84%
If we eat in a very hurried
way, a distracted way

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:33.680 align:middle line:84%
while we're driving,
while we're standing,

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:37.400 align:middle line:84%
we aren't placing our
attention and our consciousness

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:40.490 align:middle line:84%
into what we're doing,
and it confuses our body.

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:43.850 align:middle line:84%
So to be reading or
to be on a device

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:49.490 align:middle line:84%
while simultaneously eating,
the mind and the body are split.

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And in this way, we
cause disjuncture.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:52.650 align:middle line:90%
We cause disharmony.

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:54.360 align:middle line:90%
We cause disease.

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:56.960 align:middle line:84%
So we place our
attention on the food.

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.010 align:middle line:90%
We savor it.

00:21:58.010 --> 00:21:59.460 align:middle line:90%
We enjoy it.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And this is almost
more important

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:07.040 align:middle line:84%
than what particular
food we eat.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:12.230 align:middle line:10%
>> When I teach cooking classes,
I have people experience

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:18.200 align:middle line:10%
the food and experience
first the joy of it,

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:21.800 align:middle line:10%
and the pleasure of it, and the
vibrancy of it before I explain

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:26.870 align:middle line:10%
anything about it so that they
can see in their own awareness,

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:30.200 align:middle line:10%
and start to hone their
intuition, and start to listen.

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:33.760 align:middle line:84%
Oh, my body really
liked that sourness.

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.230 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, what is
that telling you?

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:41.540 align:middle line:84%
So like that, tuning into our
own intelligence, the body's

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:48.270 align:middle line:84%
own wisdom, is fundamental in
terms of diet and Ayurveda.

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:53.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Ayurveda is really a
system of self-healing.

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:57.100 align:middle line:84%
It's not a system of
relinquishing your power over

00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:58.690 align:middle line:90%
to an expert.

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:03.130 align:middle line:84%
Rather, it is learning
simple tools and techniques

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:06.820 align:middle line:84%
to empower yourself to bring
yourself into your highest

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:09.163 align:middle line:90%
state of well-being.
