00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.520 align:middle line:10%
>> In the past, leading up to
now, we saw diabetes, obesity,

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.470 align:middle line:10%
heart disease as the leading
killers in Western society.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And now they're predicting that
anxiety, depression, and anger,

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.130 align:middle line:84%
the mental diseases
are going to be causing

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.515 align:middle line:90%
a lot of illnesses and deaths.

00:00:35.515 --> 00:00:44.270 align:middle line:90%


00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.030 align:middle line:10%
>> Being a physician, I
really understand that many

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.450 align:middle line:10%
of the conditions that are
prevalent in our society are

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.920 align:middle line:10%
stress related.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.530 align:middle line:10%
Stress is a huge component.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.050 align:middle line:10%
And it's not something
that modern medicine really

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.670 align:middle line:10%
has very efficient
tools to work with.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.360 align:middle line:90%


00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.270 align:middle line:84%
Contrast that with
Ayurveda, Ayurveda

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.490 align:middle line:84%
understands this
intimate connection

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.260 align:middle line:90%
between mind and body.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.880 align:middle line:10%
It understands how emotions
and emotional perception

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.550 align:middle line:10%
and the digestion of emotion
has an impact on our ability

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.630 align:middle line:10%
to either ward off stress,
to process it, digest it,

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.130 align:middle line:10%
and not have it affect us, or
it will have an impact that

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.970 align:middle line:10%
is damaging and imbalancing.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.820 align:middle line:10%
>> Collectively, we are
experiencing a time of great

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.150 align:middle line:10%
stress, of environmental
pollutions, of toxins,

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.850 align:middle line:10%
of energetic pollution.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.880 align:middle line:84%
We have WIFI around
us all the time.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.880 align:middle line:90%
We have toxins in our food.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.120 align:middle line:10%
And Ayurveda provides
so many tools for us

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.940 align:middle line:10%
to sooth, to calm, to
come back into balance,

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.060 align:middle line:10%
and to not create
barriers between us

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.790 align:middle line:10%
and others, us and
the external world,

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.730 align:middle line:10%
but, yet, to maintain ourselves
and to invite in harmony while

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.920 align:middle line:10%
still being in the world.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.010 align:middle line:90%


00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.480 align:middle line:84%
>> We need to take into account,
like, what are we watching?

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.150 align:middle line:84%
How are we taking
in information?

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.640 align:middle line:84%
Through these beautiful
five sense organs.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.325 align:middle line:84%
You know this is
[NON-ENGLISH] yoga.

00:02:40.325 --> 00:02:43.330 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
causes of disease.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.440 align:middle line:84%
Associations with negative
things from the outside world,

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.560 align:middle line:84%
bringing them into
the body, things

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.780 align:middle line:84%
that are not beneficial to
our beautiful mental state,

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.340 align:middle line:84%
such as bad sounds, sights,
watching violent things

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.930 align:middle line:90%
in film or television.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.570 align:middle line:84%
We want to make sure that all
of the things we're bringing

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.170 align:middle line:84%
into our external environment
are creating a beautiful place

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.220 align:middle line:90%
within ourselves.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.940 align:middle line:84%
>> So we don't remove
ourselves from the world,

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.860 align:middle line:84%
we thrive in the
world where we are.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.540 align:middle line:90%


00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Heart disease is so common.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.420 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.500 align:middle line:84%
Because of stress, eating
habits, fast foods,

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.290 align:middle line:84%
processed foods, not eating
in the rhythm of the nature,

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.370 align:middle line:84%
not getting good sleep,
overly using your senses.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.670 align:middle line:84%
All of these contributions
to manifesting heart disease

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.280 align:middle line:90%
or cancer.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And emotional impressions
that are deeply embedded,

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.290 align:middle line:84%
which we ignore, we have to
address them and let them go.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.350 align:middle line:84%
Our emotions are balanced
when we are positive,

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.080 align:middle line:84%
when we are happy, and
we look forward to life.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:08.050 align:middle line:84%
But if we have an imbalanced
state of emotions, what is it?

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.440 align:middle line:84%
Either you're
angry, you're hurt,

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.700 align:middle line:84%
or you've experienced
some trauma.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:20.740 align:middle line:84%
In Ayurveda, we have to process
and sit with those emotions

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.820 align:middle line:84%
and actually go through
them and analyze them.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.210 align:middle line:84%
The use of talk therapy,
the use of healthy diet

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.070 align:middle line:84%
that can help you change
your thinking into

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.140 align:middle line:84%
positive and
rational, and the use

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.460 align:middle line:84%
of herbs that is recommended for
whatever you're going through,

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.210 align:middle line:84%
there is a lot of support in
getting your mental balance

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.410 align:middle line:90%
back through Ayurveda.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.572 align:middle line:90%


00:04:47.572 --> 00:04:50.830 align:middle line:84%
Vitality in Ayurveda
is called prana.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.950 align:middle line:84%
So when we are depleted
in our vitality,

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.260 align:middle line:84%
we just cannot
function properly.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.660 align:middle line:84%
We experience symptoms like
fatigue, lack of energy, sleep,

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.390 align:middle line:84%
and just not motivated
to do anything.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't see you
do have a lot of toxins

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.630 align:middle line:90%
in your large intestine.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.110 align:middle line:84%
As an Ayurveda doctor and
a mental health counselor,

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.720 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you
Ayurvedic psychology

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.090 align:middle line:84%
plays a very
important role in how

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.590 align:middle line:84%
I approach mental
health counseling

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.020 align:middle line:90%
in my private practice.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.130 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about your sleep?

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:29.206 align:middle line:90%
>> My sleep?

00:05:29.206 --> 00:05:30.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it could
probably be better.

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Ayurveda defines the
imbalances of our mind

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:42.030 align:middle line:84%
and emotions, especially when
we look at the vata imbalance,

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.470 align:middle line:90%
it causing anxiety.

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And the pitta imbalance
causing anger.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:53.220 align:middle line:84%
And the kapha imbalance
causing depression.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.700 align:middle line:84%
>> We can talk about having
physical ama which will be

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.520 align:middle line:84%
undigested food in
the digestive tract.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And it creates chronic
illness and chronic pain.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.140 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, we can also
have undigested emotion.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.990 align:middle line:84%
And that will cause
us a lot of pain

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.850 align:middle line:90%
as we repress those emotions.

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.770 align:middle line:84%
We don't deal with
those emotions.

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.020 align:middle line:90%
We can have undigested stress.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.270 align:middle line:90%
We can have undigested thought.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.620 align:middle line:84%
So, while we want to take
measures to strengthen

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.140 align:middle line:84%
our physical
digestion, we also want

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.470 align:middle line:84%
to take measures to
strengthen emotional digestion

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.750 align:middle line:90%
and mental digestion.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.950 align:middle line:84%
>> When we are
digesting emotion,

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:39.920 align:middle line:84%
what comes out in the
end is liveliness.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.110 align:middle line:84%
When we're struggling with
emotion, what comes out

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:44.810 align:middle line:90%
is stress.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:49.610 align:middle line:84%
And so understanding digestion
doesn't just apply to food.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.130 align:middle line:90%
It applies to emotion.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:56.030 align:middle line:84%
It applies to everything that
we take in through the senses.

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.780 align:middle line:90%
All of life gets metabolized.

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.620 align:middle line:84%
And if we're able to do
that efficiently, if we're

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:08.870 align:middle line:84%
able to do that thoroughly,
then we have vibrancy.

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.380 align:middle line:84%
If not, then we have stress
and stress related disease.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.880 align:middle line:90%


00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:19.090 align:middle line:84%
>> The way to boost our
vitality or our prana,

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:24.650 align:middle line:84%
we can do that by getting the
right amount of sleep every day

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:31.420 align:middle line:84%
and by eating healthy foods,
and also by being in sync with

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:32.500 align:middle line:90%
nature.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:33.940 align:middle line:90%
That's very important.

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:39.040 align:middle line:84%
Waking up early
morning and meditating.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.280 align:middle line:84%
In Ayurveda, we look at
five different bodies--

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.640 align:middle line:84%
physical body, the mental
body, the emotional body,

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.920 align:middle line:84%
and the spiritual body, and,
of course, the breath body.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.690 align:middle line:84%
So if we hit all these
bodies every day,

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:54.652 align:middle line:84%
we're going to feel
really energized.

00:07:54.652 --> 00:07:57.610 align:middle line:90%


00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:01.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Oftentimes, I have clients
coming to me for weight loss,

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:02.990 align:middle line:90%
in particular.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.270 align:middle line:84%
Many people in the world
are experiencing a lot

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:06.930 align:middle line:90%
of heaviness in their body.

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And one of the first things
that I'll talk to them about

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.810 align:middle line:84%
is whether there is an emotional
component to why their body is

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:16.370 align:middle line:90%
retaining weight--

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:20.540 align:middle line:84%
to stay grounded, to stay
stable, to stay powerful.

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:27.050 align:middle line:84%
I could put them on any diet and
that weight usually won't go.

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:29.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Especially, if you're
eating when you're stressed,

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:31.790 align:middle line:84%
your cortisone levels are
very high in your body.

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And when you're stressed,
you're eating, it causes what?

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.049 align:middle line:90%
Emotional eating.

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:37.730 align:middle line:84%
You're going to eat
what kind of foods?

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:42.620 align:middle line:84%
More sugar, more carbs, you
know, and drink more caffeine

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.000 align:middle line:90%
to calm yourself down.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And that is going
to throw you off.

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:48.020 align:middle line:90%
And we do that mindlessly.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And that is not good
for our vitality.

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:57.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Really, we need to understand
the emotional causes in that

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:58.530 align:middle line:90%
weight retention.

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:02.450 align:middle line:84%
So we need to look at when the
weight began to accumulate, why

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.460 align:middle line:84%
it's there, and how
that weight might

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.830 align:middle line:90%
be serving that individual.

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And then we need
to create harmony

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:12.500 align:middle line:84%
so that there is no
longer a reason for them

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.300 align:middle line:90%
to be retaining that weight.

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And then the weight
goes so easily.

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:21.420 align:middle line:84%
>> I understand that these
days we are very busy.

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:25.810 align:middle line:84%
And we have to optimize the
time we have and how we eat.

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And the digestion
starts in your mouth.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.210 align:middle line:84%
The enzyme's produce
in your saliva.

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:33.720 align:middle line:84%
It is broken down and then the
hydrochloric acid takes over

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.220 align:middle line:90%
and the food is digested.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:38.560 align:middle line:84%
The food in the stomach can
only stay for some time.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.740 align:middle line:84%
So we have to make
sure that when we eat,

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:46.200 align:middle line:84%
we have to pay attention and
make sure that the food is

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.480 align:middle line:90%
completely digested.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.920 align:middle line:10%
And no matter what, it's
going to take it's time.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.560 align:middle line:90%
You cannot rush anything.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.170 align:middle line:84%
If you are eating in
that rushed, hurried way

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:58.200 align:middle line:84%
and just gobbling up your
food, and you are really

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:02.550 align:middle line:84%
not secreting the juices and
giving it time to digest,

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:05.010 align:middle line:84%
the food is going
to pass through

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:07.170 align:middle line:90%
without being digested properly.

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:12.090 align:middle line:84%
And it is going to form what
we call ama in Ayurveda.

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:13.590 align:middle line:90%
That is toxins.

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And those toxins are going
to be absorbed in our system

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:23.310 align:middle line:84%
and manifest in the form
of discomfort or disease.

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:28.080 align:middle line:84%
That is why these days you
see a lot of imbalances.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:32.130 align:middle line:84%
Not mindful about
these routines is

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:34.530 align:middle line:90%
making us more sick than ever.

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:37.240 align:middle line:90%


00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:40.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Just imagine
that a cup of water,

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:44.020 align:middle line:84%
if you keep filling that cup
of water and you drink it,

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.950 align:middle line:90%
it's empty.

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:49.710 align:middle line:84%
But then if you keep on
filling that cup of water,

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:50.740 align:middle line:90%
it overflows.

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:55.590 align:middle line:84%
That overflowing of water is
the imbalance in your doshas.

00:10:55.590 --> 00:11:00.300 align:middle line:84%
As long as it is contained,
then you're in balance.

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.360 align:middle line:84%
Say, you are a vata
constitution person.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:08.100 align:middle line:84%
You have a tendency to suffer
with nervous disorders.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And emotionally,
you're prone to anxiety

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.610 align:middle line:90%
if you have a vata imbalance.

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:17.340 align:middle line:84%
But if you're a pitta
constitution person,

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:21.330 align:middle line:84%
you are prone to
metabolic disorders.

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And the pitta imbalance
causing anger.

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And then if you're the kapha
constitution, emotionally.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.830 align:middle line:90%
You're prone to depression.

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:33.810 align:middle line:84%
The Ayurvedic psychological
models of treatment

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:37.070 align:middle line:84%
are threefold-- the
Daivavyapasharaya,

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:39.860 align:middle line:84%
the Yuktivyapashraya,
and the Sattvavajaya.

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:42.120 align:middle line:84%
The Daivavyapasharaya
treatment relates

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.260 align:middle line:90%
to the divine interventions--

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:49.170 align:middle line:84%
with prayers, mantras,
yantras, and Tantra.

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:52.620 align:middle line:90%
Those are passive approaches.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And the Yuktivyapashraya
is with the use

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:59.190 align:middle line:84%
of herbs and other balancing
lifestyle approaches.

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:03.750 align:middle line:84%
And the Sattvavajaya treatment
is the counseling piece.

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:05.580 align:middle line:10%
For you, I would
also recommend you

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:08.370 align:middle line:10%
doing a sort of like an
alternate nostril breathing.

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:09.240 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:13.560 align:middle line:10%
>> And it works beautifully
with balancing the doshas

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:17.790 align:middle line:10%
and bringing them to a state
where they can actually

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:20.050 align:middle line:10%
function normally.

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:22.680 align:middle line:84%
>> So if we think about
that, how will that translate

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:26.740 align:middle line:84%
to the physiology and
to the nervous system?

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:30.870 align:middle line:84%
>> For example, if there
is a traumatic experience,

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:35.020 align:middle line:84%
each one of us react or
respond to it differently.

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:37.920 align:middle line:84%
There are some people
who are very sensitive

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.590 align:middle line:84%
and have less
tolerance to trauma.

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:42.360 align:middle line:90%
And they're affected more.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:46.020 align:middle line:84%
But then there are some people
it does not bother them.

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:49.260 align:middle line:84%
There is a trauma, yes, and
what just happened is not good.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:50.520 align:middle line:90%
There is empathy.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:54.330 align:middle line:84%
But then that does not
affect them to produce any

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:58.130 align:middle line:84%
psychosomatic diseases that they
cannot function in this world.

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:00.740 align:middle line:90%


00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:05.500 align:middle line:84%
Some easy tips that you
can do to help yourself

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.800 align:middle line:84%
when you're upset, or
when you're disturbed,

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:12.970 align:middle line:84%
or when you're worried, is
to just sit with yourself

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:14.140 align:middle line:90%
and breathe.

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:16.220 align:middle line:90%
Watch how you're breathing.

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:17.740 align:middle line:84%
You will notice
when you're going

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:20.680 align:middle line:84%
through these type of
emotions, your breath

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:23.140 align:middle line:90%
becomes shallow And?

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:26.980 align:middle line:84%
The types of thoughts
you're engaged in.

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:28.060 align:middle line:90%
Take a break.

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:29.890 align:middle line:90%
Break the circuit.

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:32.980 align:middle line:84%
Create that space between
you and your thoughts.

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And anchor yourself
with your breath.

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:41.370 align:middle line:84%
When you do that every day
for about even 10 minutes,

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:42.760 align:middle line:90%
there is a big difference.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:46.990 align:middle line:84%
If you have to go to work,
you cannot find time,

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:49.430 align:middle line:84%
sit in your car in the
parking lot and do it.

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:51.850 align:middle line:84%
You will be only
with yourself there.

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:54.190 align:middle line:90%
Get into that quiet space.

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:57.040 align:middle line:84%
First, before you
go, you're going

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.300 align:middle line:90%
to feel a whole lot better.

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:01.190 align:middle line:90%


00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:04.540 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're always looking at
the relative state of imbalance

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:07.900 align:middle line:84%
in the body and trying to apply
measures that will bring us

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:12.430 align:middle line:84%
into greater balance
and greater harmony.

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:15.340 align:middle line:84%
>> What I have found, from
someone who's experienced

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:18.760 align:middle line:84%
periods of depression, somebody
who has experienced periods

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:22.990 align:middle line:84%
of anxiety, when I'm on
my self-care practices,

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:26.500 align:middle line:84%
when I'm doing my meditation,
when I'm being physical

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:31.330 align:middle line:84%
in my body, I'm not dropping
into these anxiety states,

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.810 align:middle line:84%
into these states of depression,
when I'm making really good

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:39.800 align:middle line:84%
choices about what I'm
eating, when I'm eating it.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:44.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Weight loss diets,
anything that is processed,

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:51.140 align:middle line:84%
anything that does not come
naturally is definitely not

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:53.390 align:middle line:90%
good for anybody.

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:56.750 align:middle line:90%
That's how we accumulate toxins.

00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:01.190 align:middle line:84%
When we are unconscious
and blind to just being

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:03.650 align:middle line:84%
attracted to the
advertisements, that's

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:05.870 align:middle line:84%
how we lose connection
with the source.

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:08.180 align:middle line:84%
If we start to
listen to ourselves

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:10.190 align:middle line:84%
and listen to our
body and actually

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:13.430 align:middle line:84%
take some time
mindfully to even see

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:16.970 align:middle line:84%
what is in that food that
is being packaged so well

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:21.200 align:middle line:84%
and sold to you,
even a few minutes

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.310 align:middle line:90%
will make a huge difference.

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:26.630 align:middle line:10%
When a client comes to me, all
I have to do is look at them

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:29.940 align:middle line:10%
and their constitution and
everything just opens up just

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:30.740 align:middle line:10%
like that.

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:33.680 align:middle line:84%
They don't even have
to tell me everything.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:37.820 align:middle line:84%
The same thing applies to
our mental health also.

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.245 align:middle line:84%
When a person is
suffering from anxiety,

00:15:40.245 --> 00:15:44.210 align:middle line:84%
their air and space
element is very high.

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:46.310 align:middle line:90%
They are spacey.

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And their thought
processes are running wild.

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:51.570 align:middle line:90%
And they cannot focus.

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:54.950 align:middle line:84%
So what we need to
do with those clients

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:59.720 align:middle line:84%
is to help them with more
approaches that can calm them

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:04.560 align:middle line:84%
down, which involves the
water and the earth element,

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:07.310 align:middle line:90%
which means grounding.

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:10.730 align:middle line:84%
Normally, with anxiety, the
sympathetic nervous system

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:13.331 align:middle line:90%
is hyperactive.

00:16:13.331 --> 00:16:15.980 align:middle line:84%
So in our body, we
have a nervous system.

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And the nervous
system comprises of

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.466 align:middle line:84%
the sympathetic and
parasympathetic.

00:16:19.466 --> 00:16:24.050 align:middle line:84%
So the sympathetic nervous
system is when we think a lot

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:26.960 align:middle line:84%
and we use our brain
to do activities,

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:29.270 align:middle line:90%
to read, to study, to work.

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And our parasympathetic
nervous system

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:35.780 align:middle line:84%
is when we are in our body,
when blood circulation needs

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:38.120 align:middle line:90%
to go internally.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:41.810 align:middle line:84%
So our food, when we
eat, is digested properly

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:44.060 align:middle line:84%
and the enzymes are
secreted properly

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:47.020 align:middle line:90%
for wholesome digestion.

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:50.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Ayurveda has several
different levels on which

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:54.200 align:middle line:90%
it's able to work with stress.

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.020 align:middle line:84%
First, on the level
of meditation,

00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:02.600 align:middle line:84%
which, in Ayurvedic terms, is
connecting directly to source.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:06.619 align:middle line:84%
That deep connection
is something

00:17:06.619 --> 00:17:08.390 align:middle line:90%
that gives us strength.

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:12.829 align:middle line:84%
It gives us ojas, the ability
to have life force, the ability

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:15.810 align:middle line:90%
to resist the impact of stress.

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:18.619 align:middle line:84%
It is also something
that allows us

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:21.099 align:middle line:84%
to release the egoic
patterning that

00:17:21.099 --> 00:17:25.550 align:middle line:84%
can serve as frequent triggers
for stressful reactions.

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:28.170 align:middle line:90%


00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:32.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Meditation, really good for
the ama because what meditation

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:36.800 align:middle line:84%
does is it helps to constantly
re-entrain the nervous system

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:41.690 align:middle line:84%
to a more parasympathetic state
into a state where we're not

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:45.680 align:middle line:84%
focused on stressors, where
we're not allowing external

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:51.260 align:middle line:84%
influences to radically change
the way which we feel inside.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:58.440 align:middle line:84%
A lot of ama or blockage in
the flow begins energetically.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:02.150 align:middle line:84%
So if we're fine tuning
with yogic and meditation

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:06.050 align:middle line:84%
techniques, if we're fine tuning
our inner corner frequency,

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:09.140 align:middle line:84%
meaning our nervous system
and the state of the mind,

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:12.890 align:middle line:84%
being able to shed and
release emotions that are not

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:17.330 align:middle line:84%
beneficial for us, and then
tune in with proper diet,

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:18.890 align:middle line:84%
you know, these
three things help

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:21.740 align:middle line:84%
to regulate ama production in
the body and proper disposal

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:22.540 align:middle line:90%
of all of it.

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:25.570 align:middle line:90%


00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>> The state of bliss
is a state of truth.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:38.650 align:middle line:84%
It's not just an overlayering
of fast positivity or grasping

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:40.120 align:middle line:90%
of happiness.
