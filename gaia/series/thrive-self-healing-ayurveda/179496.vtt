00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.270 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.499 align:middle line:84%
>> Come into a nice
upright seated posture.

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:17.040 align:middle line:10%
For this meditation, we're going
to begin with the breathwork

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.990 align:middle line:10%
technique known as Chandra
Bhedana Pranayama or lunar

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.550 align:middle line:10%
channel breathing.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be mirroring you.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.980 align:middle line:10%
So we're going to take our
left hand into Chin Mudra,

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.520 align:middle line:10%
index finger and thumb
together palm down,

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.700 align:middle line:10%
and we going to take our right
hand into Vishnu Mudra, index

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.340 align:middle line:10%
finger, middle finger
into the pad of the palm,

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.110 align:middle line:10%
and we're just going
to be alternating

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.260 align:middle line:10%
inhaling through
your left nostril

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.270 align:middle line:10%
and then exhaling
through the right.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.550 align:middle line:90%
Inhaling left, exhaling right.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.860 align:middle line:90%
And so let's do that one time.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.190 align:middle line:90%
So go ahead and block right.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.160 align:middle line:84%
Inhale through your left
for a five count, block,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.170 align:middle line:84%
and then we're going
to exhale right.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.970 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.720 align:middle line:84%
So feel free to join me with
your eyes open or closed.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.080 align:middle line:84%
But I invite you to do
this with your eyes closed.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.190 align:middle line:84%
So let's go ahead and close
your eyes, softening the belly,

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.980 align:middle line:90%
and slowly inhaling abdomen out.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.850 align:middle line:90%


00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.170 align:middle line:90%
Exhale completely.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.246 align:middle line:84%
Empty the lungs,
draw the navel in.

00:01:29.246 --> 00:01:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to pause with
the breath out for a moment.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.110 align:middle line:90%


00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And then slowly begin to
inhale, belly expanding out.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.330 align:middle line:90%


00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.070 align:middle line:90%
Exhale, draw the navel in.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.715 align:middle line:90%
Completely empty your lungs.

00:01:49.715 --> 00:01:52.925 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to pause with
the breath out for a moment.

00:01:52.925 --> 00:01:57.030 align:middle line:90%


00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.060 align:middle line:84%
And then beginning your
inhalation softly, last one.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.860 align:middle line:90%
Inhale, belly expands out.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.780 align:middle line:90%


00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.410 align:middle line:84%
Exhale, draw the navel in,
completely emptying the lungs.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.170 align:middle line:84%
Pause for a moment
with the breath out.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.770 align:middle line:90%


00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to go ahead
and block the right nostril

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:25.750 align:middle line:90%
with your thumb.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.600 align:middle line:10%
Inhale through the left
for a count of five,

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:36.230 align:middle line:10%
four, block left,
exhale right, five.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.890 align:middle line:90%


00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.510 align:middle line:90%
Inhale left five.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.430 align:middle line:90%


00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.450 align:middle line:90%
Block left.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.760 align:middle line:90%
Exhale right five.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.920 align:middle line:90%


00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.190 align:middle line:90%
Block right.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.990 align:middle line:90%
Inhale left.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:05.440 align:middle line:90%


00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.530 align:middle line:90%
Block left, exhale right.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.000 align:middle line:90%


00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.740 align:middle line:90%
Block right, inhale left.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:20.850 align:middle line:90%


00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.910 align:middle line:90%
Block left, exhale right.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:32.030 align:middle line:90%


00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.700 align:middle line:90%
Block right, inhale left.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.700 align:middle line:90%


00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.480 align:middle line:90%
Block left, exhale right.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.820 align:middle line:90%


00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.795 align:middle line:90%
Block right, inhale left.

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:56.270 align:middle line:90%


00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.530 align:middle line:90%
Block left, exhale right.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.810 align:middle line:90%


00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:05.690 align:middle line:90%
Block right.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:06.490 align:middle line:90%
Inhale left.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:12.990 align:middle line:90%


00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.815 align:middle line:90%
Block left, exhale right.

00:04:14.815 --> 00:04:18.690 align:middle line:90%


00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.310 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do three
more rounds on your own.

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.180 align:middle line:90%
Block right.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.650 align:middle line:90%
Begin.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:23.500 align:middle line:90%
Inhale left.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:38.230 align:middle line:90%


00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.260 align:middle line:90%
Beginning round two.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:53.630 align:middle line:90%


00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:54.800 align:middle line:90%
Beginning round three.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:02.650 align:middle line:90%


00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.190 align:middle line:84%
Exhale everything out
of the right nostril.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.440 align:middle line:90%


00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.700 align:middle line:90%
Eyes closed.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:11.870 align:middle line:90%
Release.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.930 align:middle line:84%
Left hand down, index
finger and thumb touching,

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.520 align:middle line:90%
palms facing down.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:22.057 align:middle line:90%


00:05:22.057 --> 00:05:22.890 align:middle line:90%
Soften your abdomen.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.810 align:middle line:90%


00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.690 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to slow
your breathing down

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.760 align:middle line:84%
to about a quarter of
your normal breath.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.980 align:middle line:90%


00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:46.380 align:middle line:84%
And bring your attention to
the upper palate of the mouth

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.720 align:middle line:84%
and down towards the
back of the throat.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.680 align:middle line:90%


00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.830 align:middle line:84%
I want you to feel the
sensation of the breath

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:03.050 align:middle line:84%
rubbing, coming in and
out through the nostrils,

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:12.230 align:middle line:84%
rubbing in this area, back
of the upper throat at about

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:21.890 align:middle line:84%
a quarter of your normal
breath, visualizing

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:31.080 align:middle line:84%
a brightening there, feeling the
subtle vibration of the breath.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.140 align:middle line:90%


00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:40.210 align:middle line:84%
It is a very subtle
Ujjayi breathing.

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.090 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the
sensation rubbing

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.910 align:middle line:84%
against the upper palate and
back of the upper throat.

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:51.760 align:middle line:90%


00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.810 align:middle line:84%
You may begin to feel a
certain fuzziness there.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.270 align:middle line:90%
That's perfect.

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:00.910 align:middle line:90%
And if not, that's OK too.

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:10.470 align:middle line:90%


00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:16.980 align:middle line:84%
Finding yourself, your
body, in a restful state,

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:21.870 align:middle line:84%
continuing with that
breath, hearing,

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:27.090 align:middle line:84%
feeling the vibration running
against the upper palate, back

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:29.610 align:middle line:90%
of the upper throat.

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And now we'll take
Kechari Mudra.

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:36.090 align:middle line:84%
Take the tip of your
tongue up the palate

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:41.010 align:middle line:84%
and slide it back until
you find a rough patch.

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:43.500 align:middle line:84%
Now I want you to back
off and bring it back

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:49.750 align:middle line:84%
to the very last part
of the smooth palate,

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:52.300 align:middle line:84%
very gently touching the
tip of your tongue there.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.521 align:middle line:90%
No straining.

00:07:53.521 --> 00:07:58.240 align:middle line:90%


00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And next take your right hand
to the very top of your head.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:14.220 align:middle line:84%
Touch the top of
your head, the crown,

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:18.180 align:middle line:84%
tip of the tongue to
the roof of the mouth,

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:20.610 align:middle line:84%
hand's in the very
top crown of the head.

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:24.630 align:middle line:90%


00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:27.820 align:middle line:90%
Go inside.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:31.390 align:middle line:84%
Find the relationship between
the tip of your tongue

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:35.230 align:middle line:84%
at the roof of the mouth
and your fingertips

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:37.760 align:middle line:90%
at the top of the head.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:42.409 align:middle line:84%
Draw a line between
the two points.

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:44.120 align:middle line:90%
And now find the center.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.330 align:middle line:90%


00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:48.230 align:middle line:90%
Find the center.

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:50.950 align:middle line:90%


00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:57.840 align:middle line:84%
Target the center,
visualizing a full moon there.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.560 align:middle line:90%


00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And once you've gotten it, you
can release the hand back down,

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:16.990 align:middle line:84%
keeping your internal gaze
floating on the white moon

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:18.310 align:middle line:90%
in the center of your brain.

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:20.940 align:middle line:90%


00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:22.865 align:middle line:90%
This is the seat of your mind.

00:09:22.865 --> 00:09:26.800 align:middle line:90%


00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:31.460 align:middle line:84%
It is at the very center
of your mind and thoughts.

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:39.480 align:middle line:90%


00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Now with your
attention there, I'd

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:49.860 align:middle line:84%
like you to bring in a
contemplative thought

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:55.080 align:middle line:84%
with the understanding
that you are not the mind.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:58.340 align:middle line:90%


00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:05.380 align:middle line:10%
You are the witness ever
present in the background

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:17.640 align:middle line:10%
of your thoughts, emotions,
internal experiences

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:25.340 align:middle line:10%
with this stillness, this ever
present awareness resting,

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:31.820 align:middle line:10%
observant, silent witness
in the background.

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:34.600 align:middle line:10%


00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:38.470 align:middle line:10%
Visualize the white moon in
the center of your brain.

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:42.050 align:middle line:90%


00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:45.140 align:middle line:10%
And once again bringing
in the contemplation.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:48.350 align:middle line:90%


00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:49.550 align:middle line:90%
I am not the mind.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:52.120 align:middle line:90%


00:10:52.120 --> 00:11:02.170 align:middle line:84%
I am the ever present
witness, unchanging, still.

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:14.560 align:middle line:90%


00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:18.630 align:middle line:84%
We'll continue with this
observation of the moon.

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:24.870 align:middle line:90%


00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And if any random thoughts
begin to lead you astray,

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:34.590 align:middle line:84%
come back to the
witnessing of the moon

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:37.980 align:middle line:90%
and the inner contemplation.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.950 align:middle line:90%
I am not the mind.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:46.480 align:middle line:84%
I am the silent witness
who observes all thoughts

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:47.280 align:middle line:90%
and emotions.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:12:49.260 align:middle line:90%


00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:56.890 align:middle line:84%
Take a slow breath in through
the nostrils, part the lips,

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:58.940 align:middle line:90%
and exhale softly out the mouth.

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:01.990 align:middle line:90%


00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:08.150 align:middle line:84%
Release the tongue from
the roof of your mouth

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:10.110 align:middle line:84%
and slowly bring
the hands together

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:14.840 align:middle line:84%
at the heart in what's
called Anjali Mudra,

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.180 align:middle line:84%
leaving a small space

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And even before
you open your eyes,

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:26.040 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to once
again internally repeat

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.500 align:middle line:90%
the contemplation.

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:36.140 align:middle line:84%
I am not the mind, but I am
the silent witness observing

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:37.380 align:middle line:90%
in the background of things.

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:40.450 align:middle line:90%


00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And even as you now open the
eyes halfway into the hands,

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:48.450 align:middle line:84%
slowly bringing that same
level of consciousness

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:56.100 align:middle line:84%
with you now into the
awakened outside world,

00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:01.790 align:middle line:84%
see if you can take this
idea with you into your day.
