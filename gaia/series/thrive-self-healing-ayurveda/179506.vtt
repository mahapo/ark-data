00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.510 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Namaste.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.550 align:middle line:10%
Welcome to "Thrive,
Self-Healing with Ayurveda."

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.910 align:middle line:10%
I'm Justine Lemos, an Ayurvedic
practitioner and yoga teacher.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.500 align:middle line:84%
We'll begin our practice
in Vajrapradama Mudra.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.890 align:middle line:84%
We take our fingertips and
lightly intertwine them,

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.040 align:middle line:84%
and place this formation
across the heart.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.260 align:middle line:84%
This Mudra is a gesture or
seal of unshakable trust.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.540 align:middle line:84%
It grounds our nervous
system, or what

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.470 align:middle line:84%
we call Prana Vata
or Prana Vayu, back

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.930 align:middle line:90%
into the space of our heart.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.650 align:middle line:84%
So just place this
formation across the heart.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.260 align:middle line:84%
Allow yourself to
close your eyes.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.220 align:middle line:84%
Rest into an awareness
of your breath.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.110 align:middle line:90%


00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And ground into the unshakable
trust that is always

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.520 align:middle line:90%
present at your heart.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.730 align:middle line:90%


00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.760 align:middle line:84%
And gently release
the fingertips.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.130 align:middle line:90%
Inhale, drawing the arms upward.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.310 align:middle line:84%
Exhale, bring them to your
heart's space in Anjali Mudra.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.640 align:middle line:84%
We'll chant Om
together one time.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.310 align:middle line:90%
Exhaling out completely.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.105 align:middle line:90%
Inhaling deeply to begin.

00:01:38.105 --> 00:01:38.905 align:middle line:90%
Om.

00:01:38.905 --> 00:01:46.130 align:middle line:90%


00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.660 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to your practice.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:54.510 align:middle line:10%
Let's come down together into
Balasana, or Child's Pose.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.750 align:middle line:84%
Taking your big toes
together and knees apart.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.500 align:middle line:84%
Resting the forehead just right
at the center of the forehead,

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.690 align:middle line:90%
the Ajna Chakra, onto the mat.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.220 align:middle line:90%


00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.049 align:middle line:84%
Allow yourself to
rest into your breath.

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:21.320 align:middle line:90%


00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.580 align:middle line:10%
Breathing into the back
and the front of the heart.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.680 align:middle line:90%


00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.920 align:middle line:84%
Coming up onto the
hands and knees.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.390 align:middle line:84%
Stacking your hips right
on top of the knees.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.620 align:middle line:90%
Place the right hand down.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.230 align:middle line:90%
Inhale from here as you exhale.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.280 align:middle line:84%
Slide the left arm
through palm up.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.860 align:middle line:84%
Draw up onto the
right fingertips.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.480 align:middle line:90%
Hollow the lower belly.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.112 align:middle line:84%
Place the left cheek
down onto the mat.

00:02:48.112 --> 00:02:50.940 align:middle line:84%
If the temple doesn't
reach down to the mat,

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.490 align:middle line:84%
you can always place
a block underneath it.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:54.520 align:middle line:90%
Reach the right arm up.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.500 align:middle line:84%
The back of the hand
comes to the sacrum,

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.880 align:middle line:84%
or all the way around
to the left inner thigh.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.340 align:middle line:84%
This posture, as do many
in our sequence today,

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.850 align:middle line:84%
work on the heart
and lung meridians.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And in this way, we'll
bring the nervous system

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.500 align:middle line:84%
back down from out in the
ethers into the spaciousness

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.240 align:middle line:90%
of the heart.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.220 align:middle line:84%
The true home of
our nervous system.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.500 align:middle line:84%
And from there, we can
blossom forth into compassion.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.200 align:middle line:84%
Moving out of stress and anxiety
into deep heart-felt love

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.010 align:middle line:90%
and joy.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.640 align:middle line:84%
Other side, placing the
left hand down on the mat.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:41.530 align:middle line:90%
Take the right arm.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.520 align:middle line:10%
Swim it through palm up,
placing the right temple down

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.900 align:middle line:10%
onto the mat.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.370 align:middle line:90%
Up onto the left fingertips.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.140 align:middle line:90%
Hollow through the lower belly.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.870 align:middle line:90%
Slide the right arm through.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:53.960 align:middle line:90%
Connect with your breath.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:54.760 align:middle line:90%
Inhale.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.280 align:middle line:84%
Take the left arm
up towards the sky.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.180 align:middle line:90%
Rotate.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.520 align:middle line:84%
Placing the back of
the hand to the sacrum,

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.683 align:middle line:84%
all the way around to
the right inner thigh.

00:04:02.683 --> 00:04:15.010 align:middle line:90%


00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.360 align:middle line:90%
Inhaling from here.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.276 align:middle line:90%
Exhale.

00:04:17.276 --> 00:04:18.890 align:middle line:10%
Release.

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.490 align:middle line:10%
Walk your hands out slightly
in front of your shoulders.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.220 align:middle line:84%
This creation of the
Hasta Bandha of the hands

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.630 align:middle line:84%
also ignites the heart meridian,
the pericardium meridian.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.002 align:middle line:90%
Tuck your toes under.

00:04:31.002 --> 00:04:32.210 align:middle line:90%
Lift through the lower belly.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.510 align:middle line:90%
Inhale from here.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:34.310 align:middle line:90%
Exhale.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:41.490 align:middle line:84%
Lengthen up into Adho Mukha
Svanasana, Downward Facing Dog.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.730 align:middle line:10%
Rest here in an
awareness of your breath.

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.230 align:middle line:10%
Widening through the scapula.

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.227 align:middle line:84%
Allowing the arm
pits to yawn open.

00:04:50.227 --> 00:04:56.080 align:middle line:90%


00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.940 align:middle line:90%
Inhale.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:57.740 align:middle line:90%
Look forward.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.140 align:middle line:84%
Slowly walk your feet
up underneath your hips

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:07.130 align:middle line:84%
as if flowers would
blossom under each step.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.960 align:middle line:90%
Lengthen down over your legs.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.660 align:middle line:84%
If you need to, you can place
a block underneath the hands.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.240 align:middle line:90%
You can always bend your knees.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.950 align:middle line:90%
Roll your inner thighs in.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.480 align:middle line:84%
Take your fingertips to
the mat or to your shins.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.280 align:middle line:90%
Inhale.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.500 align:middle line:90%
Expand up.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.340 align:middle line:90%
Ardha Uttanasana.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.930 align:middle line:84%
Feeling this light expand
at the heart space.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:26.730 align:middle line:90%
Exhale.

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.590 align:middle line:90%
Release down over the legs.

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.678 align:middle line:84%
Two more times with
your breath inhaling up.

00:05:33.678 --> 00:05:34.710 align:middle line:90%
Exhaling.

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.390 align:middle line:90%
Lengthening down and over.

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:39.190 align:middle line:90%
Last time.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.780 align:middle line:90%
Inhaling up halfway.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:43.690 align:middle line:90%
Exhale.

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.880 align:middle line:90%
Releasing down over the legs.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:47.680 align:middle line:90%
Inhale.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.350 align:middle line:84%
Lengthen all the
way up to standing.

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:52.150 align:middle line:90%
Exhale.

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:57.550 align:middle line:84%
Taking your hands down by
your sides in Tadasana.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.650 align:middle line:84%
Turn and face
sideways on the mat.

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:01.740 align:middle line:90%
Ground into your feet.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.930 align:middle line:84%
We'll take Prana Mudra
practice, which is almost

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.810 align:middle line:90%
like yogic Tai chi or Qigong.

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:08.950 align:middle line:90%
Simply inhale.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:10.920 align:middle line:90%
Drawing your arms up.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.700 align:middle line:90%
Feeling your lungs expand.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.660 align:middle line:90%
The sides of the waist lengthen.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.790 align:middle line:90%
Exhaling down.

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:18.790 align:middle line:90%
Grounding into the feet.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:19.670 align:middle line:90%
Inhaling up.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.610 align:middle line:90%


00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.190 align:middle line:90%
Exhaling down.

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.950 align:middle line:90%


00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:27.950 align:middle line:90%
Then one more cycle.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:28.760 align:middle line:90%
Inhaling up.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.670 align:middle line:90%


00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:36.030 align:middle line:90%
And exhaling down.

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:39.840 align:middle line:90%
This time inhaling the arms up.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.870 align:middle line:84%
Rotate the palms down
and exhale down as

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.620 align:middle line:84%
if you feel your head
lifting up above the clouds.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.100 align:middle line:84%
Feeling your energy ground
back down into the earth.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.150 align:middle line:84%
So we're bringing
the nervous system,

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.750 align:middle line:84%
which can get up and
out of ourselves, back

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:58.650 align:middle line:84%
down into its home in
our body, and especially

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.920 align:middle line:90%
into the space of our heart.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.640 align:middle line:90%
Inhaling up and out.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.830 align:middle line:90%
Exhaling down the midline.

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:10.450 align:middle line:84%
Down the central
channel of the body.

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:14.030 align:middle line:84%
And now continuing to open the
side waist, inhale the arms up.

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:15.650 align:middle line:90%
Rotate the left hand forward.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:17.300 align:middle line:84%
We'll touch together
the middle finger

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.350 align:middle line:90%
to the thumb in Hridaya Mudra.

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:22.010 align:middle line:84%
This Mudra relates to
the space of the heart.

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:24.250 align:middle line:90%
Open through the arm pits.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:25.310 align:middle line:90%
Inhale from here.

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:26.810 align:middle line:90%
Exhale.

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.000 align:middle line:90%
Lengthen to the right side.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.460 align:middle line:84%
Feel this small amount of
spaciousness at the heart.

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.090 align:middle line:84%
So the heart is illuminating
and shining bright.

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:37.680 align:middle line:90%
Inhaling up with your breath.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.140 align:middle line:90%
Exhale the arms down.

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:40.940 align:middle line:90%
Inhale.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:43.180 align:middle line:90%
Expand up.

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:44.770 align:middle line:90%
Rotate the right hand forward.

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:46.720 align:middle line:84%
Touch together the middle
finger to the thumb.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.950 align:middle line:90%
Left hand around the wrist.

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:48.820 align:middle line:90%
Inhale from here.

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.790 align:middle line:90%
Exhaling over.

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:55.130 align:middle line:84%
Feeling the heads of the humerus
root down into the shoulders.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:56.300 align:middle line:90%
Inhale up.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.750 align:middle line:90%
Exhale down.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:00.670 align:middle line:90%
Take your feet out wide.

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:02.620 align:middle line:90%
Rotating out from the hips.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.290 align:middle line:84%
Bend the knees over the
midline of the feet.

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:07.880 align:middle line:84%
Take your palms,
rub them together.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.150 align:middle line:84%
So stimulating
this heart meridian

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:11.740 align:middle line:90%
point at the center of the palm.

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:14.290 align:middle line:84%
Place the palms to the
inside of the thighs.

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:16.690 align:middle line:84%
Then inhale low
under the tongue.

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:18.010 align:middle line:90%

Roll under.

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:27.960 align:middle line:84%
My guru also always says,
exhale tongue out, eyes open.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.440 align:middle line:90%
That this prevents wrinkles.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.240 align:middle line:90%

through the heart space.

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:07.830 align:middle line:90%

Standing forward at
the front of the mat,

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:33.460 align:middle line:84%
roll down through the spine,
one vertebra at a time.

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:38.550 align:middle line:84%
Take the legs out behind you
into a high plank momentarily.

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:41.670 align:middle line:10%
Then take your knees down,
your chin and your chest

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:43.960 align:middle line:10%

The very center of the
forehead, the Ajna Chakra

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:55.900 align:middle line:90%
comes down to the mat.

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.500 align:middle line:90%


00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.790 align:middle line:84%
Hands together
into a full Pranam.

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:07.980 align:middle line:90%


00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:10.440 align:middle line:84%
Then here, swimming your
arms back around behind you.

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.420 align:middle line:90%
Clasp the hands.

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:16.200 align:middle line:84%

Rolling the inner thighs.

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:21.240 align:middle line:84%
Lift the legs up
off the mat, feeling

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.750 align:middle line:84%
the lower belly engage up and
in the transverse abdominus.

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:25.590 align:middle line:90%
Then inhale.

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:28.530 align:middle line:84%
Lift up and out through
the space of the heart

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:29.705 align:middle line:90%
into Salabhasana.

00:12:29.705 --> 00:12:35.285 align:middle line:90%


00:12:35.285 --> 00:12:36.580 align:middle line:90%
Exhale.

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:38.330 align:middle line:90%
Releasing down.

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Placing the palms
underneath the forehead.

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:41.570 align:middle line:90%
Big toes together.

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:42.740 align:middle line:90%
Heels apart.

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:43.565 align:middle line:90%
Makrasana.

00:12:43.565 --> 00:12:46.590 align:middle line:90%


00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:51.030 align:middle line:84%
So feeling the forehead
connect to the earth

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:57.190 align:middle line:84%
allows us to tame and
soothe the nervous system.

00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Bringing your hands back
underneath the shoulders.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.650 align:middle line:90%
Inhale from here.

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:01.450 align:middle line:90%
Exhale.

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:04.060 align:middle line:84%
Release to Child's
Pose, Balasana.

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:06.640 align:middle line:90%


00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:12.200 align:middle line:84%
Arms forward or palms
up by the hips are fine.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.399 align:middle line:84%
Then roll up through the
spine onto the knees.

00:13:14.399 --> 00:13:16.190 align:middle line:84%
If this isn't uncomfortable,
you can always

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:20.690 align:middle line:84%
place a block underneath
the sitz bones

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:23.990 align:middle line:84%
or sit in another
comfortable position.

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:28.030 align:middle line:10%
We'll practice Hridaya
Marma practice.

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:30.590 align:middle line:10%
The Marma point is
a vital point much

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:34.520 align:middle line:10%
like the acupressure points
used in Chinese medicine.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:38.650 align:middle line:10%
And this Hridaya Marma is just
at the space of the heart.

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:41.630 align:middle line:84%
We'll place the right hand
on top of the heart space.

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:43.220 align:middle line:90%
The left hand on top of that.

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:47.420 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll massage the whole
heart space with open hands.

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:49.790 align:middle line:84%
Warming the heart
and this stimulation

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:53.000 align:middle line:84%
of the space of the
heart releases oxytocin

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.210 align:middle line:84%
into the bloodstream just
making us feel wonderful.

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:59.810 align:middle line:84%
Making our heart center
expand so that we come out

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:02.990 align:middle line:84%
of the turbulence of our
nervous system, which

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:06.950 align:middle line:84%
can be afflicted with anxiety
into the grounded space

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:08.360 align:middle line:90%
of our heart.

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.790 align:middle line:84%
You can let the hands,
again, rest across the heart

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:13.670 align:middle line:84%
or bring them back to
this Vajrapradama Mudra,

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:16.160 align:middle line:84%
this gesture of
unshakable trust.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:19.430 align:middle line:84%
Placing it across the heart and
resting back into your breath.

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:32.090 align:middle line:90%


00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:36.470 align:middle line:84%
Releasing this Mudra, we'll come
back onto our hands and knees,

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:39.110 align:middle line:84%
or into our Downward
Facing Dog, whichever

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:41.590 align:middle line:90%
feels better for you right now.

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:44.680 align:middle line:84%
We'll move into Eka
Pada Rajakapotasana.

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:45.840 align:middle line:90%
A Pigeon Pose.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:49.280 align:middle line:84%
Drawing the left knee forward,
rotating out from the hip.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.020 align:middle line:90%
Come up onto the right toes.

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:53.150 align:middle line:10%
You can always place
a block or a blanket

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:55.040 align:middle line:10%
underneath this left hip.

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.675 align:middle line:10%
Roll the right toes under.

00:14:56.675 --> 00:14:58.970 align:middle line:84%
Roll the right
hip point forward.

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:02.000 align:middle line:84%
Take the tailbone down as you
lift through the lower belly.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.640 align:middle line:10%
And then from this
very grounded stance,

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.320 align:middle line:10%
allow the heart center to exalt.

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:10.760 align:middle line:84%
So the expansion
of the heart space

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:14.360 align:middle line:84%
emerges out of the
strong and stable root.

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.880 align:middle line:90%


00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.020 align:middle line:90%
Take a breath here.

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:20.480 align:middle line:10%
Then take your fingertips
down to the mat.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.620 align:middle line:10%
Release your back right toes.

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:24.420 align:middle line:10%
Roll the right
hip point forward.

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:26.450 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll bring
our forehead all the way

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:27.470 align:middle line:90%
to the mat.

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:29.120 align:middle line:84%
If the forehead
doesn't reach the mat,

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:33.050 align:middle line:84%
you can always place a block
underneath the forehead.

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:34.010 align:middle line:90%
So forehead down.

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:35.465 align:middle line:90%
If you like to, palms together.

00:15:35.465 --> 00:15:38.270 align:middle line:90%


00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:40.355 align:middle line:84%
Resting here, allowing
the hips to open.

00:15:40.355 --> 00:15:49.890 align:middle line:90%


00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:52.582 align:middle line:84%
Then placing your hands
underneath your shoulders.

00:15:52.582 --> 00:15:53.790 align:middle line:90%
Tucking the right toes under.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:56.660 align:middle line:84%
Coming back on to
the hands and knees.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:58.998 align:middle line:84%
Or back to your
Downward Facing Dog.

00:15:58.998 --> 00:16:02.490 align:middle line:90%


00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:05.350 align:middle line:84%
Inhaling from here and drawing
your right knee forward.

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:07.430 align:middle line:10%
Rotating out from the hip.

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:09.590 align:middle line:10%
Draw the left toes under.

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:12.070 align:middle line:90%
Roll this right hip point back.

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:14.080 align:middle line:84%
You can always place
a block or a blanket

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.610 align:middle line:90%
underneath the right hip.

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:18.940 align:middle line:84%
Then from here, this very
grounded space, inhaling.

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:23.430 align:middle line:90%
Expanding up through the heart.

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:27.430 align:middle line:84%
Rolling the left
ribcage forward.

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And then surrendering
down and in.

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:34.010 align:middle line:90%
Releasing the back left toes.

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:35.940 align:middle line:90%
Lengthening forward.

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:39.620 align:middle line:84%
Forehead down on the
mat or on to a block.

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:54.010 align:middle line:90%


00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And then hands
underneath the shoulders.

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:58.725 align:middle line:84%
Draw yourself back onto
the hands and knees.

00:16:58.725 --> 00:17:00.030 align:middle line:90%
We'll go through the hips.

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:03.010 align:middle line:90%


00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:05.890 align:middle line:84%
From here into a
Downward Facing Dog.

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:10.069 align:middle line:84%
We'll move through stages
of a heart-opening posture

00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:12.319 align:middle line:84%
from a very grounded
and stable place.

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:13.119 align:middle line:90%
Inhale.

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:14.980 align:middle line:84%
Your right leg up
towards the sky.

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:17.140 align:middle line:84%
Roll your right inner
thigh in and up.

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:20.079 align:middle line:84%
Bring the right foot all the
way to the pinky-finger edge

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:21.339 align:middle line:90%
of the right hand.

00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:23.410 align:middle line:10%
If you need to, grab
the ankle and pull it

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:26.500 align:middle line:10%
through so the knee is
right underneath the heel.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.270 align:middle line:84%
Place your left knee
down onto the mat.

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:30.750 align:middle line:90%
Tuck to the left toes.

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:32.620 align:middle line:90%
Hollow through your low belly.

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And then open through
the inner groin.

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:37.250 align:middle line:90%
Take this left hand out.

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:38.570 align:middle line:90%
Up onto the fingertips.

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:42.430 align:middle line:84%
Or if it feels appropriate,
down on the left elbow.

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:44.090 align:middle line:84%
Rotate out through
the right toes

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:47.350 align:middle line:84%
so you see this right thigh
rotating back over the knee.

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:48.750 align:middle line:90%
Then here, inhale.

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:51.760 align:middle line:84%
Draw the right arm up towards
the sky or all the way

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.290 align:middle line:90%
by the ear, if you like to.

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:56.350 align:middle line:84%
Touching together the
thumb and the middle finger

00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:59.620 align:middle line:84%
to find this very grounded
activation of the heart.

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:04.940 align:middle line:90%


00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:08.240 align:middle line:84%
Releasing the fingertips
down to the mat.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.740 align:middle line:10%
Draw this right foot
back to meet the left

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:12.240 align:middle line:10%
into Downward Facing Dog.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.390 align:middle line:10%
And we'll take the other side.

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:16.340 align:middle line:10%
Always moving in
a way that feels

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:18.060 align:middle line:10%
comfortable for your body.

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:18.860 align:middle line:90%
Inhale.

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:19.980 align:middle line:90%
Draw the left leg up.

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.520 align:middle line:84%
Roll the left inner
thigh in and up.

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.920 align:middle line:84%
Deep exhalation as
you draw the left foot

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:28.060 align:middle line:84%
to the pinky-finger
edge of the left hand.

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.410 align:middle line:84%
Or grab the ankle,
draw it through.

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:33.420 align:middle line:90%
Right knee down onto the mat.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:35.180 align:middle line:90%
Lift up onto the fingertips.

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:37.280 align:middle line:84%
Hollow through the
lower belly then

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:40.550 align:middle line:90%
open through the inner groin.

00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:42.890 align:middle line:84%
Rotate out onto the
right fingertips.

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:46.550 align:middle line:84%
Or if it feels comfortable,
down onto the right elbow.

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:48.680 align:middle line:90%
Left toes can rotate out.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.720 align:middle line:90%
Roll the left hip back.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.780 align:middle line:84%
Feel the strength drawing
up from the lower belly

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:58.255 align:middle line:84%
so the expansion of the
heart is still grounded.

00:18:58.255 --> 00:19:01.660 align:middle line:90%


00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:03.250 align:middle line:90%
Feeling the side waist open.

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:07.210 align:middle line:90%


00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:09.070 align:middle line:10%
Place the left hand
down onto the mat.

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:10.900 align:middle line:84%
The right hand
down onto the mat.

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:12.250 align:middle line:90%
Left foot meets the right.

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:14.740 align:middle line:84%
Draw back to a
Downward Facing Dog.

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:17.020 align:middle line:90%
Then knees come down to the mat.

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:18.470 align:middle line:90%
Chest down onto the thighs.

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:22.638 align:middle line:84%
Again, resting the forehead on
the mat to ground and soothe.

00:19:22.638 --> 00:19:28.010 align:middle line:90%


00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:28.810 align:middle line:90%
Inhale.

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:30.740 align:middle line:90%
Roll up through the spine.

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:33.545 align:middle line:84%
We're going to come down
onto our backs with a block.

00:19:33.545 --> 00:19:37.630 align:middle line:90%


00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:40.000 align:middle line:90%
Coming down onto our backs.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.100 align:middle line:84%
Placing our feet
down 4 to 6 inches

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:43.960 align:middle line:90%
in front of our sitz bones.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:46.700 align:middle line:84%
Big toes come slightly
inside of the heels.

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:47.500 align:middle line:90%
Inhale.

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:50.170 align:middle line:90%
Draw your hips up.

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:54.520 align:middle line:84%
Place a block on any comfortable
setting underneath the sacrum

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:58.060 align:middle line:84%
and gently adjust your
scapula in towards each other.

00:19:58.060 --> 00:19:59.784 align:middle line:90%
Rotating the palms up.

00:19:59.784 --> 00:20:01.450 align:middle line:84%
If you like to, you
can bring your thumb

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:04.660 align:middle line:84%
to the middle finger, again,
in that Hridaya Mudra.

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:08.290 align:middle line:84%
If it's not comfortable,
just palms up.

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:10.960 align:middle line:90%
Resting here.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:14.680 align:middle line:84%
Now if you have glaucoma
and endometriosis

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:18.220 align:middle line:84%
or are menstruating, just stay
right here in this Bridge Pose.

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:19.930 align:middle line:90%
This is probably enough.

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:23.050 align:middle line:84%
Or if it feels comfortable,
you'll draw your feet up.

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:24.940 align:middle line:84%
Then take your legs
up towards the sky

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:28.910 align:middle line:84%
into a very gentle
Viparitakarani Mudra.

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And this balances
all of the Chakras

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:35.870 align:middle line:90%
and the endocrine system.

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:38.470 align:middle line:84%
We can also lift the
tip of the tongue

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:43.930 align:middle line:84%
all the way up to the soft
palate of the mouth here.

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:48.895 align:middle line:84%
And this creates a flow of Ojas,
or a vital energy, in the body.

00:20:48.895 --> 00:20:51.970 align:middle line:90%


00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:54.720 align:middle line:84%
And then placing your feet
back down onto the mat.

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:57.087 align:middle line:84%
Resting back into
your Bridge Pose.

00:20:57.087 --> 00:21:03.860 align:middle line:90%


00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:05.500 align:middle line:10%
Rotate your palms down.

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.500 align:middle line:84%
Lift your sacrum
up off the block.

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:10.020 align:middle line:84%
Slide the block out
from underneath you.

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:13.310 align:middle line:84%
Roll back down through the
spine, one vertebra at a time.

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:16.030 align:middle line:84%
Knees into the chest,
rocking side to side.

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:20.940 align:middle line:90%


00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:22.950 align:middle line:90%
Roll over onto your right side.

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:27.350 align:middle line:84%
Place your hands down and
make your way up to seated.

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:31.550 align:middle line:84%
Two more very grounding
asana to ground and nurture

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:34.490 align:middle line:84%
this Ajna Chakra where
the nervous system can

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:35.680 align:middle line:90%
start to move up and out.

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.580 align:middle line:84%
We're going to draw
it back down and in.

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:38.760 align:middle line:90%
Soles of the feet together.

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:39.560 align:middle line:90%
Knees apart.

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:42.740 align:middle line:84%
About a foot and a half
away from your pubic bone.

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Now if you like to, you
can take a block here.

00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:49.370 align:middle line:84%
You can also place a
bolster across the feet.

00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:52.160 align:middle line:84%
But what we'd like to
do is find somewhere

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:57.290 align:middle line:84%
where we can rest the thumbs
or the fists on the forehead.

00:21:57.290 --> 00:21:59.480 align:middle line:84%
So that may mean that you
need to prop yourself up

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:03.340 align:middle line:84%
quite high, which is just
fine, so that you can

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:06.550 align:middle line:90%
rest the forehead even here.

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:09.200 align:middle line:90%
Or you may be lower.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.910 align:middle line:90%
Just working to your capacity.

00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:13.110 align:middle line:90%
Whatever feels good to you.

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:15.650 align:middle line:84%
We're going to release
the forehead down.

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:22.290 align:middle line:90%


00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:24.300 align:middle line:84%
Taking a few long
deep breaths here.

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:33.040 align:middle line:90%


00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And rolling up
through the spine.

00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:36.890 align:middle line:90%
We'll take the legs out wide.

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:38.450 align:middle line:90%
Same thing here.

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:41.060 align:middle line:84%
We can place a
bolster or blocks.

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:42.320 align:middle line:90%
Or our elbows down.

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:45.290 align:middle line:84%
Our elbows down can
also go on to a block

00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:50.930 align:middle line:84%
or bolsters so that we have
some contact, if possible,

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:52.610 align:middle line:90%
with the Ajna Chakra.

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:54.020 align:middle line:90%
Flexing the feet.

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:58.100 align:middle line:84%
Rolling the thighs backwards
and lengthening down and in.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:05.195 align:middle line:90%


00:23:05.195 --> 00:23:10.765 align:middle line:84%
Allowing yourself to
release into this posture.

00:23:10.765 --> 00:23:22.052 align:middle line:90%


00:23:22.052 --> 00:23:25.450 align:middle line:84%
Then rolling up through the
spine, one vertebra at a time.

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:29.570 align:middle line:84%
Draw the legs back together and
come back down onto your back.

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:33.792 align:middle line:84%
We'll just take a twist before
we come into our Savasana.

00:23:33.792 --> 00:23:37.410 align:middle line:84%
Draw the arms out in a
comfortable t-shape, or cactus

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:39.140 align:middle line:90%
shape, from the shoulders.

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:41.160 align:middle line:90%
Inhale from here as you exhale.

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:45.120 align:middle line:84%
Draw both knees down and
over to the left side.

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.340 align:middle line:84%
Rotate the right shoulder
back down to the mat.

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:51.728 align:middle line:84%
Head neutral or rotating all
the way back to your right hand.

00:23:51.728 --> 00:24:01.730 align:middle line:90%


00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:02.530 align:middle line:90%
Inhale.

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:04.570 align:middle line:90%
Draw the knees up to the center.

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And then take them
over to the left side,

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:09.010 align:middle line:84%
allowing the lower
back to release.

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:11.810 align:middle line:90%


00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:14.210 align:middle line:84%
If it feels comfortable,
rotating the head back

00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:17.310 align:middle line:90%
to the left side.

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:19.710 align:middle line:84%
If it doesn't, keeping the
head in a neutral position.

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:27.580 align:middle line:90%


00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:30.180 align:middle line:84%
Draw your knees
back to the center.

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:32.320 align:middle line:84%

our long deep relaxation
or Corpse Pose.

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:38.450 align:middle line:84%
If you like to, you can
always place a bolster

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:44.810 align:middle line:84%
underneath your knees to
release any lower back tension.

00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:47.640 align:middle line:84%
You can also place a
block underneath your feet

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:48.440 align:middle line:90%
if you like.

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.490 align:middle line:90%


00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:56.460 align:middle line:84%

Go ahead and make a fist
with your right hand.

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:12.530 align:middle line:90%
Tensing all the muscles.

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:15.780 align:middle line:90%
Inhale deeply.

the right wrist, the elbow,

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:23.970 align:middle line:90%
the arm, the shoulder.

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:26.730 align:middle line:84%
And then the left
hand, making a fist.

Exhale.

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:35.430 align:middle line:84%
Releasing the palm, the
fingers, the wrist, the elbows,

00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:36.230 align:middle line:90%
the shoulder.

00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:40.500 align:middle line:90%


00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:41.520 align:middle line:90%
Now the right foot.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:42.870 align:middle line:90%
Flexing the right foot.

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:44.605 align:middle line:84%

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:51.350 align:middle line:90%
Soften and release.

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:58.820 align:middle line:84%
Allowing the foot, ankle, knee,
and hip to grow warm and soft.

00:25:58.820 --> 00:25:59.620 align:middle line:90%
The left foot.

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:02.870 align:middle line:84%

Soften the face, the jaw,
the back of the neck.

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:32.950 align:middle line:84%
Imagine or see or visualize
warm water or warm oil

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:36.700 align:middle line:84%
gently cascading
onto the forehead

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:41.310 align:middle line:84%
and flowing over the
crown of the head, down

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:45.270 align:middle line:84%
the back of the neck,
down the back to the body.

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:50.420 align:middle line:90%


00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:53.568 align:middle line:84%
Allow the whole body
to become very relaxed.

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.920 align:middle line:84%
Again, resting in an
awareness of your breath.

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:27.660 align:middle line:90%


00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:31.350 align:middle line:84%
Draw in a deeper breath and
begin to wiggle your fingers

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:33.000 align:middle line:90%
and toes.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.520 align:middle line:90%
Rotating your wrists and ankles.

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And then rub the palms
of the hands together,

00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:39.480 align:middle line:84%
and the soles of
the feet together,

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:45.720 align:middle line:84%
balancing all the 72,000 Nabis,
or meridians, in the body.

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:49.245 align:middle line:84%
Gently massage your
face and over the scalp.

00:27:49.245 --> 00:27:53.830 align:middle line:90%


00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:57.610 align:middle line:84%
Then from here, rolling
off onto your left side.

00:27:57.610 --> 00:27:59.890 align:middle line:90%
Placing your hands down.

00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:01.880 align:middle line:90%
Making your way up to seated.

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.570 align:middle line:90%


00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:06.990 align:middle line:84%
Again, finding a
comfortable seat.

00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:11.260 align:middle line:90%


00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:15.350 align:middle line:84%
Bring your hands back to
this Vajrapradama Mudra.

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:19.550 align:middle line:90%
Across the space of your heart.

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:26.870 align:middle line:84%
Resting in the unshakable
trust of your heart space

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:30.950 align:middle line:84%
knowing that you can round
back down into the spaciousness

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:34.700 align:middle line:84%
of your heart whenever
the nervous system becomes

00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:38.780 align:middle line:84%
frazzled or fried, or when
anxiety or stress begins to

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:40.100 align:middle line:90%
accumulate.

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:44.030 align:middle line:84%
This place of unshakable,
unbreakable trust

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:46.430 align:middle line:84%
is there at the
space of your heart.

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:49.480 align:middle line:90%


00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And gently releasing the
fingertips down to the mat.

00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:53.300 align:middle line:90%
Rotate the palms.

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:54.100 align:middle line:90%
Inhale.

00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:54.900 align:middle line:90%
The arms up.

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:56.600 align:middle line:90%
Place the palms together.

00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Bring them to your heart
center in Anjali Mudra.

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:02.260 align:middle line:84%
We'll chant Om
together one time.

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:04.600 align:middle line:90%
Exhaling out completely.

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:08.055 align:middle line:90%
Inhaling deeply to begin.

00:29:08.055 --> 00:29:08.855 align:middle line:90%
Om.

00:29:08.855 --> 00:29:16.040 align:middle line:90%


00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:17.590 align:middle line:90%
Namaste.

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:38.027 align:middle line:90%
