[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:16.433 align:middle line:90%
>> Namaste.

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:18.060 align:middle line:90%
And welcome to "Thrive--

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.354 align:middle line:90%
Self Healing with Ayurveda."

00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:22.940 align:middle line:10%
My name is Kishan Shah,
longtime practitioner

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.276 align:middle line:10%
of Ayurvedic medicine, and
teacher of yoga and meditation.

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:27.778 align:middle line:84%
In this video, I'm
going to take you

00:00:27.778 --> 00:00:31.073 align:middle line:84%
through a big part of Ayurveda's
morning self-care program

00:00:31.073 --> 00:00:32.616 align:middle line:90%
called Dinacharya.

00:00:32.616 --> 00:00:34.409 align:middle line:90%
So what is Dinacharya?

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:38.330 align:middle line:84%
Dinacharya is Ayurveda's
self-care ritual

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.290 align:middle line:90%
that you can do in the morning.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.501 align:middle line:10%
And we also have some
evening rituals that you'll

00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:44.461 align:middle line:10%
see in Justine's video.

00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:46.505 align:middle line:10%
The parts that I'm going
to focus on in this video

00:00:46.505 --> 00:00:48.507 align:middle line:10%
are related to the
head, specifically

00:00:48.507 --> 00:00:51.134 align:middle line:10%
the sense organs of
the nose and the ears,

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:54.596 align:middle line:10%
and one of the organs
of action, the mouth.

00:00:54.596 --> 00:00:56.848 align:middle line:84%
Our nose and ears are the
instruments through which

00:00:56.848 --> 00:00:59.309 align:middle line:84%
we perceive and
receive information

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.187 align:middle line:84%
from the outside world,
while the organs of action,

00:01:02.187 --> 00:01:05.147 align:middle line:84%
like the mouth, facilitate ways
in which we interact physically

00:01:05.147 --> 00:01:07.192 align:middle line:90%
with the outside world.

00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:09.569 align:middle line:84%
So if you think about it,
it is vitally important

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:11.446 align:middle line:84%
that we keep these
sensitive organs

00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:14.825 align:middle line:84%
fine-tuned and
rejuvenated, cleansed,

00:01:14.825 --> 00:01:18.620 align:middle line:84%
so they can receive information
from the outside world

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.164 align:middle line:90%
beautifully and correctly.

00:01:21.164 --> 00:01:23.083 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Rishis
or sages from India

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:26.503 align:middle line:84%
realized a lot through
deep states of meditation.

00:01:26.503 --> 00:01:28.755 align:middle line:10%
And one of those things
is they understood

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:31.883 align:middle line:10%
that these dinacharya,
or self-care techniques,

00:01:31.883 --> 00:01:34.011 align:middle line:10%
were super important.

00:01:34.011 --> 00:01:35.637 align:middle line:10%
They understood that
stagnation needed

00:01:35.637 --> 00:01:37.347 align:middle line:10%
to be removed through action.

00:01:37.347 --> 00:01:41.184 align:middle line:84%
And they also understood that
the body and all of its parts

00:01:41.184 --> 00:01:44.604 align:middle line:84%
should be cleansed and taken
care of on a daily basis.

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:46.023 align:middle line:84%
Here are all the
things that we'll

00:01:46.023 --> 00:01:48.859 align:middle line:84%
need to perform these cleansing
and rejuvenating rituals today.

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:50.402 align:middle line:84%
You're going to need
your toothbrush.

00:01:50.402 --> 00:01:51.862 align:middle line:90%
I know you've got one of those.

00:01:51.862 --> 00:01:52.654 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:01:52.654 --> 00:01:54.156 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll need
some sesame oil.

00:01:54.156 --> 00:01:57.451 align:middle line:84%
Make sure it's organic, and
it's expeller-pressed or

00:01:57.451 --> 00:02:00.245 align:middle line:84%
cold-pressed, not the toasted
kind that you commonly

00:02:00.245 --> 00:02:01.580 align:middle line:90%
use in Asian cooking.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.041 align:middle line:84%
We're going to need
then also toothpaste.

00:02:04.041 --> 00:02:06.335 align:middle line:84%
I recommend a
toothpaste that is all

00:02:06.335 --> 00:02:09.128 align:middle line:90%
natural with no chemicals in it.

00:02:09.128 --> 00:02:12.090 align:middle line:84%
In Ayurvedic medicine, we
love neem for the mouth.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.134 align:middle line:84%
So if you can find a
toothpaste with neem in it,

00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:15.761 align:middle line:90%
that is awesome.

00:02:15.761 --> 00:02:17.596 align:middle line:84%
Next, you'll need
a tongue scraper.

00:02:17.596 --> 00:02:19.264 align:middle line:84%
You can find them
online for sale.

00:02:19.264 --> 00:02:20.974 align:middle line:90%
A stainless steel on is perfect.

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:22.351 align:middle line:84%
If you want to get
real fancy, you

00:02:22.351 --> 00:02:24.978 align:middle line:84%
can find yourself a
silver one in India.

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:27.731 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll need your glass
for water, room temperature

00:02:27.731 --> 00:02:28.565 align:middle line:90%
water.

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:30.400 align:middle line:84%
It's also nice to
have a slice of lemon

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.110 align:middle line:84%
to squeeze into
your glass of water,

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.071 align:middle line:84%
so you can bring an
alkalizing effect

00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:35.864 align:middle line:90%
to that morning glass of water.

00:02:35.864 --> 00:02:37.824 align:middle line:84%
And lastly, you're going
to need your neti pot.

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:41.828 align:middle line:84%
That's N-E-T-I. And you'll
find those online, all right?

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:44.331 align:middle line:84%
So most likely you're already
good about brushing your teeth

00:02:44.331 --> 00:02:47.209 align:middle line:84%
and flossing before you go
to bed and when you wake up,

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:48.126 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:50.629 align:middle line:84%
So I don't need to teach
you those two things.

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.298 align:middle line:84%
Understanding that these
two are the base steps,

00:02:53.298 --> 00:02:56.635 align:middle line:84%
and as time permits, you can add
more of these daily mouth care

00:02:56.635 --> 00:02:58.553 align:middle line:90%
routines into your ritual.

00:02:58.553 --> 00:03:00.722 align:middle line:84%
And finding the ones that
are most beneficial to you

00:03:00.722 --> 00:03:03.100 align:middle line:90%
and do those consistently.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.644 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you'll even have time
to do all of them each morning.

00:03:05.644 --> 00:03:08.605 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to begin with
something called oil pulling.

00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:11.400 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take one
tablespoon of that sesame oil,

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.526 align:middle line:90%
and put it into your mouth.

00:03:12.526 --> 00:03:13.360 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.861 align:middle line:84%
Then you're going
to close your lips,

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:17.030 align:middle line:84%
and begin swishing the
oil all around your mouth.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.658 align:middle line:84%
Make sure you get it through
your entire oral cavity,

00:03:19.658 --> 00:03:22.285 align:middle line:84%
around the outsides
of the teeth, insides.

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:24.246 align:middle line:84%
And then without
clenching the jaw,

00:03:24.246 --> 00:03:27.416 align:middle line:84%
pulling it back and forth
through the teeth as well.

00:03:27.416 --> 00:03:29.543 align:middle line:84%
You want to do this for
about three to five minutes

00:03:29.543 --> 00:03:32.379 align:middle line:84%
until the oil becomes
thicker and whitish in color.

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.339 align:middle line:84%
You'll only know that by
opening up your mouth,

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:36.716 align:middle line:84%
but be careful it
doesn't spill out

00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:39.219 align:middle line:84%
I recommend spitting the
oil out then into the toilet

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:41.721 align:middle line:84%
or your trash can if you
have a septic system.

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:43.098 align:middle line:84%
If you spit it
out into the sink,

00:03:43.098 --> 00:03:45.892 align:middle line:84%
it definitely will eventually
clog up your drain.

00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:48.145 align:middle line:84%
So next, you want to move
on to brushing of your teeth

00:03:48.145 --> 00:03:48.937 align:middle line:90%
and flossing.

00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:50.856 align:middle line:84%
I know you've got
those in the bag.

00:03:50.856 --> 00:03:52.983 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to
move on to tongue scraping.

00:03:52.983 --> 00:03:54.651 align:middle line:84%
So the tongue
scraper, you're not

00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:56.736 align:middle line:84%
going to want to put
firm pressure, right?

00:03:56.736 --> 00:04:01.032 align:middle line:84%
So it's a nice pressure from
the back of the tongue forwards.

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:04.035 align:middle line:84%
And check out your tongue
before you do that.

00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:07.122 align:middle line:84%
You also want to refer to
Justine's self-analysis video,

00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:09.040 align:middle line:84%
and you'll learn a little
bit more about that.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.376 align:middle line:84%
OK, so when you're ready to
tongue scrape your tongue,

00:04:11.376 --> 00:04:13.420 align:middle line:84%
go ahead and place it at
the back of your tongue,

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.298 align:middle line:84%
and you're just going to do
about three or four strokes

00:04:16.298 --> 00:04:18.257 align:middle line:84%
along the whole
top of the tongue.

00:04:18.257 --> 00:04:20.385 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to want
to do the sides as well.

00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:21.887 align:middle line:84%
And then look at
the tongue scraper.

00:04:21.887 --> 00:04:23.847 align:middle line:84%
You'll probably see a
white, yellowish scum

00:04:23.847 --> 00:04:26.266 align:middle line:90%
that comes off your tongue, OK?

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:28.768 align:middle line:84%
So imagine this is something
that you didn't do before,

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:29.352 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:30.896 align:middle line:84%
And once you do it
once, I have a feeling

00:04:30.896 --> 00:04:32.939 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be buying
one for whomever you're

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:34.983 align:middle line:90%
kissing as well.

00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:37.194 align:middle line:84%
So now oral care is
complete, and it's

00:04:37.194 --> 00:04:39.696 align:middle line:84%
time to rinse your mouth
out with some warm water.

00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:42.157 align:middle line:84%
You can add a little bit
of Triphala powder to it,

00:04:42.157 --> 00:04:45.284 align:middle line:84%
and that will help clean
out the gums as well.

00:04:45.284 --> 00:04:47.120 align:middle line:84%
After you're finished
rinsing out your mouth,

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.790 align:middle line:84%
it's time to drink that large
glass of room-temperature water

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.002 align:middle line:84%
with that squeezed
lemon into it.

00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:55.837 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's move on to the ears.

00:04:55.837 --> 00:04:59.424 align:middle line:84%
The ear canal is one of the
sub sites of Vata dosha.

00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:01.927 align:middle line:10%
The doshas are the
three main intelligences

00:05:01.927 --> 00:05:05.347 align:middle line:10%
in the body that
govern physiology.

00:05:05.347 --> 00:05:09.434 align:middle line:84%
The main site of Vata is
actually the large intestine.

00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:10.852 align:middle line:84%
It is well-known
kitchen medicine

00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:13.688 align:middle line:84%
in India, when a child
has an ear ache, to treat

00:05:13.688 --> 00:05:15.315 align:middle line:90%
their ears with garlic oil.

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:19.236 align:middle line:84%
So garlic pacifies the Vata,
which is the associated pain.

00:05:19.236 --> 00:05:22.030 align:middle line:84%
And it also has
anti-bacterial function.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.242 align:middle line:84%
Garlic oil also is good
for tinnitus, excess

00:05:25.242 --> 00:05:27.494 align:middle line:90%
or hardened earwax and ear ache.

00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:30.580 align:middle line:84%
Sesame oil also has
its own anti-microbial

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.749 align:middle line:90%
and anti-bacterial properties.

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:34.209 align:middle line:84%
When you're ready
to apply the oil,

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:36.336 align:middle line:84%
you want to warm
the oil up slightly,

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:38.463 align:middle line:84%
making sure it's not too
hot before putting it

00:05:38.463 --> 00:05:40.799 align:middle line:90%
into your ear.

00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:42.259 align:middle line:90%
Now we'll move on to the nose.

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:44.719 align:middle line:10%
The nasal passages are
so important as they

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:47.681 align:middle line:10%
filter the air and warm
up the breath that's

00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:49.140 align:middle line:10%
coming into the body.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.102 align:middle line:84%
It's the primary
source of prana coming

00:05:52.102 --> 00:05:54.646 align:middle line:90%
into our entire organism--

00:05:54.646 --> 00:05:56.481 align:middle line:90%
the Pranavaha Srotas.

00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:58.692 align:middle line:10%
Our sense of smell gives
us so much information

00:05:58.692 --> 00:06:00.735 align:middle line:10%
from the outside
world, and it also

00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:04.114 align:middle line:10%
attributes to much of our
sense of taste as well.

00:06:04.114 --> 00:06:06.241 align:middle line:84%
So first, we'll clean
out the nasal passages

00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:07.784 align:middle line:90%
using a neti pot.

00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:09.077 align:middle line:90%
So grab your neti pot.

00:06:09.077 --> 00:06:10.453 align:middle line:84%
And we're going
to need a quarter

00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:14.624 align:middle line:84%
teaspoon of non-iodized sea
salt. And put into the pot.

00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:16.251 align:middle line:90%
Add some more water.

00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:17.877 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
stir that water in.

00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:20.171 align:middle line:84%
Make sure the salt
is well-dissolved.

00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And then next, you're
going to come over

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.550 align:middle line:84%
to your sink or
your tub, and you're

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.678 align:middle line:84%
going to place the tip of the
neti pot into one nostril.

00:06:26.678 --> 00:06:29.097 align:middle line:84%
Make sure you are leaning
slightly forward, and then

00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:32.058 align:middle line:84%
as you begin to tilt
your head sideways,

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:35.395 align:middle line:84%
you're going to want to resist
the sensation of swallowing

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:36.438 align:middle line:90%
the liquid.

00:06:36.438 --> 00:06:37.856 align:middle line:90%
And just be patient with it.

00:06:37.856 --> 00:06:39.899 align:middle line:84%
The nasal passage
could be clogged.

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:42.235 align:middle line:84%
Eventually maybe you'll
see a slow stream.

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:44.487 align:middle line:84%
Maybe right away,
it'll come out quickly.

00:06:44.487 --> 00:06:47.115 align:middle line:90%
And just be patient with it.

00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:49.326 align:middle line:84%
You're going to need to
breathe through your mouth.

00:06:49.326 --> 00:06:52.662 align:middle line:84%
And let the whole
pot drain through.

00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:56.416 align:middle line:84%
And then when you're ready,
come back up, clean off the tip,

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:58.835 align:middle line:84%
and then add more
salt and more water,

00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:01.504 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to do the
same thing with the other side.

00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And so now we'll
move on to the nose

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.550 align:middle line:90%
with a practice known as Nasya.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:09.179 align:middle line:84%
So Nasya is oilation
of the inner nostrils,

00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:11.931 align:middle line:84%
and it nourishes the nasal
passages and tonifies

00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:13.850 align:middle line:84%
the surrounding
tissues of the face.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.852 align:middle line:84%
Amazing for anti-aging
and preventing

00:07:15.852 --> 00:07:17.646 align:middle line:90%
wrinkles in the skin.

00:07:17.646 --> 00:07:20.482 align:middle line:84%
The nasal passage is
well-connected to the sinuses,

00:07:20.482 --> 00:07:22.942 align:middle line:84%
the eyes and the brain,
through the cell walls.

00:07:22.942 --> 00:07:25.779 align:middle line:84%
And we can introduce herbal
medicine via this route.

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:29.658 align:middle line:84%
In Ayurveda, we say the nose
is the door to the brain.

00:07:29.658 --> 00:07:32.369 align:middle line:84%
With this one, we're going
to use straight sesame oil,

00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:35.747 align:middle line:84%
or you can even use some
ghee, clarified butter.

00:07:35.747 --> 00:07:38.249 align:middle line:84%
Now we'll warm up our
sesame oil or our ghee.

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:40.794 align:middle line:84%
Once your oil is warm, test it
out in the back of your hand

00:07:40.794 --> 00:07:43.004 align:middle line:90%
and make sure it's not too hot.

00:07:43.004 --> 00:07:44.381 align:middle line:10%
So then with the
dropper in hand,

00:07:44.381 --> 00:07:46.132 align:middle line:10%
go ahead and find a
nice place to lie down.

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:48.635 align:middle line:84%
Begin breathing in
through your nose,

00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:51.262 align:middle line:84%
and then exhaling
out the mouth softly.

00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:53.139 align:middle line:84%
When you're doing this,
you want to make sure

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:55.683 align:middle line:84%
that you're not breathing
intensely in through the nose.

00:07:55.683 --> 00:07:58.728 align:middle line:84%
The breath needs to be
super soft so you're not

00:07:58.728 --> 00:08:01.940 align:middle line:90%
sucking the oil back in, OK?

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:05.110 align:middle line:84%
So blocking one nostril,
you're going to lie back

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:08.154 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to drip
three drops into one nostril.

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And just let it go through
the nasal passage on its own.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.159 align:middle line:90%
Don't sniff it back.

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:15.537 align:middle line:84%
You're going to breathe in
through the nose, exhaling

00:08:15.537 --> 00:08:17.038 align:middle line:90%
softly out the mouth.

00:08:17.038 --> 00:08:21.084 align:middle line:84%
Once the one side's done, go
ahead and block the other side.

00:08:21.084 --> 00:08:23.670 align:middle line:84%
Drip three drops into
that nostril as well.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:25.380 align:middle line:84%
So after you put
the bottle aside,

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:28.675 align:middle line:84%
you can then take your hands
and gently massage the nostrils

00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:30.135 align:middle line:90%
on either side of your nose.

00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:32.886 align:middle line:84%
And then even move
energetically up

00:08:32.886 --> 00:08:35.432 align:middle line:84%
into the sinuses
on the cheek bones,

00:08:35.432 --> 00:08:37.683 align:middle line:90%
and then up onto the brow.

00:08:37.683 --> 00:08:40.645 align:middle line:84%
Continue lying on your back for
another three minutes or so.

00:08:40.645 --> 00:08:44.274 align:middle line:84%
And then when you're ready,
go ahead and stand up.

00:08:44.274 --> 00:08:45.275 align:middle line:90%
All right, you did it.

00:08:45.275 --> 00:08:48.737 align:middle line:84%
This completes your Ayurvedic
mouth and nose care.

00:08:48.737 --> 00:08:50.947 align:middle line:84%
I hope you enjoy these
practices and integrate them

00:08:50.947 --> 00:08:52.157 align:middle line:90%
in your morning routine.

00:08:52.157 --> 00:08:54.909 align:middle line:84%
And remember, you don't have
to do all of them every day.

00:08:54.909 --> 00:08:56.911 align:middle line:84%
You can add one a
day here and there,

00:08:56.911 --> 00:08:59.456 align:middle line:84%
and then you can add
others as time permits.

00:08:59.456 --> 00:09:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And just notice how great
they're making you feel.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.294 align:middle line:84%
And that's the most
important thing.

00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps that's what's going
to push you to do them

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.757 align:middle line:90%
on a more regular basis.

00:09:08.757 --> 00:09:10.759 align:middle line:84%
Empower yourself
with the knowledge

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:13.970 align:middle line:84%
of our Ayurveda to harmonize
your health and your life.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:17.182 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy, and thank you.
