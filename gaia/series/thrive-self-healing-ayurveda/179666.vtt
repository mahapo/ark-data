>> Namaste and
welcome to "Thrive,

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.710 align:middle line:90%
Self-healing with Ayurveda."

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.290 align:middle line:10%
My name is Kishan Shah,
longtime practitioner

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.890 align:middle line:10%
of Ayurvedic medicine and
teacher of yoga and meditation.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.490 align:middle line:84%
Ayurveda is the holistic
system of medicine from India.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And in today's
video, we're going

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.070 align:middle line:84%
to show you how to make
khichdi, also known as kitchari.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.140 align:middle line:84%
It's a super
cleansing, balancing,

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.710 align:middle line:84%
and nourishing recipe that
you can make on a daily basis

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.380 align:middle line:90%
or even use as a simple cleanse.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.010 align:middle line:90%
Let's get started.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.760 align:middle line:10%
For this recipe, you will need 1
cup of long grain white basmati

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.900 align:middle line:10%
rice, 1 cup of split mung daal--
it's a small yellow bean--

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.800 align:middle line:10%
1 medium onion, 1/4 cut
chopped fresh ginger root,

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.360 align:middle line:10%
1 teaspoon turmeric powder,
1 teaspoon of cumin seeds,

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.020 align:middle line:10%
1 teaspoon of black
mustard seeds, and ghee.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.860 align:middle line:10%
Then will need 4 whole
cloves, 4 fresh curry leaves--

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.470 align:middle line:10%
you can get those at
a local Indian grocer,

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.810 align:middle line:10%
and if not, don't
worry about it--

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.950 align:middle line:10%
pink Himalayan salt, freshly
ground black pepper, Hing,

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.460 align:middle line:10%
also known as asafoetida-- you
can also get that an Indian

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.540 align:middle line:10%
grocery store--

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.080 align:middle line:10%
fresh cilantro, 1
lemon, 2 scallions

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.090 align:middle line:10%
are optional if
you like the taste,

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.950 align:middle line:10%
1 whole dried red
chili if you wanted

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.540 align:middle line:10%
to add a little bit of spice.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.910 align:middle line:10%
All right, so use this
recipe as your base.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And you can add various organic
seasonal vegetables to it

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.570 align:middle line:90%
as you like.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.820 align:middle line:10%
Included in the video
page is a basic PDF

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.220 align:middle line:10%
I created for you that
you can download and use

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.370 align:middle line:10%
as a reference to the recipe,
along with a list of vegetables

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.500 align:middle line:10%
that are appropriate
for the doshas, body

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.840 align:middle line:10%
types, and seasonal influences.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.285 align:middle line:90%
All right, let's get started.

00:01:46.285 --> 00:01:47.660 align:middle line:84%
The first thing
we're going to do

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.284 align:middle line:84%
is we're going to
measure out the ghee.

00:01:49.284 --> 00:01:51.740 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to need a
tablespoon and a half of ghee.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.710 align:middle line:10%
And I've already added some
in there so it would melt.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.700 align:middle line:10%
And we're going to
put our heat on low.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.010 align:middle line:10%
OK, so it's not too hot
for when we add the spices.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.212 align:middle line:10%
And then once we melt the ghee--

00:02:04.212 --> 00:02:06.150 align:middle line:10%
ghee is clarified butter.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.509 align:middle line:10%
Essentially what it is they
take butter, they heat it up,

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.390 align:middle line:10%
and it allows all the
excess water to boil off.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.030 align:middle line:10%
And then they're able to
actually filter out and strain

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.830 align:middle line:10%
the milk solids.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.150 align:middle line:10%
So what you end up with
is a shelf stable oil.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.050 align:middle line:10%
And as long as you use a
very clean and dry spoon

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.850 align:middle line:10%
to measure out your
ghee, you don't even

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.050 align:middle line:10%
need to refrigerate it.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.070 align:middle line:10%
OK, so now that my ghee is
nice and melted and warm,

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.820 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to add that 1
teaspoon of black mustard seed.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.790 align:middle line:84%
Black mustard seed
is a pungent spice,

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.094 align:middle line:90%
and it is also quite aromatic.

00:02:38.094 --> 00:02:39.510 align:middle line:84%
All right, so we
want to make sure

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.810 align:middle line:84%
that that is not too hot,
because they have a tendency

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.300 align:middle line:90%
to want to jump out of the ghee.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.937 align:middle line:84%
And combined with oil,
it could cause a burn

00:02:47.937 --> 00:02:49.270 align:middle line:90%
and make a little bit of a mess.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.030 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm going to do
is tilt it to the side.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.704 align:middle line:84%
And now you can see they're
beginning to pop a little bit.

00:02:54.704 --> 00:02:56.620 align:middle line:84%
They're starting to turn
a little bit of gray.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.840 align:middle line:90%
That's what you want to see.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.840 align:middle line:10%
And once again, my
temperature isn't too high.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.010 align:middle line:10%
Otherwise, they're going
to want to jump out a lot.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.211 align:middle line:10%
I'm just going to give
him another 10 seconds.

00:03:06.211 --> 00:03:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And while that's
going on there, I'm

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.140 align:middle line:84%
going to go ahead and
grab my cumin seed.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.250 align:middle line:10%
Cumin is also a nice aromatic
spice, slightly pungent

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.140 align:middle line:10%
and heating in nature, really
good for the digestive system,

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.900 align:middle line:10%
increasing digestive powers.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.580 align:middle line:10%
It allows the absorption of the
healthy benefits of the split

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.210 align:middle line:10%
mung bean and the basmati
rice to be easily assimilated

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.000 align:middle line:10%
into your digestive tract.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.050 align:middle line:10%
So we're adding the
cumin seed there.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.430 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to do that same
thing, giving those a second.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.020 align:middle line:10%
I'm actually going to
turn that down even lower,

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.532 align:middle line:10%
so they have some
more time there.

00:03:39.532 --> 00:03:41.490 align:middle line:10%
And while that's going
on, I'm going to chop up

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.170 align:middle line:10%
this onion real quick.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.650 align:middle line:10%
So you don't need to chop it
up into super small pieces.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.350 align:middle line:90%
They can be nice sized chunks.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.580 align:middle line:90%
All right, really simple.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.990 align:middle line:90%
And that's perfect right there.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And then from here, now that
these have cooked nicely,

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.150 align:middle line:84%
the cumin seed and the
black mustard seed, what

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to add is my Hing.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And I'll use just the
spoon to measure it out.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.560 align:middle line:90%
Just a little bit.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.435 align:middle line:90%
You don't need a lot.

00:04:06.435 --> 00:04:08.310 align:middle line:90%
That right there is enough.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.810 align:middle line:90%
Add that to it.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:10.890 align:middle line:90%
You can smell it already.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:11.950 align:middle line:90%
It's super aromatic.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.430 align:middle line:84%
It has a little bit
of a sulfery smell.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.529 align:middle line:84%
And then these are
fresh curry leaves.

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:19.260 align:middle line:84%
You can get these at your
local Indian grocery store.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.660 align:middle line:84%
And usually you'll have to
ask them where they are.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.280 align:middle line:90%
That's at least my experience.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.320 align:middle line:84%
All right, I'm going to
just pick off about four

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.330 align:middle line:90%
or five of these and add them.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.214 align:middle line:10%
They'll pop too.

00:04:29.214 --> 00:04:30.630 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going
to add-- if you

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.160 align:middle line:84%
want to add a
little bit of spice

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.770 align:middle line:84%
to this, especially for those
of you looking for some weight

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.470 align:middle line:84%
reduction or removal
of kapha dosha, which

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.110 align:middle line:84%
is going to be an excess of
earth and water in the body.

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.970 align:middle line:84%
If you're experiencing
sluggishness

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:47.130 align:middle line:84%
in your digestive tract
or bloating or water gain,

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.560 align:middle line:84%
this is a nice little
addition right there.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's not going
to make it too hot.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.990 align:middle line:84%
So once those are
mixed in nicely--

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.440 align:middle line:90%
and that looks perfect--

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.210 align:middle line:90%
now I'm going to add my onion.

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.650 align:middle line:10%
OK, and you know what?

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:05.700 align:middle line:90%
That was a huge onion.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to add
that much of the onion

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:10.920 align:middle line:90%
and saute these in.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.830 align:middle line:84%
So while the onion
is sauteing, I'm

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.540 align:middle line:84%
going to take my mung bean and
my rice once these are nice

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.130 align:middle line:84%
and coated, I'm going to
take my mung beans and rice

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:24.630 align:middle line:84%
and rinse them off
over at the sink.

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.110 align:middle line:84%
So this is 1 cup of long
grain white basmati rice.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.160 align:middle line:84%
White basmati rice or long
grain white basmati rice

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.870 align:middle line:90%
has a very low glycemic level.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.440 align:middle line:84%
So it's not going to
spike your sugar levels.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.690 align:middle line:90%
It's also very easy to digest.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.240 align:middle line:84%
Once they've taken the
hull-- and I know commonly

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.330 align:middle line:84%
it's known that brown rice
is more nutritious for you.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:46.374 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is.

00:05:46.374 --> 00:05:47.790 align:middle line:10%
But what we're
looking for here is

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.000 align:middle line:10%
something that is really
easy for the digestive system

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.170 align:middle line:10%
to process.

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.020 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we're using
white long grain basmati rice.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And then this is
that split mung bean.

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:02.110 align:middle line:10%
So 1 cup of each and then
we got to rinse them.

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.454 align:middle line:90%
And use cold water.

00:06:05.454 --> 00:06:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And you want to make
sure you rinse this

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.110 align:middle line:90%
until the water runs clear.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.540 align:middle line:84%
Massaging it a little
bit is perfectly fine.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:21.027 align:middle line:90%


00:06:21.027 --> 00:06:21.860 align:middle line:90%
And that looks good.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.891 align:middle line:90%


00:06:24.891 --> 00:06:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And then we're just going
to set it in the bowl.

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:28.640 align:middle line:90%
Check on the onions.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And they're starting
to look like they're

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.150 align:middle line:90%
getting translucent.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.020 align:middle line:90%


00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.400 align:middle line:90%
And it smells delicious.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.850 align:middle line:10%
All of those aromatic spices,
along with the curry leaves,

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:42.977 align:middle line:10%
is starting to come
out of the pot.

00:06:42.977 --> 00:06:44.810 align:middle line:84%
My mouth is watering
just thinking about it.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.800 align:middle line:90%


00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.310 align:middle line:84%
So I've already pre-measured
out 5 cups of water.

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:54.551 align:middle line:84%
And if you add
vegetables to it, you're

00:06:54.551 --> 00:06:57.050 align:middle line:84%
going to probably want to add
a little bit more water to it.

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.070 align:middle line:90%


00:06:59.070 --> 00:06:59.870 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:01.460 align:middle line:90%
My onions are looking perfect.

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm ready to add the split
mung bean and the rice

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.400 align:middle line:90%
mixture to it.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:18.854 align:middle line:90%


00:07:18.854 --> 00:07:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going
to stir that in

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:23.450 align:middle line:84%
nicely real quick
before I add the water.

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And once we cover
this pot, we're

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.370 align:middle line:84%
not going to want
to stir this again.

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:31.270 align:middle line:90%


00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:33.740 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now I'm going to
add the 5 cups of water.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.990 align:middle line:90%


00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to turn it on
high just to get it going.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:48.670 align:middle line:90%


00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And then now to the
water, I'm going

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:54.280 align:middle line:84%
to add the turmeric powder,
salt, and black pepper.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.780 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to measure out
1 teaspoon of turmeric powder.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:03.367 align:middle line:90%


00:08:03.367 --> 00:08:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And then salt and pepper is
going to be mainly to taste.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:11.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm using pink Himalayan salt.
It has a lot more mineral

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.460 align:middle line:90%
content to it.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:13.500 align:middle line:90%
So I like to use this.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going to put
in one nice big pinch, maybe

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:19.790 align:middle line:90%
just a little bit more.

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And then similarly
with the black pepper.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.545 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to put a nice
pinch of the black pepper.

00:08:24.545 --> 00:08:30.630 align:middle line:90%


00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:33.970 align:middle line:84%
This also has a really nice
digestive quality to it.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:39.630 align:middle line:10%
And then we'll throw in
4 whole cloves as well.

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:42.650 align:middle line:90%


00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:47.700 align:middle line:10%
And then give it one last stir,
just to mix everything in.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And then well this
is coming to a boil,

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:53.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to chop up some
fresh sliced fresh ginger

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.800 align:middle line:90%
and then add that to it as well.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.290 align:middle line:10%
So this is looking
perfect right here.

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:07.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to cover that, move
this onion aside, and then

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:09.260 align:middle line:90%
slice some fresh ginger.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.650 align:middle line:84%
So the fresh ginger
root, I broke the fingers

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:16.310 align:middle line:84%
apart earlier because
you want to wash

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:18.350 align:middle line:90%
in between all of these.

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:19.440 align:middle line:90%
It grows in the dirt.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.420 align:middle line:90%
It is a rhizome.

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:22.880 align:middle line:90%
It is a tuber or a root.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And also really important to
buy organic ginger, especially

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.910 align:middle line:84%
because it is a
tuber or it's a root,

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:31.100 align:middle line:84%
so it tends to absorb
everything that's in the soil.

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.910 align:middle line:84%
So really important to
buy organic ginger root.

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And we all we want to do is
give it some nice thin slices.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:41.480 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:48.290 align:middle line:84%
So 1/4 cup, that's approximately
what it is, about a 2 inch

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:49.590 align:middle line:90%
piece of ginger.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:52.940 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to chop it
into some other small pieces.

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.700 align:middle line:84%
That's going to cook down and
become nice and soft inside.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.110 align:middle line:90%
It's super fibrousy.

00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:01.550 align:middle line:90%
I don't tend to skin my ginger.

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:03.680 align:middle line:90%
I tend to leave the skin on.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:07.070 align:middle line:84%
If you like it for some reason
you want to take the skin off,

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:10.487 align:middle line:90%
that's perfectly fine as well.

00:10:10.487 --> 00:10:11.820 align:middle line:90%
All right, one last little stir.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:15.380 align:middle line:90%


00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:16.520 align:middle line:90%
And it is ready.

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.380 align:middle line:84%
So all we're going
to do is cover this

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:22.240 align:middle line:84%
and let it cook on
low for 15 minutes.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm noticing that
this burner is going

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.267 align:middle line:84%
to be too much for
this to keep it on low.

00:10:26.267 --> 00:10:28.475 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to burn the
bottom or have it overflow.

00:10:28.475 --> 00:10:32.740 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to switch it to the
back burner, put that on low,

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:36.080 align:middle line:84%
and move these things
out of the way.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:41.160 align:middle line:10%
All right, beautiful.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.290 align:middle line:10%
So now, while that's cooking,
let's talk about kitchari.

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:47.230 align:middle line:84%
Part of the reason why kitchari
is such a healing recipe

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:48.970 align:middle line:90%
is in its simplicity.

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:51.580 align:middle line:84%
What we have is basmati
rice and mung bean.

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:55.270 align:middle line:84%
The two together make a nice
complete protein profile,

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:59.470 align:middle line:84%
nine essential amino acids
present, along with turmeric,

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:04.720 align:middle line:84%
cumin, and black mustard seed,
which are all digestive aids.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.910 align:middle line:84%
People who have
digestive issues,

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:10.870 align:middle line:84%
this is a really
great go-to recipe.

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:14.260 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the fiber inside of
the mung beans and the rice

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.440 align:middle line:84%
is going to help clean
out the digestive tract.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.030 align:middle line:84%
The cumin seeds
and the turmeric is

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:22.310 align:middle line:84%
going to help to heal any
inflammation inside of the GI

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:23.110 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:25.060 align:middle line:84%
And any sort of
toxicity is going

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:28.050 align:middle line:84%
to begin to get
removed by the cumin

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:30.260 align:middle line:84%
seeds and the black
mustard seed as well.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.350 align:middle line:10%
Also, if you're experiencing
low energy levels,

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:36.430 align:middle line:10%
this recipe can really help
to spark your digestive fire

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:39.874 align:middle line:10%
and get your GI
tract back in order.

00:11:39.874 --> 00:11:42.560 align:middle line:10%
[CLOCK TICKING]

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.570 align:middle line:10%
>> I think the kitchari
is ready to check out.

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:45.680 align:middle line:10%
Let's look.

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:46.910 align:middle line:10%
It's ready.

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:49.060 align:middle line:10%
And let's see what's going--

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:51.570 align:middle line:10%
oh, my gosh, it smells so good.

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:55.640 align:middle line:10%
So I like to add some
things to the top of this.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:12:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And that would be fresh
cilantro, some freshly

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.270 align:middle line:84%
green cut scallion, and a
little bit of lemon juice.

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:05.002 align:middle line:10%
So let's go ahead and
put some in a bowl.

00:12:05.002 --> 00:12:09.070 align:middle line:90%


00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:11.425 align:middle line:84%
It looks amazing
and smells amazing.

00:12:11.425 --> 00:12:14.368 align:middle line:90%


00:12:14.368 --> 00:12:17.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to add a little
bit more, because I'm hungry.

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.750 align:middle line:90%


00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:27.130 align:middle line:10%
All right, a little bit of
fresh cilantro over the top.

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:31.510 align:middle line:10%
And some freshly
chopped green scallion,

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:35.275 align:middle line:10%
and a little bit of lemon juice
to add some sour flavor to it.

00:12:35.275 --> 00:12:36.630 align:middle line:90%
It smells so delicious.

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:38.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have
a little taste.

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:40.510 align:middle line:90%
Let's see how it is.

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:43.982 align:middle line:90%


00:12:43.982 --> 00:12:46.810 align:middle line:90%
Mm, so good.

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:49.870 align:middle line:84%
We have two more cooking
videos in this Ayurveda series.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:53.050 align:middle line:84%
