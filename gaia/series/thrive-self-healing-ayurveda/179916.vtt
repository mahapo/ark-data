00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.730 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to "Thrive,
Self-Healing with Ayurveda."

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.030 align:middle line:10%
I'm Justine Lemos, an
Ayurvedic practitioner

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.920 align:middle line:10%
and yoga instructor.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.740 align:middle line:84%
Ayurveda is a
holistic science that

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.380 align:middle line:84%
has its origins
in ancient India,

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.000 align:middle line:84%
but it has immense
application to modern life.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.210 align:middle line:84%
In this video, I'm going to
share with you two ritual

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.990 align:middle line:90%
self-care practices.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.730 align:middle line:84%
These are the ancient practices
of raw silk glove brushing,

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.870 align:middle line:84%
also called Gharshana, and
self-massage with warm oil,

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.060 align:middle line:90%
which is called Abhyanga.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.870 align:middle line:84%
These two practices are
essential for our self-care

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.450 align:middle line:84%
and have really been
the practices that

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.960 align:middle line:84%
have created the most
value in my own life

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.040 align:middle line:84%
as I've brought myself into
more balance and more harmony.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.760 align:middle line:84%
You can do these practices
as standalone practices,

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.890 align:middle line:84%
or you can combine
them together.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.840 align:middle line:84%
If you combine them
together, you'll

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.080 align:middle line:84%
do Gharshana, the silk
glove brushing first,

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.130 align:middle line:84%
and then you'll follow it with
Abhyanga, the warm oil massage.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.710 align:middle line:84%
When you do the practices
alone, or if you combine them,

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.040 align:middle line:84%
you follow the entire ritual
with a warm shower or bath.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And if you combine
them together,

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.980 align:middle line:84%
your skin feels
amazing afterwards.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.820 align:middle line:84%
Silk glove massage is
wonderful for the skin

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.960 align:middle line:84%
and encourages lymphatic
flow, and it removes toxins,

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.240 align:middle line:90%
which we call Ama in Ayurveda.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.090 align:middle line:84%
Oil massage is deeply soothing
to the nervous system,

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.930 align:middle line:84%
and it's a primary
therapy for taming what we

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.960 align:middle line:90%
call in Ayurveda, Vata dosha.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.900 align:middle line:84%
In Ayurveda, we
postulate that there

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.310 align:middle line:84%
are three primary motivating
intelligences in the universe.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.690 align:middle line:84%
These are Vata,
like air and ether--

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.140 align:middle line:90%
very dry, quick, and cold.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.300 align:middle line:90%
Pitta, which is like fire--

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.380 align:middle line:84%
it's intense, burning,
transformative.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.650 align:middle line:84%
Kapha dosha, which is
like water and earth--

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.160 align:middle line:84%
it's heavy, stable,
and immobile.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.460 align:middle line:84%
These doshas can
accumulate and are

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.880 align:middle line:84%
a prime factor in generating
disease in the body.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.530 align:middle line:84%
So warm oil massage can be
performed in the morning

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.060 align:middle line:90%
or at night.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.820 align:middle line:84%
Some people find that it's
a very soothing practice

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.420 align:middle line:84%
before bed, but some people
find it a bit too stimulating

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.430 align:middle line:90%
or invigorating before bed.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.370 align:middle line:84%
If that's your case,
then do your oil massage

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.660 align:middle line:90%
in the morning.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.270 align:middle line:10%
To perform these
ritual practices,

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.770 align:middle line:10%
I first set up my space.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.550 align:middle line:84%
Gharshana gloves
are not expensive,

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.880 align:middle line:84%
and you can easily buy them
from an Ayurvedic pharmacy

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.520 align:middle line:90%
or at various online retailers.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.840 align:middle line:84%
The oils that you will need
to perform the oil massage

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.680 align:middle line:84%
vary according to your
own specific needs.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.550 align:middle line:84%
If you tend to be cold
and have dry skin,

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.590 align:middle line:90%
then you should use sesame oil.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.640 align:middle line:84%
If you tend to be
hot and intense,

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.760 align:middle line:84%
sunflower oil is
recommended for you.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.600 align:middle line:84%
If you tend to be
cold and slow-moving,

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.960 align:middle line:84%
mustard seed oil is what
will serve you best.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.280 align:middle line:84%
There are also many herbalized
oils that you can use.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.920 align:middle line:84%
So you'll need a way
to warm your oil.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.610 align:middle line:84%
You can just take a glass
bottle full of the oil

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.040 align:middle line:84%
and place it in a
cup of hot water,

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.190 align:middle line:84%
or you can use a more
elaborate oil warmer.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.470 align:middle line:84%
I like an oil warmer
because it makes

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.870 align:middle line:90%
the whole ritual more special.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's so easy to just warm
up the oil in an oil warmer.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.050 align:middle line:84%
Once I've set up,
I'm ready to perform

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.450 align:middle line:90%
this decadent self-care ritual.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.420 align:middle line:84%
First, silk glove
brushing, or Gharshana.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.360 align:middle line:84%
Gharshana literally means
friction through rubbing.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.470 align:middle line:84%
You place the
gloves on your hands

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.040 align:middle line:84%
and notice how the
fingers are split.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.209 align:middle line:84%
This is because you can gently
squeeze as you brush the skin

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.920 align:middle line:90%
to encourage lymphatic flow.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.960 align:middle line:84%
The lymphatic system lies
directly beneath the skin

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.070 align:middle line:84%
and will direct the lymph
back up to the heart.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.950 align:middle line:84%
Massage your entire body except
for your face, your chest,

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.000 align:middle line:84%
and your heart, which, with
the silk glove brushing,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.570 align:middle line:84%
these areas are considered
to be too sensitive.

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.650 align:middle line:84%
We also want to
avoid sensitive areas

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.740 align:middle line:84%
and anywhere the skin
is broken or inflamed.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.720 align:middle line:84%
Use circular strokes on
your stomach and joints,

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.570 align:middle line:84%
like the shoulders, the elbows,
the knees, wrists, hips,

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:04.420 align:middle line:84%
and ankles, and long, sweeping
strokes on the arms and legs.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.390 align:middle line:84%
Apply light pressure
where the skin is thin,

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.090 align:middle line:84%
like under the arms,
and harder pressure

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.600 align:middle line:84%
where the skin is thicker,
like on the soles of the feet.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.450 align:middle line:84%
The direction of the
stroke should always

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.930 align:middle line:84%
be towards your heart, as this
helps drain your lymph back

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.760 align:middle line:90%
to your heart.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.570 align:middle line:84%
Massage from your feet upward,
continuing up to your torso

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.120 align:middle line:90%
and onto your neck.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.760 align:middle line:84%
Also, massage from the
hands to the shoulders.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.690 align:middle line:84%
Continue for at
least five minutes.

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.420 align:middle line:84%
Gharshana is really
essential for people

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.320 align:middle line:84%
with slower metabolism and
those who retain water.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:46.240 align:middle line:10%
Gharshana detoxifies the
liver; removes ama, or toxins;

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.390 align:middle line:10%
promotes healthy
lymphatic circulation;

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:52.480 align:middle line:10%
reduces cellulite;
exfoliates the skin;

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.710 align:middle line:10%
and detoxifies the mind
and the nervous system.

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:01.090 align:middle line:10%
You can complete your self-care
ritual with a warm shower,

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.940 align:middle line:10%
or you can move
on to oil massage.

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.480 align:middle line:84%
You can also do the oil
massage, or Abhyanga,

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:11.570 align:middle line:84%
as a standalone practice
followed by a shower.

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.770 align:middle line:90%
Abhyanga helps to reduce pain.

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.260 align:middle line:84%
It can also help with
sleep disturbances,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.030 align:middle line:84%
even if you do it
in the morning.

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:21.460 align:middle line:84%
It's deeply soothing
to the nervous system

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.120 align:middle line:90%
and reduces anxiety and stress.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.450 align:middle line:84%
First, I put down a
large towel on the floor

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.450 align:middle line:84%
because inevitably, you're
going to get a little bit of oil

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.900 align:middle line:90%
on this towel.

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.110 align:middle line:84%
To perform Abhyanga,
or warm oil massage,

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.840 align:middle line:84%
you take some oil into
your hand and begin

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.920 align:middle line:90%
to rub it on your body.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.940 align:middle line:84%
I like to start with the
scalp, moving up over the head,

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.400 align:middle line:90%
gently tugging on the hair.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.260 align:middle line:90%
You can get your hair very oily.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:56.070 align:middle line:84%
It's very nurturing
for your hair.

00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:05.950 align:middle line:84%
And then massaging your
face, your ears, your neck,

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:14.150 align:middle line:84%
the clavicle, over the chest and
heart center, around the back

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:20.340 align:middle line:84%
and the shoulders, massaging
your entire abdomen

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:27.690 align:middle line:84%
in a clockwise direction,
underneath the rib cage,

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:29.340 align:middle line:90%
down the entire body.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.540 align:middle line:90%


00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:44.340 align:middle line:84%
Don't forget the soles of
your feet, the finger tips,

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.310 align:middle line:84%
the inside of the
ears, as these are

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:52.540 align:middle line:84%
all places where the nerves
are closest to the surface.

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:56.910 align:middle line:90%
Abhyanga communicates self-love.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:02.910 align:middle line:84%
Warm oil is lovingly applied
all over your skin, long stroked

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:07.050 align:middle line:84%
over the muscles and round
strokes over the joints.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:12.740 align:middle line:84%
Be aware of how your body feels
when you pamper it with love.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:18.250 align:middle line:84%
Doing Abhyanga with an intention
makes all the difference.

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:20.820 align:middle line:90%
This is not a mindless act.

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:24.960 align:middle line:84%
It's deeply nourishing,
slightly detoxifying,

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.520 align:middle line:84%
and soothing to
the nervous system.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:31.050 align:middle line:84%
It makes your skin
soft and supple.

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:34.950 align:middle line:84%
It helps with healing
emotional trauma.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:38.520 align:middle line:84%
One of the names of
oil in ancient Sanskrit

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:42.020 align:middle line:90%
actually means love.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:45.920 align:middle line:84%
You can sit with the oil on
your skin for a few minutes

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:50.880 align:middle line:84%
or do a few yoga asana with
the warm oil on your skin.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:56.180 align:middle line:84%
We really recommend that you
use a copious amount of oil.

00:08:56.180 --> 00:09:01.400 align:middle line:84%
You really bathe the whole
body in this warm oil.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.790 align:middle line:84%
You can oil your
face and your hair.

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:07.790 align:middle line:84%
If you get the right oil
for your face and your body,

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:11.900 align:middle line:84%
you can actually cure a
lot of skin difficulties.

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:14.570 align:middle line:84%
And if you oil
your hair, one tip

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:18.500 align:middle line:84%
here is to put your
shampoo in first before you

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.300 align:middle line:84%
get it wet in the
shower or else you

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.970 align:middle line:90%
get a clump of oil and water.

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:27.830 align:middle line:84%
So you'll follow your warm oil
massage with a warm shower.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:30.800 align:middle line:84%
As you rub the oil
into your skin,

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.720 align:middle line:84%
the heat and steam
from the shower

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.510 align:middle line:84%
opens your pores
and allows your skin

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:39.740 align:middle line:84%
to accept the energy and
the essence of the oil.

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:44.720 align:middle line:84%
Notice how this ritual affects
your sleep, your energy,
