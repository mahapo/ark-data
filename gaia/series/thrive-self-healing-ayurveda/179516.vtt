00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.400 align:middle line:10%
>> Namaste and
welcome to Thrive--

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.470 align:middle line:10%
Self-Healing with Ayurveda.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.970 align:middle line:10%
My name's Kishan Shah.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.710 align:middle line:10%
And in this video
we're going to do yoga

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.690 align:middle line:10%
for strength and stamina.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:27.681 align:middle line:90%
Let's get started.

00:00:27.681 --> 00:00:29.180 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
start in Malasana.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.010 align:middle line:90%
Turn your feet out 45 degrees.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.310 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take
a nice slow breath.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.060 align:middle line:90%
Inhale, reach up.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Exhale, start bending the
knees, and pull through.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.250 align:middle line:90%
Drop into a squat.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And then we're just going
to extend the palms flat out

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.270 align:middle line:90%
onto the ground.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.710 align:middle line:84%
Lengthening your spine, pull
your shoulders down the back.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.876 align:middle line:90%
Take a breath in your belly.

00:00:47.876 --> 00:00:50.190 align:middle line:90%
Let it expand out.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.990 align:middle line:90%
And then exhale.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.975 align:middle line:84%
Relax everything towards
the earth below you.

00:00:53.975 --> 00:00:58.080 align:middle line:84%
Eyes closed, I want you to
slow your breathing down.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.010 align:middle line:84%
Feel the blood rush
into your legs.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.720 align:middle line:84%
Feel the strength and
power of your legs,

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.210 align:middle line:84%
thighs, of your hips, and
your tailbone lengthening down

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.880 align:middle line:90%
towards the earth below you.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.210 align:middle line:84%
We'll take one
more big breath in.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.575 align:middle line:84%
And then exhale
softly out your mouth.

00:01:19.575 --> 00:01:22.740 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to slowly
start to slide your hands back.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to spin
our feet to parallel,

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.420 align:middle line:84%
bringing your palms
to your shins.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.080 align:middle line:84%
Now shift your weight forwards
into the fronts of the feet.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.740 align:middle line:84%
I want you to draw
your shoulders back.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.950 align:middle line:84%
Feel the sides of the
neck, long breath in.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:34.750 align:middle line:90%
And then exhale.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.920 align:middle line:84%
Bend your knees so your
ribs come to the thighs.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.820 align:middle line:84%
Slide your hands
down to the floor.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.610 align:middle line:84%
Inhale, Ardha Uttanasana,
Halfway Position,

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.780 align:middle line:90%
coming back up.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.956 align:middle line:84%
Exhale, forward
folding, Uttanasana.

00:01:47.956 --> 00:01:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And we're just going to
do that one more time,

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.650 align:middle line:84%
just beginning to warm up
your legs and your low back.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:55.450 align:middle line:90%
Exhale.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.850 align:middle line:84%
This time just reach
across the opposite elbows.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.920 align:middle line:84%
I want you to give your
hamstrings a break.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.450 align:middle line:84%
So, knees slightly
bent, neck is relaxed.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.580 align:middle line:84%
We'll take one more
long breath here.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.060 align:middle line:84%
Exhale, softening,
deepening the fold.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.560 align:middle line:84%
And then inhale,
straightening legs.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.840 align:middle line:90%
Come up strong, legs flat back.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.800 align:middle line:84%
Reach and rise, arms
to the sky, inhaling.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.060 align:middle line:84%
Exhale and just draw a leg
down the center of your body.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.610 align:middle line:90%
Inhale, reach up.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.120 align:middle line:90%
Tilt the head back, look up.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.220 align:middle line:84%
Bringing the hands to the
forehead, hinge from the waist,

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.750 align:middle line:90%
diving over the legs.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.580 align:middle line:84%
Nice and slow forward fold,
bend the knees if you need.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.880 align:middle line:90%
Inhale, come on up halfway.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.330 align:middle line:84%
We're going to slide our left
leg back into old-school lunge.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.810 align:middle line:84%
Exhale, drive your
hips down low.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.910 align:middle line:84%
Inhale, pull your navel
up, lifting the hips,

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.080 align:middle line:84%
almost straightening
the right leg.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.940 align:middle line:84%
Exhale, warming up the legs and
the spine, opening it on up.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:57.960 align:middle line:90%
One more cycle.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.970 align:middle line:90%
Inhaling, lifting the hips.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.520 align:middle line:90%
Exhale, drive the hips through.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.140 align:middle line:90%
Stay on the fingertips light.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.520 align:middle line:90%
Heart, chest lifts.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.690 align:middle line:84%
Stepping back, right
leg into Downward

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.180 align:middle line:84%
Facing Dog, right away
coming up onto the toes.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.200 align:middle line:84%
Lift up and around
out of your shoulders.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.850 align:middle line:90%
Pull the left knee in.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.540 align:middle line:90%
Step the foot through.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.800 align:middle line:84%
Exhale, old-school
lunge, hips sink club.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.200 align:middle line:84%
Inhaling, hips
rise, belly lifts.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.000 align:middle line:90%
Exhale.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.760 align:middle line:90%
Two more cycles nice and slow.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.320 align:middle line:90%
Move slow, breathe long.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.540 align:middle line:90%
That is the key factor.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.470 align:middle line:90%
One more time.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.760 align:middle line:90%
Exhale, sink it in.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.980 align:middle line:84%
Now I want you to connect
to your low belly.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.980 align:middle line:84%
One big step,
inhale, lengthening.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.010 align:middle line:90%
Exhale, fold.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.610 align:middle line:90%
Bend the knees if you need.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.220 align:middle line:90%
Strong legs flat back.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.115 align:middle line:90%
Inhale, reach and rise.

00:03:45.115 --> 00:03:47.640 align:middle line:90%


00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.951 align:middle line:84%
Exhale, hands down
the center line.

00:03:49.951 --> 00:03:52.840 align:middle line:90%


00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:53.850 align:middle line:90%
Inhale, reaching.

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.980 align:middle line:90%


00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.510 align:middle line:90%
Exhale, hinge from the waist.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.790 align:middle line:84%
Slow movement, long breath,
slow and controlled.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.510 align:middle line:90%
Inhale, lengthening on up.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.570 align:middle line:84%
Once again, right
leg steps back, hips

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.220 align:middle line:90%
sink low, chest, chin lifts.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.830 align:middle line:84%
We're going to reach your left
foot to the sky this time,

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:12.690 align:middle line:90%
Downward Dog.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.787 align:middle line:84%
Now keep your hips
level first round.

00:04:14.787 --> 00:04:15.870 align:middle line:90%
Root your right heel down.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.250 align:middle line:84%
Now press through
your left ankle.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.490 align:middle line:84%
Internally rotate
your left thigh.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And then slowly come up
onto your right toes.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:24.920 align:middle line:90%
Lift the heel.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.310 align:middle line:84%
Pull the left knee into the
chest, looking forwards,

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.900 align:middle line:90%
planting the foot.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And then, making sure
your feet are wide enough

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.740 align:middle line:84%
so you're strong and stable
through your foundation,

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:34.540 align:middle line:90%
inhale.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.400 align:middle line:90%
Peel the belly off the thigh.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.030 align:middle line:90%
Reach the arms back behind.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.830 align:middle line:90%
Spread the fingers.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.680 align:middle line:84%
So, shoulders back,
palms up, chest forwards.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.480 align:middle line:90%
Exhale.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.800 align:middle line:84%
Sit a little deeper
into your front leg.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.390 align:middle line:90%
Start bending the right knee.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to reach the
arms on up into Crescent Pose.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.200 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.240 align:middle line:84%
Tailbone scoops
under a little bit.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.870 align:middle line:90%
Take a big breath in.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.680 align:middle line:84%
And then as you exhale, push
off the ball of your right foot.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.920 align:middle line:90%
Straighten that leg out.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.790 align:middle line:90%
Inhale, reaching forwards.

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.450 align:middle line:84%
Exhale, the left
hand onto the hip.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.220 align:middle line:84%
Now keep this hand
anchored here.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.780 align:middle line:90%
Pull it down and back.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.630 align:middle line:84%
Lightly place right
fingertips to the floor.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.250 align:middle line:84%
Hand stays anchored as
you roll the spine open.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.430 align:middle line:84%
And then when you're
ready, take the arm up.

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.450 align:middle line:84%
Stay light under those
right fingertips.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.390 align:middle line:90%
Inhale, reaching up.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And then as you exhale,
soften into the twist

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.710 align:middle line:90%
maybe a little bit more.

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.890 align:middle line:84%
You can bring the hand down
to the floor or onto a block

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.030 align:middle line:90%
if you need.

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.340 align:middle line:84%
Keep firing the right thigh
up, heel reaching back.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.970 align:middle line:90%
One more breath in.

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.370 align:middle line:84%
Exhale, soften, lean
back a little bit.

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.362 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
release hand to the floor.

00:05:37.362 --> 00:05:39.070 align:middle line:10%
From here, we're going
to come into Plank

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.030 align:middle line:10%
with your left foot lifted.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.370 align:middle line:90%
Point the foot, spread the toes.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:43.730 align:middle line:90%
Look left.

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.760 align:middle line:84%
Roll over onto the outer
blade of the right foot

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.920 align:middle line:90%
for Side Plank.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.940 align:middle line:84%
Option A, feet stacked, ankles,
flex toes up to the face.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.420 align:middle line:84%
Option B, bring the
top for foot in front.

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.380 align:middle line:90%
Inhale, reaching up.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to,
you can also exhale.

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:02.170 align:middle line:90%
Reach forwards.

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.840 align:middle line:84%
Now lift higher out of
the right side body.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.770 align:middle line:84%
Get longer through the left,
just for one more breath.

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.000 align:middle line:90%
Stay through the exhale.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And then on inhale the
arm is going to go up.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.764 align:middle line:84%
Looking down, as the
hand comes to the floor,

00:06:16.764 --> 00:06:17.680 align:middle line:90%
pull the left knee in.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.430 align:middle line:84%
Now core is strong, press
out of the shoulders.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.630 align:middle line:84%
Feel your back body
stretch to the sky.

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.660 align:middle line:84%
Inhale, set your
Plank up strong.

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.070 align:middle line:90%
So crawl your toes forwards.

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.330 align:middle line:84%
Reach your heels back,
thighs lifting Tailbone

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:30.130 align:middle line:90%
tucks a little bit.

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:31.254 align:middle line:90%
Press out of the shoulders.

00:06:31.254 --> 00:06:32.250 align:middle line:90%
Breath in.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:33.050 align:middle line:90%
Exhale.

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.320 align:middle line:84%
You can always lower
the knees to the floor.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.980 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, keep
the thighs lifting.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.240 align:middle line:84%
Elbows shave the ribs as
you come all the way down.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.370 align:middle line:84%
Lifting with the
strength of your back,

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.340 align:middle line:84%
come on up into a Low
Cobra-- so almost as

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.530 align:middle line:84%
if you can lift your
hands off the floor.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.040 align:middle line:84%
Lift with the strength of the
back, neck soft and relaxed,

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.450 align:middle line:90%
breath in.

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:54.670 align:middle line:90%
Stay through the exhale.

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:58.930 align:middle line:84%
And then slowly sit back onto
the heels, Child's Pose, just

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.730 align:middle line:90%
for a breath.

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:03.980 align:middle line:84%
Inhale, shift back forwards
to the hands and knees.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:04.850 align:middle line:90%
Arch the spine.

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:05.650 align:middle line:90%
Spread the fingers.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:06.560 align:middle line:90%
Open the chest.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.450 align:middle line:90%
Look up.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.280 align:middle line:84%
Curling the toes
under, push back

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.780 align:middle line:84%
into Downward Facing Dog,
where we'll start to inhale,

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.680 align:middle line:90%
coming up onto your toes.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.460 align:middle line:84%
Lift up and round
out of the shoulders.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.080 align:middle line:84%
Looking forwards, bend your
knees, sit back onto the hips.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And then step or float the
feet to the top, feet together.

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:26.440 align:middle line:84%
So the big toes touch, heels
separated just a little bit.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.170 align:middle line:90%
Lengthen your spine.

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:30.690 align:middle line:84%
Exhale, bend the knees if
you need, forward fold.

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:31.490 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:32.590 align:middle line:90%
Drop into the hips.

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:36.410 align:middle line:84%
Slowly inhale on
up into Chair Pose.

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:37.210 align:middle line:90%
And then exhale.

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:39.010 align:middle line:90%
Squeeze the glutes.

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:39.940 align:middle line:90%
Come on to standing.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:42.940 align:middle line:90%
Take a breath in.

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:46.120 align:middle line:84%
Exhale out the mouth, release
hands down and behind you,

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.240 align:middle line:90%
open the front body.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.040 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:48.850 align:middle line:90%
Bend the knees.

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:50.200 align:middle line:90%
Touch them out along the way.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.170 align:middle line:84%
Inhale, come back up
into Crescent Pose.

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:57.900 align:middle line:84%
Exhale, dive forward,
and fold over your legs.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:00.010 align:middle line:90%
Inhale, lengthen on up halfway.

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:02.440 align:middle line:84%
This time we're going to
step the left leg back.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.980 align:middle line:84%
Old-school lunge, hips sink
low, chest, chin lifts, look up.

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And now, reaching the right heel
up to the sky, Downward Dog.

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:11.860 align:middle line:84%
This first one, hips
level, internally

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:15.400 align:middle line:84%
rotated the right thigh, big
toe facing straight down.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.600 align:middle line:90%
Take one more breath.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.921 align:middle line:84%
Lengthen your hips away
from the shoulders.

00:08:19.921 --> 00:08:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And then slowly come
up on your left toes.

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:22.820 align:middle line:90%
Lift the heel.

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.660 align:middle line:84%
Pull the right knee into
the chest, looking forwards.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.640 align:middle line:84%
With control, bring
the foot through,

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:31.830 align:middle line:84%
setting your feet up wide
enough, stable, for Crescent.

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:33.130 align:middle line:90%
Inhale, reach back.

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:35.320 align:middle line:84%
Peel the belly
chest off the thigh.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.380 align:middle line:84%
Breath in, exhale, sit a little
deeper into the front leg.

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:40.990 align:middle line:84%
Start bending that back
left knee a little bit.

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:42.859 align:middle line:90%
Arms are going to reach on up.

00:08:42.859 --> 00:08:43.659 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:46.780 align:middle line:84%
Tailbone scoops under
just for one more breath.

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:48.939 align:middle line:90%
Stay through your exhale.

00:08:48.939 --> 00:08:50.230 align:middle line:90%
And then inhale, reach forward.

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:51.550 align:middle line:90%
Straighten out the left leg.

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:53.540 align:middle line:90%
Thigh lifts, heel reaching back.

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.710 align:middle line:90%
Exhale, right hand to the hip.

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:57.870 align:middle line:84%
And then lightly place
left fingertips down.

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:59.970 align:middle line:84%
Keep your right hand
anchored on the hip.

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.760 align:middle line:90%
Slowly roll shoulder back.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And then when you're
ready, take the arm up.

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:06.670 align:middle line:90%
Stay light on the fingertips.

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:08.503 align:middle line:84%
You can always bring
your palm to the floor.

00:09:08.503 --> 00:09:10.980 align:middle line:84%
Make sure you're not dumping
all your weight into that arm.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:14.190 align:middle line:84%
You can also bring a
block underneath that hip.

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:19.950 align:middle line:84%
Left thigh firing up strong,
reach your left heel back.

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:22.030 align:middle line:90%
Inhale, reach up.

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:23.690 align:middle line:84%
Exhale, lean back
a little deeper.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:25.050 align:middle line:90%
Soften.

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:26.535 align:middle line:90%
Release, hand to the floor.

00:09:26.535 --> 00:09:28.860 align:middle line:84%
We're going to extend
the right leg back,

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.630 align:middle line:90%
keeping it lifted in Plank.

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:32.220 align:middle line:90%
That's Half Plank.

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.440 align:middle line:90%
Look to your right.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.370 align:middle line:84%
Roll over onto the
outer blade of the foot.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:37.980 align:middle line:90%
Option A, feet stacked.

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Option B, top leg
in front of you.

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:40.890 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:43.510 align:middle line:84%
Lift higher out of
the left side body.

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:46.170 align:middle line:84%
Exhale, reach
right arm forwards.

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:52.110 align:middle line:84%
We're just going to take
one more slow breath here.

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:55.710 align:middle line:90%
Emphasize it through the exhale.

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:57.030 align:middle line:90%
Inhale, arm is going to go up.

00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:00.480 align:middle line:84%
Looking down, return
the hand to the floor.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.060 align:middle line:84%
And then immediately
pull right knee to chest.

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:04.645 align:middle line:90%
Push out of the shoulders.

00:10:04.645 --> 00:10:08.140 align:middle line:84%
Draw everything into the
center core and lift.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:08.940 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:10.350 align:middle line:90%
Inhale, Plank.

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:12.540 align:middle line:84%
So you have that option
A, knees to the ground

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.930 align:middle line:84%
or straight legs to
the ground, Low Cobra.

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:17.580 align:middle line:84%
Option B, come on
down half way, elbows

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:21.630 align:middle line:84%
to the middle of your ribs, and
then inhaling into Upward Dog,

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:25.470 align:middle line:90%
option B. Take a breath then.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:28.070 align:middle line:84%
Exhale back,
Downward Facing Dog.

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:30.360 align:middle line:90%
We'll take a couple of breaths.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.080 align:middle line:90%
So, heels down as best you can.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.312 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you need to bring your
feet forwards a little bit.

00:10:35.312 --> 00:10:37.520 align:middle line:84%
Make sure the hands are
shoulder width, about as wide

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.890 align:middle line:90%
as the mat, fingertips spread.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:43.620 align:middle line:84%
Lengthen your hips away
from the shoulders.

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:45.780 align:middle line:84%
Widen the shoulder blades
across the upper back.

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:47.800 align:middle line:90%
Neck is relaxed.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:48.600 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.540 align:middle line:90%
Breath in.

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:54.400 align:middle line:90%
Exhale out the mouth.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.860 align:middle line:90%
And let's go ahead right away.

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.230 align:middle line:90%
Step the feet together.

00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:00.230 align:middle line:84%
This time we're going to
take the right leg up.

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And now open the hip, reach
straight on up for the ceiling.

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:03.510 align:middle line:90%
Point the foot.

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:05.110 align:middle line:90%
Spread the toes.

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:06.930 align:middle line:90%
Take your time.

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:08.160 align:middle line:90%
Come up onto your left toes.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.360 align:middle line:90%
Lift the heel.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.310 align:middle line:84%
Right knee draws on
up into the chest.

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:15.240 align:middle line:84%
Looking forwards, plant the foot
through, back heel to the floor

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.690 align:middle line:90%
like Warrior 1 feet.

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:19.230 align:middle line:84%
You may want to widen your
right foot a little bit.

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:20.970 align:middle line:90%
Right hand to the hip.

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:21.920 align:middle line:90%
Draw that hip back.

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.100 align:middle line:90%
Look back to the left foot.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.657 align:middle line:84%
Make sure the inner arch
is lifted and strong.

00:11:25.657 --> 00:11:27.490 align:middle line:84%
So you're pressing firm
into the outer blade

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:31.280 align:middle line:84%
and heel of that left
foot, looking forwards.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:32.350 align:middle line:90%
Left hand reaches.

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:33.990 align:middle line:90%
Take a breath in.

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:35.600 align:middle line:90%
Exhale, stay.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.400 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.310 align:middle line:90%
Right arm reaches forwards.

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:42.530 align:middle line:84%
Inhale, Virabhadrasana
1-- Warrior I. Exhale,

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:44.460 align:middle line:90%
pull it into the chest.

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.620 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go through
a little movement cycle.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:48.960 align:middle line:90%
Inhale, lean back.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.640 align:middle line:90%
Exhale, push forwards.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:54.540 align:middle line:84%
Inhale, reach back behind
you, interlock the fingers,

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.880 align:middle line:84%
let your hands draw
the chest on up.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:00.060 align:middle line:84%
Now you can, A, rest
your chest on the thigh

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.030 align:middle line:90%
or drop it in, touch your mat.

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And then inhale, reach the
hands forward, strong legs,

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:06.730 align:middle line:90%
come on up.

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:08.250 align:middle line:90%
Were doing two of those.

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:10.560 align:middle line:90%
Exhale.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.410 align:middle line:90%
Inhale, lift the chest.

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:16.110 align:middle line:90%
Exhale, lean forwards, push.

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:18.840 align:middle line:84%
Inhale, reach back,
interlock your fingers,

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:21.160 align:middle line:90%
climb back up the front body.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:21.960 align:middle line:90%
Exhale.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:23.190 align:middle line:90%
Keep your hips square.

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:25.560 align:middle line:90%
Drop your chest.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.090 align:middle line:90%
Touch the mat along the way.

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:27.990 align:middle line:90%
Inhale.

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:30.930 align:middle line:90%
Reach and rise, last one.

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:33.870 align:middle line:90%
Exhale, draw it in.

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:36.240 align:middle line:90%
Inhale, open.

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:39.080 align:middle line:90%
Exhale, lean forwards and push.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Inhale, climb back up the
front body, open the chest.

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:47.310 align:middle line:90%
Exhale, drop it down.

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:49.650 align:middle line:90%
And release, hands to the mat.

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:50.810 align:middle line:90%
Reach forwards and up.

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:51.610 align:middle line:90%
Inhale.

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:53.160 align:middle line:90%
Strong legs-- we're almost done.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:53.460 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.050 align:middle line:84%
I know you're feeling
that right leg.

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:57.240 align:middle line:84%
And let it go,
hands to the floor.

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.345 align:middle line:84%
Let's take the right
leg up to the sky.

00:12:59.345 --> 00:13:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Bend the knee, draw the
thigh back, open the hip.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.240 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:06.090 align:middle line:84%
We're going to draw your
knee into the chest.

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:07.590 align:middle line:90%
And then just circle it around.

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:09.796 align:middle line:90%
Make a big circle.

00:13:09.796 --> 00:13:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Knee back to chest and
release, Downward Dog.

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:18.250 align:middle line:84%
Feet together, let's
do the left side.

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:19.050 align:middle line:90%
Left leg lifts.

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:19.680 align:middle line:90%
Keep it straight.

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.080 align:middle line:84%
Point your foot, spread the
toes, open through the hip.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.180 align:middle line:90%
So, reach for the sky.

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And then, taking your time,
come upon onto the right toes.

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.280 align:middle line:84%
Left knee draws on
up into the chest,

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.120 align:middle line:84%
looking forwards, putting
the foot to the top,

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.030 align:middle line:90%
back heel down.

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:36.220 align:middle line:84%
Now get into the outer blade
and heel of that back foot,

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:37.950 align:middle line:90%
left hand to the hip.

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:39.590 align:middle line:90%
Pull tat hip back.

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:42.270 align:middle line:84%
Inhale, right arm
forwards, pause.

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:43.170 align:middle line:90%
Stay, exhale.

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:45.550 align:middle line:84%
Hips stay square,
reach forwards.

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:47.970 align:middle line:90%
Inhale, Vira 1, opposite side.

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:49.060 align:middle line:90%
Inhale.

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:49.860 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:52.720 align:middle line:90%
Exhale, hands to heart.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.740 align:middle line:90%
Inhale, open the front body.

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:58.110 align:middle line:90%
Exhale, push forwards.

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:00.450 align:middle line:84%
Inhale, reach back behind
you, interlock fingers,

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:03.840 align:middle line:84%
and climb back up the
front body, inhaling.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.240 align:middle line:90%
Exhale, hip stays square.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.500 align:middle line:90%
Drop it down.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:10.500 align:middle line:84%
We're going to scrape our
fingers along the mat.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.110 align:middle line:84%
Reach forwards,
strong legs, come up.

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:15.815 align:middle line:90%
Two more cycles, exhaling.

00:14:15.815 --> 00:14:16.615 align:middle line:90%
Inhale.

00:14:16.615 --> 00:14:19.200 align:middle line:90%


00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.750 align:middle line:90%
Exhale, lean forwards, push.

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:23.310 align:middle line:84%
Keep connecting
to the outer blade

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:24.480 align:middle line:90%
and heel of that right foot.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.220 align:middle line:90%
Inhale, come on up.

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:29.550 align:middle line:90%
Exhale hip stays square.

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:31.740 align:middle line:90%
Relax through the shoulders.

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:35.760 align:middle line:84%
Touch the mat, inhale,
reach and rise.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.370 align:middle line:90%
Last cycle, bring it in.

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:41.880 align:middle line:90%
Slow movement, long breath.

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:45.070 align:middle line:84%
Exhale, lean forwards,
push forwards.

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:47.830 align:middle line:90%
Inhale, climb it back up.

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:50.610 align:middle line:90%
Open the heart, chest.

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:54.660 align:middle line:84%
Exhale, completing,
almost there.

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:58.620 align:middle line:84%
Strong legs, reach
forwards, come on up.

00:14:58.620 --> 00:14:59.420 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:00.830 align:middle line:90%
Bring it in slow.

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:02.680 align:middle line:84%
This is where you
want to slow down.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:03.480 align:middle line:90%
Nice.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.880 align:middle line:84%
Straight, left
leg, up to the sky.

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And now bend the knee,
draw the thigh back,

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.460 align:middle line:90%
make that feel good.

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:10.260 align:middle line:90%
Nice.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.120 align:middle line:84%
Knee to chest,
make a big circle.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.350 align:middle line:90%
Knee stays bent.

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:18.242 align:middle line:84%
Open the hip leg around to
the side, Downward Facing Dog.

00:15:18.242 --> 00:15:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll take
a few breaths here.

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:22.210 align:middle line:90%
Press out at the shoulders.

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:23.730 align:middle line:84%
See if you can lift
the big toes up

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:26.850 align:middle line:84%
and spread the pinky
toes wide and down,

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:28.950 align:middle line:90%
rooting your heels down.

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:31.370 align:middle line:90%
Take a big breath in.

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:35.370 align:middle line:84%
Exhale, pause, Child's Pose
just for a few breaths.

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:37.575 align:middle line:90%
Sit back onto the heels, rest.

00:15:37.575 --> 00:15:52.630 align:middle line:90%


00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:53.430 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:54.770 align:middle line:90%
One more long breath in.

00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:57.400 align:middle line:90%


00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:00.480 align:middle line:90%
Exhale softly at the mouth.

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.960 align:middle line:84%
And then slowly
sitting on back up.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:03.760 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:06.880 align:middle line:84%
So now we're just going
to come into Plank.

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.610 align:middle line:84%
We're going to add five yoga
push-ups for the upper body.

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:12.570 align:middle line:84%
We just did something really
strong for the low body.

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:15.650 align:middle line:84%
A yoga push-up is
essentially long breath,

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:18.580 align:middle line:84%
push-up to Chaturanga
or Plank to Chaturanga.

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:20.782 align:middle line:84%
You can do this with
your knees to the floor.

00:16:20.782 --> 00:16:22.615 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm just going to
demonstrate from Plank.

00:16:22.615 --> 00:16:24.820 align:middle line:84%
It's right here,
elbows shave the ribs.

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:27.012 align:middle line:90%
Don't dip the chest any lower.

00:16:27.012 --> 00:16:28.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do knees
down with you guys.

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:29.520 align:middle line:90%
So, give of them.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.480 align:middle line:90%
We'll move slow, breathe long.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:35.860 align:middle line:90%
Inhale, exhale down.

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:38.980 align:middle line:90%
Inhale up, slow.

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:41.790 align:middle line:90%
Exhale down.

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:44.510 align:middle line:90%
Inhale up.

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:46.080 align:middle line:90%
Exhale down.

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.790 align:middle line:90%
That's three-- two more.

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:50.070 align:middle line:90%
Inhale up.

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:52.690 align:middle line:90%
Exhale down.

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:53.490 align:middle line:90%
One last one.

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:55.950 align:middle line:90%
Inhale.

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:57.970 align:middle line:90%
Exhale.

00:16:57.970 --> 00:16:58.770 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:00.630 align:middle line:90%
Press back up.

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:01.458 align:middle line:90%
Child's Pose.

00:17:01.458 --> 00:17:04.089 align:middle line:90%


00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:06.119 align:middle line:90%
Nice.

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:10.950 align:middle line:84%
Take one more long breath
in through the nose.

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:12.869 align:middle line:90%
Exhale softly out the mouth.

00:17:12.869 --> 00:17:15.589 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, your heart rate
has come down a little bit.

00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Slowly inhale, shift forwards
to the hands and knees.

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:21.810 align:middle line:84%
We're just going to arch
the spine, grip the mat,

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:23.658 align:middle line:90%
pull the chest through.

00:17:23.658 --> 00:17:25.422 align:middle line:90%
Curl the toes under.

00:17:25.422 --> 00:17:26.880 align:middle line:84%
Exhale back to
Downward Facing Dog.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.790 align:middle line:90%


00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:31.092 align:middle line:90%
Right away inhale.

00:17:31.092 --> 00:17:32.050 align:middle line:90%
Come up onto your toes.

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:34.090 align:middle line:84%
Lift up and round
out of the shoulders.

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:36.870 align:middle line:84%
Exhale, bend the knees,
look forward, step or spring

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:39.210 align:middle line:90%
to the top, feet hip distance.

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:41.700 align:middle line:90%
Lengthen your spine, breath in.

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:46.320 align:middle line:84%
Bend the knees if you
need, forward fold.

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:47.810 align:middle line:90%
Inhale strong.

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:50.910 align:middle line:90%
Reach and rise.

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:52.380 align:middle line:90%
Exhale, hands to the heart.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:56.720 align:middle line:90%
Space, pause, breath in.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.030 align:middle line:90%
Exhale out the mouth.

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:01.700 align:middle line:84%
So now we're going to
learn Thoppukaranam,

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:06.230 align:middle line:84%
which is an ancient practice
often done at temples in India,

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:08.360 align:middle line:84%
specifically in
front of Ganesha,

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:12.300 align:middle line:84%
or the elephant-headed god,
the god of removing obstacles.

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:15.830 align:middle line:84%
What we're going to do is take
your left hand, thumb in front.

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:18.260 align:middle line:90%
Grab your earlobe first.

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:23.190 align:middle line:84%
Right hand over top, thumb
in front, right arm on top.

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And then all it is
is a simple squat.

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:26.760 align:middle line:84%
So, sitting up
nice and tall, make

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.770 align:middle line:84%
sure the knees
don't go too wide.

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:30.970 align:middle line:90%
You want to inhale.

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:32.730 align:middle line:90%
This is very specific--

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:34.545 align:middle line:90%
inhale as you go down.

00:18:34.545 --> 00:18:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And then if you've
ever taken a syringe

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:39.290 align:middle line:84%
and pulled up some liquid
or some water into it,

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:41.780 align:middle line:84%
I want you to think
about that sensation

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:44.250 align:middle line:90%
as you inhale going down.

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:46.610 align:middle line:84%
As you exhale when
you're pulling up,

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:50.065 align:middle line:84%
feel like you're drawing
energy up into the pelvis.

00:18:50.065 --> 00:18:54.110 align:middle line:84%
Ganesha is associated with the
root chakra, Muladhara chakra.

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:56.600 align:middle line:84%
It's also associated
with the earth elemental.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.030 align:middle line:84%
So this specific practice
you should do daily

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:02.850 align:middle line:84%
when you wake up 18 times to
increase the size of your root

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:05.750 align:middle line:84%
chakra, and increase
your stability,

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:06.800 align:middle line:90%
and strengthen the body.

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.840 align:middle line:84%
Left hand first,
right hand in front.

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.540 align:middle line:84%
If you have bad knees,
you can do this just

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:15.650 align:middle line:84%
to about here, or wherever
it feels good for you.

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:19.370 align:middle line:84%
If you have good knees, make
sure if it starts to feel bad,

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:21.927 align:middle line:90%
back off, do less quantity.

00:19:21.927 --> 00:19:23.260 align:middle line:90%
We're just going to inhale down.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.190 align:middle line:90%
We're going to do this 18 times.

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:27.030 align:middle line:84%
You do it as many
times as you can.

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:29.040 align:middle line:90%
Inhale down.

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:29.840 align:middle line:90%
Exhale up.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:20:07.820 align:middle line:90%


00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:10.690 align:middle line:90%
Last one.

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:11.950 align:middle line:90%
Good, that's 18.

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:12.940 align:middle line:90%
Inhale the arms up.

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:15.340 align:middle line:90%
Spin your feet out 45 degrees.

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:16.810 align:middle line:90%
Start bending the knees.

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:20.150 align:middle line:84%
Pull through to
Malasana, Yogic Squat,

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:21.520 align:middle line:90%
sitting up nice and tall.

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:24.440 align:middle line:90%


00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:27.910 align:middle line:90%
Exhale at the mouth.

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:28.780 align:middle line:90%
Nice.

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:31.237 align:middle line:84%
Let's open up the
shoulders a little bit

00:20:31.237 --> 00:20:32.570 align:middle line:90%
and get a little bit of a twist.

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:35.050 align:middle line:84%
So we're going move back,
hips over the knees.

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Walk your hands out
in front of you.

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:38.404 align:middle line:84%
Make sure the hips
don't cheat forwards.

00:20:38.404 --> 00:20:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And then all we're going
to do is thread the needle.

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:44.600 align:middle line:84%
With the right arm across,
shoulder to the floor,

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.870 align:middle line:84%
let the head be
relaxed the whole time.

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:49.010 align:middle line:84%
Reach behind you,
grab the inner thigh.

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:53.030 align:middle line:90%
Head stays relaxed, pull open.

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And just take a couple
more breaths here.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:21:04.247 align:middle line:90%


00:21:04.247 --> 00:21:05.740 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:13.222 align:middle line:84%
And releasing, switching sides,
left shoulder to the mat.

00:21:13.222 --> 00:21:15.100 align:middle line:90%
Let's take the opposite around.

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:17.680 align:middle line:84%
See if you can reach around
and grab the left thigh.

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.350 align:middle line:90%
Let the head be relaxed.

00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:23.320 align:middle line:84%
Use this thigh
here and draw open.

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:25.740 align:middle line:90%
Roll the shoulder back.

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:29.820 align:middle line:84%
We're just going to take
one more big breath in.

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:33.420 align:middle line:90%
Stay through the exhale.

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:35.050 align:middle line:90%
And then release.

00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:37.105 align:middle line:90%
Come forwards onto your abdomen.

00:21:37.105 --> 00:21:40.940 align:middle line:90%


00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:42.150 align:middle line:90%
Watch closely.

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:45.296 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take the
right knee up to 90 degrees.

00:21:45.296 --> 00:21:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
take same thing,

00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:49.250 align:middle line:84%
threading needle
with my left arm.

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:54.050 align:middle line:84%
Shoulder to the floor, I'm
just going to flop over

00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:58.220 align:middle line:90%
into a nice relaxing twist.

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:00.470 align:middle line:90%
Close Your eyes.

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:04.100 align:middle line:84%
Start to slow your
breathing down.

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:10.250 align:middle line:84%
And just feel that
warm blanket of gravity

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:14.540 align:middle line:84%
being pulled over your
body, drawing you down

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:19.160 align:middle line:84%
into the strength and the
stability of the earth

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:24.740 align:middle line:84%
below you, arms stretched
open to embrace you.

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:27.290 align:middle line:90%
Breath in.

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:29.380 align:middle line:90%
Exhale softly out the mouth.

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:31.860 align:middle line:84%
We're just going
to switch sides.

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:34.460 align:middle line:84%
Lazily flip back
over onto the belly.

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:36.980 align:middle line:90%
Straighten your right leg out.

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And then start bending
your left knee up.

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:43.400 align:middle line:84%
Thread the needle
and the right arm.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And all we're going to
do is just flop over

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:48.410 align:middle line:90%
into the twist, opposite side.

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:51.350 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully your heart rate
is starting to slow down.

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:54.660 align:middle line:90%


00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:56.740 align:middle line:84%
And you can really
help in that process

00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:00.640 align:middle line:84%
by softening your breathing,
breathing with the nose.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.444 align:middle line:84%
I know some of you, this
may have been super cardio.

00:23:03.444 --> 00:23:05.110 align:middle line:84%
Trust me-- if you
breathe with the nose,

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:06.880 align:middle line:90%
you need to build that muscle.

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.500 align:middle line:84%
If you're having a
hard time, I know

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:10.780 align:middle line:84%
sometimes it feels natural
to breathe with the mouth.

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:13.010 align:middle line:84%
But see if you can
breathe with the nose.

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:13.810 align:middle line:90%
Last breath in.

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:16.450 align:middle line:90%


00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:19.760 align:middle line:90%
Exhale, stay.

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.326 align:middle line:84%
And then shift back
over onto the belly.

00:23:22.326 --> 00:23:25.620 align:middle line:84%
We're going to push back to
lengthen out the low back just

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:26.580 align:middle line:90%
a little bit.

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:28.680 align:middle line:90%
Balasana, Child's Pose.

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:31.080 align:middle line:84%
Couple breaths in
through your nose.

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:36.000 align:middle line:10%
Like you're fogging a piece of
glass, exhale out the mouth.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.340 align:middle line:90%
One more breath in.

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:41.890 align:middle line:84%
Like you're fogging a piece of
glass, exhale out the mouth.

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:42.690 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:45.570 align:middle line:90%
And then slowly sitting on up.

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:50.620 align:middle line:84%
We're going to move on to
our backs for our Savasana.

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:52.780 align:middle line:90%
And get comfortable.

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:54.490 align:middle line:84%
Spring the legs on
out in front of you,

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:55.820 align:middle line:90%
feet about as wide as the mat.

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:59.230 align:middle line:84%
Let the ankles fall open,
hands about a foot away

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:00.490 align:middle line:90%
from the hips, palms up.

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:03.250 align:middle line:90%


00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to
just close your eyes.

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And then go back
to that sensation

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:13.670 align:middle line:84%
of being drawn down into the
earth, that earth element

00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:16.430 align:middle line:90%
of strength and stability.

00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:19.358 align:middle line:90%


00:24:19.358 --> 00:24:20.530 align:middle line:90%
Breath is calm.

00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:23.560 align:middle line:90%


00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:27.070 align:middle line:84%
We're just going to
take one long breath in.

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:28.530 align:middle line:90%
Breathe into your belly.

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:30.937 align:middle line:84%
Let it fill, roll,
rise all the way up

00:24:30.937 --> 00:24:32.020 align:middle line:90%
into the top of the chest.

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:33.811 align:middle line:84%
If you're pregnant,
don't hold your breath.

00:24:33.811 --> 00:24:35.740 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, hold the breath.

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:39.160 align:middle line:90%
Comfortably hold your breath.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:39.960 align:middle line:90%
Hold.

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.590 align:middle line:90%


00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:46.710 align:middle line:84%
See yourself climbing to
the top of a mountain.

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:48.340 align:middle line:90%
You're at the top.

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:50.690 align:middle line:90%
Hold.

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:53.130 align:middle line:90%
And jumping off, exhale.

00:24:53.130 --> 00:26:14.310 align:middle line:90%


00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:18.640 align:middle line:84%
Keeping your eyes closed,
just get a little movement

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:21.586 align:middle line:90%
in your fingertips and toes.

00:26:21.586 --> 00:26:23.440 align:middle line:84%
The fingers and
toes are actually

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:27.010 align:middle line:84%
associated with the
root chakra as well.

00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:29.560 align:middle line:84%
So bringing a little bit of
movement to fingers and toes

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:33.460 align:middle line:84%
brings you back through the
body into the earth element.

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to
invite you to keep

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:39.160 align:middle line:84%
your eyes closed all the way
up into the seated position.

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.460 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
reach the arms up.

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:42.835 align:middle line:84%
Give yourself a
bit of a stretch.

00:26:42.835 --> 00:26:45.440 align:middle line:90%


00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.770 align:middle line:90%
Exhale, knees into your chest.

00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:51.410 align:middle line:90%


00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:52.210 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:54.280 align:middle line:84%
Let the knees fall
off to the right,

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:58.707 align:middle line:84%
right arm above you to rest
the head like a pillow.

00:26:58.707 --> 00:27:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And then you're just going
to press your left hand

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:02.270 align:middle line:90%
to the floor.

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:03.340 align:middle line:90%
Keep your eyes closed.

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:09.020 align:middle line:84%
Come up to any comfortable
seated upright posture,

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:10.025 align:middle line:90%
whatever you like.

00:27:10.025 --> 00:27:14.850 align:middle line:90%


00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:19.440 align:middle line:84%
Palms resting on the knees,
index finger and thumb

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:27.290 align:middle line:84%
together, palms facing down,
sitting up tall, abdomen soft.

00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:30.850 align:middle line:10%
And I want you to tilt
your chest up two degrees.

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:33.790 align:middle line:10%


00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:37.840 align:middle line:10%
And now bow your chin slightly
into the chest two degrees.

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:39.870 align:middle line:10%
You'll feel the back of
your neck lengthen up.

00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:44.280 align:middle line:90%


00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:48.810 align:middle line:84%
Curl the tip of your tongue back
up on the roof of your mouth,

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:49.980 align:middle line:90%
pointing upwards.

00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:51.000 align:middle line:90%
Hold it there softly.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.350 align:middle line:90%


00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:56.210 align:middle line:84%
Making sure your
abdomen is soft,

00:27:56.210 --> 00:28:00.760 align:middle line:84%
zero control over
your breathing.

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And I invite you to just tune
in to the grounding energy--

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:09.700 align:middle line:84%
called prana-- coming in
through the crown of the head

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:10.930 align:middle line:90%
down to the belly.

00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:13.750 align:middle line:90%


00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:17.693 align:middle line:84%
And then, feeling that
exhale from the navel center

00:28:17.693 --> 00:28:22.320 align:middle line:90%
down to the earth, apana vayu.

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.840 align:middle line:84%
And you can remain here
for as long as you like.

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:29.080 align:middle line:90%


00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:29.880 align:middle line:90%
Namaste.

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:32.580 align:middle line:90%


00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:35.930 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:49.131 align:middle line:90%
