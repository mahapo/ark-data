00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:17.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.020 align:middle line:10%
Welcome to "Thrive, Self
Healing for Ayurveda."

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.910 align:middle line:10%
My name's Kishan
Shah, and today we're

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.190 align:middle line:10%
going to go through a yoga
sequence specially designed

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.650 align:middle line:10%
to increase your metabolic rate
and build your core strength.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.180 align:middle line:84%
So let's get started
on our backs.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.590 align:middle line:90%
Draw your knees into the chest.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.140 align:middle line:90%
Give yourself a nice squeeze.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.880 align:middle line:90%
Take a breath in.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.800 align:middle line:84%
And then exhale
softly out the mouth.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll slowly reach
the arms on up above you.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.460 align:middle line:90%
Take a big breath in.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.900 align:middle line:90%
And then exhale slowly.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.970 align:middle line:84%
Using your core
strength, let your knees

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.240 align:middle line:90%
fall off to the right.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.640 align:middle line:90%


00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.296 align:middle line:84%
And then coming on
back up on an inhale.

00:01:00.296 --> 00:01:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And all we're going to do is the
same thing on the other side.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.335 align:middle line:90%
Make sure you're exhaling long.

00:01:06.335 --> 00:01:09.310 align:middle line:90%


00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.330 align:middle line:90%
And then coming on back up.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.250 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do that two
more times, both sides.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.370 align:middle line:84%
So elongating your breath as
you slow down your movement.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.170 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.370 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
core principles.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.880 align:middle line:84%
Elongation of breath,
slow movement.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And the principle
of slow movement

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.180 align:middle line:84%
is there to facilitate the
lengthening of your breath.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.400 align:middle line:84%
We're going to come
back up on an inhale,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.040 align:middle line:84%
just finishing off
the last round.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.020 align:middle line:84%
Knees to the right
as you exhale.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.030 align:middle line:90%


00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.160 align:middle line:90%
And then we'll inhale.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.800 align:middle line:90%
Come on up.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.660 align:middle line:84%
Just warming up the
core and the back

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.580 align:middle line:84%
before we jump
into this practice.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.580 align:middle line:90%


00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.630 align:middle line:90%
And last one.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:54.905 align:middle line:90%
Coming on up.

00:01:54.905 --> 00:01:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And we'll slowly extend
your left leg out.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.750 align:middle line:84%
Pull your right
knee into the chest.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.450 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to keep
your left foot lifted.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.250 align:middle line:90%
Point the feet.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.290 align:middle line:90%
Spread the toes.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And now draw your right knee
a little bit outside the ribs

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.639 align:middle line:90%
and down towards the shoulder.

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:10.449 align:middle line:90%
Take a big breath.

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:13.230 align:middle line:90%
Inhale through the nose.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And then as you exhale,
release the left foot down.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to just
draw your left knee over,

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.440 align:middle line:84%
as you extend the right
arm out, and twist,

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.880 align:middle line:90%
just for a couple more breaths.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.670 align:middle line:84%
Breathing down
into the side body,

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.090 align:middle line:84%
breathing into your low back,
and finding yourself relaxing

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.860 align:middle line:84%
and softening into
your exhalation.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.430 align:middle line:90%
Take one more big breath in.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.230 align:middle line:90%
Exhale.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.030 align:middle line:90%
Soften.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.470 align:middle line:90%
Deepen into it.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.510 align:middle line:90%
Returning onto your backs.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.980 align:middle line:90%
And switch legs.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.600 align:middle line:90%
Left knee in, right leg out.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.800 align:middle line:90%
Keep the right foot lifted.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.600 align:middle line:90%
Point the foot.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.140 align:middle line:90%
Spread the toes.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.460 align:middle line:84%
Left knee slightly
outside the ribs and down.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.430 align:middle line:90%
Take a big breath in.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.245 align:middle line:90%


00:02:57.245 --> 00:02:59.460 align:middle line:90%
And then as you exhale, release.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.900 align:middle line:90%
Foot down.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.930 align:middle line:84%
Draw left knee
over to the right.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.640 align:middle line:90%
Left arm extends out.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.980 align:middle line:90%
Softening the neck.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.110 align:middle line:84%
Softening through
the whole body.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.950 align:middle line:90%
Relaxing.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.800 align:middle line:90%
Softening through the exhale.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.430 align:middle line:90%
One more long breath in.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.300 align:middle line:84%
You can go ahead and exhale
softly out the mouth.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And then release
onto your backs.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.271 align:middle line:90%
Both knees in.

00:03:30.271 --> 00:03:31.270 align:middle line:90%
And then we'll go ahead.

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:32.692 align:middle line:90%
Reach on up for your feet.

00:03:32.692 --> 00:03:34.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, bring the feet together,
and then draw your feet

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.210 align:middle line:90%
in towards the hips and belly.

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And then gently
press the knees away.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.010 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of a Baddha
Konasana on your back.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.220 align:middle line:84%
Just a stretch to warm up
the inner groin a little bit.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And then playfully, go
ahead and rock back.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.290 align:middle line:84%
Keep your hands on the
feet and rock on up.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.367 align:middle line:84%
Bring your feet on out into
a nice big diamond shape.

00:03:53.367 --> 00:03:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And then we're just going
to interlock the fingers

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.770 align:middle line:90%
around the toes.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.650 align:middle line:84%
Lengthen your chest forward
so the front body lengthens.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:00.550 align:middle line:90%
And then exhale.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.160 align:middle line:84%
Bow your forehead
into the heels.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.090 align:middle line:90%
It may not touch.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And in this variation, it's OK
if you round through your back

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.130 align:middle line:90%
a little bit.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.150 align:middle line:90%
And we'll just breathe.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.030 align:middle line:90%
Breathe down into your low back.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.730 align:middle line:90%
Take a big breath in.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And then same thing, exhale
and soften the whole body.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.420 align:middle line:84%
Feel all tension releasing
through that exhalation.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.220 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.000 align:middle line:90%
Last long breath in.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.210 align:middle line:90%
Exhale softly out the mouth.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And then we're
going to slowly rise

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.070 align:middle line:84%
on up, finding a comfortable
cross-legged position

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.980 align:middle line:90%
for yourself.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.040 align:middle line:84%
So if you have tight
hips or a tight low

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.800 align:middle line:84%
back, what you want to
do is grab a blanket

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.130 align:middle line:84%
or bolster and then
get your sit bones

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.255 align:middle line:90%
off the floor a little bit.

00:04:45.255 --> 00:04:46.054 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:04:46.054 --> 00:04:48.670 align:middle line:84%
That's going to help you from
rounding through the low back

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.710 align:middle line:84%
and being more comfortable
sitting upright

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.360 align:middle line:90%
for a long period of time.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.170 align:middle line:84%
Option A is Sukhasana, ankles
right underneath the knees.

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.340 align:middle line:90%
Sitting up nice and tall.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.430 align:middle line:84%
Option B would be to
draw the left heel in,

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.860 align:middle line:84%
bringing the right
foot in front first.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.210 align:middle line:90%
That's how I'm going to sit.

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:05.320 align:middle line:90%
And then lean forward.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.720 align:middle line:84%
Pull the flesh back
from the sit bones.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.080 align:middle line:90%
And then sitting back down.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.080 align:middle line:84%
So the first Pranayama
we're going to go through

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.780 align:middle line:84%
is known as Bhastrika
Pranayama, or Bellows Breath.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.890 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
actually soften the belly.

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.960 align:middle line:84%
This is really beginning to get
into full yogic breath, right?

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And then what we're going to
do is speed that process up.

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.050 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to take
the right hand just

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.540 align:middle line:84%
above the navel center
to the solar plexus.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.049 align:middle line:90%
Left hand over the top.

00:05:30.049 --> 00:05:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And if you're familiar
with this Pranayama,

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.760 align:middle line:84%
you can already
start with your hands

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.800 align:middle line:84%
down, palms up, in
Chin Mudra, both hands.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.440 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, start with me.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.440 align:middle line:84%
Hand right below the
sternum, above the navel.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.370 align:middle line:90%
Right hand first.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:43.700 align:middle line:90%
Left hand on top.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.160 align:middle line:84%
And all we're going
to do is begin

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.070 align:middle line:84%
to pump the breath
in and out, focusing

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.350 align:middle line:90%
on both inhale and exhalation.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.360 align:middle line:84%
This is going to bring a lot of
heat and warmth into the body.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.160 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.600 align:middle line:84%
So starting slowly,
and then we're

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.790 align:middle line:84%
going to speed it up, and
do it for about two minutes.

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:59.590 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.500 align:middle line:84%
So eyes open, looking
at the tip of the nose.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.330 align:middle line:84%
Or you can do this
with your eyes closed,

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:05.840 align:middle line:90%
and just follow my voice.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.640 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.470 align:middle line:90%
Soft abdomen.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:09.940 align:middle line:90%
Nice and slow.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:10.740 align:middle line:90%
Inhale.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.750 align:middle line:90%
Let the belly expand out.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.520 align:middle line:90%
Use the hands to exhale.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.460 align:middle line:90%
Push in.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.840 align:middle line:84%
All we're going to do is
slowly start to speed that up.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:20.879 align:middle line:90%
Inhale.

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:23.374 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:23.374 --> 00:08:09.200 align:middle line:90%


00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:14.470 align:middle line:84%
Our last five, four,
three, two, one.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:15.290 align:middle line:90%
Take a big breath.

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:18.270 align:middle line:90%
Inhale through the nose.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.910 align:middle line:90%
Exhale out the nose.

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:23.640 align:middle line:90%
Exhale all the breath out.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:24.830 align:middle line:90%
Pull your navel in.

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:25.910 align:middle line:90%
Gently drop the chin.

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:36.000 align:middle line:84%
Hold with your breath out for
five, four, three, two, one.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.010 align:middle line:84%
Slowly inhaling
through the nose.

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:39.450 align:middle line:90%
Palms up with the hands.

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:40.350 align:middle line:90%
Eyes closed.

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:42.262 align:middle line:84%
Taking three very
long, slow breaths.

00:08:42.262 --> 00:08:43.095 align:middle line:90%
In through the nose.

00:08:43.095 --> 00:08:46.510 align:middle line:90%


00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:47.590 align:middle line:90%
Exhaling out the nose.

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:50.050 align:middle line:90%
Draw the navel in.

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:51.760 align:middle line:90%
Staying calm in the body.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:52.640 align:middle line:90%
Slow breath.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:53.690 align:middle line:90%
Inhale through the nose.

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:54.490 align:middle line:90%
Belly expands.

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:57.790 align:middle line:90%


00:08:57.790 --> 00:08:58.590 align:middle line:90%
Exhale.

00:08:58.590 --> 00:08:59.530 align:middle line:90%
Draw the navel in.

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:03.690 align:middle line:90%


00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:04.490 align:middle line:90%
Inhale.

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:05.900 align:middle line:90%
Abdomen expands out.

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.340 align:middle line:90%


00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:10.140 align:middle line:90%
Exhale.

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:11.915 align:middle line:90%
Slowly draw the navel in.

00:09:11.915 --> 00:09:14.890 align:middle line:90%


00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:18.370 align:middle line:84%
And opening your eyes
into a nice soft gaze.

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:20.080 align:middle line:84%
Just noticing how
dramatically different

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.400 align:middle line:84%
you feel by this
point in the practice.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.260 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.480 align:middle line:84%
So the next move that
we're going to go through

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.460 align:middle line:90%
is a little progression.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:30.460 align:middle line:84%
And part of it is
going to be sitting up

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:33.530 align:middle line:84%
from this position, which
is quite challenging.

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:35.560 align:middle line:90%
So know that it is hard.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And I invite you to come
back to this practice

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.660 align:middle line:90%
and see how your progress goes.

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Initially, you may need to use
your hands alongside the hips

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:45.560 align:middle line:90%
to be able to get up.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:46.990 align:middle line:90%
And that's perfectly fine.

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:48.250 align:middle line:90%
But do what you can.

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:50.080 align:middle line:90%
Do it as best as you can.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.747 align:middle line:84%
And feel free to laugh
at yourself here.

00:09:51.747 --> 00:09:53.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm probably going to have
some trouble getting up

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:54.940 align:middle line:90%
once or twice doing it.

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:55.910 align:middle line:90%
Five rounds.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:56.710 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to
move slow, breathe long.

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:02.410 align:middle line:84%
When we move slow, we get
more control into the body.

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:05.070 align:middle line:84%
We get a lot more
overall strength as well.

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:05.870 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:08.440 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to begin in
Boat Pose, called Navasana.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And what we're going to do
is draw our knees together.

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:12.256 align:middle line:90%
Make sure you're sitting up.

00:10:12.256 --> 00:10:13.630 align:middle line:84%
So what we don't
want to be doing

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:15.004 align:middle line:84%
is rounding through
the low back.

00:10:15.004 --> 00:10:18.640 align:middle line:84%
So feeling your low belly,
pull up into the lower thighs.

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Stage A. I invite you to
bring your knees together.

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:22.270 align:middle line:90%
Hands under the knees.

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:23.730 align:middle line:90%
And we're just going to sit up.

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And if you already
know you're rolling out

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.940 align:middle line:84%
through the low back, pull
your low belly up and in.

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.060 align:middle line:90%
This may be your maximum.

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:32.320 align:middle line:84%
The second option is
going to be Full Navasana.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.570 align:middle line:84%
We're going to put the
feet up into the air

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:35.890 align:middle line:90%
and reach the arms out.

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:36.700 align:middle line:90%
So let's begin.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.380 align:middle line:90%
Stage A or B. Go ahead.

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:40.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do stage
A with you first round.

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:42.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to take three breaths.

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:52.147 align:middle line:90%


00:10:52.147 --> 00:10:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And then the feet are
going to come on down.

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:55.060 align:middle line:90%
The knees are going to separate.

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:56.770 align:middle line:84%
You're going to reach
in front of you,

00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:58.350 align:middle line:90%
and we're going to sit up.

00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:59.356 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:10:59.356 --> 00:11:00.730 align:middle line:84%
And then come on
up, there we go.

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:02.192 align:middle line:90%
Knees together.

00:11:02.192 --> 00:11:03.400 align:middle line:90%
Come on up in the Chair Pose.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.200 align:middle line:90%
Arms reaching.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.620 align:middle line:90%
Shoulder heads down the back.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.330 align:middle line:90%
Arms activated and strong.

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:08.440 align:middle line:90%
Fingers spread.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.150 align:middle line:90%
Take a breath in.

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:11.110 align:middle line:90%
Exhale.

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:13.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to slowly inhale.

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:14.510 align:middle line:90%
Squeeze the glutes.

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:17.360 align:middle line:90%
Press to standing, reaching up.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And then exhale back into
Utkatasana, Chair Pose.

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:21.220 align:middle line:90%
Pause.

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:22.860 align:middle line:90%
Breath in.

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:24.309 align:middle line:84%
And then as we
lower to the squat,

00:11:24.309 --> 00:11:26.600 align:middle line:84%
you may need to bring your
hands down to help yourself.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.240 align:middle line:84%
But see if you can
keep your arms up.

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.830 align:middle line:90%
The knees are going to separate.

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:32.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to sit
back from Navasana.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:32.920 align:middle line:90%
Number two.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:33.720 align:middle line:90%
Three breaths.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:41.080 align:middle line:90%


00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.430 align:middle line:90%
Once again, doing what you can.

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:45.640 align:middle line:84%
You can always have your
hands underneath the knees.

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.200 align:middle line:90%
And lowering.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.010 align:middle line:90%
Knees separate.

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:49.810 align:middle line:90%
Reach.

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:50.610 align:middle line:90%
Come on up.

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:51.860 align:middle line:90%
Knees together.

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.800 align:middle line:84%
Push up through the
Chair Pose and pause.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:55.600 align:middle line:90%
Inhaling.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.360 align:middle line:90%
Squeeze the glutes to standing.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.160 align:middle line:90%
Exhale.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.610 align:middle line:90%
Back into Chair Pose and pause.

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:04.750 align:middle line:90%
Separating the knees.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:08.973 align:middle line:84%
Sitting back and hands
to knees or legs up.

00:12:08.973 --> 00:12:09.773 align:middle line:90%
Navasana.

00:12:09.773 --> 00:12:10.573 align:middle line:90%
Three breaths.

00:12:10.573 --> 00:12:18.758 align:middle line:90%


00:12:18.758 --> 00:12:21.920 align:middle line:90%
One more long breath in.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:22.850 align:middle line:90%
And exhale.

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:24.760 align:middle line:90%
Knees separate.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.330 align:middle line:84%
Go ahead and sit
up into Navasana.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:29.790 align:middle line:90%
Pause.

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:30.730 align:middle line:90%
Inhale.

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:33.170 align:middle line:90%
Press to standing.

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:36.560 align:middle line:90%
Exhale back into Chair Pose.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.360 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.770 align:middle line:90%
Slowly sit back.

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:41.380 align:middle line:90%
And Navasana number three.

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:46.070 align:middle line:90%


00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:47.750 align:middle line:90%
One more long breath in.

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:49.770 align:middle line:90%
You got this.

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:50.570 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:51.500 align:middle line:90%
Feet to the floor.

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:52.910 align:middle line:90%
Feet together.

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:56.690 align:middle line:90%
Sit on up into Chair Pose.

00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:57.670 align:middle line:90%
Inhale slowly.

00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:58.740 align:middle line:90%
Urdhva Hastasana.

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:01.460 align:middle line:90%
Reach and rise.

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:04.650 align:middle line:90%
Number four, coming on down.

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:05.810 align:middle line:90%
Knees separate.

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:08.190 align:middle line:90%
Sit back with control.

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:08.990 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:11.836 align:middle line:90%
I'll do A with you now.

00:13:11.836 --> 00:13:13.460 align:middle line:84%
Pull your low belly
up into the thighs.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.470 align:middle line:90%
Spread to toes.

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:16.490 align:middle line:90%
Shoulders back and down.

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:18.290 align:middle line:90%
Chest lifting.

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:20.480 align:middle line:90%
One more breath.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.935 align:middle line:90%
And release.

00:13:21.935 --> 00:13:23.180 align:middle line:90%
This is the last cycle.

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:25.360 align:middle line:90%
Slowly, coming on up.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.750 align:middle line:90%
Push into Chair Pose.

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:27.740 align:middle line:90%
Do what you can.

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:28.540 align:middle line:90%
Inhale.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:29.770 align:middle line:90%
Spread the fingers.

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:31.230 align:middle line:90%
Reach.

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:32.030 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:32.920 align:middle line:90%
Exhale back.

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:33.990 align:middle line:90%
Chair Pose.

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:35.780 align:middle line:90%
Pause.

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:37.130 align:middle line:90%
Knees separate.

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:38.700 align:middle line:90%
Come on down.

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:40.680 align:middle line:90%
Last Navasana cycle.

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:43.016 align:middle line:84%
I'll do stage B
with you this time.

00:13:43.016 --> 00:13:45.900 align:middle line:90%


00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:46.700 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.860 align:middle line:90%
One more breath.

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And then slowly reaching
out in front, sit up.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.420 align:middle line:90%
Chair Pose.

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:55.220 align:middle line:90%
Pause.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:56.020 align:middle line:90%
Last one.

00:13:56.020 --> 00:14:01.230 align:middle line:84%
I want you to come up really
slow to Urdhva Hastasana.

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:02.030 align:middle line:90%
And then exhale.

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:03.730 align:middle line:90%
Hands to chest.

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:04.530 align:middle line:90%
Pause.

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:06.862 align:middle line:84%
So that ends that
last cycle there.

00:14:06.862 --> 00:14:09.320 align:middle line:84%
We're going to loosen up the
low back and hips a little bit

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.640 align:middle line:90%
coming on into Temple Pose.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.730 align:middle line:84%
You're going to take your feet
a little wider than the mat.

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:15.650 align:middle line:90%
Hands on the tops of the knees.

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:17.557 align:middle line:84%
Lifting the chest,
take a breath in.

00:14:17.557 --> 00:14:18.890 align:middle line:90%
All we're going to do is exhale.

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:20.620 align:middle line:90%
Drop your right shoulder down.

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:23.310 align:middle line:90%
Press against the inner thighs.

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:24.110 align:middle line:90%
And then inhale.

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:24.910 align:middle line:90%
Come on up.

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:27.455 align:middle line:84%
We're just going to do
three rounds of this.

00:14:27.455 --> 00:14:28.255 align:middle line:90%
Exhaling.

00:14:28.255 --> 00:14:31.860 align:middle line:90%


00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:32.660 align:middle line:90%
Inhale.

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:35.310 align:middle line:90%
Coming on back up.

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:36.385 align:middle line:90%
Exhale.

00:14:36.385 --> 00:14:38.170 align:middle line:84%
You can go in a little
deeper each round,

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:40.850 align:middle line:84%
maybe even looking
up over the shoulder.

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:41.650 align:middle line:90%
Inhale.

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:43.710 align:middle line:90%
Come on up.

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:44.510 align:middle line:90%
Exhale.

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:48.170 align:middle line:90%


00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:51.560 align:middle line:90%
And one more cycle, both sides.

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.360 align:middle line:90%
Exhale.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:56.320 align:middle line:90%


00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.120 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:59.655 align:middle line:90%
Inhaling.

00:14:59.655 --> 00:15:00.455 align:middle line:90%
And exhale.

00:15:00.455 --> 00:15:02.750 align:middle line:90%


00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:03.550 align:middle line:90%
Nice.

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:05.930 align:middle line:90%
Coming on back to center.

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:08.560 align:middle line:84%
So here we're going
to come into a series

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.750 align:middle line:90%
of working your abdominal core.

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:13.220 align:middle line:90%
And know that this is not easy.

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:14.020 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:17.090 align:middle line:84%
If you ever try to do
something new with the body,

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:18.755 align:middle line:90%
sometimes it takes time, right?

00:15:18.755 --> 00:15:20.640 align:middle line:90%
Any sport requires this.

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.080 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to have
to learn how to do this.

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.090 align:middle line:84%
Some of you may
come really natural.

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:26.550 align:middle line:90%
Some of you may take some time.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:28.790 align:middle line:84%
So don't get discouraged
about the three steps.

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:29.590 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:34.470 align:middle line:84%
Traditional Vinyasa Krama Yoga,
we use the different steps

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:36.850 align:middle line:84%
as building blocks
to get to new levels.

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:39.460 align:middle line:10%
So make sure you're practicing
whatever stage that's

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:42.790 align:middle line:10%
appropriate for you, but
also coming back, referring

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:44.800 align:middle line:10%
to this video, and moving along.

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.630 align:middle line:90%
Giving the next stage a try.

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:47.770 align:middle line:90%
Playing around with it.

00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:50.290 align:middle line:84%
Playing around with this simple
thing in the mornings when

00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:51.090 align:middle line:90%
you wake up.

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:53.140 align:middle line:84%
It's really good to
increase your metabolic rate

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:55.460 align:middle line:84%
and cleanse out all
the intestines inside.

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:56.260 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.320 align:middle line:84%
So the first one we're going
to learn is Uddiyana Bandha.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:02.800 align:middle line:84%
And essentially that is drawing
everything up into the belly.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.990 align:middle line:90%
Creating a deep concave space.

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:07.139 align:middle line:84%
You're going to do that
on a long exhale, OK?

00:16:07.139 --> 00:16:08.680 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going
to pull my shirt up

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.020 align:middle line:84%
so you can see
what's going on here.

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to come
on into knees bent.

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:16.920 align:middle line:84%
Let's see if I can get
this to come on up.

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:17.720 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:18.720 align:middle line:90%
Here we are.

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.450 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to exhale
forcefully out the mouth.

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:24.110 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do three rounds
of this, holding the breath

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:25.820 align:middle line:90%
out, OK, comfortably.

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:27.030 align:middle line:90%
And just watch.

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:28.410 align:middle line:90%
Try it along with me.

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:29.210 align:middle line:90%
See how it goes.

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:32.630 align:middle line:84%
You can always pause this tape
and do this a few more tries

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:33.440 align:middle line:90%
if you want to.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:34.240 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.700 align:middle line:90%
Big breath in through the nose.

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:40.130 align:middle line:84%
You're going to exhale
everything out the mouth.

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:41.300 align:middle line:90%
And then draw your navel in.

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:50.110 align:middle line:90%


00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Inhaling through the
nose, lifting the chin.

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:54.940 align:middle line:84%
So, no, this isn't using
your core abdominal wall

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:55.900 align:middle line:90%
to pull up in.

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:58.850 align:middle line:84%
You actually need to
soften your abdomen.

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And then it's creating
a negative vacuum space.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.660 align:middle line:84%
So allowing it to
soften and draw up.

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And like I said,
it just takes time.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And at a certain point,
it'll either happen

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:10.359 align:middle line:84%
or it'll take a
little bit more time.

00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:11.942 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do
that two more times.

00:17:11.942 --> 00:17:13.900 align:middle line:90%
Big breath in.

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:16.730 align:middle line:84%
Exhale out the
mouth, everything.

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:17.530 align:middle line:90%
Then draw it up.

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:18.363 align:middle line:90%
Hold the breath out.

00:17:18.363 --> 00:17:24.140 align:middle line:90%


00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:24.940 align:middle line:90%
Inhaling.

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:27.310 align:middle line:90%
Lifting the chin.

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:28.460 align:middle line:90%
And one more time.

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:30.977 align:middle line:90%
Inhale through the nose.

00:17:30.977 --> 00:17:32.310 align:middle line:90%
Exhale forcefully out the mouth.

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:44.540 align:middle line:90%


00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:45.340 align:middle line:90%
Inhale.

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:46.220 align:middle line:90%
Lifting the chin.

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:47.020 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:50.500 align:middle line:84%
So the next one is the
same type of thing.

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.380 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter
of practicing it.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.250 align:middle line:84%
We're going to learn
how to do that.

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And then the next step is
dropping the center core

00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:00.210 align:middle line:84%
muscles out, where you
still feel that vacuum

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:02.200 align:middle line:90%
sensation on both sides.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:05.100 align:middle line:84%
So that's step A. So we'll
do that the first round.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And then the second two
rounds what I'm going to do

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.970 align:middle line:84%
is begin pumping the center
core back in and out.

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:12.880 align:middle line:90%
And is known as Agni Sara.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:13.680 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:14.650 align:middle line:90%
So let's give it a try.

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:16.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm hoping that you can see.

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:18.364 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to hold this
up as best as I can.

00:18:18.364 --> 00:18:19.163 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:19.163 --> 00:18:21.420 align:middle line:84%
So the same thing, beginning
with Uddiyana Bandha.

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:24.419 align:middle line:84%
And then moving into
dropping out the middle.

00:18:24.419 --> 00:18:26.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going to hold
the middle dropped out

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:28.212 align:middle line:84%
for the first round
so you can see it.

00:18:28.212 --> 00:18:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And then the second
two rounds, I'm

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:30.820 align:middle line:90%
going to pump it in and out.

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:31.620 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.075 align:middle line:84%
Take a big breath
in through the nose.

00:18:34.075 --> 00:18:34.950 align:middle line:90%
Exhale out the mouth.

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:44.700 align:middle line:90%


00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:46.350 align:middle line:90%
So that's what that looks like.

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:48.690 align:middle line:90%
Now, work on that.

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:51.630 align:middle line:84%
Or still you're working on the
first one, Uddiyana Bandha,

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:53.310 align:middle line:90%
creating the concave space.

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:55.500 align:middle line:84%
Or now what I'm going to
do for the next two rounds,

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:58.950 align:middle line:84%
as long as I can hold
it, the two rounds

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:00.867 align:middle line:84%
of pumping that center
core muscle in and out.

00:19:00.867 --> 00:19:01.666 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:19:01.666 --> 00:19:02.700 align:middle line:90%
So take a big breath in.

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:22.296 align:middle line:90%


00:19:22.296 --> 00:19:23.545 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to take two breaths.

00:19:23.545 --> 00:19:40.570 align:middle line:90%


00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:42.960 align:middle line:84%
So now we're going to
do the third cycle here.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:46.970 align:middle line:84%
And all we're doing is building
on the second set of that

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:47.770 align:middle line:90%
Agni Sara.

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:50.980 align:middle line:84%
So learning how to suction
in Uddiyana Bandha first.

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:53.050 align:middle line:84%
Then learning to isolate
the center of your core,

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:54.340 align:middle line:90%
popping it out.

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And then pulling it in and out
as you hold with your breath

00:19:58.430 --> 00:19:59.230 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:00.030 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:03.590 align:middle line:84%
Third one is now learning
how to roll it side to side.

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:04.390 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:07.466 align:middle line:84%
And once again, like
I said, honestly,

00:20:07.466 --> 00:20:08.590 align:middle line:90%
this stuff isn't teachable.

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:11.140 align:middle line:90%
You just have to do it at home.

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:12.220 align:middle line:90%
Hit rewind.

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:13.570 align:middle line:90%
Do this over and over again.

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:14.460 align:middle line:90%
Practice it a lot.

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:16.960 align:middle line:84%
If you're really interested in
it, the benefits are amazing.

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.870 align:middle line:90%
It clears out all stagnation.

00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:24.160 align:middle line:84%
It internally massages your
small and large intestine.

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And once again, we're going for
that increase in metabolic rate

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:31.850 align:middle line:84%
and your ability to burn fat and
release lethargy in the body.

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:32.650 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:34.630 align:middle line:84%
So let's pull the shirt
up for the third round.

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:37.680 align:middle line:90%


00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.812 align:middle line:90%
And come on down.

00:20:39.812 --> 00:20:41.520 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to take
a couple of breaths.

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going
to fully exhale, go

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:46.170 align:middle line:84%
into Uddiyana Bandha, and then
I'll drop the center of my core

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:46.970 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going to start
just rolling it side to side.

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And like I said,
it's not teachable.

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:54.180 align:middle line:84%
It's something that you're going
to have to learn on your own,

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:55.056 align:middle line:90%
inside your own body.

00:20:55.056 --> 00:20:55.855 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:20:55.855 --> 00:20:56.656 align:middle line:90%
Take a breath in.

00:20:56.656 --> 00:21:53.170 align:middle line:90%


00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:53.970 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:55.020 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:57.690 align:middle line:84%
I assure you, it's
a great party trick.

00:21:57.690 --> 00:21:59.940 align:middle line:84%
So my whole body is
super warm and I actually

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:02.839 align:middle line:84%
have a hot sweat over
my whole entire body.

00:22:02.839 --> 00:22:04.380 align:middle line:84%
So finishing off
this practice, we're

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:06.360 align:middle line:90%
going to roll onto our backs.

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:10.620 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do a six
minute abdominal core workout.

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:13.230 align:middle line:84%
So there's basically,
it's designed around

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:15.160 align:middle line:90%
as many reps as possible.

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:17.310 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
be doing this timed.

00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:19.140 align:middle line:90%
Three different exercises.

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:20.910 align:middle line:90%
Each one of them I've chosen.

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:23.110 align:middle line:84%
They're totally safe
for your low back.

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:23.910 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:25.380 align:middle line:90%
And do what you can.

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:28.740 align:middle line:84%
So in the 30 seconds, and
literally, if you only do two,

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:29.700 align:middle line:90%
that's perfectly fine.

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:31.075 align:middle line:84%
Because the next
day, guess what?

00:22:31.075 --> 00:22:32.190 align:middle line:90%
You're going to do three.

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:33.330 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:35.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do
maybe 20 of them.

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:39.894 align:middle line:84%
And this first one is a
reverse crunch, all right?

00:22:39.894 --> 00:22:41.310 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
be on our backs.

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And just go ahead and
watch me for a sec.

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:45.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go
through all three.

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:46.530 align:middle line:90%
So reverse crunch.

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:48.400 align:middle line:90%
So palms down.

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.130 align:middle line:90%
Feet and knees together.

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:52.020 align:middle line:90%
Draw the calf into the thigh.

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:53.700 align:middle line:84%
You want to make
sure you're squeezing

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:56.945 align:middle line:84%
your calf into the thigh
really strong the entire time.

00:22:56.945 --> 00:22:59.070 align:middle line:84%
And you're not going to
feel these the first round.

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:00.778 align:middle line:84%
But I guarantee you're
going to feel them

00:23:00.778 --> 00:23:02.010 align:middle line:90%
in the second and the third.

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:05.100 align:middle line:84%
On an exhale, you're going to
pull the knees into the chest.

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:06.670 align:middle line:90%
And then we just tap the toes.

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:07.470 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:08.845 align:middle line:84%
So you're going
to be doing this.

00:23:08.845 --> 00:23:10.094 align:middle line:90%
Pull the knees into the chest.

00:23:10.094 --> 00:23:10.920 align:middle line:90%
Tap the toes.

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.150 align:middle line:90%
30 seconds.

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:15.480 align:middle line:90%
The second one is a touch toes.

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:18.640 align:middle line:84%
So make sure the feet
aren't back over your chest.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:20.610 align:middle line:90%
We want the feet straight up.

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:24.175 align:middle line:84%
Hips, knees, ankles,
toes in alignment.

00:23:24.175 --> 00:23:26.300 align:middle line:84%
Then all we're going to
do, keep your neck relaxed,

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:28.530 align:middle line:84%
spread the fingers,
and then sit up.

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:29.630 align:middle line:90%
Sit up.

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:30.430 align:middle line:90%
Sit up.

00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:30.580 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:32.550 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do
that for 30 seconds.

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:34.410 align:middle line:84%
From there we're going
to cross our ankles.

00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:37.080 align:middle line:90%
Option A. Fingers interlocked.

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:39.360 align:middle line:90%
Elbows under the shoulders.

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:40.755 align:middle line:90%
Coming into a Plank position.

00:23:40.755 --> 00:23:41.555 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:23:41.555 --> 00:23:43.710 align:middle line:90%
So tailbone tucked in.

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:45.810 align:middle line:90%
Thighs lifting strong.

00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:46.830 align:middle line:90%
Curl your toes forward.

00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:48.690 align:middle line:84%
So you can reach
your heels back.

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:50.870 align:middle line:84%
Feel your Achilles in
your calves stretch.

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:52.770 align:middle line:84%
And then not sitting
on the shoulders.

00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:53.670 align:middle line:90%
Pushing out of this.

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:54.480 align:middle line:90%
30 section.

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:58.080 align:middle line:84%
Option B. If you want that
strength for your forearm

00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.910 align:middle line:90%
balances, separate the hands.

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:00.710 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:01.720 align:middle line:90%
30 seconds here.

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.040 align:middle line:90%
Keep the neck relaxed.

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:03.840 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:06.060 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to do
three rounds of that.

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:07.590 align:middle line:90%
As many reps as you can do.

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:08.390 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:09.240 align:middle line:90%
You got this.

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.520 align:middle line:84%
So starting with
reverse crunches.

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:12.870 align:middle line:90%
Onto your backs.

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:14.020 align:middle line:90%
Palms flat.

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:14.820 align:middle line:90%
And let's begin.

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:46.805 align:middle line:90%


00:24:46.805 --> 00:24:47.605 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:24:47.605 --> 00:24:48.980 align:middle line:90%
So that's 30 seconds.

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:50.050 align:middle line:90%
Next.

00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:52.180 align:middle line:84%
Sitting up, reaching
for toes, ankles.

00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:53.500 align:middle line:90%
And go ahead.

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:56.020 align:middle line:84%
So like I said, if
you only are doing two

00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:58.580 align:middle line:84%
and you need to take
a rest, that's fine.

00:24:58.580 --> 00:24:59.860 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, continue.

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:02.710 align:middle line:90%
Just, neck is relaxed.

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:04.540 align:middle line:84%
Make sure you're
smiling on your face.

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:07.150 align:middle line:84%
It's easy to go
into wrinkle mode

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:10.727 align:middle line:90%
and scrunch up your forehead.

00:25:10.727 --> 00:25:11.935 align:middle line:90%
We're going to do 30 seconds.

00:25:11.935 --> 00:25:38.390 align:middle line:90%


00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:39.190 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:40.300 align:middle line:90%
Crossing the ankles.

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:41.680 align:middle line:90%
Coming on over.

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:42.730 align:middle line:90%
And into Plank.

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:48.280 align:middle line:84%
So interlocking the fingers
or palms flat, making a box.

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:49.270 align:middle line:90%
And thighs lift.

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:50.090 align:middle line:90%
Tailbone tucks.

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:51.460 align:middle line:90%
Push out your shoulders.

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:52.960 align:middle line:90%
Slow your breathing down.

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:55.660 align:middle line:84%
Feel the whole front
of your body, OK?

00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:57.970 align:middle line:84%
Envision the whole front
of your body lifting up

00:25:57.970 --> 00:26:00.340 align:middle line:90%
into the back body.

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:04.570 align:middle line:84%
The whole body is
activated and strong.

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:07.240 align:middle line:90%
Slow your breathing down.

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.690 align:middle line:90%
Neck is relaxed.

00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:10.490 align:middle line:90%
30 seconds.

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:21.640 align:middle line:90%


00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:23.880 align:middle line:90%
And lowering the knees.

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.080 align:middle line:90%
Crossing the ankles.

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:25.880 align:middle line:90%
Reverse crunch.

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.420 align:middle line:90%
30 seconds.

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:28.910 align:middle line:90%
Palms flat, and go.

00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:34.370 align:middle line:90%


00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:36.380 align:middle line:84%
So the cool thing
about these exercises

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:39.350 align:middle line:90%
is you don't need any equipment.

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:41.240 align:middle line:90%
You can do it anywhere.

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And it only takes
you six minutes.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.000 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:53.580 align:middle line:90%


00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:55.290 align:middle line:90%
Really pull the knees in.

00:26:55.290 --> 00:27:00.270 align:middle line:84%
Keep the calf drawing
into the hamstring.

00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:02.430 align:middle line:90%
And legs up.

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:03.620 align:middle line:90%
Reaching.

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:04.530 align:middle line:90%
30 seconds.

00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:07.800 align:middle line:90%
You got this.

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:09.070 align:middle line:90%
Doing as many as you can.

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:12.690 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's one and you're
taking a little break.

00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:14.420 align:middle line:90%
And then go for the next one.

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:17.490 align:middle line:84%
But I really invite
you to push yourself.

00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:20.795 align:middle line:84%
You're going to feel your
core burning, and that's good.

00:27:20.795 --> 00:27:22.560 align:middle line:90%
Breathe into the burn.

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.180 align:middle line:90%
Do as many as you can.

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:27.480 align:middle line:84%
And know that tomorrow, maybe
you'll do a little bit more.

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:29.520 align:middle line:90%
But just do what you can today.

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:35.110 align:middle line:90%


00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:36.570 align:middle line:90%
And crossing the ankles.

00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:39.330 align:middle line:90%
On over to Plank number two.

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:40.980 align:middle line:90%
This is what I'm going to do.

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:46.140 align:middle line:84%
Palms, hands wide as the
elbows, making a nice square box

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:48.360 align:middle line:84%
between the wrists
and the elbows.

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.170 align:middle line:90%
Toes forward.

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:50.550 align:middle line:90%
Heels back.

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:52.530 align:middle line:90%
Neck relaxed.

00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:53.940 align:middle line:90%
Jaw relaxed.

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:55.190 align:middle line:90%
Breath full.

00:27:55.190 --> 00:28:00.210 align:middle line:84%
Filling my whole front body and
lifting up into the back body.

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:02.050 align:middle line:84%
Tailbone scooping under
just a little bit.

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:18.430 align:middle line:90%


00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:19.240 align:middle line:90%
Nice.

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:20.680 align:middle line:90%
Last round.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:21.490 align:middle line:90%
You got this.

00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:22.420 align:middle line:90%
On your backs.

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:23.840 align:middle line:90%
Reverse crunches.

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:24.640 align:middle line:90%
And go.

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:33.126 align:middle line:90%


00:28:33.126 --> 00:28:36.370 align:middle line:90%
Breathing into the burn.

00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:39.590 align:middle line:90%
Pull those thighs in.

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:40.390 align:middle line:90%
Almost there.

00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:59.040 align:middle line:90%


00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:00.440 align:middle line:90%
And reaching on up.

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:01.340 align:middle line:90%
Legs straight.

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:02.140 align:middle line:90%
Go.

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:03.620 align:middle line:90%
30 seconds.

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:04.520 align:middle line:90%
Last cycle.

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:05.010 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:05.810 align:middle line:90%
Give it to me.

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:09.800 align:middle line:90%


00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:13.040 align:middle line:84%
Make sure you do a facial
expression check, all right?

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:14.180 align:middle line:90%
Fake it till you make it.

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:16.717 align:middle line:90%
Smile a little bit.

00:29:16.717 --> 00:29:18.050 align:middle line:90%
I know you're feeling your core.

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:18.710 align:middle line:90%
I am too.

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:19.350 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:20.150 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:23.820 align:middle line:90%


00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:24.620 align:middle line:90%
Point the feet.

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:25.420 align:middle line:90%
Spread the toes.

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:26.750 align:middle line:90%
Squeeze those thighs in.

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:29.850 align:middle line:90%


00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:31.870 align:middle line:90%
Almost there.

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:32.670 align:middle line:90%
And that's it's.

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:33.210 align:middle line:90%
To Plank.

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:34.060 align:middle line:90%
Last Plank.

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:34.860 align:middle line:90%
You got this.

00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:35.310 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:36.240 align:middle line:90%
Quicker.

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:36.780 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:37.580 align:middle line:90%
Set it up.

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:41.400 align:middle line:90%


00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:43.830 align:middle line:90%
Stay calm.

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:46.260 align:middle line:90%
Engage whole body.

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:47.060 align:middle line:90%
Lift the thighs.

00:29:47.060 --> 00:30:03.350 align:middle line:90%


00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:04.500 align:middle line:90%
OK, here we are.

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:07.520 align:middle line:90%
We got about five more seconds.

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:08.700 align:middle line:90%
Softening the breath.

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:11.030 align:middle line:90%
Keep your neck relaxed.

00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:14.140 align:middle line:90%
Three, two, one.

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:14.940 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:15.740 align:middle line:90%
You got this.

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:16.556 align:middle line:90%
It's finished.

00:30:16.556 --> 00:30:17.430 align:middle line:90%
Let's stretch it out.

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:18.980 align:middle line:90%
Roll onto your backs.

00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:20.810 align:middle line:90%
Legs out in front of you.

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:22.610 align:middle line:84%
Interlock your fingers
above your head,

00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:25.720 align:middle line:84%
and then press your palms
to the wall behind you.

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.870 align:middle line:90%
Stretch on out through the legs.

00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:29.430 align:middle line:90%
Soften your belly.

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And just feel your
abdomen stretch.

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:36.830 align:middle line:84%
Let it be really
relaxed and soft.

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:39.870 align:middle line:84%
You deserve this
little bit of a break.

00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:44.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're going to move
slowly into Upright Seated.

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:45.900 align:middle line:90%
Draw your knees into the chest.

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:47.300 align:middle line:90%
Roll back.

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:48.100 align:middle line:90%
Rock on up.

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:49.040 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.650 align:middle line:84%
So finding that appropriate,
comfortable, upright

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:54.020 align:middle line:84%
seated posture for
yourself again.

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:56.060 align:middle line:90%
This is how I like to sit.

00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:58.830 align:middle line:84%
Leaning forward in
either position.

00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:00.430 align:middle line:90%
Sukhasana or here.

00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:01.800 align:middle line:90%
Flushed back from the sit bones.

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:03.290 align:middle line:90%
Sitting up nice and tall.

00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:06.140 align:middle line:84%
So the last Pranayama I'm
going to teach you here today

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:09.130 align:middle line:84%
is known as Surya Bhedana
Pranayama or Surya Bheda

00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:09.930 align:middle line:90%
Pranayama.

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:10.820 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, all it is
is right nostril breathing.

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:17.360 align:middle line:90%
This activates Pingala Nadi, OK?

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:20.480 align:middle line:84%
One of the two main
principle channels of energy

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:24.240 align:middle line:84%
that crisscrosses across the
center column of the spine.

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:27.860 align:middle line:84%
It is associated with the
sun, and so it increases heat

00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:28.790 align:middle line:90%
into the body.

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:32.060 align:middle line:84%
You could do this
practice on its own, OK?

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:33.830 align:middle line:90%
This entire thing is designed.

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:36.290 align:middle line:84%
If you have a slow
digestive system.

00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:40.130 align:middle line:84%
You're wanting to lose weight
and increase your metabolism.

00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:42.710 align:middle line:84%
If you're feeling
lethargic or low energy.

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:44.210 align:middle line:84%
These are the types
of practices you

00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:47.730 align:middle line:84%
don't want to do late in the
day because it may wake you up

00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:48.530 align:middle line:90%
at night.

00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:49.330 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:50.960 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
place left hand down.

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:52.700 align:middle line:90%
Chin Mudra for receptivity.

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:54.050 align:middle line:90%
Palm up.

00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to place
right hand Vishnu Mudra.

00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:59.600 align:middle line:10%
Index finger, middle
finger, inside.

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:00.890 align:middle line:10%
Ring finger and pinky out.

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:04.760 align:middle line:10%
So we're going to block
left nostril with these two.

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:08.990 align:middle line:10%
Block the right
nostril with this one.

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:09.900 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:11.510 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to just take
a few breaths in and out

00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:12.426 align:middle line:90%
through both nostrils.

00:32:12.426 --> 00:32:15.130 align:middle line:90%


00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:16.240 align:middle line:90%
Softening the belly.

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.290 align:middle line:90%
Abdomen expands out.

00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:19.090 align:middle line:90%
Exhale.

00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:22.110 align:middle line:90%
Navel draws in.

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:22.910 align:middle line:90%
Inhale.

00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:24.680 align:middle line:90%
Belly expands out.

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:26.810 align:middle line:84%
You can do this with
the eyes closed.

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:28.910 align:middle line:84%
Or if your eyes are
open, soft gaze,

00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:30.220 align:middle line:90%
looking at the tip of the nose.

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:32.240 align:middle line:90%
Exhale.

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:33.240 align:middle line:90%
One more cycle.

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.040 align:middle line:90%
Inhaling.

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:36.860 align:middle line:90%


00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:37.660 align:middle line:90%
Exhale.

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:38.780 align:middle line:90%
Navel draws in.

00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:39.580 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:40.830 align:middle line:90%
Exhale everything out.

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:42.400 align:middle line:90%
Block left.

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:49.480 align:middle line:10%
Inhale through the right for
five, four, three, two, one.

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:50.410 align:middle line:90%
Block right.

00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:57.460 align:middle line:84%
Exhale left for five,
four, three, two, one.

00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:58.630 align:middle line:90%

Round three.

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:15.694 align:middle line:90%
Inhale right.

00:33:15.694 --> 00:33:17.110 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do
a total of nine.

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:20.560 align:middle line:90%


00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:21.360 align:middle line:90%

That's four.

thumbs together, both hands.

00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:07.540 align:middle line:90%
Turn your palms down.

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:09.540 align:middle line:90%

Soften your abdomen.

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:12.520 align:middle line:90%
Sitting up nice and tall.

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:15.780 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do a one minute
meditation of which you're

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:18.660 align:middle line:84%
welcome to lengthen this
technique on your own

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:21.090 align:middle line:90%
at any time.

00:35:21.090 --> 00:35:23.900 align:middle line:90%
With your eyes closed.

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:25.420 align:middle line:90%
Inhale.

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:29.720 align:middle line:10%
Visualize a column of golden
white light coming down

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:32.780 align:middle line:10%
through the crown of
the head to the space

00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:36.740 align:middle line:10%
just above the navel
center called the hara.

00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:40.610 align:middle line:10%
And in this space, I
want you to visualize

00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:45.370 align:middle line:10%
a single, steadfast,
unwavering flame.

00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:49.050 align:middle line:90%


00:35:49.050 --> 00:35:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And as the breath comes in
through the crown of the head,

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:56.910 align:middle line:84%
allowing the breath to fan
over and brighten this flame.

00:35:56.910 --> 00:36:00.470 align:middle line:90%


00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And as you exhale, I want
you to feel and visualize

00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:12.130 align:middle line:84%
this heat, this increased
metabolic rate, on the exhale,

00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:14.090 align:middle line:90%
to flow through the whole body.

00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:17.660 align:middle line:84%
Feel it flowing up the
torso, out through the arms,

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:20.480 align:middle line:90%
out to the tips of the fingers.

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:24.890 align:middle line:84%
Feel it flowing down through
the torso, out the pelvic floor,

00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:27.320 align:middle line:84%
through the legs to
the tips of the nose.

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:30.740 align:middle line:84%
Continuing for about
five more breaths.

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:35.060 align:middle line:84%
Inhaling a stream of golden
white light coming down

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:37.940 align:middle line:84%
through the crown of the
head to the navel center,

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:43.970 align:middle line:84%
fanning over that beautiful,
single, unwavering flame.

00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:47.690 align:middle line:84%
As you exhale, feel that
energy, that warmth,

00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:51.260 align:middle line:90%
spread through the whole body.

00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:53.210 align:middle line:84%
On your own for a
few more breaths.

00:36:53.210 --> 00:37:15.070 align:middle line:90%


00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:16.750 align:middle line:90%
Last one.

00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:17.860 align:middle line:90%
Soft and slow.

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:24.930 align:middle line:90%


00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:28.380 align:middle line:84%
Keeping your eyes closed, you
just slowly lie to your backs.

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:30.430 align:middle line:84%
We're going to come
into Corpse Pose.

00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:31.600 align:middle line:90%
Savasana.

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:34.290 align:middle line:84%
So extend your legs on
out in front of you.

00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:37.020 align:middle line:84%
Let your ankles fall
to the outsides.

00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:39.149 align:middle line:84%
Feet are about as
wide as your mat.

00:37:39.149 --> 00:37:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And then bring your hands
about a foot and a half

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:42.880 align:middle line:90%
away from the hips.

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:44.550 align:middle line:90%
Palms facing up.

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:47.478 align:middle line:90%
Eyes softly closed.

00:37:47.478 --> 00:37:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to close
with the practice here.

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And our 30 minute
practice is over.

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:56.100 align:middle line:90%
And this video is going to end.

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:57.880 align:middle line:84%
But what I recommend
is that you just

00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:00.820 align:middle line:84%
continue lying here
for three minutes,

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:03.670 align:middle line:84%
or as long as you
feel you need to.

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:04.570 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:38:04.570 --> 00:38:07.970 align:middle line:84%
We're going to start taking a
long breath into your belly.

00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:08.770 align:middle line:90%
Fill it up.

00:38:08.770 --> 00:38:09.370 align:middle line:90%
Fill it up.

00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:10.170 align:middle line:90%
Fill it up.

00:38:10.170 --> 00:38:12.910 align:middle line:84%
Let that breath fill, rolls,
rise into the top of the chest.

00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:14.480 align:middle line:90%
Hold your breath.

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:15.280 align:middle line:90%
Hold.

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:18.550 align:middle line:90%
Comfortably hold the breath.

00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:20.500 align:middle line:84%
As you comfortably
hold the breath,

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:22.870 align:middle line:84%
find your awareness
kind of slipping

00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:24.280 align:middle line:90%
into the background of things.

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:25.550 align:middle line:90%
Hold.

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:26.350 align:middle line:90%
Exhale.

00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:28.047 align:middle line:90%
Let it go out the mouth.

00:38:28.047 --> 00:38:30.130 align:middle line:84%
And just a simple reminder,
don't hold your breath

00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:31.690 align:middle line:90%
if you're pregnant.

00:38:31.690 --> 00:38:33.920 align:middle line:90%
Let's do that one more time.

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.050 align:middle line:90%
Nice and slow.

00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:36.610 align:middle line:90%
Inhale into your belly.

00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:38.719 align:middle line:84%
Let it fill into the
top of the chest.

00:38:38.719 --> 00:38:41.010 align:middle line:84%
When you feel you're full,
sip a little bit more breath

00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:41.810 align:middle line:90%
through the mouth.

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:43.400 align:middle line:90%
Sip it in.

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:44.920 align:middle line:90%
Hold a little bit longer.

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:46.655 align:middle line:90%
Stay relaxed and calm inside.

00:38:46.655 --> 00:38:49.650 align:middle line:90%


00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:52.570 align:middle line:90%
Comfortably holding the breath.

00:38:52.570 --> 00:38:55.000 align:middle line:90%
Holding.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.020 align:middle line:90%
Holding.

00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:57.820 align:middle line:90%
Exhale.

00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:01.120 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:03.870 align:middle line:90%
