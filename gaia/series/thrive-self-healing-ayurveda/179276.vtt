[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:12.140 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Find a comfortable seat.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.634 align:middle line:10%
Allow your eyes to fall shut.

00:00:16.634 --> 00:00:19.380 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.800 align:middle line:84%
Allow your awareness to rest
on the flow of your breath.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.530 align:middle line:90%


00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.800 align:middle line:84%
Moving your awareness up
to the crown of the head.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.870 align:middle line:90%


00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.530 align:middle line:84%
Then again up above
the crown of the head.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.440 align:middle line:90%


00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.710 align:middle line:84%
Up into the sky and
above up into space.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.015 align:middle line:90%
Up into the ethers into Akash.

00:00:51.015 --> 00:00:54.940 align:middle line:90%


00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.320 align:middle line:84%
Begin to allow the
energy of the sun

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:08.660 align:middle line:84%
and the moon, of all the
planets, of space and air

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.910 align:middle line:90%
to draw down into the body.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:19.580 align:middle line:90%


00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.190 align:middle line:10%
Move down then to the
base of the spine.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.400 align:middle line:90%


00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:31.250 align:middle line:10%
Then dropping down
into the earth,

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:38.680 align:middle line:10%
Imagine or see or visualize
roots growing down into Bhumi,

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.580 align:middle line:10%
into the earth.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.600 align:middle line:10%
And then drawing up
the element of earth,

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.880 align:middle line:10%
grounding and stabilizing.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.810 align:middle line:84%
Just enough fire to allow
the flames to grow bright

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.460 align:middle line:84%
and water, jala,
to allow for flow.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.310 align:middle line:90%


00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.270 align:middle line:10%
Feel all these elements,
these five great elements

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:20.770 align:middle line:10%
of space and air, of
fire and earth and water

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.510 align:middle line:10%
in perfect balance in your body.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:40.750 align:middle line:90%


00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.240 align:middle line:10%
And take a long, deep breath.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.980 align:middle line:90%
And then gently open the eyes.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.410 align:middle line:84%
We'll be using our hands to
make sacred ritual shapes, which

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.950 align:middle line:84%
promote balance and healing
throughout the body.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.760 align:middle line:84%
So take your fingers,
intertwine them, and just

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.320 align:middle line:90%
lightly roll your wrists.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.510 align:middle line:90%


00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And then offer your fingers out
and gently pull on the fingers.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.810 align:middle line:84%
Our hands and wrists often
contain a lot of tension

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.410 align:middle line:84%
from typing,
writing, and driving.

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.530 align:middle line:90%


00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.070 align:middle line:90%
Then here, rotate the palms up.

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Take the thumbs and
touch them over the ends

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.060 align:middle line:84%
of the pinky finger
and the fourth finger.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.790 align:middle line:90%
This is Prana Mudra.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.280 align:middle line:84%
It draws a healing flow
of prana, of life energy,

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.220 align:middle line:90%
into the body.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.990 align:middle line:84%
Taking this mudra, again,
allow the eyes to fall shut.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.730 align:middle line:90%


00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:00.690 align:middle line:84%
As you inhale, imagine or see or
visualize a warm, golden light

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.040 align:middle line:90%
moving into the body.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.270 align:middle line:90%


00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.820 align:middle line:84%
As you pause at the
top of the inhalation,

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.490 align:middle line:90%
allow that light to expand.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.120 align:middle line:90%


00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.329 align:middle line:84%
Exhaling out,
release any stress,

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:23.560 align:middle line:84%
anxiety, disease, anything
that's not serving you.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.310 align:middle line:84%
Inhaling, drawing in
a warm, golden light.

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.590 align:middle line:90%


00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.490 align:middle line:84%
Pausing and
expanding that light.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.080 align:middle line:84%
Allowing it to reach into
every cell in the body.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.460 align:middle line:90%
Exhaling, releasing.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.460 align:middle line:84%
One more breath,
inhaling deeply.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:56.020 align:middle line:84%
Drawing this light, this life
force energy, into the blood,

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:04.050 align:middle line:84%
into the blood cells, into the
blood plasma, into the muscles,

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:10.080 align:middle line:84%
into the fat tissues, into
our hormones, into our bones,

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.650 align:middle line:84%
into our bone marrow,
into our vital essence.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.650 align:middle line:90%


00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.710 align:middle line:10%
Gently release the finger.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.006 align:middle line:84%
Stretch them out
and open the eyes.

00:05:21.006 --> 00:05:24.200 align:middle line:90%


00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.140 align:middle line:90%
Then coming into Vayu Mudra.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:31.730 align:middle line:84%
This mudra is very useful
for taming anxiety,

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:35.310 align:middle line:84%
for taming what we call
the energy of vata dosha,

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.790 align:middle line:84%
or the elements of air
and ether in the body.

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:43.100 align:middle line:10%
We'll take the thumb, and we'll
fold it over the index finger,

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.630 align:middle line:10%
folding it down.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:50.240 align:middle line:84%
This mudra is very calming,
very soothing, very grounding.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.700 align:middle line:84%
I like to rotate the palms down
and place them onto my knees.

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:00.110 align:middle line:90%
Allow the eyes to fall shut.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.705 align:middle line:84%
Feeling yourself
grounded and stable.

00:06:02.705 --> 00:06:14.560 align:middle line:90%


00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And feeling the winds in
the body the breath as it

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.410 align:middle line:90%
moves in and out.

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.510 align:middle line:90%
Feeling the spaces of the body.

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:33.250 align:middle line:90%


00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And the joints, the inside
of the skull cavity.

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:42.260 align:middle line:90%


00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And then releasing this mudra,
gently opening the eyes,

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:51.100 align:middle line:84%
stretching out the fingers
again, closing the fingers

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.340 align:middle line:90%
and opening them.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.450 align:middle line:84%
Just working with mudra,
working with each fingertip,

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:02.110 align:middle line:84%
we begin to see a great
deal of flow and healing

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:03.100 align:middle line:90%
throughout the body.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.800 align:middle line:84%
You can take the wrists
and gently turn them.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.250 align:middle line:90%


00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.280 align:middle line:84%
You always want the mudra
to feel comfortable.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.950 align:middle line:10%
Coming into Matangi
Mudra for the fires

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:21.060 align:middle line:10%
in the body, our willpower,
our strength, our courage.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.450 align:middle line:90%
And take the middle fingers.

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.500 align:middle line:90%
Place them together.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.220 align:middle line:84%
The other fingers
intertwine, and then

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:31.270 align:middle line:84%
I wrap my thumbs all the
way to my index fingers.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:34.585 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll place this
powerful mudra at my navel.

00:07:34.585 --> 00:07:37.680 align:middle line:90%


00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.980 align:middle line:84%
Allowing the eyes
to fall shut again,

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:47.310 align:middle line:84%
invoking our inner fires, that
which illuminates the spark

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:51.240 align:middle line:90%
of passion at the heart.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:58.750 align:middle line:84%
The fire of digestion,
the flame of sight,

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:03.780 align:middle line:90%
our inspiration and our courage.

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:08.870 align:middle line:84%
Feeling your inner flames
grow perfectly bright

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:10.160 align:middle line:90%
or perfectly vibrant.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.790 align:middle line:90%


00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:22.720 align:middle line:84%
Feeling your inner courage,
your discipline, your willpower,

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.940 align:middle line:90%
your ability to take action.

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:38.210 align:middle line:90%


00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:42.799 align:middle line:84%
Then releasing this mudra,
again rolling the wrists.

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:45.110 align:middle line:84%
I like to make fists
with the wrists

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:47.624 align:middle line:84%
and roll them back
and forth and around.

00:08:47.624 --> 00:08:50.930 align:middle line:90%


00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And these mudras are so
wonderful and healing.

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:54.660 align:middle line:90%
Anyone can do them.

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.820 align:middle line:84%
If you're in a wheelchair,
you can perhaps

00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:00.390 align:middle line:84%
practice these mudras and get
a healing flow that connects

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:03.720 align:middle line:90%
throughout the entire body.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.490 align:middle line:84%
The next mudra is for
the water element.

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:07.920 align:middle line:90%
Kilaka Mudra.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.880 align:middle line:84%
We'll take the pinky fingers,
which access the water element

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.300 align:middle line:84%
in the body, and we'll touch the
peace sign fingers, the index

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.700 align:middle line:84%
and middle fingers,
to the thumbs.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.700 align:middle line:84%
And the fourth
fingers just float.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:23.160 align:middle line:84%
And we'll take this mudra,
which promotes a healing flow

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.560 align:middle line:90%
of waters throughout the body.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.645 align:middle line:90%
Place it at the heart or below.

00:09:27.645 --> 00:09:31.270 align:middle line:90%


00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:33.335 align:middle line:84%
Allow the eyes to
fall shut again.

00:09:33.335 --> 00:09:37.770 align:middle line:90%


00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:42.595 align:middle line:84%
Imagine or see or
visualize a beautiful lake.

00:09:42.595 --> 00:09:47.790 align:middle line:90%


00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:51.150 align:middle line:84%
See the gentle ripples
on the water of the lake.

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:56.560 align:middle line:90%


00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:02.320 align:middle line:84%
Allow the mind to
float on the surface

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:08.260 align:middle line:84%
of this beautiful lake that
reflects a perfect blue sky.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:16.790 align:middle line:90%


00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:20.455 align:middle line:90%
Feel all the waters of the body.

00:10:20.455 --> 00:10:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And the kidneys,
the urinary bladder,

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:30.930 align:middle line:84%
the inside of the mouth,
the lining of the stomach.

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:36.940 align:middle line:84%
All in perfect balance,
in perfect flow,

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.035 align:middle line:90%
in perfect harmony.

00:10:38.035 --> 00:10:49.770 align:middle line:90%


00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:55.220 align:middle line:84%
And releasing this mudra,
coming into one final mudra

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:59.870 align:middle line:84%
for the earth element,
Bhumisparsha Mudra.

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:04.460 align:middle line:84%
This is the mudra that it
said that the Buddha took

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:06.290 align:middle line:90%
upon his awakening.

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:09.410 align:middle line:84%
The left hand palm
up in the lap.

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:15.630 align:middle line:84%
The right hand four fingers
gently touching the earth.

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:20.160 align:middle line:84%
Touching into the earth,
the earth as the witness

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:25.560 align:middle line:84%
to our unfolding and
our own awakening.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.840 align:middle line:84%
Allow the eyes to
fall shut again.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:41.050 align:middle line:90%


00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Allow your fingertips
to rest onto the earth.

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:47.060 align:middle line:90%


00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And feel yourself grounded,
stable, steady, connected,

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:58.850 align:middle line:90%
and rooted.

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:03.230 align:middle line:84%
Allowing the earth
to absorb anything

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:04.750 align:middle line:90%
that you are ready to release.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:10.720 align:middle line:90%


00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:17.120 align:middle line:84%
Feeling the column of the
spine emerging up and out

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.630 align:middle line:90%
of the earth.

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:23.230 align:middle line:84%
Feeling the polarity of
the base of the spine

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:24.480 align:middle line:90%
and the crown of the head.
