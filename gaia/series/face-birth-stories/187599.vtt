[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.900 align:middle line:84%
>> 81 years ago, a business
took off in a small town

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.230 align:middle line:90%
in Queensland.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:12.030 align:middle line:90%
It was a business--

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>> If giving birth to Olivia
was the most empowering moment

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.210 align:middle line:84%
of my life, giving birth to
Matilda was the most joyous

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.275 align:middle line:90%
moment of my life.

00:00:19.275 --> 00:00:23.240 align:middle line:90%


00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:29.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm a filmmaker and a director
and an actor and a storyteller.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:30.748 align:middle line:90%
I'm a storyteller.

00:00:30.748 --> 00:00:34.170 align:middle line:90%


00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.875 align:middle line:84%
Family to me means
expanding the love.

00:00:38.875 --> 00:00:39.850 align:middle line:90%
So there's two of you.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.923 align:middle line:84%
You love each other,
and you have a baby,

00:00:41.923 --> 00:00:42.840 align:middle line:90%
and there's more love.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And then you go, oh god,
I've got another one.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.140 align:middle line:90%
This is so hard.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.100 align:middle line:84%
You have another one,
and there's more love.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And then you go,
oh, no this is--

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:49.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm just too tired.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.450 align:middle line:84%
I need to sleep, or
I can't afford it.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.270 align:middle line:84%
And then you have another
one, and there's more love.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.810 align:middle line:84%
There's also more
mess, but yeah, that's

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.050 align:middle line:90%
what it means to me.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.209 align:middle line:84%
For a long time I've been really
into-- some people would say

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:06.530 align:middle line:90%
obsessed--

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.200 align:middle line:84%
with Art Deco and with
the Interwar period.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.370 align:middle line:90%


00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And the thing of
balance and peace

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.730 align:middle line:84%
has been something that
I've worked a long time

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.250 align:middle line:84%
to try and get to, and I'm
pretty content at the moment,

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.220 align:middle line:90%
despite being 30 weeks pregnant.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm comfortable and content.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:36.340 align:middle line:84%
So when I got pregnant, I
didn't know a lot about birth

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.180 align:middle line:90%
and having a baby.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.930 align:middle line:84%
The things I did
know were not great.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.090 align:middle line:84%
When my aunt gave
birth to my cousin,

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.430 align:middle line:90%
I was, like, 14 years old or so.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.960 align:middle line:90%
I remember it quite well.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.600 align:middle line:84%
I remember going to
visit her in hospital,

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.748 align:middle line:90%
and I asked her how she was.

00:01:51.748 --> 00:01:53.290 align:middle line:84%
And she turned around
to me and said,

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.520 align:middle line:84%
if you want to know
how I feel, go and sit

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.800 align:middle line:90%
on a barbed wire fence.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.120 align:middle line:90%
And I went, [GASP].

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And about two years
later, my best friend

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.300 align:middle line:84%
had an older sister who'd
had her first baby, 19

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.840 align:middle line:84%
or 20 or something, and
again, we were sort of 15.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And she had said
to me that birth

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.950 align:middle line:84%
was like trying to
shit a vacuum cleaner.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.815 align:middle line:84%
Then I think when you do get
pregnant, most women-- maybe

00:02:16.815 --> 00:02:17.815 align:middle line:90%
that's a generalization.

00:02:17.815 --> 00:02:20.650 align:middle line:84%
But I think most women want
a whole lot of knowledge

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.170 align:middle line:84%
because it's unknown when
you haven't done it before,

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.090 align:middle line:84%
and you want to
know what it's like.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.850 align:middle line:84%
You want to know
what it feels like.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.500 align:middle line:90%
And you start to read stuff.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.120 align:middle line:84%
So I started to
read lots of books.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And you know I went and
bought "Up the Duff"

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.440 align:middle line:84%
because it's funny
and has cute pictures,

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.940 align:middle line:84%
and I went and bought "What
To Expect" because you do.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.710 align:middle line:84%
But then I started
to read "Secret Life

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.690 align:middle line:84%
Of the Unborn Child"
and "Active Birth"

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.610 align:middle line:84%
and a book on lotus
birth and a book

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.922 align:middle line:84%
called "Gentle Birth
Myth," and I started--

00:02:47.922 --> 00:02:49.630 align:middle line:84%
and I read all of them
in the first three

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.290 align:middle line:90%
months or something.

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.730 align:middle line:90%
And I started to go, oh, wow.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.170 align:middle line:90%
No, there's a whole other side.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.420 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I actually
want the drug thing because I

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.270 align:middle line:84%
want the best thing
for my baby, and I

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:02.710 align:middle line:90%
want to work with my body.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.045 align:middle line:84%
And so I rang up the
female obstetricians

00:03:06.045 --> 00:03:07.420 align:middle line:84%
that were on this
list, and there

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.310 align:middle line:90%
was one that had an opening.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.150 align:middle line:90%
Matt and I went to see her.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.880 align:middle line:84%
I didn't ask the right
questions then, I must say,

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.410 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't speak
to anybody else.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.740 align:middle line:84%
I felt a bit in a
hurry to make sure I

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.910 align:middle line:90%
was booked into a hospital.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.540 align:middle line:90%


00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.487 align:middle line:84%
Then I would keep on
seeing this obstetrician

00:03:27.487 --> 00:03:28.320 align:middle line:90%
for my appointments.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.890 align:middle line:84%
They'd go for about
5, 10 minutes.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.910 align:middle line:84%
She'd take my blood
pressure, examine me.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.543 align:middle line:84%
And I asked her when we were
going to talk about the birth

00:03:37.543 --> 00:03:39.210 align:middle line:84%
because I had this
thing about-- because

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.407 align:middle line:84%
of the barbed wire fence
comment, the coming out,

00:03:41.407 --> 00:03:42.240 align:middle line:90%
the baby coming out.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.310 align:middle line:84%
I going, but what happens
when the baby comes out?

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.020 align:middle line:84%
Because this is what
I'm concerned about.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I don't
want to talk about this.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.087 align:middle line:84%
It's too early to
talk about this.

00:03:49.087 --> 00:03:51.420 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about it when
you're in your third trimester

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.890 align:middle line:90%
later on.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.340 align:middle line:84%
And the reason she gave, she
said, because women get too

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.140 align:middle line:84%
hung up on the birth and not
that they're getting a baby.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And something in
that rang true to me.

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.260 align:middle line:84%
But because I wasn't getting
the answers from her,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.300 align:middle line:84%
and I needed more
information, I went

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.220 align:middle line:84%
and I did a course with a
woman called Lina Clerke,

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.790 align:middle line:84%
and she's a birth educator
and a doula and a midwife.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.190 align:middle line:84%
But her business
is to do classes.

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And there were people
having home births.

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.780 align:middle line:90%
I'd never heard of a home birth.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.380 align:middle line:84%
There were people
in birth centers.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.300 align:middle line:84%
There were people
who were having

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.630 align:middle line:90%
an obstetrician at home birth.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.780 align:middle line:84%
There were people who
just had midwife-led care.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.238 align:middle line:84%
And there were
people in hospitals,

00:04:32.238 --> 00:04:34.980 align:middle line:84%
both public and private,
all doing these classes.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.450 align:middle line:84%
And I learned then,
at that class,

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.670 align:middle line:84%
that there were lots
of ways to have a baby,

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.637 align:middle line:84%
and that you could do
whatever you wanted.

00:04:42.637 --> 00:04:44.970 align:middle line:84%
Then she went around the room
and she said, does anybody

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.870 align:middle line:84%
have any fears or concerns or
things I want to talk about?

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.230 align:middle line:84%
And I was the first
one she asked.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.325 align:middle line:84%
And I said, oh, I'm
worried about the tearing

00:04:55.325 --> 00:04:56.700 align:middle line:84%
because this is
part of my stuff.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm worried about the
tearing or the cutting

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.960 align:middle line:84%
at the second stage
when the baby comes out.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And she said, why does
that have to happen?

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.830 align:middle line:84%
So she really helped
me get over that fear,

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.790 align:middle line:84%
and that was the one
sort of fear I had.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.460 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, at 36 weeks
pregnant, I finally

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.230 align:middle line:84%
have my birth plan meeting
with my obstetrician.

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And my husband's not
there for that visit.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm on my own.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.840 align:middle line:90%
And I'm excited.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm excited about giving birth.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm excited about
finally talking

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:31.310 align:middle line:84%
about what I want with the woman
who's going to deliver my baby.

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And I said, so in early labor,
we'd like to labor at home.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.230 align:middle line:84%
Then we'll come in at the
right time when we come in,

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.780 align:middle line:84%
and I said I didn't
want any pain relief.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.070 align:middle line:90%
And she laughed at me.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.750 align:middle line:90%


00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And she laughed at me in this
really condescending kind

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.230 align:middle line:90%
of, yeah right, kind of way.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:59.070 align:middle line:84%
And so I started to get alarm
bells going off a little bit.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd learned all these
great things about positions,

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.560 align:middle line:84%
and it made so much
sense to me, someone

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.300 align:middle line:84%
who's trained as a dancer and
knows their body very well

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.630 align:middle line:84%
and what their body can do,
about squatting and opening up

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:16.140 align:middle line:84%
your pelvis to let then
gravity helping the baby.

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh, all my ladies
give birth on their back.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking,
you don't want to get

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.930 align:middle line:84%
your Armani trousers dirty by
squatting on the floor with me.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.810 align:middle line:84%
Like, that's what I was
thinking of her at that point.

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And then I had done a lot
of reading about third stage

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.930 align:middle line:84%
and about the blood transfer
that happens from the placenta

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:41.910 align:middle line:84%
to the baby and
also the hormones,

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:43.860 align:middle line:84%
like taking away the
baby's adrenaline

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.560 align:middle line:84%
and giving it the
oxytocin and it

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.260 align:middle line:84%
getting the same happy
hormones as the mother.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:54.150 align:middle line:84%
And to me and to Matthew,
that seemed really important.

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:55.950 align:middle line:84%
So I did not want
to cut the cord,

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.860 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted a natural
third stage delivery.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.530 align:middle line:90%
And she just said to me--

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.120 align:middle line:84%
I get so angry
thinking about it.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.940 align:middle line:84%
She said to me, oh, no, we
have to get that placenta out

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:07.740 align:middle line:90%
straight away.

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.510 align:middle line:84%
I always cut the cord and
then take the placenta out

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.000 align:middle line:84%
because my job's not done till
I can inspect the placenta.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.150 align:middle line:84%
Her job's not done till she
can inspect the placenta.

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:19.050 align:middle line:84%
So she can't wait around
40 minutes for me?

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.820 align:middle line:90%


00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:22.950 align:middle line:90%
So that made me very upset.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:25.540 align:middle line:90%


00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:30.920 align:middle line:84%
So I just said, I don't
think this is going to work.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.550 align:middle line:90%
I think I have to go.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing I'll
give her credit for

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.748 align:middle line:84%
is she recognized it wasn't
going to work as well,

00:07:36.748 --> 00:07:38.290 align:middle line:84%
and she didn't try
to talk me around.

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.020 align:middle line:84%
She just went, yeah, no, I
don't think is going to work.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.853 align:middle line:84%
Mind you, she didn't
recommend anybody else.

00:07:41.853 --> 00:07:43.860 align:middle line:84%
So I walked out of there
at 36 weeks pregnant.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.540 align:middle line:90%
I had no way to have my baby.

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:51.140 align:middle line:84%
But when I walked out, I
didn't continue to feel angry.

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.590 align:middle line:84%
To be honest, I probably
bit panicked about the fact

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:57.070 align:middle line:84%
that I had nowhere to
give birth, suddenly.

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:59.510 align:middle line:84%
But then I was like,
right, we have to fix this.

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And through this course,
this workshop I'd done,

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:05.895 align:middle line:84%
luckily, there was
people I could call,

00:08:05.895 --> 00:08:07.478 align:middle line:84%
and I knew the right
questions to ask.

00:08:07.478 --> 00:08:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And within a really
short space of time--

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:13.300 align:middle line:84%
in fact, that same day, there's
this wonderful place called

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:14.640 align:middle line:90%
the Hawthorne Birth Center.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.243 align:middle line:90%
It's a standalone birth center.

00:08:16.243 --> 00:08:17.410 align:middle line:90%
It was a water birth center.

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:19.460 align:middle line:84%
They specialized
in water births.

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:23.000 align:middle line:90%
It was like coming home.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.820 align:middle line:84%
I suddenly then had no
fear about anything,

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.320 align:middle line:90%
felt totally relaxed.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And when I then, in a little
bit of a defensive manner,

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.409 align:middle line:84%
started to go through
my birth plan.

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:36.675 align:middle line:90%
I was met with, oh, yeah, yeah.

00:08:36.675 --> 00:08:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, yeah,
yeah, we do this.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:39.690 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you can do
whatever you want.

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, get in the water,
you can get out the water.

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And oh, no, no, we don't cut the
cord until after third stage.

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:51.510 align:middle line:90%
And so, just so different.

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:54.480 align:middle line:84%
I still asked Bruce, how
far is it to the hospital?

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.700 align:middle line:90%
He wouldn't tell me in time.

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:56.658 align:middle line:90%
It was quite hilarious.

00:08:56.658 --> 00:09:01.770 align:middle line:84%
He'd say, oh, it's about sort of
five or six contractions away.

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:06.090 align:middle line:84%
But because he was
so relaxed about it,

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:07.367 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't worried about it.

00:09:07.367 --> 00:09:08.700 align:middle line:90%
>> The military is overextended.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.820 align:middle line:90%
>> And how are you feeling?

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:12.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Same.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.200 align:middle line:90%
Having contractions.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.720 align:middle line:84%
They hurt a little
bit, not too bad.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:19.410 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd gone to bed, and I
woke up with labor pains.

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:21.990 align:middle line:84%
And my sister had stayed the
night, and Matt was there.

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And he rang the midwife and she
said, I'll go to the nurse said

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:26.430 align:middle line:90%
and put pool on.

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:28.055 align:middle line:84%
So then when I got
to the birth center,

00:09:28.055 --> 00:09:30.462 align:middle line:84%
I just want to get in
the water straight away.

00:09:30.462 --> 00:09:33.426 align:middle line:90%
>> Know when we'll be back now.

00:09:33.426 --> 00:09:34.908 align:middle line:90%
>> She's having a baby.

00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:36.390 align:middle line:90%
Kate's having a baby.

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:56.550 align:middle line:90%


00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:00.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm just waiting until the
contraction's finished.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.600 align:middle line:90%
She's more agreeable then.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.950 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm not saying
it didn't hurt.

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And we all know that labor is
painful because, hey, everyone

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:09.748 align:middle line:90%
tells us that all the time.

00:10:09.748 --> 00:10:12.852 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:12.852 --> 00:10:13.652 align:middle line:90%


00:10:13.652 --> 00:10:14.628 align:middle line:90%
>> Fuck.

00:10:14.628 --> 00:10:17.556 align:middle line:90%


00:10:17.556 --> 00:10:19.508 align:middle line:90%
Oh, baby.

00:10:19.508 --> 00:10:21.970 align:middle line:90%
Really hurts.

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:22.960 align:middle line:90%
>> It did hurt.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.538 align:middle line:84%
But to be perfectly
honest, I had a gastro bug

00:10:25.538 --> 00:10:27.580 align:middle line:84%
that I picked up in Thailand
on my honeymoon that

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:29.890 align:middle line:90%
was 10 times worse.

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And when this involuntary
muscle contraction happened,

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:37.130 align:middle line:84%
something went off in my
head, and I went, aha.

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:38.800 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.390 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:44.410 align:middle line:84%
Then I went into second
stage and through transition,

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:46.053 align:middle line:90%
and then I got the pushing urge.

00:10:46.053 --> 00:10:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And when I got the
pushing urge, I

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:51.510 align:middle line:84%
was like, oh, all right,
that bearing down.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:53.977 align:middle line:84%
And so the only way I
can describe it-- this

00:10:53.977 --> 00:10:55.810 align:middle line:84%
isn't a medical
description, you understand.

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:57.730 align:middle line:84%
This is a Kate
Gorman description--

00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:03.910 align:middle line:84%
is your uterus is doing this
and pushing down and pushing in,

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:05.800 align:middle line:84%
and you can use
your stomach muscles

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.350 align:middle line:84%
to do that as well
in the same time.

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And once I got that, it was
like I had something to--

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:12.370 align:middle line:90%
I knew what to do.

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:16.270 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, oh, I'm fine.

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:20.200 align:middle line:84%
We were monitoring
the baby's heartbeat

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.930 align:middle line:84%
only with the Sonicaid, though,
not with any fetal monitor.

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:25.450 align:middle line:90%


00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:28.360 align:middle line:84%
I ended up having a
three-hour second stage.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.280 align:middle line:90%
I was OK with that.

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.380 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't fatigued.

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:35.085 align:middle line:84%
I just went somewhere
else in my body.

00:11:35.085 --> 00:11:36.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I knew I
was in the room.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:37.810 align:middle line:84%
I knew Matt was there
in the pool with me,

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:39.852 align:middle line:84%
and my sister was there
and my midwife was there.

00:11:39.852 --> 00:11:42.250 align:middle line:90%
But I just--

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:44.530 align:middle line:84%
I just had a job to do
and I was just into it.

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And I had no idea
it was three hours.

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:49.372 align:middle line:90%
I thought it was half an hour.

00:11:49.372 --> 00:11:50.830 align:middle line:84%
But what that meant
was I was doing

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:52.720 align:middle line:84%
this slow opening,
two steps forward,

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:56.080 align:middle line:84%
one step back, two steps
forward, one step back,

00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:00.610 align:middle line:84%
and I had no tearing in
the end when she came.

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:05.310 align:middle line:84%
So then at the last minute
I remember feeling the head

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:07.210 align:middle line:84%
and that she was
coming out and just,

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:09.560 align:middle line:90%
oh my god, my baby's coming.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.050 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'm so excited.

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:14.090 align:middle line:90%
It was just-- it was beautiful.

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:18.610 align:middle line:90%
And I was doing it.

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And then Bruce, the
obstetrician, he stuck his head

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:24.430 align:middle line:90%
in, said, everything all right?

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:25.638 align:middle line:90%
And Barbara went, yeah, fine.

00:12:25.638 --> 00:12:26.555 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be soon.

00:12:26.555 --> 00:12:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And he went, doing
a great job, Kate.

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:29.510 align:middle line:90%
And he walked out of the room.

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:31.110 align:middle line:90%
Hilarious, but how wonderful.

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:33.660 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that what perhaps
an obstetrician should do?

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:36.290 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:40.970 align:middle line:84%
Then when Olivia was born in
the water, Matt caught her.

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:44.070 align:middle line:90%
He was sitting behind me.

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And he passed her up
sort of through my legs,

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:49.860 align:middle line:84%
and I brought her up
through the water.

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And when you have a
water birth, the water

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.950 align:middle line:84%
is body temperature,
and so was the room.

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:58.308 align:middle line:84%
It all has to be very
warm, especially the water,

00:12:58.308 --> 00:13:00.600 align:middle line:84%
so the baby doesn't try and
take a breathe under water.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.720 align:middle line:84%
And you bring the baby
up, and she was still

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.460 align:middle line:90%
breathing through the cord.

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And Barbara gave me a face
washer cloth, flannel .

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And she said, Kate, just
wipe her face and blow on it.

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:16.802 align:middle line:84%
And so I wiped her face and
I went, and she went, ah.

00:13:16.802 --> 00:13:23.550 align:middle line:90%


00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And it was like
giving life again,

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:29.470 align:middle line:90%
like it just giving birth.

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:31.765 align:middle line:90%
And then I made her breathe.

00:13:31.765 --> 00:13:38.000 align:middle line:90%


00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.030 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know why
I'm crying so much.

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:41.738 align:middle line:84%
It was actually a
really wonderful thing.

00:13:41.738 --> 00:13:44.130 align:middle line:90%


00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:45.130 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing like it.

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:46.160 align:middle line:90%
It's a miracle.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.550 align:middle line:90%
It's extraordinary.

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:57.050 align:middle line:90%


00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:59.700 align:middle line:84%
So for my second
pregnancy, circumstances

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:01.260 align:middle line:90%
had us living in England.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.420 align:middle line:84%
So we were living
in the country.

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:06.190 align:middle line:84%
I actually was already
pregnant when I went there.

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:11.330 align:middle line:90%


00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:14.300 align:middle line:84%
Because what I wanted
was a home birth,

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:19.220 align:middle line:84%
because after you've had that
experience, you can't go back.

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:20.640 align:middle line:90%
You know too much.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:21.440 align:middle line:90%
I can't get back.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.610 align:middle line:90%
You know too much.

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:26.651 align:middle line:84%
And I knew what I wanted
was a water birth at home.

00:14:26.651 --> 00:14:27.645 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:14:27.645 --> 00:15:15.737 align:middle line:90%


00:15:15.737 --> 00:15:17.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Kate, just try and keep
breathing when you hear

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:18.800 align:middle line:90%
the next contraction.
