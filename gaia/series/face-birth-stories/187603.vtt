00:00:11.688 --> 00:00:18.530 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:24.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Opinionated, grouchy,
not tall enough,

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.140 align:middle line:84%
and all of those are
quite trite answers.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.150 align:middle line:84%
I guess really, if I had to
describe myself, I would say,

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm Croatian, and I'm a
mother, and I'm a wife,

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.340 align:middle line:84%
and I'm a milliner,
and that most of all,

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.115 align:middle line:84%
I would describe
myself as lucky.

00:00:40.115 --> 00:00:43.730 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, he's got a
tummy ache, hasn't he?

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.190 align:middle line:84%
The next day was Sunday,
and the caterpillar

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.440 align:middle line:90%
ate through-- what's this one?

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.140 align:middle line:90%
Nice, big--

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Not hungry anymore.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.440 align:middle line:90%
>> No, he's not hungry anymore.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.360 align:middle line:90%


00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.670 align:middle line:90%
We lived in London for 11 years.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.430 align:middle line:84%
So I worked at the Victoria
Palace Theater backstage,

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.450 align:middle line:84%
and then I got a permanent
job at the Savoy Theatere,

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.220 align:middle line:84%
and then I retrained
to be a milliner

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.600 align:middle line:90%
and worked at Covent Garden.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.580 align:middle line:90%


00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.890 align:middle line:90%
I've always liked making things.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.730 align:middle line:84%
I think my dad probably
had a lot to do with it.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.440 align:middle line:84%
He was one of those
immigrant men that

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.410 align:middle line:84%
just had an enormous shed,
and rebuilt the house,

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.095 align:middle line:84%
and if the roof needed fixing,
he just did it himself.

00:01:29.095 --> 00:01:30.720 align:middle line:84%
Mom and dad gave me
a car when I turned

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.890 align:middle line:84%
18, which was an old banger
that kept breaking down,

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.410 align:middle line:84%
and so I used to drive
dad's '67 Fairlane

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.570 align:middle line:90%
and drag the boys at the lights.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And so when we moved
back to Australia,

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.100 align:middle line:84%
one of the things we talked
about was wanting an old car,

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.810 align:middle line:90%
so we found our Falcon.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.790 align:middle line:90%
I love that it's pink.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.220 align:middle line:84%
I like that it has
Venetian blinds

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.950 align:middle line:90%
and a falcon on the Bonnet.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.990 align:middle line:84%
Nick and I had a really
good life together that

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.330 align:middle line:90%
was completely self-indulgent.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.320 align:middle line:90%
We traveled a lot.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.470 align:middle line:90%
We had a lot of friends.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.690 align:middle line:90%
We had a great social life.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And there was-- there was a
lot of talk for a lot of years

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.310 align:middle line:84%
about whether we were too
selfish to have children,

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.820 align:middle line:84%
whether we even wanted to give
up enough to have children.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And then my brother
had his little girl,

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.540 align:middle line:84%
and we both fell
in love with her,

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.250 align:middle line:84%
and that kind of
clinched it for us.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.250 align:middle line:90%


00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it was
so specific in my mind

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.420 align:middle line:90%
that I wanted a home birth.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.000 align:middle line:84%
What I had known for years
was that I didn't ever

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.830 align:middle line:84%
want to give birth
in a hospital.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.230 align:middle line:84%
I'd had a couple of
operations in the UK.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.603 align:middle line:84%
I remember having surgery
once to remove a coil that

00:02:45.603 --> 00:02:47.270 align:middle line:84%
had poked through the
wall of my uterus,

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.320 align:middle line:90%
and so it was emergency surgery.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.230 align:middle line:84%
I was absolutely traumatized
by what was happening to me.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.120 align:middle line:84%
I was in a gown on an
operating table surrounded

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.170 align:middle line:84%
by five men who were all joking
and laughing in a language

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.025 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't understand,
and not one of them

00:03:07.025 --> 00:03:07.900 align:middle line:90%
looked me in the eye.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.145 align:middle line:84%
Not one of them told
me I would be OK.

00:03:11.145 --> 00:03:12.520 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know
who they were.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.300 align:middle line:84%
I assumed that they
were assistants.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.600 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think that they were
surgeons, but I had no idea.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.000 align:middle line:84%
I had developed this
kind of weird almost

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.920 align:middle line:90%
terror of hospitals.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And so when I got
pregnant, we really

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.880 align:middle line:84%
had to talk about where
I was going to feel safe.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And so I contacted Dr. Peter
Lucas at Wattle Park House,

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.700 align:middle line:84%
because I've been told that he
was a home birth obstetrician

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.120 align:middle line:84%
and he had two midwives
working out of his surgery.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.110 align:middle line:84%
So we made an appointment
and met Jan, our midwife.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.550 align:middle line:90%


00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.730 align:middle line:84%
Instantly, we fell
in love with her.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.010 align:middle line:90%
She was warm and generous.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.450 align:middle line:84%
I have never felt so well
or so strong or so capable

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.990 align:middle line:84%
or so frightened by what
people were telling me.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.160 align:middle line:84%
So my pregnancy was
interesting in that there

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.880 align:middle line:90%
was potential complications.

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.050 align:middle line:84%
There was an issue over the
scar on my uterus from when

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:22.730 align:middle line:84%
the coil had pushed
through and whether that

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.800 align:middle line:84%
would cause a
weakness in my uterus

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.790 align:middle line:90%
if I had a vaginal birth.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:35.397 align:middle line:84%
I had the glucose test,
and it came back positive.

00:04:35.397 --> 00:04:36.980 align:middle line:84%
And so part of that
was that every two

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.750 align:middle line:84%
weeks I went to the diabetes
clinic at the hospital

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.010 align:middle line:84%
to have my results looked
at, talk about nutrition,

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.470 align:middle line:84%
do all of that stuff that
theoretically is a really

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.770 align:middle line:90%
good thing, except I went--

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.220 align:middle line:90%
it was quite late on.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:05:00.830 align:middle line:84%
I think I was about seven
weeks from Nate's birth,

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.470 align:middle line:90%
and he hadn't turned around yet.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.680 align:middle line:84%
So I saw a woman
obstetrician, and you think--

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.910 align:middle line:84%
as a woman, I've always
gravitated towards female GPs,

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.770 align:middle line:84%
thought I would be in
more empathetic hands

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.680 align:middle line:84%
with a female obstetrician,
and as it turned out,

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.560 align:middle line:84%
this woman was a
complete fuckwit.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.730 align:middle line:84%
She told me that seven weeks
out, there was no chance

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:27.920 align:middle line:90%
that Nate would turn.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.790 align:middle line:84%
She told me that unless I
booked myself in for a cesarean,

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:36.110 align:middle line:90%
that Nate and/or I would die.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.230 align:middle line:90%
And I said to her--

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.950 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't believe what she'd
said to me and I said to her,

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.130 align:middle line:84%
are you seriously telling
me that my baby will die?

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And she said, babies
don't turn this late.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
I'll try everything.

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.110 align:middle line:90%
I'll try acupuncture.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.750 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of acupuncture
it works very well for me.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.390 align:middle line:84%
And she told me that
believing in acupuncture

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:59.600 align:middle line:84%
was about as medically
relevant as believing in God.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.030 align:middle line:84%
This woman knew
nothing about me.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.610 align:middle line:84%
I could have been
a devout Christian.

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.990 align:middle line:90%
I could have been a devout Jew.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.790 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.000 align:middle line:84%
What she was basically
saying to me was everything

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.990 align:middle line:84%
I felt was wrong, and
unless I did it her way,

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.600 align:middle line:90%
my baby was going to die.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.360 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.210 align:middle line:90%


00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.690 align:middle line:84%
The day after I'd
seen the obstetrician,

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.200 align:middle line:84%
we had an appointment with Jan,
and I'd called her that day

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.030 align:middle line:90%
in floods of tears.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.250 align:middle line:84%
She talked me down, told me
everything would be fine,

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.130 align:middle line:84%
to come tomorrow and
we'd talk about it.

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:40.140 align:middle line:84%
She checked him, she checked
me, she said that we were fine

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:47.110 align:middle line:84%
and to just give it a few more
weeks and see how he went,

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.910 align:middle line:90%
and he turned.

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.620 align:middle line:90%


00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And so I'd managed it
really well and none of this

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:59.460 align:middle line:84%
was a problem except when I
got sucked into the fear thing.

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.990 align:middle line:84%
I went back to my GP for
something completely unrelated,

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.410 align:middle line:84%
and she asked how my
pregnancy was going.

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.618 align:middle line:84%
I told her what had
happened at the hospital,

00:07:09.618 --> 00:07:11.160 align:middle line:84%
and this woman looked
me in the eye--

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this was a
woman I'd trusted.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:15.270 align:middle line:84%
She'd been my GP
for a few years.

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:20.847 align:middle line:84%
I'd found her really open
and honest and caring,

00:07:20.847 --> 00:07:22.680 align:middle line:84%
and she looked me in
the eye and she told me

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.400 align:middle line:84%
that an elective Cesarean
was a perfectly pleasant way

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.130 align:middle line:90%
to bring a baby into the world.

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:32.265 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought
I was going mad.

00:07:32.265 --> 00:07:34.140 align:middle line:84%
I just couldn't believe
that I was surrounded

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:39.120 align:middle line:84%
by so many women who were so
determined that slicing open

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.360 align:middle line:84%
my abdomen and
pulling my baby out

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.870 align:middle line:90%
was the best thing for me to do.

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:50.355 align:middle line:84%
>> So were you
confused by all that?

00:07:50.355 --> 00:07:51.305 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:07:51.305 --> 00:07:54.160 align:middle line:90%


00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.900 align:middle line:84%
What it made me realize
is that the choices

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:06.780 align:middle line:84%
that I'd made about
what was good for me

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:13.750 align:middle line:84%
and the baby I was
carrying were right,

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:22.280 align:middle line:84%
that my instincts were
right, that my midwife was,

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:29.720 align:middle line:84%
along with Nick, the best people
to be with me during my labor.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:37.470 align:middle line:90%


00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:41.470 align:middle line:84%
So we got to 42 weeks, we were
seeing Jan a lot at that point.

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:46.370 align:middle line:84%
Nate hadn't quite engaged
fully, and he showed no signs

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:47.617 align:middle line:90%
at all of coming.

00:08:47.617 --> 00:08:48.950 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we were both very happy.

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:51.900 align:middle line:84%
I could've easily done
another three months.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And most women
look at me like I'm

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:57.170 align:middle line:84%
a crazy person when I said that,
but we really were very happy.

00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:59.770 align:middle line:90%


00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:03.550 align:middle line:84%
Jan said that she would
like me to have a scan,

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:07.300 align:middle line:84%
and she was happy for me
if everything carried on

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:11.080 align:middle line:84%
to go for a little while
longer, but that she wanted

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.750 align:middle line:84%
me to have a scan just
to check that everything

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:15.700 align:middle line:90%
was fine with the baby.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:19.930 align:middle line:84%
The woman doing the ultrasound
tutted a bit and said,

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:24.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to go and get
my supervisor, and went away,

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:25.930 align:middle line:90%
and no one came back.

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:28.930 align:middle line:84%
So I'm getting progressively
more and more stressed,

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:30.400 align:middle line:84%
saying to Nick,
something's wrong,

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.150 align:middle line:90%
something terrible is wrong.

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:34.360 align:middle line:84%
He must be alive, because
I can feel him kicking,

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.610 align:middle line:90%
but something terrible is wrong.

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And what had happened
was they'd forgotten.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:44.980 align:middle line:84%
And so when Nick
finally went out to say,

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:48.190 align:middle line:84%
is someone coming
back, we found out

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:52.400 align:middle line:84%
that my fluid levels
were really quite low.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:56.500 align:middle line:84%
So it meant that
Nate was getting

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.480 align:middle line:90%
kind of wrinkly in there.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.270 align:middle line:84%
It probably meant that
I needed to be induced.

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:03.730 align:middle line:84%
If I wasn't going to
go into labor normally,

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:07.480 align:middle line:84%
it probably meant that I needed
to be induced a bit more.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.750 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want him
to go into distress.

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:15.330 align:middle line:84%
They were OK with me going
home for five or six hours.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And Jan was basically saying,
let's hope you go into labor.

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:20.620 align:middle line:84%
If you go into labor
and everything's fine

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.240 align:middle line:84%
and you're safe and
the baby's safe,

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:25.150 align:middle line:84%
we'll just carry on at
home and see how you go.

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:28.900 align:middle line:84%
So of course, in what was
becoming a bit of a pattern,

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:30.590 align:middle line:90%
I didn't go into labor.

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:36.723 align:middle line:84%
So we went back that afternoon
and had my waters broken

00:10:36.723 --> 00:10:37.640 align:middle line:90%
and I went into labor.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.770 align:middle line:90%


00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:42.770 align:middle line:84%
I was OK with the fact
that I was in a hospital.

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:44.228 align:middle line:84%
I'd kind of dealt
with all of that.

00:10:44.228 --> 00:10:45.820 align:middle line:84%
We'd taken our fairy
lights with us.

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:48.970 align:middle line:84%
Nick was there, Jan
was there, but then it

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:54.478 align:middle line:84%
became an issue of fighting
against policy and procedure.

00:10:54.478 --> 00:10:56.020 align:middle line:84%
Because they'd broken
my waters, they

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:58.562 align:middle line:84%
wanted to put me on a drip, and
I didn't want to go on a drip

00:10:58.562 --> 00:11:01.180 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't want the
contractions to become

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:03.665 align:middle line:84%
unnatural and painful, and
then that whole cascade

00:11:03.665 --> 00:11:05.290 align:middle line:84%
of intervention that
people talk about,

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:08.540 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want any of that.

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And so it really was a bit like
beating them off with a stick.

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, Nick growled at
a midwife and said, she's fine.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.420 align:middle line:90%
Her contractions are good.

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:23.590 align:middle line:90%
She doesn't need a drip.

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:26.920 align:middle line:90%


00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.930 align:middle line:84%
Things kind of went
OK for a while.

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:33.250 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking, OK, I might be
in hospital, but Jan's with me.

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:35.120 align:middle line:90%
It's all fine.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And then I got to 5
centimeters, and Nate

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:43.070 align:middle line:84%
rolled over and went to sleep,
and I stopped contracting.

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:46.100 align:middle line:84%
Jan came in and asked
Nick how I was doing,

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:49.460 align:middle line:84%
and he said, oh, she's
quietened down a bit.

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And Jan felt my stomach,
and for the first time,

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:59.760 align:middle line:84%
I heard Jan say, oh,
well, that's not so great.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And because she'd always been
so positive, so matter of fact,

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:11.540 align:middle line:84%
so unflappable, even kind of in
that primal place in my head,

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:14.270 align:middle line:84%
I started to think,
this isn't so good.

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:17.720 align:middle line:84%
Something's going wrong
and Nate had rolled over.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And so then as my
contractions were coming,

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.590 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't dilating anymore.

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And he'd basically
sat on my spine,

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:26.180 align:middle line:84%
so we were spine
to spine, and so

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:28.910 align:middle line:84%
that pain of him
sitting on my spine

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:32.120 align:middle line:84%
was getting harder
and harder and harder,

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.830 align:middle line:84%
and then my contractions
over the top of that,

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:37.340 align:middle line:90%
then I started to shake.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:39.290 align:middle line:84%
And we'd had this
whole conversation

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:42.720 align:middle line:84%
about I don't think
this is necessarily

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.960 align:middle line:90%
going to happen naturally.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:53.010 align:middle line:84%
When they finally saw me, a very
sympathetic, very young woman

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:56.910 align:middle line:84%
said to me, I think we need
to give you a Cesarean.

00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:00.000 align:middle line:84%
I stalled and stalled and
stalled, eventually spoke

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.560 align:middle line:84%
to Jan, and she said, I
think this is probably

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:05.490 align:middle line:90%
what we need to do.

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:12.990 align:middle line:84%
So then I talked to them about,
if this is what we have to do,

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:15.240 align:middle line:84%
I want to be awake, I
want Nick to be with me,

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.190 align:middle line:90%
I want Jan to be with me.

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:20.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't want anyone to tell
me what sex my baby is.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.110 align:middle line:90%
I don't want--

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:25.288 align:middle line:84%
I don't want you to cut the cord
if you can possibly help it.

00:13:25.288 --> 00:13:27.705 align:middle line:84%
If you do have to cut the cord,
I want you to cut it long.

00:13:27.705 --> 00:13:33.410 align:middle line:90%


00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:36.180 align:middle line:90%
And I said to them, if we--

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:39.330 align:middle line:90%
I'd like it to be really quiet.

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.310 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want Nate arriving in--

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:53.280 align:middle line:90%


00:13:53.280 --> 00:14:06.040 align:middle line:84%
I wanted Nate to come surrounded
by his family in his home,

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:09.090 align:middle line:90%
in his living room.

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:13.080 align:middle line:84%
I wanted it to be peaceful
and calm and welcoming.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.660 align:middle line:90%


00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And what I didn't want
was him to be wrenched out

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:27.085 align:middle line:84%
of me in an operating
theater with noise and light

00:14:27.085 --> 00:14:27.885 align:middle line:90%
and stress.

00:14:27.885 --> 00:14:32.340 align:middle line:90%


00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And in the end, they were
very gentle and quiet.

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:43.425 align:middle line:84%
And there's a picture I have
of him being lifted out,

00:14:43.425 --> 00:14:44.675 align:middle line:90%
and he looks like he's asleep.

00:14:44.675 --> 00:14:53.960 align:middle line:90%


00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:57.500 align:middle line:84%
Although it wasn't the
birth I wanted for him,

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.670 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't the
way I wanted to birth

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:08.420 align:middle line:84%
my child, what was most
important was that he was safe

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:11.850 align:middle line:90%
and that I was safe.

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:14.030 align:middle line:90%
And we were safe.

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:20.820 align:middle line:84%
But what made it OK was
that every step of the way,

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:21.620 align:middle line:90%
Jan was there.

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:24.670 align:middle line:90%


00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:29.960 align:middle line:84%
It's the most miraculous
thing I have ever done.

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And I've done some
really good stuff.

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:34.090 align:middle line:84%
I've had a lot of
fun in my life.

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:35.680 align:middle line:90%
I've traveled a lot.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.600 align:middle line:84%
I've seen extraordinary
things and I've

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.070 align:middle line:84%
been in extraordinary
situations,

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:44.020 align:middle line:84%
but there is nothing in my
life that has ever compared

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:45.880 align:middle line:90%
to the birth of my son.

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.500 align:middle line:90%
One.

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:48.640 align:middle line:90%
>> One ice cream.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:49.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:50.080 align:middle line:90%
One.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.020 align:middle line:90%
What's this?

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:52.160 align:middle line:90%
Nate?

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:53.020 align:middle line:90%
What's this?

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:53.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Pickle.

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:55.170 align:middle line:90%
>> A pickle.

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:57.000 align:middle line:90%
