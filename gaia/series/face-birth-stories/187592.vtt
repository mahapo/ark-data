Had no choice.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.770 align:middle line:84%
Had to be born out here,
because it was raining

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.600 align:middle line:84%
and the roads were closed,
and the airstrip was closed.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.030 align:middle line:90%
And Thea delivered her.

was really bad and horrible.
