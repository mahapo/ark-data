>> Oh no, it just seems like you
don't really get to choose much

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.340 align:middle line:84%
if you have it in a hospital,
and the midwives or the nurses

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.930 align:middle line:90%
just come and go.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.240 align:middle line:90%
>> I want a boy and two girls.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.956 align:middle line:90%
>> You can't choose that.

00:00:23.956 --> 00:00:25.117 align:middle line:90%
>> I want one.

>> - [Woman] Blanche, where
would you have your babies?

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Home.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.320 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd have my babies
in the doctor's.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.428 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:36.428 --> 00:00:38.470 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, you hear
people preparing for birth,

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.970 align:middle line:84%
and they've got the aromatherapy
and all this sort of stuff.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.920 align:middle line:84%
Whereas for me, to be honest,
if there were 50 people there,

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.200 align:middle line:84%
so long as they were quiet,
right, and just gave me I

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.160 align:middle line:84%
suppose physical space,
I think I would be OK.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.150 align:middle line:84%
But people are really
different, like what they want

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.950 align:middle line:90%
and that thing.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.670 align:middle line:84%
I could have had-- like
aromatherapy shmoma-- you know,

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.753 align:middle line:84%
it wouldn't have made any
difference to me really.

00:01:02.753 --> 00:01:05.920 align:middle line:84%
Like it's just such
an animal thing.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.760 align:middle line:84%
We chose to live here because
Peter and I both needed

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.350 align:middle line:84%
to have studio space because we
both had art craft practices.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.770 align:middle line:84%
Peter's a sculptor, and I
had my shoe-making business.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And also we really
wanted to work and live

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.630 align:middle line:84%
in the same environment
because it just gives you

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.150 align:middle line:84%
that flexibility
of when you work

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.890 align:middle line:84%
and if you're really
going with something

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.010 align:middle line:90%
that you can keep going.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.130 align:middle line:84%
Always really, really talented
at what I did with my hands

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.460 align:middle line:84%
and to the point that my mom
bought me a sewing machine

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.798 align:middle line:84%
when I was eight years old
for my eighth birthday,

00:01:38.798 --> 00:01:40.840 align:middle line:84%
actually attempted to make
my first pair of shoes

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.920 align:middle line:90%
when I was about 16.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.350 align:middle line:84%
A complete disaster,
but I had a go--

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.460 align:middle line:84%
no teaching, nobody to tell
me what to do, just had a go.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.950 align:middle line:84%
People say, why don't
you do handbags or belts?

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's like I don't wake
up in the middle of the night

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.840 align:middle line:90%
thinking about handbags.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.888 align:middle line:84%
Shoes are just on my
radar all the time.

00:01:57.888 --> 00:01:58.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm always noticing them.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.848 align:middle line:84%
It's just something
I've just attuned to.

00:02:01.848 --> 00:02:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And because there's really only
one entrance to this building

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.400 align:middle line:84%
it just means that sometimes you
have people around for dinner,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.870 align:middle line:84%
they're leaving at 3
o'clock in the morning,

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.578 align:middle line:84%
and then they want to
look at your shoes.

00:02:09.578 --> 00:02:12.212 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, you
know, just go away.

00:02:12.212 --> 00:02:13.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm not interested, you know?

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.420 align:middle line:84%
Like no matter how passionate
you are about what you do,

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.253 align:middle line:84%
there are times when you really
want to be able to turn off.

00:02:20.253 --> 00:02:22.420 align:middle line:84%
When I was really young,
like when I was a teenager,

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.880 align:middle line:84%
I knew I wanted
to have children.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.740 align:middle line:84%
So any articles in the
paper that ever came up

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.500 align:middle line:90%
about birthing issues--

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.237 align:middle line:84%
I read every single
one, and I still do.

00:02:32.237 --> 00:02:33.570 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to be in hospital.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.770 align:middle line:90%
I didn't like hospitals.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.270 align:middle line:84%
I thought that
hospitals are where

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.562 align:middle line:90%
you go when you're really sick.

00:02:38.562 --> 00:02:40.390 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's a
sort of morbidness,

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.040 align:middle line:90%
morbidity about hospitals.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.400 align:middle line:84%
So I became pregnant,
and I finally

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.070 align:middle line:90%
found a list of midwives.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And I rang a few just
to arrange to meet them.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.320 align:middle line:90%
And then I had a miscarriage.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And I rang up to cancel
a couple of appointments,

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.278 align:middle line:84%
and one of them rang
me back that afternoon.

00:02:59.278 --> 00:03:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And she just got on
the phone and she

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.330 align:middle line:90%
said, are you all right?

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:03.130 align:middle line:90%
Are you OK?

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And it was the first person
who'd actually asked me that.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.708 align:middle line:84%
Like I'd gone through seeing
the doctors and everything,

00:03:08.708 --> 00:03:10.250 align:middle line:84%
and it was just like
you go in there,

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.375 align:middle line:90%
and it's this cold process.

00:03:11.375 --> 00:03:12.940 align:middle line:90%
And I was just--

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:13.840 align:middle line:90%
I was devastated.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.048 align:middle line:84%
And she just rang me up and
said, oh, you poor thing.

00:03:16.048 --> 00:03:18.820 align:middle line:84%
Are you OK, especially
given the fact

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.100 align:middle line:84%
you've gone through this
whole process of days

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.392 align:middle line:84%
and days of finding out people
and making appointments?

00:03:23.392 --> 00:03:27.220 align:middle line:84%
And she was just so incredibly
right for that situation

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.950 align:middle line:84%
that from there I just knew
that when I got pregnant again

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.490 align:middle line:90%
that I had to have her.

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.385 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you know where
you guys were born?

00:03:36.385 --> 00:03:38.320 align:middle line:90%
>> I was born there.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.120 align:middle line:90%
>> No--

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.953 align:middle line:90%
>> I was born there.

00:03:39.953 --> 00:03:41.210 align:middle line:90%
>> --not exactly, not exactly.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.200 align:middle line:84%
You were born right
where that cup of tea is.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.900 align:middle line:84%
>> I started having I suppose
what felt like little period

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.120 align:middle line:84%
pains during the day, but
I didn't think much of them

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.617 align:middle line:90%
because I was a few days early.

00:03:52.617 --> 00:03:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And then I think my dad came
round and had a cup of tea.

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And while he was there I
went down to the toilet,

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.650 align:middle line:84%
and my waters broke,
not a huge gush.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.710 align:middle line:84%
It must have been the
hind waters or something.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.085 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't say
anything to him.

00:04:04.085 --> 00:04:05.150 align:middle line:90%
I let him go.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And then I said to Peter,
well, my waters just broke.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.220 align:middle line:90%
And he just collapsed.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.240 align:middle line:84%
I got Peter to go out and
get DVDs and maybe some food

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.399 align:middle line:84%
and a bottle of
wine or something.

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And the minute he
stepped out of the door,

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.260 align:middle line:84%
the pains just started
coming quite strong

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.285 align:middle line:84%
so that when he came back
I was really in labor.

00:04:25.285 --> 00:04:27.590 align:middle line:90%
And so he rang the midwives.

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And they came, and I just
threw myself around a lot,

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.850 align:middle line:84%
like holding onto
the back of chairs

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.150 align:middle line:84%
and just throwing myself around
and being incredibly physical

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.460 align:middle line:90%
and really, really noisy.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.207 align:middle line:84%
And where we were living,
we had a 22-year-old--

00:04:46.207 --> 00:04:48.290 align:middle line:84%
he was just about to turn
22-year-old-- boy living

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:49.550 align:middle line:90%
downstairs.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.110 align:middle line:90%
And it was his birthday party.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And he'd arranged
to have his birthday

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.570 align:middle line:84%
party at the warehouse,
and being 22,

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.930 align:middle line:84%
hadn't even thought-- we'd told
him, look, Johanna's in labor.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.840 align:middle line:84%
But he hadn't thought to stick
a sign on the door saying,

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.860 align:middle line:84%
meet you at the
pub, or anything.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.730 align:middle line:84%
So as the labor progressed,
every now and again

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.090 align:middle line:84%
there'd be this awful
heavy metal music coming up

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.245 align:middle line:90%
from downstairs.

00:05:12.245 --> 00:05:15.220 align:middle line:84%
And we'd have to tell them
to go, just like, shut

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.688 align:middle line:90%
the fuck up, and make them go.

00:05:18.688 --> 00:05:21.230 align:middle line:84%
Somebody had to go downstairs
and tell them to turn the music

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.030 align:middle line:90%
down, turn the music down.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, lots of those
sort of moments of I

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.400 align:middle line:84%
don't want to do this
anymore and I can't, I

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.250 align:middle line:90%
can't do it anymore.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.850 align:middle line:90%
I can't do it anymore.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.267 align:middle line:84%
And Annie's going,
no, no, no, no.

00:05:31.267 --> 00:05:34.120 align:middle line:84%
No, no, that means your
baby's really close.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And there's also
that surreal moment

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.740 align:middle line:84%
where you're still going through
the throes of all these pains,

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.950 align:middle line:84%
but they're unwrapping things
and putting them on the floor,

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.460 align:middle line:90%
like your birthing--

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.270 align:middle line:84%
oh, I forget what they
call it, but where

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.470 align:middle line:84%
you've got a freshly
ironed clean sheet that's

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:49.850 align:middle line:90%
been wrapped up in brown paper.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:53.402 align:middle line:84%
And underneath that
you put an old shower

00:05:53.402 --> 00:05:54.860 align:middle line:84%
curtain or lots of
plastic, so it's

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.383 align:middle line:90%
like your little launch pad.

00:05:56.383 --> 00:05:58.550 align:middle line:84%
So they were unwrapping
everything, getting the nail

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.620 align:middle line:84%
brush out so they
can scrub their nails

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.340 align:middle line:90%
and do all that sort of stuff.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.530 align:middle line:84%
So there's this
thing of, oh, OK.

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.820 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
happening really soon.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:08.750 align:middle line:90%
But I'm still--

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.160 align:middle line:84%
I just don't feel
like I'm there.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.480 align:middle line:90%
And then I just--

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.100 align:middle line:84%
and then Peter held
me from behind,

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:18.110 align:middle line:84%
and I sort of squatted
down and pushed her out

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.130 align:middle line:84%
with a scream that I reckon must
have woken up the whole street.

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.120 align:middle line:84%
You feel like you're just being
opened up from right around,

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:25.920 align:middle line:90%
that sort of thing.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't think I had
a tiny tear, but nothing bad.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:29.857 align:middle line:84%
But especially getting
the first one out

00:06:29.857 --> 00:06:32.450 align:middle line:90%
is a pretty intense feeling.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, had this
little baby who came out

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.680 align:middle line:90%
with a squashed little nose.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:37.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, she cried.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.405 align:middle line:90%
And it's funny for the first--

00:06:39.405 --> 00:06:41.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, until
they're about four,

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:42.680 align:middle line:84%
every time they cry,
it's that little

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.180 align:middle line:90%
face that they're born with.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.960 align:middle line:84%
It's like they go back to that
absolute newborn baby face.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.870 align:middle line:84%
You can see that sort of
essence of what they were born

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:51.995 align:middle line:90%
like when they have a howl.

00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:57.380 align:middle line:90%


00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.810 align:middle line:84%
There were moments in
the labor where I'd just

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:01.027 align:middle line:90%
be really all over the place.

00:07:01.027 --> 00:07:03.110 align:middle line:84%
And Annie just came and
she looked me in the eyes.

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And she touched me in
the forehead like that,

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.240 align:middle line:84%
and she said center
yourself, Joanna.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.865 align:middle line:84%
And it would just be
the most amazing--

00:07:07.865 --> 00:07:09.560 align:middle line:84%
like nothing else
would be there.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Somehow my headspace was in
outer space or somewhere else,

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.110 align:middle line:84%
you know, this really
powerful thing.

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And most of the time Annie
sat there and knitted,

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:22.730 align:middle line:90%
just watching.

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:23.660 align:middle line:90%
So she was there.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:24.740 align:middle line:90%
She knew where I was at.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.850 align:middle line:84%
But she wasn't-- you know, she
was only really on with me when

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:32.405 align:middle line:84%
it was really obvious to her
that I needed somebody to come

00:07:32.405 --> 00:07:33.920 align:middle line:90%
and take charge.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:39.410 align:middle line:90%


00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:41.105 align:middle line:84%
When I was pregnant
with Anushka,

00:07:41.105 --> 00:07:42.980 align:middle line:84%
it turned out that I
wouldn't be able to have

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.590 align:middle line:84%
the same midwife that I'd had
for the first two children.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And that was really
hard for both of us.

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:49.970 align:middle line:84%
I know she felt really strongly
that she wanted to be there.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.250 align:middle line:84%
But she was moving
into state, and it just

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:53.810 align:middle line:84%
wasn't going to
be able to happen.

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And there was maybe
a period of, oh,

00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:00.740 align:middle line:84%
if I can't have Annie,
who am I going to have?

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And oh, maybe I should just
go to have it in hospital.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.120 align:middle line:90%
And honestly, I just can't.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.800 align:middle line:90%
It sort of entered my brain.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And as quickly as it
entered, it was like I just

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:10.400 align:middle line:90%
can't do it that way.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.780 align:middle line:90%
I just can't.

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:15.230 align:middle line:84%
Blanche, the middle child,
was a two-hour labor--

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:18.110 align:middle line:90%
really, really, really intense.

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:21.260 align:middle line:84%
I'd been having those on and
off Braxton Hicks contractions

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.770 align:middle line:90%
for maybe a couple of days even.

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:26.978 align:middle line:84%
And then with Anushka I
started getting Braxton Hicks

00:08:26.978 --> 00:08:28.895 align:middle line:84%
contractions at about
20 weeks, so it was just

00:08:28.895 --> 00:08:31.038 align:middle line:84%
almost this constant-- and
they were very regular,

00:08:31.038 --> 00:08:32.580 align:middle line:84%
and they would take
your breath away.

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.224 align:middle line:84%
So every now and again, even
from 32 weeks, I'd be thinking,

00:08:35.224 --> 00:08:37.490 align:middle line:84%
oh my god, I'm just
about to go into labor.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:40.760 align:middle line:84%
So I just kept working the
day that I was having Anushka.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And I'm having
these contractions,

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.510 align:middle line:84%
and they're sort of like Braxton
Hicks, Braxton Hicks, Braxton

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:45.310 align:middle line:90%
Hicks.

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:47.187 align:middle line:90%
And then I went, oh, hang on.

00:08:47.187 --> 00:08:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And I really wanted
to finish this job

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:51.140 align:middle line:84%
I was doing because I just knew
that if the glue got completely

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:52.473 align:middle line:90%
dry, everything would get stiff.

00:08:52.473 --> 00:08:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And it'd be very, very hard
to do three weeks later.

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.532 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh yeah,
maybe I'd better just

00:08:57.532 --> 00:08:59.490 align:middle line:84%
go do it in the house
and see what's happening.

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:02.032 align:middle line:84%
And then I went to the toilet
and had one of those huge shits

00:09:02.032 --> 00:09:04.730 align:middle line:84%
that you have before-- you
know when you just, like, boom.

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:06.920 align:middle line:84%
I think I came out
of the bathroom,

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.810 align:middle line:84%
and I had one really
big contraction.

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And I just said, oh my
god, if the rest of it's

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:11.620 align:middle line:84%
going to be like
this and I'm going

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:14.150 align:middle line:84%
to be doing this for two hours,
I don't think I can take it.

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:16.100 align:middle line:84%
Blanche, she was
jumping around the house

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.140 align:middle line:84%
because she was three,
three and a bit.

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.240 align:middle line:84%
She was playing crocodiles,
like jumping off

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.500 align:middle line:84%
from one bit of
furniture to the other

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:22.550 align:middle line:90%
so the crocodile didn't get you.

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:23.780 align:middle line:84%
And I had to say,
look, just stop it.

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:24.260 align:middle line:90%
Just stop it.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.480 align:middle line:84%
And she's going, why are
you taking your clothes off?

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And I was just taking
my clothes off, just

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:32.030 align:middle line:90%
instinctually doing this stuff.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And then I think
Peter came back,

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:37.580 align:middle line:84%
and he'd told all
the staff to go home.

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.830 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and he'd said, I'm
ringing her just to make sure

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:40.650 align:middle line:90%
she's coming in.

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:42.942 align:middle line:84%
And by that stage, I'm like,
oh my god, I want to push.

00:09:42.942 --> 00:09:43.880 align:middle line:90%
It was just so fast.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.400 align:middle line:84%
I had maybe like five of
those horrible, horrible

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.530 align:middle line:84%
contractions, like oh
my god, I want to push,

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:50.870 align:middle line:84%
and then as soon as I
got the pushing urge,

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:55.850 align:middle line:84%
the waters broke in a huge
big gush full of meconium.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:57.812 align:middle line:84%
And I said, oh there's
meconium in the waters.

00:09:57.812 --> 00:10:00.020 align:middle line:84%
And by this time, he was on
the phone to the midwife.

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:01.233 align:middle line:90%
And she had gotten--

00:10:01.233 --> 00:10:03.650 align:middle line:84%
it was like there's all these
one-way streets around here,

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:07.560 align:middle line:84%
so he had to direct
her how to get here.

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And so she just said, look,
put her on her hands and knees.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.350 align:middle line:84%
Put her bum up in the air,
and make her count backwards

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:16.825 align:middle line:90%
from 100 or something.

00:10:16.825 --> 00:10:18.200 align:middle line:84%
Just whatever,
just distract her.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.970 align:middle line:84%
She can't have the
baby until I get here.

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And she said go and have
Beatrice at the front door

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.400 align:middle line:90%
waiting for me.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I went up to get the midwife
from the door, and I thought--

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:30.410 align:middle line:84%
because mummy was
yelling so much,

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:33.170 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was like a
junkie out on the street.

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>> I was, like, counting,
ten, like screaming at the top

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:41.980 align:middle line:84%
of my voice, roaring
like a caged animal.

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:44.470 align:middle line:90%
She only just got here in time.

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:46.570 align:middle line:90%
And she ran down into the house.

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:47.740 align:middle line:90%
And I said, can I push?

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:48.640 align:middle line:90%
And she said, yes.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.410 align:middle line:84%
And I put my hand in,
and I pushed her out

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:51.250 align:middle line:90%
into my own hand.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:54.000 align:middle line:84%
I'd learned the hand
trick from having Blanche.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.130 align:middle line:84%
She just made sure that
there was no meconium

00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:58.450 align:middle line:90%
in any of her passages.

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And then Anushka
just looked around.

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:02.650 align:middle line:90%
And we're like oh, it's a girl.

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:04.810 align:middle line:84%
Because we were so sure
we're going to have a boy.

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And then she just looked
around and went to sleep.

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:21.000 align:middle line:90%
