00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.330 align:middle line:90%
>> I was over the moon--

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.310 align:middle line:90%
well over the moon.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.150 align:middle line:84%
And I think what
touched me the most was

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:21.050 align:middle line:84%
a photo we had of our daughters
Zalia, Sarah, and the baby.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And when I look at
their photo, I just

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.800 align:middle line:84%
think, wow, my partner
did it at home--

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.850 align:middle line:90%


00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.530 align:middle line:84%
all by herself,
just her and her CD.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Now the CD is, like,
a meditating CD,

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.030 align:middle line:90%
so she was fully focused.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.570 align:middle line:90%


00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.990 align:middle line:90%
>> So my name's Sarah.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm studying to be a midwife,
and I work part-time also.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.175 align:middle line:84%
I had Zalia when I was 19
and Tunil when I was 21.

00:00:56.175 --> 00:00:58.600 align:middle line:90%
Where are you going, Zalia?

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.360 align:middle line:84%
After I had witnessed
a home birth,

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.140 align:middle line:84%
I was pregnant with
Zalia and I had really

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.840 align:middle line:90%
wanted a home birth for Zalia.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.180 align:middle line:84%
At the time, the only
option that I had

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.990 align:middle line:84%
was to hire an independent
midwife to have a home birth,

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.800 align:middle line:84%
and that was not a financially
viable option for me.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.890 align:middle line:84%
So I was forced, therefore, to
have Zalia at the Family Birth

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:23.690 align:middle line:90%
Center.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.910 align:middle line:90%


00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.920 align:middle line:84%
At home, I felt like
I was coping OK.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And then when I got
to the hospital,

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.350 align:middle line:90%
I felt pretty out of control.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.690 align:middle line:84%
I was crying, and I just
didn't want to be there.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:38.680 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to go home.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And I just remember
feeling a massive relief

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.110 align:middle line:90%
when she was born.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.200 align:middle line:84%
Like, I was like,
thank god that is over.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And, like, I was
obviously ecstatic

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.070 align:middle line:84%
that I had this
little girl now, but I

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.710 align:middle line:90%
was kind of like thank god.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And I completely understood
why people use drugs and wanted

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.710 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of
interventions because I

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.760 align:middle line:90%
felt completely out of control.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.490 align:middle line:84%
When I became
pregnant with Tunil,

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.370 align:middle line:84%
I, again, desperately
wanted a home birth.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.400 align:middle line:84%
I had just learned about
the program at Casey,

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.770 align:middle line:90%
where they were--

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.060 align:middle line:84%
and Sunshine, that
were doing home births

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.590 align:middle line:84%
through the hospital, publicly
funded, which meant that that

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.570 align:middle line:90%
was something I could do.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.820 align:middle line:90%
And so I went for it.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.940 align:middle line:84%
Oh, When I told Koo that I
wanted to have a home birth,

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.130 align:middle line:90%
he was quite nervous.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.420 align:middle line:84%
>> I think I did try to talk her
out of it, come to think of it.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.150 align:middle line:84%
But I'm thinking, well, what
are you going to have at home?

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.900 align:middle line:84%
How are you going to bring
the hospital to home?

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, what pulled me
around was Sarah here

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.250 align:middle line:84%
is going to become a midwife,
so she's quite strong about it.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.320 align:middle line:84%
So I thought to myself,
I'm going to be there.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to support my partner.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.390 align:middle line:84%
She's dedicated to
her studies, and she's

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.160 align:middle line:84%
going to prove to herself and
myself that she can do it.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.330 align:middle line:84%
>> I wake up in the middle of
the night, about 1 o'clock.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.440 align:middle line:90%
And I was--

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.975 align:middle line:84%
I felt quite a lot
of pain in my back.

00:03:18.975 --> 00:03:20.890 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, mm.

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.340 align:middle line:84%
So I went to the toilet,
went back to sleep,

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.150 align:middle line:84%
and then I woke up again
about 10 minutes later.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
OK, I think we're

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.110 align:middle line:90%
going to have a baby tonight.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.000 align:middle line:84%
So I got up and I decided
to prepare the room

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.230 align:middle line:90%
how I wanted it set up.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.860 align:middle line:84%
So, like, I lit the
candles, the aroma therapy.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.080 align:middle line:84%
I was having
probably contractions

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.590 align:middle line:90%
about, like, every 10 minutes.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.940 align:middle line:84%
And then they started
to get more intense.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And I remember that I had
a moment of self-doubt,

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.120 align:middle line:84%
and I got really
scared all of a sudden.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.430 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, holy crap,
I'm having a baby at home.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.930 align:middle line:84%
Then I decided that I needed
to put the hypnobirthing CD on.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And, instantly, I just
was completely focused.

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.000 align:middle line:84%
Everything-- all
my panic stopped,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.500 align:middle line:84%
and I knew the
midwife was coming.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And then with the
hypnobirthing CD,

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.250 align:middle line:84%
I realized that I could cope
and I could control this.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.870 align:middle line:90%
I was just in the zone.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.880 align:middle line:84%
I was lying on my bed
kind of on my side

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.530 align:middle line:84%
with my leg propped
up with the pillow.

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't even have
to change my breathing.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.965 align:middle line:84%
And I know when people
talk about birth,

00:04:33.965 --> 00:04:35.340 align:middle line:84%
they're always
like, "Oh, you got

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.510 align:middle line:90%
to get your breathing right.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.370 align:middle line:84%
Make sure you do
your breathing."

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.200 align:middle line:90%
For me, I did not--

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.790 align:middle line:84%
all I did was deep breathe or
just normal, just breathing.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.830 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have to change it.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.250 align:middle line:90%
And I just-- I was so relaxed.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.360 align:middle line:90%
I almost fell asleep.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.980 align:middle line:90%
I remember waking up and--

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.710 align:middle line:84%
I think when you're in that
space between asleep and fully

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.480 align:middle line:84%
conscious and
you're kind of like,

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.840 align:middle line:84%
I can hear what's going on
but I'm so close to asleep

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.590 align:middle line:84%
that I'm not sure if
it's really happening

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.330 align:middle line:90%
or if I'm dreaming already--

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.940 align:middle line:84%
that's where I was in the
middle of contractions.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.360 align:middle line:90%
So I got in the shower.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And I remember I was doing
what I like to call my "birth

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.940 align:middle line:84%
dance," where I was
just swaying the hips,

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.700 align:middle line:90%
swinging from side to side.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.890 align:middle line:84%
And I just kept telling
myself that the pain is good,

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.020 align:middle line:84%
and that it means
that my baby's coming.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And so you just let
it wash over you.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.350 align:middle line:84%
And I remember telling myself
that just like the water was

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.720 align:middle line:84%
washing down the drain,
to let every contraction

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.330 align:middle line:84%
and all the pain just
wash down the drain.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.580 align:middle line:84%
The contractions had
started to pick up

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.620 align:middle line:90%
and were getting more intense.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And I was just lying
there with my eyes closed,

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.850 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't feel that I
had changed in any way.

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.880 align:middle line:84%
But I remember Kookoo
turning to the midwife

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.980 align:middle line:84%
and saying that the contractions
are getting stronger.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And I hadn't signaled or
verbalized that to him at all.

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.625 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, "Yes, they are."

00:06:02.625 --> 00:06:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And I was just so in awe
of how connected he was

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.450 align:middle line:84%
and how focused he was on
me and what was happening.

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:14.170 align:middle line:90%
And he knew what was going on.

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.470 align:middle line:90%
After that, I started pushing.

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:21.190 align:middle line:84%
My body was just
pushing this baby out.

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.560 align:middle line:90%
And the midwife ran and got--

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.470 align:middle line:84%
one of the midwives
got the mirror for me

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:30.170 align:middle line:84%
so I could see because
that is what I had wanted.

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:34.190 align:middle line:84%
And so I was watching
as this baby came out,

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.760 align:middle line:90%
that she was here, I did it.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
saying, "I did it.

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:41.998 align:middle line:90%
I did it."

00:06:41.998 --> 00:06:45.902 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:45.902 --> 00:06:51.270 align:middle line:90%


00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:55.800 align:middle line:84%
>> It was like watching your
footy team win the game.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.510 align:middle line:84%
And when the crowd
goes, "Yay," you

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.520 align:middle line:90%
just want to jump up for joy.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.690 align:middle line:90%
But it was like--

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:05.410 align:middle line:90%
it was nothing I could imagine.

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:09.340 align:middle line:84%
It was just seeing my
partner there and just

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.690 align:middle line:84%
watching you go
through the emotions.

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And because she was that
strong, I felt strong as well.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:17.910 align:middle line:84%
In tradition in New
Zealand, we have

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:20.910 align:middle line:90%
the placenta, the afterbirth.

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And what we do with it is that
we bury it into the ground.

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.440 align:middle line:84%
We receive the food
from the ground.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:33.240 align:middle line:84%
So by giving it respect, we
put a placenta in the ground--

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.400 align:middle line:90%
part of us.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, what we do when we
put it into the ground,

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:40.590 align:middle line:90%
we put a plant on top.

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:45.280 align:middle line:84%
With myself and my
family, we have trees.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.980 align:middle line:84%
And when the tree
goes up, it grows up

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.700 align:middle line:84%
to nourish, as the same
as the way you live.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.490 align:middle line:84%
When you grow up,
life is a battle,

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:55.880 align:middle line:90%
but you grow to nourish.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:00.000 align:middle line:90%
