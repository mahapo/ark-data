00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>> The vast majority of people
were just happy that we were

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:07.600 align:middle line:90%
having a baby.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.460 align:middle line:90%
But I did have some--

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.690 align:middle line:84%
a few isolated, two
in particular friends

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.180 align:middle line:90%
who were very judgmental.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And they were pretty
open about the fact

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.160 align:middle line:84%
that they thought
I was missing out,

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.285 align:middle line:84%
and that they felt sorry
for me that I wasn't going

00:00:23.285 --> 00:00:26.290 align:middle line:84%
to have a natural birth,
and that they had both had

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.820 align:middle line:90%
wonderful natural births.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.920 align:middle line:84%
There was just
consternation on their faces

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:36.110 align:middle line:84%
that I would choose to have a
cesarean when I didn't need to.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm Emma MacDonald.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And I am a press
gallery journalist

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.740 align:middle line:90%
for "The Canberra Times."

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.090 align:middle line:84%
I've been working in Parliament
for more than a decade now.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.160 align:middle line:90%
I love to write.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.890 align:middle line:84%
I love the actual process of
getting the words on paper.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.890 align:middle line:84%
You get to write about causes
that you think are important.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.530 align:middle line:84%
You get to keep an eye
on the political process.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.100 align:middle line:90%
You get to effect change.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.130 align:middle line:84%
It really is the
most tremendous job.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.010 align:middle line:90%


00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.560 align:middle line:84%
When I look back
now-- and I was one

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.520 align:middle line:84%
of those women who was intensely
focused on their career.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And I really wasn't
thinking about children.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And I never actually
sat down with my husband

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.390 align:middle line:90%
and made the decision.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.360 align:middle line:84%
Our beautiful son, Thomas,
was something of a surprise.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.080 align:middle line:84%
And I was never
in that headspace

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.700 align:middle line:84%
where I was keen
to have children.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.600 align:middle line:84%
But having said that, from
the moment I was pregnant,

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.680 align:middle line:84%
I was just so thrilled and
amazed at my own cleverness.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.260 align:middle line:84%
I had absolutely no
idea what to expect.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And while I tried to research,
one pregnant hormonal woman

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.400 align:middle line:84%
and the internet can sometimes
be a dangerous thing.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.610 align:middle line:84%
I feel we sort of lost
that link of having

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.440 align:middle line:84%
mothers and
grandmothers and sisters

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.650 align:middle line:84%
and the sort of
the extended family

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.118 align:middle line:90%
where we know about birth.

00:01:57.118 --> 00:01:59.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm one of those people
that's had private health

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.630 align:middle line:90%
insurance all my life.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.450 align:middle line:84%
And I knew as a matter
of course that I

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.850 align:middle line:90%
would go to a private hospital.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.100 align:middle line:84%
It was very important to
me that I have my own room.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.740 align:middle line:84%
It's just the sort
of person I am.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.140 align:middle line:84%
I guess I'm one of those
overly cautious people.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.050 align:middle line:84%
If there's a precaution that
I can take, I will take it.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And for me, childbirth
seemed such a profound thing

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.790 align:middle line:84%
I was certainly not
going to do anything

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.300 align:middle line:90%
that I wouldn't normally do.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.870 align:middle line:84%
But I also wanted to
give birth naturally.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.780 align:middle line:84%
Everything I'd read said that
was the best thing for the baby

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.090 align:middle line:84%
and the best thing for me and
the shortest recovery time.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.800 align:middle line:84%
The obstetrician that
I'd chosen and who

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.260 align:middle line:84%
I liked and had met
and formed a bond with,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.200 align:middle line:84%
he had some personal
tragedies in his life.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And I was doing a shared
care model with my GP.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.730 align:middle line:84%
Through unfortunate
circumstances,

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.610 align:middle line:84%
I missed several
appointments with him.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And I missed the
gestational diabetes test.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.240 align:middle line:84%
When I did the test and I
had the gestational diabetes,

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.410 align:middle line:84%
I felt that I needed
to find another doctor,

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.920 align:middle line:84%
because I felt quite
upset about that.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.320 align:middle line:84%
So that's when I met my new
doctor who I really liked.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:16.380 align:middle line:84%
So as the weeks progressed,
I had some quite sort

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.150 align:middle line:84%
of long appointments
with my obstetrician.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.160 align:middle line:90%
We talked about all the issues.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.490 align:middle line:84%
So I remember coming in
one day and saying, now,

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.930 align:middle line:84%
look, I would like
to give it a go,

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.190 align:middle line:84%
except if you don't think I've
got a 50/50 chance of getting

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.360 align:middle line:84%
through it, then I think maybe
we need to look at a cesarean,

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.780 align:middle line:84%
because the idea of a
really long hard labor

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.820 align:middle line:84%
to then have a
cesarean, I really

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.460 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to be
exhausted and hysterical

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.080 align:middle line:90%
by the time I gave birth.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.300 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to control
it as much as I could.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.510 align:middle line:84%
I was really hoping that he
would suggest that I have

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.250 align:middle line:90%
a cesarean, but he wouldn't.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.580 align:middle line:84%
He didn't make a
decision on my behalf.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, he wouldn't
inform my decision

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.680 align:middle line:90%
through his opinion.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.633 align:middle line:90%
He told me the information.

00:04:03.633 --> 00:04:04.800 align:middle line:90%
And he said it was up to me.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.660 align:middle line:84%
He said he would be there
whatever route I chose.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.640 align:middle line:84%
At 38 weeks, I went in
to see the obstetrician.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.290 align:middle line:90%
And I made the call.

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.680 align:middle line:90%
He said I could go then.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.829 align:middle line:84%
And I made the call that
I would have a cesar.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:28.550 align:middle line:84%
And we toddled off to hospital
and got organized in my room,

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.540 align:middle line:84%
and then had some checks,
and then went off to theater.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.990 align:middle line:84%
It was a brightly lit place,
lots of smiling people, busy.

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.260 align:middle line:84%
Exciting, I felt that
they were excited.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.790 align:middle line:90%
Lots of smiles.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.980 align:middle line:84%
It didn't feel
clinical in that sense.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.700 align:middle line:84%
Had a lovely pediatrician
there and my obstetrician.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.640 align:middle line:90%
And it was--

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.790 align:middle line:84%
I think the thing that struck
me was how quickly it was done.

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:58.220 align:middle line:90%
They just put a sheet up.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And they were telling me what
was going on the whole time.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And my husband and
I were holding hands

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.070 align:middle line:90%
and beaming expectantly.

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.920 align:middle line:90%
And then out came Thomas.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And it was just bizarre that
I had grown this little guy.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And he was exquisite
beyond words.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.060 align:middle line:90%
And he didn't cry.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.620 align:middle line:90%
He just looked at us.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.740 align:middle line:84%
And then he closed his
eyes, and we got a good look

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:28.610 align:middle line:90%
at his eyelashes.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And he had the longest
eyelashes I've ever seen.

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.590 align:middle line:90%
To this day, he still has them.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.780 align:middle line:90%
And we held him.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And it was just the best
thing I've ever done ever.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.880 align:middle line:90%
No job, no travel, no--

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.220 align:middle line:84%
nothing, nothing
even comes close.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.820 align:middle line:90%


00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.460 align:middle line:84%
I think I knew
from the minute I'd

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:01.250 align:middle line:84%
had the first cesarean that
I would choose it again.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.822 align:middle line:84%
I guess I felt secure because
I knew what would happen.

00:06:03.822 --> 00:06:05.780 align:middle line:84%
The thing is the second
time around, bizarrely,

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.650 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have
gestational diabetes.

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:12.380 align:middle line:84%
So it was a really
routine pregnancy,

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.930 align:middle line:84%
even though by the end I felt
a bit ready to give birth.

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.170 align:middle line:84%
I think I went in at
35 weeks and said,

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.660 align:middle line:84%
so I'm free this
afternoon, you know?

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:21.650 align:middle line:90%
What have you got on?

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And my obstetrician
just laughed and said,

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.990 align:middle line:84%
yeah, you all get to that point
where you're just exhausted.

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.850 align:middle line:84%
So he said, you've
got to hang on.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.160 align:middle line:84%
The second cesar
was a bit harder

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.190 align:middle line:84%
to bounce back from
than the first.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:40.070 align:middle line:84%
So I always-- when women
talk about birth, I'm honest

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.740 align:middle line:90%
and I say, it's a major surgery.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And you will not be jumping up
and down the first week or two.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:49.160 align:middle line:90%
But we had a beautiful daughter.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:54.020 align:middle line:84%
There was less of the magic and
the mystery of the first birth.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.650 align:middle line:84%
But there was also
the excitement

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:00.270 align:middle line:84%
of knowing that I had
another person to love.

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:01.985 align:middle line:90%
And she was just divine.

00:07:01.985 --> 00:07:04.810 align:middle line:90%


00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.160 align:middle line:84%
The thing I say to friends
when they get pregnant,

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.433 align:middle line:84%
I say, you're so lucky
you're about to fall in love.

00:07:11.433 --> 00:07:13.100 align:middle line:84%
They haven't met the
person that they're

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.200 align:middle line:84%
about to fall in
love with, but I

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.710 align:middle line:84%
know that they will fall in
love once that baby's out

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:20.560 align:middle line:90%
into the world.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:26.000 align:middle line:90%
