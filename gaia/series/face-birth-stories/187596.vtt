00:00:22.186 --> 00:00:25.380 align:middle line:84%
>> So I moved to the
UK five years ago.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'm an actress and
have set myself up there.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.040 align:middle line:84%
This is an unexpected
pregnancy, and it's a recession.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to be
doing this on my own.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.673 align:middle line:84%
So I have to decide
where I'm going to live,

00:00:39.673 --> 00:00:41.465 align:middle line:84%
whether I'm going to
come back to Australia

00:00:41.465 --> 00:00:43.250 align:middle line:84%
or where I'm going
to stay in the UK.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And a huge part of
that is working out

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.550 align:middle line:84%
where is it going to be
best place to be a mother.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.930 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm going to be a single
mother, which a lot of people

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.800 align:middle line:84%
are these days, so there's
a certain level of close

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.470 align:middle line:84%
emotional support that I won't
be getting from a partner that

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.480 align:middle line:84%
perhaps could come from
a friend or perhaps

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.200 align:middle line:90%
could come from a family member.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.193 align:middle line:84%
But that still they're
not going to be in my bed

00:01:12.193 --> 00:01:14.110 align:middle line:84%
every morning going
through every little shift

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.600 align:middle line:84%
and change with
my body and being

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.700 align:middle line:84%
intimate with the
pregnancy, so there's

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.480 align:middle line:84%
a lack of intimacy with
the pregnancy already.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And realizing actually
of one-on-one midwife who

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.990 align:middle line:84%
got really involved with
me and really involved

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.930 align:middle line:84%
with my pregnancy would somehow
provide me with that support.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.300 align:middle line:84%
So what I've
accepted is Australia

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.890 align:middle line:84%
to have the kind
of birth I want,

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.375 align:middle line:84%
the baby bonus will
go straight to that.

00:01:38.375 --> 00:01:39.175 align:middle line:90%
And that's--

00:01:39.175 --> 00:01:39.975 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:39.975 --> 00:01:44.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah or a birthing center or
something that's not attached

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.370 align:middle line:90%
to a hospital.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.620 align:middle line:84%
That's the Australian
option for me.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.450 align:middle line:84%
The K option is move
borough, take a loan

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.300 align:middle line:84%
for 2,500 pounds out,
and slowly pay off

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.660 align:middle line:84%
over the next couple of years
to have a midwife that I get

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.160 align:middle line:90%
to know, or risk the system.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.930 align:middle line:90%


00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.510 align:middle line:84%
I decided because I thought
London middle of winter

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.639 align:middle line:84%
small baby, not much extended
family, not a good idea.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:14.830 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't make the decision
based on what sort of birth

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.190 align:middle line:90%
experience I could have.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.110 align:middle line:84%
I based it on what was
going to happen after.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.118 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing I did
was went to a GP and said,

00:02:22.118 --> 00:02:24.160 align:middle line:84%
look, I've had this great
experience with the NHS

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.950 align:middle line:84%
and I was planning on a home
birth, and she went, oh,

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.700 align:middle line:84%
[deep breath] you're going
to have a bit of trouble.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.800 align:middle line:90%
It's not like that here.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.650 align:middle line:84%
So she-- and I said,
oh, well, what do I do?

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.858 align:middle line:90%
Where do you recommend me to?

00:02:35.858 --> 00:02:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And she said, look, call this
hospital and see what they say.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And I called and said, look,
do you have a birthing center

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.340 align:middle line:90%
or what's the deal.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.705 align:middle line:84%
And I'm 25, six weeks
pregnant, and I've

00:02:47.705 --> 00:02:48.830 align:middle line:90%
been in the English system.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:49.747 align:middle line:90%
I need to come across.

00:02:49.747 --> 00:02:51.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm an Australian.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.570 align:middle line:84%
Firstly, the fact that I was
this front in the pregnancy,

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.070 align:middle line:84%
I got all sorts of
negativity at me,

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.950 align:middle line:84%
and, oh, there won't
be room in there.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.030 align:middle line:84%
But I was also told that I
couldn't register with them

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.240 align:middle line:84%
until I was in the--
living in that area,

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.812 align:middle line:84%
that I would have to go
to Monash or Box Hill.

00:03:09.812 --> 00:03:11.020 align:middle line:90%
And I said but I'm going to--

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.150 align:middle line:84%
I think I'll be living
around St. Kilda.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.650 align:middle line:84%
She said, well,
that doesn't matter.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.442 align:middle line:84%
And I said but what if
I move to St. Kilda?

00:03:16.442 --> 00:03:17.950 align:middle line:90%
Can I then come with you guys?

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:18.790 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.082 align:middle line:90%
I said so I'm moving St. Kilda.

00:03:20.082 --> 00:03:22.965 align:middle line:84%
You're going to make me drive
to Monash to have this baby even

00:03:22.965 --> 00:03:24.340 align:middle line:84%
though that's a
really long drive

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.882 align:middle line:84%
and doesn't make me
feel safe at all.

00:03:25.882 --> 00:03:28.580 align:middle line:84%
She said, well,
that's just how it is.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.557 align:middle line:84%
So the whole approach
in the NHS is

00:03:30.557 --> 00:03:32.890 align:middle line:84%
that you choose between a
home birth, a birthing center,

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.150 align:middle line:90%
or a hospital.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.790 align:middle line:90%
It's in the big book you get.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.600 align:middle line:84%
It's what midwives
say whatever you want,

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.300 align:middle line:90%
your GP says it's no problem.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.118 align:middle line:84%
And you go online, and you can
look up any hospital on the NHS

00:03:44.118 --> 00:03:45.910 align:middle line:84%
system-- they all have
their own websites--

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.670 align:middle line:84%
and it will give you their rates
for how many women have home

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.580 align:middle line:84%
births and how many
transfer or not

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.347 align:middle line:84%
and how many women are
in birthing centers

00:03:53.347 --> 00:03:55.180 align:middle line:84%
and how many women are
in hospital and cesar

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.220 align:middle line:90%
rates and natural birth rates.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And you can look
and go, oh, wow,

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.430 align:middle line:84%
this hospital has a really,
really high cesar rate.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.250 align:middle line:84%
Lots of people end
up having cesareans.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.250 align:middle line:90%
I don't know about that.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.230 align:middle line:90%
What this one has--

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.030 align:middle line:90%
looks better.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.113 align:middle line:84%
Well, I tried to find this
stuff out in Australia,

00:04:09.113 --> 00:04:12.180 align:middle line:84%
and it was like the butler
was asking to sit at table.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.440 align:middle line:84%
It was like I was being
asked for secret files

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.269 align:middle line:84%
and how dare I ask
things like that.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And they're not statistics,
that would be available to you

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:28.990 align:middle line:84%
and realizing this terrible
kind of authoritarian attitude

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.220 align:middle line:84%
from the medical
establishment towards women.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.217 align:middle line:84%
And it's so permeated
through everything.

00:04:34.217 --> 00:04:35.800 align:middle line:84%
I looked into a
private midwife, but I

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.180 align:middle line:84%
did know that there were
about $5,000 to $6,000.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And because of my situation,
that was a lot of money.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And as lots of people
said, it's a lot of money,

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.010 align:middle line:84%
and you might end up
in hospital anyway.

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.400 align:middle line:84%
So I'm living with this
friend and Yarraville,

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.550 align:middle line:84%
and she's going to be my birth
partner along with the father.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And you'd mentioned that there
was this home birth pilot

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.720 align:middle line:90%
program in Sunshine.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.197 align:middle line:84%
So I got in touch with
him and it is on Medicare

00:04:59.197 --> 00:05:00.280 align:middle line:90%
and they're all fantastic.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:06.000 align:middle line:84%
So I can actually have the baby
in this house, which is great.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.130 align:middle line:84%
It's still terrifying, but
I just wanted that choice.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.570 align:middle line:84%
This is a really
important moment,

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.210 align:middle line:84%
and I do think the
more relaxed I am,

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.120 align:middle line:84%
the easier it's
going to be to labor.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And just the fact
that I've got it

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.530 align:middle line:84%
means that if my midwife in
a couple of weeks says, look,

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.030 align:middle line:84%
you've really going to have to
have this in hospital because

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.020 align:middle line:84%
of x, it'll be like,
oh, OK, what a shame.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to get that, but
I did have the chance to do it.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.347 align:middle line:90%


00:05:37.347 --> 00:05:41.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And we always meet together
at around 36 weeks for a birth

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.420 align:middle line:84%
plan meeting, and that's a big
meeting where anybody who is

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.790 align:middle line:84%
going to be at the
birth is invited.

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:51.290 align:middle line:84%
They have a chance to
air any concerns, wishes.

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:52.780 align:middle line:90%
We go through the what ifs.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:53.750 align:middle line:90%
They get to know us.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.910 align:middle line:84%
We usually-- it usually
takes an hour or two.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.380 align:middle line:90%
It's very labor relaxed.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.710 align:middle line:84%
Some of it's practical about
where things are going to be.

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.780 align:middle line:84%
Where people envisage
they may labor,

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.300 align:middle line:84%
we might give a
little hint and say

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.240 align:middle line:84%
that seems like a good idea,
but have you thought about this?

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.660 align:middle line:84%
>> So, Louisa, how do you feel
about being the chosen one?

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.306 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:14.306 --> 00:06:18.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Amanda asked me if she
could give birth to her baby

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.876 align:middle line:90%
on my piano in the front room.

00:06:22.876 --> 00:06:26.270 align:middle line:90%
Said, yeah, 'course, you can.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:27.140 align:middle line:90%
Well, it feels good.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm growing into it.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.530 align:middle line:84%
When Amanda first
asked me, I thought--

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.070 align:middle line:90%
I asked her what does that mean.

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.230 align:middle line:90%
What do I do?

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:43.450 align:middle line:84%
But it's exciting, and I
think the really great thing

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:47.070 align:middle line:84%
about this midwife
who's an amazing woman

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:48.630 align:middle line:84%
is that she's coming
over and we're

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:53.400 align:middle line:84%
doing this program with her
to get ready for the birth

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.970 align:middle line:84%
and just forming this
relationship with her

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:59.730 align:middle line:90%
and hearing her stories and--

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:05.102 align:middle line:84%
>> Any feeling
apprehensive at all or--

00:07:05.102 --> 00:07:06.720 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I'm not--

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.280 align:middle line:90%
not really, no.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.770 align:middle line:84%
I grew up on a farm, and I feel
like my farm girl will kick in

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:12.645 align:middle line:90%
help me out.

00:07:12.645 --> 00:07:17.301 align:middle line:90%
I saw lots of calves being born.

00:07:17.301 --> 00:07:20.160 align:middle line:90%
I know it's different from that.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.760 align:middle line:84%
But this-- there's something--
what Amanda was saying before

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.590 align:middle line:84%
about it being a
body experience,

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:27.520 align:middle line:84%
and this midwife is
talking about that.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.030 align:middle line:90%
It makes so much sense.

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:34.040 align:middle line:84%
She's talking about the body
knows what to do in birth.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.290 align:middle line:84%
>> It is like making a
piece of theater working out

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:42.750 align:middle line:84%
your [INAUDIBLE] and what
I realized was that--

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:49.350 align:middle line:84%
to have a very, very close
female partner in this

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:51.870 align:middle line:84%
because of the whole thing of
this being women's business

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:54.493 align:middle line:84%
in any sense was
really important.

00:07:54.493 --> 00:07:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And also, of course,
the father being on

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.770 align:middle line:84%
was really important
and a midwife

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:00.910 align:middle line:84%
that I feel really,
really comfortable with,

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:03.480 align:middle line:84%
which is coming out of a
continuous relationship

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.520 align:middle line:90%
with one midwife.

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.520 align:middle line:84%
But now I feel a little
bit like team leader where

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.800 align:middle line:84%
I have to make sure everyone's
on board emotionally.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.090 align:middle line:90%
Everyone feels good.

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:15.000 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's got the
skills they need.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- we're going to
be a little team and that

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:24.300 align:middle line:84%
they're prepared for the fact
that I'm going to such a deep

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.780 align:middle line:84%
space that I'm not going to
be able to manage them at any

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:27.580 align:middle line:90%
level.

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:28.955 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going
to-- they're going

00:08:28.955 --> 00:08:32.939 align:middle line:84%
to have to follow me as
I go into that space.

00:08:32.939 --> 00:08:35.569 align:middle line:84%
>> She's taken a lot
of paddle pops though.

00:08:35.569 --> 00:08:40.120 align:middle line:84%
>> That's recent, my
rediscovery of paddle pops.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.331 align:middle line:84%
And that's very important
to the birth plan.

00:08:43.331 --> 00:08:44.450 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:45.491 align:middle line:90%
They're great.

00:08:45.491 --> 00:08:46.291 align:middle line:90%
[SINGING]

00:08:46.291 --> 00:08:49.339 align:middle line:90%
[BABY BABBLING]

00:08:49.339 --> 00:08:51.744 align:middle line:90%
>> She's singing back.

00:08:51.744 --> 00:08:59.650 align:middle line:84%
>> (SINGING) You are my
sunshine, my only sunshine.

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:02.990 align:middle line:90%
>> My birth was fantastic.

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And for a home birth,
I ended up in hospital.

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:07.690 align:middle line:90%
It had been quite long.

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:13.550 align:middle line:84%
It had been 20 hours, and she
was very happy still, Clara.

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:17.500 align:middle line:84%
The midwives came with me and
they were with me in the room

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.350 align:middle line:84%
and they helped me once I got
there with my birth partners

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:23.240 align:middle line:84%
make decisions and decide
what we're going to do,

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.350 align:middle line:84%
which was fantastic
because it just did feel

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:28.630 align:middle line:90%
like another stage in labor.

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:31.450 align:middle line:84%
It just felt like the
whole thing was now moving,

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:34.210 align:middle line:84%
and they knew how
exhausted I was.

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:35.890 align:middle line:84%
They knew the
rhythm of my labor.

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:37.330 align:middle line:84%
They knew what had
been happening.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:40.360 align:middle line:84%
They knew how my birth partners
had been dealing with it

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.960 align:middle line:84%
and watching their
ebbs and flows.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.550 align:middle line:90%
So we felt really contained.

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:46.307 align:middle line:84%
And the obstetrician was great
because he basically came in,

00:09:46.307 --> 00:09:47.890 align:middle line:84%
and the first thing
he said was you've

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:51.760 align:middle line:84%
done all the work,
which was great

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.640 align:middle line:84%
because he had the attitude of,
oh, dear another terrible home

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:59.620 align:middle line:84%
birth person, it would have
been really demoralizing

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:01.210 align:middle line:90%
for all of us actually.

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:03.040 align:middle line:84%
The great thing
about my midwives

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.140 align:middle line:84%
and transferring the
continuity of care

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:09.860 align:middle line:84%
was they knew how much I didn't
want to Cesarean, for example.

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And so we got to
the hospital I was

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:13.900 align:middle line:90%
able to have a natural birth.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.000 align:middle line:90%
And that meant a lot to me.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.950 align:middle line:84%
I was, of course, at
that stage I didn't care.

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:19.840 align:middle line:84%
The baby's well-being
is the first thing,

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.510 align:middle line:84%
but actually on reflection, it
was with all the prep I'd done

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:26.360 align:middle line:84%
and whatever, it was great to
be able to do that and that they

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.160 align:middle line:90%
made that call.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.360 align:middle line:90%


00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:35.602 align:middle line:84%
It's an intensely private and
personal experience, deeply so.

00:10:35.602 --> 00:10:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And my midwife said to
me after said, oh, women

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.800 align:middle line:84%
will spend years
processing the birth story

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.910 align:middle line:84%
and remembering little hints
and remembering little things.

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And I can remember
midway through

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.970 align:middle line:84%
where you have all
those endorphins to help

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:51.000 align:middle line:84%
me get through the
contractions looking out

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.133 align:middle line:84%
the window at the garden at
Louise's and another point

00:10:54.133 --> 00:10:56.550 align:middle line:84%
where they have me climbing
steps to see if they could get

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:59.490 align:middle line:90%
a head in a better position.

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And all these things will
stay with me my whole life.

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that they were
in a home that I care about,

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:09.480 align:middle line:84%
that that was the setting, that
I was looking at the garden,

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:14.190 align:middle line:84%
that I did see the dusk go
down, and I did see the sunrise,

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:20.090 align:middle line:84%
it's really important for me
and my memories of my birth.

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:24.050 align:middle line:84%
It does feel like a whole
new journey started,

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:26.960 align:middle line:84%
and it very much
feels like you start

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.860 align:middle line:84%
the birth-- you start
your labor as one person

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.070 align:middle line:90%
and you finish as another.

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:39.000 align:middle line:90%
