>> Once you step into
the hospital system,

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.770 align:middle line:84%
you take off your clothes,
and you're given a gown.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, I
really felt like I'd

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.093 align:middle line:84%
handed over my decision-making
to the people who

00:00:17.093 --> 00:00:18.010 align:middle line:90%
were looking after me.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.770 align:middle line:90%


00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.350 align:middle line:84%
I would describe myself
firstly as a mother

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.440 align:middle line:84%
because my family's
so important to me.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.410 align:middle line:84%
Part of the reason
that we wanted

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.790 align:middle line:84%
to live somewhere
like Mallacoota

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.650 align:middle line:90%
is that it's a small town.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.520 align:middle line:84%
All of my training
was really aimed

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.430 align:middle line:84%
at being a GP in the Bush, and
so the more remote, the better.

>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.500 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was pregnant
with my first pregnancy,

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.950 align:middle line:84%
when around about her due
date, I developed preeclampsia,

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.320 align:middle line:84%
my obstetrician called
me and said, you know,

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.203 align:middle line:84%
you probably need to
come in for an induction.

00:01:01.203 --> 00:01:02.370 align:middle line:90%
So I went into the hospital.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And I was induced with
a syntocinon drip.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.870 align:middle line:84%
And so I went from not
being in labor, feeling

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.730 align:middle line:84%
very fit and healthy,
to having a drip that

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.450 align:middle line:84%
started my contractions so that
I was having five contractions

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.450 align:middle line:84%
every 10 minutes, probably
within the first half hour.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.060 align:middle line:84%
So it started-- everything
started pretty suddenly.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.020 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, with a CTG monitor
on so I couldn't really move.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.240 align:middle line:84%
So I was standing
there in a lot of pain,

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.930 align:middle line:84%
without really any
build-up, you know,

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.480 align:middle line:84%
those natural hormones
and endorphins

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.960 align:middle line:84%
that allow you to kind of
cope with what's happening.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.810 align:middle line:84%
So that went on
for quite a while.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.770 align:middle line:84%
I was feeling pretty much like
I just didn't want to be there.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And at one point,
when I'd gotten

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.040 align:middle line:84%
to a state where I felt that
I could just keep going,

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.850 align:middle line:84%
the midwife bent down and
said to me, you're too tired.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.750 align:middle line:90%
You can't do this.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, well, that
was kind of in my mind then--

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.270 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't going to
be able to do it.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.540 align:middle line:90%
And then I really let go.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.500 align:middle line:90%
I had an epidural.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.315 align:middle line:90%
And things continued on OK.

00:02:15.315 --> 00:02:18.510 align:middle line:90%


00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.760 align:middle line:90%
And then my cervix got--

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.500 align:middle line:84%
I got what's called
an anterior lip,

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.480 align:middle line:84%
so a little bit
of my cervix just

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.340 align:middle line:90%
decided to stay in the way.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.320 align:middle line:84%
So even though the baby's
head was moving down,

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.080 align:middle line:84%
my cervix just
decided to get stuck.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, the
obstetric registrar,

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.400 align:middle line:84%
who had been working for
the last nearly 24 hours

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.890 align:middle line:90%
on his shift, came in and said--

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.630 align:middle line:84%
mumbled something about
it was taking too long.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.190 align:middle line:84%
He did a vaginal examination,
which he didn't really

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.990 align:middle line:90%
explain to me.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.460 align:middle line:84%
And I realize now that,
actually, he was probably

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.230 align:middle line:84%
feeling my cervix and thinking
about trying to push it back,

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.046 align:middle line:84%
but hadn't actually said that
that's what he was doing.

00:03:04.046 --> 00:03:05.880 align:middle line:84%
You know, I trusted
them to, I guess,

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.830 align:middle line:84%
make the right decisions
for me and also

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.250 align:middle line:84%
to give me the right
information as well.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.290 align:middle line:84%
So when the obstetric
registrar said

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.720 align:middle line:84%
that he'd seen some fetal
distress on that CTG monitor,

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.675 align:middle line:84%
I know immediately agreed
to having a Cesarean.

00:03:22.675 --> 00:03:37.430 align:middle line:90%


00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's been--
afterwards, I actually

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.010 align:middle line:84%
found out that the CTG
was actually normal,

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.480 align:middle line:84%
and there wasn't
any fetal distress.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.650 align:middle line:84%
Matilda was born very
healthy and robust,

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.400 align:middle line:90%
and certainly looked very well.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And then I was
faced with, I guess,

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.640 align:middle line:84%
recovering from a
Cesarean section, which

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.940 align:middle line:90%
was quite a shock to me.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.060 align:middle line:84%
I'd looked after people
post-operatively,

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.260 align:middle line:84%
and had looked after women who'd
had Cesareans, and given them

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.100 align:middle line:90%
the usual advice.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.780 align:middle line:84%
But I really wasn't
aware how long

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.580 align:middle line:84%
it was going to
take me to really--

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.149 align:middle line:84%
to be out of pain,
and to also be

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:21.230 align:middle line:84%
able to do normal
activities around the house.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.060 align:middle line:90%
So that was quite a shock.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.420 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, that's kind
of colored my view

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.400 align:middle line:90%
of how obstetric care is given.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.980 align:middle line:90%


00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.420 align:middle line:90%
I know he was tired.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.790 align:middle line:84%
He was just about to
get off his shift.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And he needed me ready for
my Cesarean at 8 o'clock

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.060 align:middle line:84%
in the morning, which was
when it was performed.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.392 align:middle line:84%
We actually ended up with the
placenta after the Cesarean,

00:04:49.392 --> 00:04:50.850 align:middle line:84%
which my husband
and my best friend

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.475 align:middle line:84%
took home while I
was still in hospital

00:04:52.475 --> 00:04:56.070 align:middle line:84%
with a six-pack of
beer on the top of it.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.970 align:middle line:90%
And it ended up in the freezer.

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.300 align:middle line:84%
And when Matilda was
about one year old,

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.290 align:middle line:90%
we buried it together.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.210 align:middle line:90%
And because it's--

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.460 align:middle line:84%
I guess the placenta really
represents that connection

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.580 align:middle line:90%
that you have with your baby.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.110 align:middle line:84%
So I felt that I really needed
that healing and that time--

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.440 align:middle line:84%
to acknowledge that time, I
guess, when Matilda was born,

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.680 align:middle line:84%
and we kind of became
two from one, so--

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:27.990 align:middle line:90%


00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.870 align:middle line:84%
After I'd had Matilda, my
obstetrician said to me,

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.470 align:middle line:84%
you would be able to have
a bigger baby naturally.

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And that was because her head
had actually moved quite a way

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.320 align:middle line:90%
down my pelvis.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.120 align:middle line:84%
It's generally accepted that
attempting a vaginal birth

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.060 align:middle line:84%
after Cesarean is considered
the safest option.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.820 align:middle line:84%
We started looking for
ways about how to achieve

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.500 align:middle line:90%
that in the hospital system.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.030 align:middle line:84%
So my first experience
was the obstetrician

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.130 align:middle line:84%
that I met at my
first appointment, who

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:04.350 align:middle line:84%
had said to me, we'll give it a
go, but it probably won't work.

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:07.560 align:middle line:90%
And that was a bit of a blow.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And we'd already decided that
we needed a private midwife

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.400 align:middle line:90%
for support during the process.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And our initial
meeting, it was almost

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.220 align:middle line:84%
like a battle plan for how I
was going to escape the knives,

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.820 align:middle line:84%
basically how I was going
to avoid having a Cesarean

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:29.760 align:middle line:84%
section, anticipating every
move of the obstetric team,

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:35.220 align:middle line:84%
and working out how we could
say stop, no, you know,

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.890 align:middle line:84%
we've made a choice not
to have CTG monitoring

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:41.700 align:middle line:84%
or not to be induced
at this time.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And so I was treated as
a high-risk pregnancy

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:47.468 align:middle line:84%
with having had a
previous Cesarean

00:06:47.468 --> 00:06:48.510 align:middle line:90%
and gestational diabetes.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:52.110 align:middle line:90%


00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.570 align:middle line:84%
And I could see that it was
getting more and more difficult

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:56.220 align:middle line:84%
for me to achieve
a vaginal delivery,

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:00.060 align:middle line:84%
despite the fact that I knew
that it was going to be safe

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.310 align:middle line:90%
and that it was important to us.

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:05.040 align:middle line:84%
After we had a bit more
information about home birth,

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.670 align:middle line:84%
we realized that that was
going to be the safest option.

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:13.440 align:middle line:84%
So I met two wonderful
midwives, Helen and Jenny.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And my first visit with
both of them was at least,

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:23.820 align:middle line:84%
I think, two or three
hours consultation.

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.790 align:middle line:90%
And we had a lot to catch up on.

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:30.840 align:middle line:84%
I was already 36, 37 weeks
pregnant when I met them.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.790 align:middle line:84%
My term, my due
date came and went.

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And a week later,
I'm still pregnant.

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:39.240 align:middle line:84%
All my friends, all
my medical friends

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:43.703 align:middle line:84%
were saying, how long is the
obstetrician letting you go?

00:07:43.703 --> 00:07:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, my
obstetrician hasn't really said

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:48.880 align:middle line:84%
much because I wasn't
seeing them anymore.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And it was at that time
that I learned to really

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:56.040 align:middle line:84%
become very aware of
my body and very aware

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.240 align:middle line:90%
of what the baby was doing.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:03.960 align:middle line:84%
And I knew I had a very
active, healthy baby that

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:04.950 align:middle line:90%
was waiting to be born.

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:07.970 align:middle line:90%


00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:09.920 align:middle line:84%
When I went into
labor, the midwives

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.210 align:middle line:90%
were there straightaway.

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:15.310 align:middle line:84%
I was able to use the birth
pool, which was amazing.

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:18.470 align:middle line:84%
I did some relaxation in between
my contractions in the birth

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:21.110 align:middle line:84%
pool and was probably
the most relaxed

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:23.840 align:middle line:84%
I've ever been in
my life in that time

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.030 align:middle line:84%
and in such a good
space mentally

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:30.770 align:middle line:84%
to be able to, I guess, make
it through a labor, which did

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:33.799 align:middle line:90%
become a little bit difficult.

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:39.530 align:middle line:84%
My cervix did the same thing as
it did with my first delivery.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:44.253 align:middle line:84%
And I had this little
anterior lip that got stuck.

00:08:44.253 --> 00:08:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't have an
epidural this time,

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.070 align:middle line:84%
so I could feel the
baby moving down.

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that my uterus was
doing the right thing by moving

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:54.200 align:middle line:90%
my baby down my pelvis.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And I could feel
that there was room.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.730 align:middle line:84%
But this lip just
got in the way.

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And so we did a lot of things
to try and get it moving.

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:06.050 align:middle line:84%
I had worked up lots
of sets of stairs.

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, Helen was able
to push that part of the cervix

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:17.586 align:middle line:84%
back, and I was able to
deliver my baby naturally.

00:09:17.586 --> 00:09:24.040 align:middle line:90%


00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.520 align:middle line:84%
And little Hugo was
healthy and happy,

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.760 align:middle line:84%
and started breastfeeding
straightaway.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.270 align:middle line:84%
Probably about an hour
after his delivery,

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:37.840 align:middle line:84%
I noticed that he'd gone from
being pink back to blue again.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And I called out to the
midwives, who were helping out.

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And he'd actually stopped
breathing at that point.

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:51.060 align:middle line:84%
The midwives, in about
three seconds flat,

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:54.690 align:middle line:84%
had him on oxygen, and gave
him a couple of breaths,

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:57.810 align:middle line:90%
and got him breathing again.

00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:01.710 align:middle line:84%
So that was pretty
scary, but they

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:05.695 align:middle line:84%
were able to manage it
completely appropriately.

00:10:05.695 --> 00:10:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And he just needed
a bit of stimulation

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.030 align:middle line:84%
to remind him to
keep breathing again.

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:13.190 align:middle line:90%


00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:15.640 align:middle line:90%
And I don't--

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:19.080 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, that
experience hasn't

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.000 align:middle line:84%
made me feel less safe
in that environment

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.310 align:middle line:84%
because the midwives were
fully equipped with oxygen

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:30.810 align:middle line:84%
and could do basic
resuscitation if they needed to.

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:34.770 align:middle line:84%
I had literally been waiting
four years to push out a baby.

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:39.502 align:middle line:84%
And so when the
midwife said, you

00:10:39.502 --> 00:10:41.460 align:middle line:84%
know, Sara, you need to
push this baby out now,

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:42.630 align:middle line:90%
I just did it.

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:43.650 align:middle line:90%
And it felt--

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:45.450 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:46.950 align:middle line:90%
--just great.

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:50.300 align:middle line:90%
