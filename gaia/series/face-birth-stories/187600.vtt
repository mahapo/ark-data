00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.280 align:middle line:84%
>> I think there's a perception
that only strong women have

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.240 align:middle line:84%
home births, which I find
extraordinary because I think

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.410 align:middle line:90%
all women are strong.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.910 align:middle line:84%
You totally understand that it
doesn't matter whether you're

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.827 align:middle line:84%
a woman giving birth out
in a field or a woman

00:00:16.827 --> 00:00:19.800 align:middle line:84%
giving birth in a
multi-scrillion dollar mansion

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.790 align:middle line:84%
home birth, you're just
a woman giving birth.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's the most humbling
and yet humanizing

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.930 align:middle line:84%
thing that you could
ever experience.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.600 align:middle line:84%
I've had two home births,
one in 1988 and one in 1994,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.220 align:middle line:90%
Charlie and William.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.810 align:middle line:84%
First one was when I was 35, and
the second one when I was 40.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.360 align:middle line:84%
The reason I chose
the home births

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.680 align:middle line:84%
was because I had
heard so many horror

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.510 align:middle line:84%
stories about people's
intervention in their births

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:56.650 align:middle line:90%
in hospitals.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.270 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to be in control
of things as best I could.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.269 align:middle line:84%
Not understanding then
that you're not in control

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.052 align:middle line:84%
in the sense that
you're just a vessel

00:01:06.052 --> 00:01:07.510 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to
happen, whatever,

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.790 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't want to hand
over my births, my children's

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:13.720 align:middle line:90%
births.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.670 align:middle line:84%
And I also didn't want to have
everybody go home at the end

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.230 align:middle line:90%
and leave me there.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.080 align:middle line:84%
I wanted the creation
of the family

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.360 align:middle line:90%
to start right there and Then

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.120 align:middle line:84%
With both births, I didn't
do much visiting of doctors.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.110 align:middle line:84%
I went to a doctor for
confirmation of the pregnancy

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.710 align:middle line:84%
and expressed my desire to
have a home birth and sort

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.440 align:middle line:84%
out my midwife Maggie
Lecky Thompson,

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.160 align:middle line:84%
and I saw her monthly and then
weekly in the last few weeks.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And I felt so loved and
embraced and empowered by her.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.420 align:middle line:90%
She filled me with confidence.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.800 align:middle line:84%
She was absolutely a
realist, but she just

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.350 align:middle line:90%
made me feel completely capable.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.199 align:middle line:84%
So there was
absolutely nothing that

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:13.410 align:middle line:84%
made me feel I couldn't
trust this woman with me,

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.830 align:middle line:90%
my life, and my baby's life.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.680 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's birth has the
capacity to go horribly wrong,

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.910 align:middle line:84%
but it also has the capacity
to go absolutely wonderfully.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.640 align:middle line:84%
Charlie was due on
the 13th of January.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:35.830 align:middle line:84%
On the 1st of January, a friend
of mine, she's kind of psychic,

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.890 align:middle line:84%
I guess, she's very
attuned to things,

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.250 align:middle line:84%
she said, this baby's
ready to be born.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.517 align:middle line:84%
And I went, oh yes, right,
13 days, it's all good.

00:02:44.517 --> 00:02:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And she said, no, no, the
baby's ready to be born.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And she started
giving me a massage

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.030 align:middle line:84%
on the tummy in that
circular motion,

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.150 align:middle line:84%
and she said, but you
have to be able to say,

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm ready for this
baby to be born.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.240 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't say it.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.610 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't say it.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.990 align:middle line:84%
I just cried and sobbed,
and I did everything.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.790 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't do it.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.450 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, eventually I did, and
I went into labor that night.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.030 align:middle line:84%
I just remember the fact that
there were these moments where

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.960 align:middle line:90%
it didn't hurt.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.320 align:middle line:90%


00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.190 align:middle line:84%
It came on, and it happened,
and then it went away,

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.920 align:middle line:84%
and you could have a laugh and
a joke and a bit of whatever.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.955 align:middle line:90%
And came back and went away.

00:03:25.955 --> 00:03:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And I had this thought
through my head,

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.340 align:middle line:84%
I will never have to have
that contraction again.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.350 align:middle line:84%
So it was always this
moving forward thing.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And I'd read so
extensively about birth.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.690 align:middle line:84%
Nothing about parenting
unfortunately,

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.940 align:middle line:84%
but I'd read every
book there was to read,

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.342 align:middle line:84%
and it was nothing like any of
the books told me to expect.

00:03:43.342 --> 00:03:45.550 align:middle line:84%
I didn't feel like a little
ship bobbing on an ocean.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.020 align:middle line:84%
I didn't feel anything that
I thought I would feel.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.720 align:middle line:84%
I didn't get to the
music I wanted to play,

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.760 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have any of
the oils, nothing.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.500 align:middle line:90%
It was just full-on into it.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.763 align:middle line:84%
And then by the time
I was at second stage,

00:04:02.763 --> 00:04:04.180 align:middle line:84%
my husband was
sitting on a chair,

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.490 align:middle line:84%
and I was kneeling on the floor
with my head in his crotch

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:07.840 align:middle line:90%
holding the back of the chair.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.970 align:middle line:84%
He was like that,
and I was like that.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And Charlie kept going,
hello, and going back, hello,

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.380 align:middle line:90%
and going back.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And every time his
head appeared, I'd

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.510 align:middle line:90%
hear all these cameras going.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And then it was
like a grand final.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.107 align:middle line:90%
They'd go, oh, aww, oh, aww.

00:04:25.107 --> 00:04:26.690 align:middle line:84%
And I said, can we
have no more photos

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.010 align:middle line:90%
just for a little while please?

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.940 align:middle line:90%
[GRUMBLES]

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And then the midwife
said, would you

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.482 align:middle line:84%
be more comfortable in
another position, darling?

00:04:32.482 --> 00:04:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I don't know,
I've never done this before.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.498 align:middle line:84%
If you think there's
another position I'd

00:04:36.498 --> 00:04:38.780 align:middle line:84%
be more comfortable in,
I wish you'd tell me.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.360 align:middle line:84%
I think that was sort of a
transition moment probably.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And so she got me up, and
Charlie was almost coming out.

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And I staggered over to the
bed, and I lay back on the bed.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
fantastic photo of me.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.880 align:middle line:84%
There was a mirror there,
and I couldn't see.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.730 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to video tape it.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.060 align:middle line:84%
I wanted something in my life
not to be recorded like that.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.470 align:middle line:90%
I regret it now.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And there's a shot of me
with his head like that,

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.237 align:middle line:84%
and I'm saying, turn
the mirror towards me.

00:05:06.237 --> 00:05:07.820 align:middle line:84%
And it looks like
I'm saying, his head

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.560 align:middle line:84%
feels like it's this
big, because there's

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.578 align:middle line:90%
this little head.

00:05:12.578 --> 00:05:14.120 align:middle line:84%
I remember Maggie
the midwife saying,

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.640 align:middle line:84%
when the baby comes out,
nobody tell her what it is.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.330 align:middle line:84%
Let her find out for
herself what it is.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.840 align:middle line:84%
The minute his head was out,
it was January in the Blue

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.190 align:middle line:84%
Mountains, summer, this
amazing mist descended all

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.160 align:middle line:84%
around the house, and
about 150,000 butterflies,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.470 align:middle line:84%
white butterflies,
came to the windows,

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.320 align:middle line:84%
and there was an
almighty clap of thunder.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.360 align:middle line:90%
And there were eight witnesses.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.083 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't just me going nuts.

00:05:40.083 --> 00:05:41.750 align:middle line:84%
So loud that she was
saying, don't push,

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.208 align:middle line:84%
don't push, don't
push, don't push,

00:05:43.208 --> 00:05:46.740 align:middle line:84%
because she was checking the
cord, and I couldn't hear her.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.192 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, he came out,
and I just looked.

00:05:51.192 --> 00:05:52.150 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't do anything.

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.263 align:middle line:90%
I just looked at him.

00:05:53.263 --> 00:05:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And she said, aren't you
going to pick him up?

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.080 align:middle line:90%
Oh!

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.250 align:middle line:90%
I said, is it a boy?

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And she said, yes,
it's a boy dammit.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.330 align:middle line:90%
Sorry I told you.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.870 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I picked him up, put
him straight on the breast.

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.270 align:middle line:84%
The atmosphere in the
house was just beautiful.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:13.390 align:middle line:84%
It just felt blessed is the
only way I can describe it.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.710 align:middle line:84%
There just seemed to be
a glow around the house.

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.450 align:middle line:90%
It was just beautiful.

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:21.505 align:middle line:84%
And the greatest thing is we
all slept together that night.

00:06:21.505 --> 00:06:24.130 align:middle line:84%
Charlie was exhausted, the baby
was exhausted, I was exhausted,

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.510 align:middle line:90%
my husband was exhausted.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.120 align:middle line:84%
Charlie slept for
nine hours that night,

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.540 align:middle line:84%
and that was the longest
he slept for two years.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.850 align:middle line:90%
But it was just so fantastic.

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And the midwife came
every day for a week,

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.760 align:middle line:84%
and I had so much support,
people bringing food.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.760 align:middle line:84%
It was like a community
gathering, community event,

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.370 align:middle line:90%
and it was just beautiful.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:48.820 align:middle line:84%
With the second baby, because I
was 40, I had an amniocentesis.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.460 align:middle line:90%


00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.470 align:middle line:84%
Other than that, I didn't
go to a doctor at all

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:57.940 align:middle line:84%
because I knew at 40, they
would be concerned about my age.

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.670 align:middle line:84%
But I had textbook
pregnancies both times,

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:07.630 align:middle line:84%
and I just felt
completely OK with it all.

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:10.330 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the second
time thinking, oh, this

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:11.330 align:middle line:90%
is a piece of cake.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.453 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it's painful, I'm
having a bath, la, la, la.

00:07:13.453 --> 00:07:15.778 align:middle line:84%
And oh gosh yes, then
terrible, terrible.

00:07:15.778 --> 00:07:17.320 align:middle line:84%
Must be getting
close by now, Maggie.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.778 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you're
4 centimeters.

00:07:18.778 --> 00:07:20.080 align:middle line:90%
And I went, oh no.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.370 align:middle line:90%
Oh no.

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:22.960 align:middle line:90%
I had forgotten.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And she tried to encourage
me to go for a walk,

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.230 align:middle line:90%
and I tried and I couldn't.

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:28.272 align:middle line:84%
And then she said, what
about the birthing stool?

00:07:28.272 --> 00:07:31.220 align:middle line:90%
And I tried and I couldn't.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And my waters broke
way into the labor

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.250 align:middle line:84%
and broke and broke
and broke and broke.

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And Charlie got fed
up and went to school,

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.375 align:middle line:84%
and he told them that I'd
had the baby, and I hadn't.

00:07:42.375 --> 00:07:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
what did she have?

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And he said, they're
working it out now.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.278 align:middle line:84%
And he came home
and realized I still

00:07:48.278 --> 00:07:50.320 align:middle line:84%
hadn't had it and started
to see William crowning

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.010 align:middle line:84%
and thought he looked like
a slug, a little hairy slug.

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:56.470 align:middle line:84%
He'd had so much Rescue
Remedy, he was probably drunk,

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:57.370 align:middle line:90%
I suspect, Charlie.

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:03.310 align:middle line:84%
But he was at the end of my
body when the baby was born.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And again, that atmosphere was
there, that absolutely blessed

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:10.090 align:middle line:84%
holy atmosphere
around the house,

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:12.340 align:middle line:84%
and Charlie was
suitably wide-eyed.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:15.880 align:middle line:84%
That wore off in about three
or four days with Charlie.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:22.720 align:middle line:84%
But it was just so special,
so special, and the greatest,

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:27.250 align:middle line:84%
greatest experience of
my life, both of them.

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:30.620 align:middle line:90%
And you never forget it ever.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:32.170 align:middle line:90%
Mm-mm.

00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:34.000 align:middle line:90%
