00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.992 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:01.992 --> 00:00:51.990 align:middle line:90%


00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.230 align:middle line:84%
>>Once upon a time, there
was a country parson

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.650 align:middle line:84%
making his rounds
of the village.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.600 align:middle line:10%
And he stopped at the
cottage of a farmer

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.709 align:middle line:10%
and looked over
the fence to where

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:08.120 align:middle line:10%
the farmer was working
in his garden and said,

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.880 align:middle line:10%
well, my man, that's a wonderful
job that you and the Lord

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.580 align:middle line:10%
have done on that piece of land.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And the farmer
said, yes, reverend,

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.559 align:middle line:84%
but you should have seen it
when the Lord had it to himself.

00:01:18.559 --> 00:01:20.630 align:middle line:90%


00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that farmer
realized that the Lord still

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.600 align:middle line:90%
had it to himself.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.630 align:middle line:84%
We think of ourselves
as so separate

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.820 align:middle line:84%
from the doings of the Lord
or the doings of nature.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of this, when
we go to work on the land,

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.400 align:middle line:84%
we are apt to force
patterns on it.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.670 align:middle line:90%


00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.480 align:middle line:84%
As, for example, in
this old Italian print

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.880 align:middle line:84%
of a stately garden, where
the plants have practically

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.870 align:middle line:84%
grown up on a parade ground
and made to look, shall

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.540 align:middle line:84%
we say, as artificial,
as city-like as possible.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.789 align:middle line:84%
This is a garden made
by someone for whom

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.740 align:middle line:84%
man was the boss of
nature, and not in nature.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:20.980 align:middle line:84%
I remember once seeing a cartoon
of a retired Army sergeant

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.380 align:middle line:84%
gardener standing by a bed
of tulips, all arranged.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And that he was with his arms
stiff beside him, calling out,

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.150 align:middle line:90%
attention!

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.210 align:middle line:90%


00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.740 align:middle line:84%
But in the gardens
of China and Japan,

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.460 align:middle line:84%
there is an entirely
different philosophy.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.510 align:middle line:84%
Where the gardener regards
himself, as it were,

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.690 align:middle line:84%
as a new plant introduced
into the area, not one,

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.340 align:middle line:84%
however, that is rooted to
the ground, a mobile plant,

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.080 align:middle line:84%
with an intelligence And he
doesn't regard his intelligence

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.840 align:middle line:84%
and his artistry as something
different from those

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.170 align:middle line:84%
processes by which
leaves grow, and ferns

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.010 align:middle line:84%
achieve their patterns,
and water, its ripples.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.550 align:middle line:84%
He regards his intelligence
as something of the same kind.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.120 align:middle line:90%


00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, when
he looks at a piece

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.380 align:middle line:84%
of so-called rough
ground, which he

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.300 align:middle line:84%
is going to turn into a
garden, the first thing he asks

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.610 align:middle line:84%
is not what sort
of a pattern am I

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.730 align:middle line:84%
going to impose on
this piece of land?

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.855 align:middle line:84%
In other words, he doesn't
move in with a bulldozer

00:03:34.855 --> 00:03:38.660 align:middle line:84%
and shovel the mounds
of earth around.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.880 align:middle line:84%
He asks, what would this piece
of land, in collaboration

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.320 align:middle line:90%
with me, like to become?

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.370 align:middle line:84%
And this is, of course, the
essence of Taoist philosophy,

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.930 align:middle line:84%
upon which Zen Buddhism is
founded, a principle which

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.640 align:middle line:84%
is also illustrated in the
art of judo, which I shall be

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.760 align:middle line:84%
talking about in
the next program.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.610 align:middle line:84%
The principle that the
Taoists call wu-wei,

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.730 align:middle line:84%
or non-interference,
which doesn't actually

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.740 align:middle line:84%
mean doing nothing in
the face of nature,

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.800 align:middle line:84%
doing nothing in
the face of problems

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.880 align:middle line:90%
that have to be handled.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.610 align:middle line:84%
But it means, not just taking
the line of least resistance,

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:24.240 align:middle line:84%
but, as it were, finding out
the grain of the situation

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.020 align:middle line:90%
and going with it.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And this whole
philosophy of nature,

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.440 align:middle line:84%
of man as an integral part of
nature, not separated from it

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.680 align:middle line:84%
and dominating it, but
in it and moving with it,

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.460 align:middle line:84%
his own intelligence
representing

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.970 align:middle line:84%
the same force that moves
in mountains, and stars,

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:49.060 align:middle line:84%
and plants, and trees, is
to build works of art that

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.420 align:middle line:84%
are at the same time
works of nature,

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.215 align:middle line:84%
rather than works
of artificiality.

00:04:54.215 --> 00:04:57.500 align:middle line:90%


00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the most sublime
examples of the Japanese garden

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.450 align:middle line:84%
is that of the Katsura
Palace in Kyoto.

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And this garden was created
somewhere around 1620 or 1624.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.640 align:middle line:84%
And in these crowded
city areas, the Japanese

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.290 align:middle line:84%
have exhibited
the perfect genius

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:28.100 align:middle line:84%
for achieving in a very
small space, the atmosphere

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:33.986 align:middle line:84%
of the vast lakes, and
forests, and mountains.

00:05:33.986 --> 00:05:37.330 align:middle line:90%


00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.530 align:middle line:84%
Creating them in
the city is a kind

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.350 align:middle line:84%
of symbolism, too,
of the Zen saying,

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.420 align:middle line:84%
if the mind is not overlaid
with wind and waves,

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:53.520 align:middle line:84%
you will always be living among
blue mountains and green trees.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.160 align:middle line:84%
If your true nature has the
creative force of nature

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.990 align:middle line:84%
itself, wherever you may
go, you will see fishes

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.490 align:middle line:90%
leaping and kites flying.

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.930 align:middle line:90%


00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And so in the densely
crowded cities of Japan,

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:19.410 align:middle line:84%
the gardener and the architect
have together conspired

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:24.540 align:middle line:84%
to use minute spaces to create
the atmosphere of peace,

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:28.630 align:middle line:90%
and solitude, and naturalness.

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:33.660 align:middle line:84%
Of course, this garden here is
a very, very wealthy garden,

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:39.910 align:middle line:84%
attached to an old
imperial palace,

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:45.670 align:middle line:84%
with its great lakes
and spacious landscapes.

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:48.940 align:middle line:84%
But the same thing, of course,
is often done on a tiny scale,

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:53.990 align:middle line:84%
so that you might think
that a space of a few yards

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:55.050 align:middle line:90%
is a day's journey.

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:59.160 align:middle line:90%


00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, the art of the
gardener can very well

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:06.580 align:middle line:84%
be illustrated by a
number of anecdotes

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.460 align:middle line:84%
about the old
masters of gardening.

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And these were often,
incidentally, masters of what

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.540 align:middle line:90%
is called the tea ceremony.

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:22.500 align:middle line:84%
The tea ceremony is a
ritual of drinking tea

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.840 align:middle line:90%
in quiet seclusion with friends.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.430 align:middle line:90%


00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And arises from the
practice of Zen monks,

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.330 align:middle line:84%
who a long time ago
used to drink tea

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:39.690 align:middle line:84%
to keep themselves awake during
their long hours of meditation.

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:43.370 align:middle line:84%
One of the famous masters
of the tea ceremony in Japan

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:46.200 align:middle line:90%
was Sen no Rikyu.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And a tea master is a kind
of coordinator of art.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:54.850 align:middle line:84%
For the tea ceremony
involves not only simply

00:07:54.850 --> 00:08:01.660 align:middle line:84%
the drinking of tea, but also
the ceramic and other utensils

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:04.900 align:middle line:84%
connected with it, the building
of the house in which the tea

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.240 align:middle line:84%
ceremony is held,
and the construction

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.260 align:middle line:84%
of the garden in which
the house is placed.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And so a tea master is a
man who has supervision

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.320 align:middle line:84%
of all these various
arts and casts over them

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:22.100 align:middle line:84%
the influence of
his exquisite taste.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, when Rikyu was studying
the art of the garden,

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:29.350 align:middle line:84%
his master one day directed
him to sweep the path.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And religiously and
dutifully, he swept it.

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:35.789 align:middle line:84%
And the master said,
not quite good enough.

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:37.820 align:middle line:90%
And so he swept it again.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And the master looked at it and
said, still not good enough.

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.970 align:middle line:90%
And so he swept it again.

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:45.970 align:middle line:84%
But the master said,
still not good enough.

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:48.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, said Rikyu, look, I
have swept it three times

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.480 align:middle line:90%
and it's perfectly clean.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.910 align:middle line:84%
No, no, that's not the
point, said the master.

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And grabbing the branch
of a tree, he shook it

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:58.580 align:middle line:84%
and some leaves
scattered on the path.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.342 align:middle line:84%
That, said the master,
is a clean path.

00:09:01.342 --> 00:09:04.570 align:middle line:90%


00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:08.870 align:middle line:84%
A similar story is told
about Rikyu himself,

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:13.990 align:middle line:84%
when he attained the full
stature of his mastery.

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:18.940 align:middle line:84%
He was patronized by one of the
great feudal loads of Japan,

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.830 align:middle line:90%
the prince Hideyoshi.

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:25.900 align:middle line:84%
And one day,
Hideyoshi came to him

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:30.990 align:middle line:84%
with a golden lacquer bowl
and some plum branches

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:35.900 align:middle line:84%
and asked Rikyu to make an
arrangement, the Japanese art

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:39.340 align:middle line:84%
of ikebana or
flower arrangement.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:43.300 align:middle line:84%
But what Rikyu did was simply
to knock the blossoms off

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:46.440 align:middle line:90%
to float on the water.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And the pattern
of random blossoms

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:51.190 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of the water,
with the gold light of the bowl

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:55.150 align:middle line:84%
beneath, was a perfect
creation, but done, as it were,

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.910 align:middle line:90%
in an accidental way.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:04.020 align:middle line:84%
This, too, is the spirit of
wu-wei or non-interference

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.005 align:middle line:90%
with nature.

00:10:06.005 --> 00:10:07.880 align:middle line:84%
Let me give you another
illustration of this,

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.140 align:middle line:90%
which is rather fascinating.

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:13.840 align:middle line:84%
It's also a story
connected with Rikyu.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.440 align:middle line:84%
There was a feudal
lord of some kind,

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:22.210 align:middle line:84%
I forget who he was, a
noble, who owned a tea

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:24.740 align:middle line:90%
caddy that he was very proud of.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.390 align:middle line:90%
And it was a ceramic tea caddy.

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And he invited Rikyu to
have tea with him one day

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:32.110 align:middle line:90%
and use the caddy.

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:34.920 align:middle line:84%
But Rikyu made no
comment about it.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And so the nobleman
thought, well, it really

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:38.360 align:middle line:90%
isn't a very good one after all.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And he was so angry
that he smashed it.

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:43.980 align:middle line:84%
But a friend of his
procured all the pieces

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:45.830 align:middle line:90%
and had the tea caddy mended.

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's an art of
mending broken ceramics

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.320 align:middle line:90%
with molten gold.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And little lines of
molten gold showed

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:56.220 align:middle line:84%
all over the caddy, wherever
the cracks had been,

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:59.120 align:middle line:90%
casting this wonderful network.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:05.990 align:middle line:84%
And when Rikyu saw that, he
said it was absolutely superb.

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And consequently, the
value of this caddy

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.200 align:middle line:90%
went up to a phenomenal figure.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:14.380 align:middle line:90%


00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:20.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is the art of what the
great modern Japanese painter,

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:26.520 align:middle line:84%
Saburo Hasegawa, called
the controlled accident.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And you see there
is the combination

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:31.470 align:middle line:84%
in the idea of the controlled
accident, the accident being

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:36.320 align:middle line:84%
the spontaneity of
nature, the control

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.240 align:middle line:90%
being the contribution of man.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.860 align:middle line:84%
But actually, in the
philosophy of Zen

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.740 align:middle line:84%
these two things are not
thought of as different,

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:47.240 align:middle line:84%
as representing
different realms, control

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.280 align:middle line:84%
from the realm of
mind and spirit,

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:53.860 align:middle line:84%
and accident from the realm
of matter and brute energy.

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:58.870 align:middle line:84%
They look upon the
two as one energy.

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:04.000 align:middle line:84%
And, therefore, the intelligence
of man working in nature,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.810 align:middle line:84%
simply being a more elaborate
form, a more complex form,

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:12.040 align:middle line:84%
of the same forces
that are, as I

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.980 align:middle line:84%
said, shaping the
trees and the ferns.

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:18.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Katsura garden,
which I showed you, as I said

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:20.940 align:middle line:90%
was a very elaborate one.

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And for my taste, the
extremely simple gardens

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.070 align:middle line:84%
that you often find
in Zen monasteries

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:32.980 align:middle line:90%
are still more marvelous.

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:35.645 align:middle line:84%
And there is a particular
gotten in Kyoto,

00:12:35.645 --> 00:12:38.750 align:middle line:84%
at a temple called
Daisen-in, which

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:41.240 align:middle line:84%
is a peculiarly magnificent
example of this art.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:44.260 align:middle line:90%


00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:49.890 align:middle line:84%
These are just a few
initial pictures of stone

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:53.630 align:middle line:84%
walks in the neighborhood
of this garden.

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And here is a part
of the monastery,

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:01.103 align:middle line:84%
with a monk strolling
through it into the garden.

00:13:01.103 --> 00:13:04.290 align:middle line:90%


00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:08.070 align:middle line:84%
These gardens are made
primarily of rock and sand.

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And you see in this painting of
Sesshu's, which is shown here,

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:15.650 align:middle line:84%
the marvelous feeling
for rocks, which inspired

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:18.480 align:middle line:84%
both the painter
and the gardener.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And here in the
garden of Daisen-in

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.600 align:middle line:84%
there is created, as
it were, a stream.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:28.400 align:middle line:90%
But the stream is made of sand.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:31.120 align:middle line:84%
And the rocks selected
for it could well

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.580 align:middle line:90%
be called living rocks.

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:37.990 align:middle line:84%
I think nothing shows
the absence of alienation

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:41.300 align:middle line:84%
between man and nature
more than the Zen artist

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.230 align:middle line:90%
treatment of rocks.

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:45.840 align:middle line:84%
You see, rocks, minerals,
are the part of nature

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.840 align:middle line:90%
that we think most dead.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.875 align:middle line:84%
And here they are
shown as most alive.

00:13:50.875 --> 00:13:53.620 align:middle line:90%


00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:57.640 align:middle line:84%
The art of bonseki, or
the cultivation of rocks,

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:03.330 align:middle line:84%
is a very, very highly regarded
artistic pursuit in Japan.

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And the gardener will search
for days and days in mountain

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:10.350 align:middle line:84%
streams and places where
fantastic rocks may

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:14.190 align:middle line:84%
be found and bring
them to the garden.

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:16.430 align:middle line:84%
But once he gets
them to the garden,

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:20.940 align:middle line:84%
he wants to get them accustomed
to their new environment.

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And so he goes very carefully
about placing them and getting,

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:30.580 align:middle line:84%
for instance, moss to grow on
them in the way that he wants.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:36.290 align:middle line:84%
He wouldn't dream, for instance,
of simply getting some moss

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:38.880 align:middle line:90%
and plunking it on a rock.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:45.400 align:middle line:84%
He will rather put the
rock in a moist place

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:49.130 align:middle line:84%
where moss will form
upon it naturally.

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:52.220 align:middle line:90%
It may take three or four years.

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.360 align:middle line:84%
But then when the
moss has grown,

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.690 align:middle line:84%
he will remove the rock
to the place in the garden

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:58.250 align:middle line:90%
where he wants it.

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:00.730 align:middle line:84%
So you could almost
say that bonseki

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:04.590 align:middle line:90%
is the art of growing rocks.

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:08.580 align:middle line:84%
The Japanese national anthem
says something like this.

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:12.715 align:middle line:84%
May our Emperor reign a
thousand years-- reign ten

00:15:12.715 --> 00:15:16.800 align:middle line:84%
thousand thousand years--
until little stones grow

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.660 align:middle line:84%
into mighty rocks,
thick-velveted

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:20.760 align:middle line:90%
with ancient moss.

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:26.230 align:middle line:90%


00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:31.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, this attitude
to the inanimate

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.520 align:middle line:84%
or to the subintelligent,
as we deign to call nature,

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.150 align:middle line:90%
is the key of the whole thing.

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:39.980 align:middle line:84%
I remember a Western story
which illustrates the same point

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:41.650 align:middle line:90%
very well.

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:46.520 align:middle line:84%
There was a competition in
sculpture at the Chicago Art

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.930 align:middle line:90%
Institute some years ago.

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And the competition consisted in
seeing what the students could

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:56.560 align:middle line:84%
do with a cubic foot
of plaster of Paris.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, can you imagine
anything more

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:00.980 align:middle line:84%
uninviting than a
cubic foot of plaster

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:06.250 align:middle line:84%
of Paris, a textureless,
white, flat material?

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And the person who
won the competition

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:12.000 align:middle line:84%
looked at this object for
a long time, utterly unable

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.940 align:middle line:90%
to decide what it wanted to be.

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.860 align:middle line:84%
So finally she picked it up
and flung it on the floor.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And this mashed it up and put
all sorts of cracks through it,

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:23.330 align:middle line:90%
and odd, jagged edges.

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:25.930 align:middle line:90%
Then she looked at it again.

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And now because it had some
texture to it, she could feel,

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:31.570 align:middle line:84%
she could look into
it and see what

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:34.380 align:middle line:84%
that plaster block
wanted to become.

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:36.060 align:middle line:84%
It's rather the
same way, perhaps

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:38.320 align:middle line:84%
when you're lying in
bed early in the morning

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:43.720 align:middle line:84%
and roving your eyes
over cracks and blotches

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:49.030 align:middle line:84%
on the ceiling or patterns
in a cretonne curtain.

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to see
figures in them that

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:53.620 align:middle line:84%
were not put there
intentionally.

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And in this way,
the rough surface

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:59.860 align:middle line:84%
that has come there
by nature begins

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:03.380 align:middle line:84%
to suggest ideas, which
you take up and develop.

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:06.430 align:middle line:84%
And this faculty, which
we call eidetic vision,

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:11.109 align:middle line:84%
is what the gardener
and the artist,

00:17:11.109 --> 00:17:14.169 align:middle line:84%
the rock artist inspired
by Zen, employs.

00:17:14.169 --> 00:17:18.099 align:middle line:90%


00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:22.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, what about
the dwellings that

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:27.369 align:middle line:90%
are put near these gardens?

00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:34.720 align:middle line:84%
Here, too, man does
not put up buildings

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:39.870 align:middle line:84%
which make him look a
stranger in his environment.

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:42.210 align:middle line:84%
The whole art of
Zen is to put up

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:47.830 align:middle line:84%
buildings that look as if
they belonged in their place,

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:56.980 align:middle line:84%
as, for example, this temple,
a Zen temple in Kyoto.

00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:01.000 align:middle line:84%
Which, with its thatched
roof and the particular style

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.470 align:middle line:84%
of roof architecture, perfectly
fits in with its surroundings.

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:08.580 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't, as we
say, proverbially,

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:12.570 align:middle line:90%
stick out like a sore thumb.

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:21.460 align:middle line:84%
It isn't that man is so, as
it were, humble or masochistic

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:26.260 align:middle line:84%
that he doesn't, as it
were, have the spirit

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:29.310 align:middle line:90%
to assert himself.

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:32.810 align:middle line:84%
His assertion of
himself is subtle,

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:38.790 align:middle line:90%
along the lines of human nature.

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And thus, compare this
temple with a stately temple

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:54.020 align:middle line:84%
of the West, piercing the sky,
with stone walls shutting out

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:57.860 align:middle line:84%
the day and the
surrounding country.

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:01.740 align:middle line:84%
Canterbury Cathedral,
where, as a matter of fact,

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:08.460 align:middle line:84%
I lived for many
years, noble, austere,

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:13.480 align:middle line:84%
grand, but nevertheless,
contrary to nature.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:19.910 align:middle line:90%


00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:24.330 align:middle line:84%
Here is the interior
of a temple tea room.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:28.360 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to particularly
to notice the marvelous

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:30.845 align:middle line:84%
use of emptiness in this
kind of architecture.

00:19:30.845 --> 00:19:33.580 align:middle line:90%


00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:35.260 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps it isn't
easy to see clearly,

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:38.910 align:middle line:84%
but in the very center of the
picture, there is a pillar.

00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And that pillar is a tree trunk,
with nothing more than the bark

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.100 align:middle line:90%
removed.

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.270 align:middle line:84%
It has hardly been
finished in any other way.

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:49.640 align:middle line:84%
So that the twists of
the trunk and the grain

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:52.390 align:middle line:90%
are still there to be seen.

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And the feeling for emptiness,
that you find very prominently

00:19:56.150 --> 00:20:00.000 align:middle line:84%
in this kind of architecture,
is also a major feature

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.900 align:middle line:84%
of Chinese and
Japanese painting,

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:03.760 align:middle line:90%
as in this particular example.

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:08.060 align:middle line:84%
Where you can see that the
summer house and the pine tree,

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:11.610 align:middle line:84%
at the bottom right, are
balanced against the vast area

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:15.420 align:middle line:84%
of space in the top of the
picture and over to the left.

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:18.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, the point of
this use of space

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:21.720 align:middle line:84%
is not that it's
simply background.

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean if you take a
sheet of white paper

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:26.040 align:middle line:84%
and you draw the figure,
bang in the middle of it,

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:29.540 align:middle line:84%
the rest of the white paper
simply serves as background.

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:35.410 align:middle line:84%
But space in Far Eastern
painting and gardening

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:41.000 align:middle line:84%
is intended to be part of the
composition, not something

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.190 align:middle line:84%
as in this Ryoan-ji garden,
which shows off the rocks,

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:49.480 align:middle line:84%
but together with the
rocks constitutes the area.

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And this philosophy of space,
again, is connected with Zen.

00:20:53.660 --> 00:21:01.810 align:middle line:84%
Because very often in Zen it
is said this universe of form

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:05.840 align:middle line:84%
is fundamentally emptiness
or all things come out

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.830 align:middle line:90%
of emptiness.

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:14.856 align:middle line:84%
And this doesn't mean a kind
of philosophy of nihilism,

00:21:14.856 --> 00:21:18.220 align:middle line:84%
but the idea that
emptiness is created.

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:21.070 align:middle line:84%
In just the same way when
a small boy is confronted

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:22.980 align:middle line:84%
with a vast, white
wall, he seems

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:25.380 align:middle line:84%
to be drawn irresistibly
to take a piece of charcoal

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:28.430 align:middle line:84%
or something, or a crayon,
and make marks on it.

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:31.850 align:middle line:84%
Nothing is more
fertile than emptiness.

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:35.780 align:middle line:84%
And so you see in these
Japanese interiors,

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:41.330 align:middle line:84%
there is a feeling of
total freedom from clutter.

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:47.570 align:middle line:84%
These houses very largely
dispense with furniture.

00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:51.360 align:middle line:84%
They don't have great,
awkward bedsteads, and tables,

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:54.610 align:middle line:84%
and cumbersome things to be
moved around every time one

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:56.760 align:middle line:90%
pulls up one's stakes.

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:59.270 align:middle line:84%
You sleep on the floor,
with quilts thrown down,

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:02.980 align:middle line:84%
that can be rolled up and put
in closets during the day,

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:06.720 align:middle line:84%
and so have your bedroom
space free for other things.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think the point of this
is that really you can only

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:15.550 align:middle line:84%
live in such
surroundings with comfort

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:16.870 align:middle line:90%
if you're at peace in yourself.

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:20.530 align:middle line:90%


00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:22.290 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you
know now some people,

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:26.040 align:middle line:84%
when they get out in the
spaces of the desert,

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:27.460 align:middle line:90%
they feel uncomfortable.

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:30.950 align:middle line:84%
Or if there's a long period
of silence, many of us

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:33.070 align:middle line:90%
feel positively uncomfortable.

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:36.360 align:middle line:90%


00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:40.390 align:middle line:84%
And so in the same way, we
tend to like our living spaces

00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:43.500 align:middle line:84%
cluttered, full of
all sorts of things

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:47.260 align:middle line:84%
to distract our
minds and our eyes.

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is simply symptomatic
of our lack of interior peace.

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:54.370 align:middle line:84%
To be able to live
in such surroundings,

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:58.590 align:middle line:84%
you must be as serene
as these surroundings.

00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:04.140 align:middle line:84%
This incidentally shows
the tokonoma or alcove

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:07.720 align:middle line:90%
in a tea room.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:11.100 align:middle line:84%
This alcove is rather
important because it

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:16.040 align:middle line:84%
is a sort of survival in the
secular house of the altar

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:20.190 align:middle line:90%
space in a Buddhist temple.

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's of great interest
for the feeling of Zen

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:26.690 align:middle line:84%
that the altar space
is no longer occupied

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:29.250 align:middle line:84%
by a specifically
religious object.

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:31.180 align:middle line:84%
In this particular
tokonoma here, there

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:34.580 align:middle line:84%
is a piece of calligraphy
hanging, of writing.

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:38.460 align:middle line:84%
But very often, the principal
decoration of the tokonoma

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:42.060 align:middle line:84%
will simply be a
flower arrangement.

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:48.130 align:middle line:84%
Flowers instead of an image,
emphasizing the particular Zen

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:51.210 align:middle line:84%
point that when
the master is asked

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:53.380 align:middle line:84%
what is the fundamental
principle of Buddhism,

00:23:53.380 --> 00:24:00.320 align:middle line:84%
he may well reply, a
branch of plum blossom.

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.720 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:06.920 align:middle line:90%


00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:14.240 align:middle line:84%
And we see now how this feeling
for the spacious architecture

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:17.480 align:middle line:84%
of Japan, which flows
into its surroundings,

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:23.040 align:middle line:84%
is increasingly being taken
up by American architects.

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:27.840 align:middle line:84%
Houses, particularly on the West
Coast, have for several years

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:31.550 align:middle line:84%
been showing the influence of
Japanese and Chinese design,

00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:34.880 align:middle line:90%
but more particularly Japanese.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:37.810 align:middle line:84%
The increasing
merging of the house

00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:42.470 align:middle line:84%
with its surroundings, the
increasing use of empty space.

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:49.110 align:middle line:84%
But there is one respect I think
in which the Western architect

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:51.270 align:middle line:84%
is not quite
understanding the spirit

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:53.110 align:middle line:90%
of Japanese architecture.

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is because the
culture in which he works

00:24:55.690 --> 00:25:00.590 align:middle line:84%
does not quite understand
the spirit too.

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:06.840 align:middle line:84%
Many of our new homes
showing Japanese influence

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:13.010 align:middle line:84%
are just pretty much a roof
covering a living area,

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:17.270 align:middle line:84%
with perhaps some
partitioning for the bathroom.

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:21.160 align:middle line:84%
But there is no privacy in
so many of our modern homes.

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.260 align:middle line:84%
We have what we
call togetherness.

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:26.170 align:middle line:84%
That means human beings
treated as sardines

00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:29.630 align:middle line:90%
in a can, all lumped together.

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And this absence of privacy,
this absence of seclusion

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:34.840 align:middle line:84%
in these great barns,
where the whole family

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:38.930 align:middle line:84%
lives on top of everybody
else, is not at all

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:39.870 align:middle line:90%
in the spirit of Zen.

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:42.430 align:middle line:90%


00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:45.350 align:middle line:84%
Notice that the Japanese
house, as I showed it to you,

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:48.130 align:middle line:84%
is full of screens
and partitions.

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:53.180 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea of
creating houses like this,

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:55.180 align:middle line:84%
with gardens like
this in small areas,

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:57.960 align:middle line:84%
with all sorts of screens
dividing areas off,

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:04.150 align:middle line:84%
is to create privacy, and peace,
and an atmosphere of solitude

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:07.660 align:middle line:90%
in a densely populated area.

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And so where we use this
kind of architectural feeling

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:16.410 align:middle line:84%
to throw people together,
we're not really

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:18.820 align:middle line:90%
putting them together.

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:24.770 align:middle line:84%
You don't get human people
to cooperate with each other

00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:27.790 align:middle line:84%
by throwing them at
each other's heads.

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:31.250 align:middle line:84%
Just in the same way, you
don't get the full development

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:35.410 align:middle line:84%
of human personality by trying
to cultivate personality.

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:38.850 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever hear of anybody
who had true personality, who

00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:41.110 align:middle line:84%
got it through taking a
course on how to win friends

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:45.850 align:middle line:84%
and influence people or
how to be a real person?

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:49.110 align:middle line:90%
You never did.

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:52.980 align:middle line:84%
It's rather when you forget
about your personality

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:55.960 align:middle line:84%
and you become interested
in something else,

00:26:55.960 --> 00:27:00.100 align:middle line:84%
that you become interesting
to other people.

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And so in the same way, it's
when you learn to love solitude

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:09.910 align:middle line:84%
that, paradoxically
it may seen, you're

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:13.090 align:middle line:84%
able the better to
get on with others.

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:17.430 align:middle line:84%
This is an example of what's
sometimes called a paradox.

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:19.660 align:middle line:84%
I simply call it
the backwards law,

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:23.590 align:middle line:84%
which runs all the way through
Taoist and Zen philosophy.

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:32.070 align:middle line:84%
That contrary things come from
actions, unexpected things.

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:38.600 align:middle line:84%
That is to say, when
you would be strong,

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:43.270 align:middle line:84%
very often the best
course is to be weak.

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:46.225 align:middle line:84%
When you would be
powerful, the best course

00:27:46.225 --> 00:27:47.100 align:middle line:90%
is often to withdraw.

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:50.328 align:middle line:90%
