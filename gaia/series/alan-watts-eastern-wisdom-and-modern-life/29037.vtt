>>"Eastern Wisdom and Modern
Life" with Alan W. Watts,

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:28.680 align:middle line:84%
produced by KQED San Francisco
for the Educational Television

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.750 align:middle line:90%
and Radio Center.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:38.090 align:middle line:90%


00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.220 align:middle line:84%
Alan Watts is a
scholar, lecturer,

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.090 align:middle line:84%
and the author of
many widely read

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.150 align:middle line:84%
book on comparative
philosophy and religion.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:01:00.410 align:middle line:90%


00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.629 align:middle line:84%
Since we are now over
halfway through our series

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.520 align:middle line:84%
on Eastern wisdom
and modern life,

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.930 align:middle line:84%
I thought I would use this
program as an interlude,

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.720 align:middle line:84%
first, for answering some
queries that have come up

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.630 align:middle line:84%
about the previous
talks, and secondly,

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.370 align:middle line:84%
for suggesting a number of
books which might be of interest

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.110 align:middle line:84%
to you to deepen your knowledge
of the subject of Eastern

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.790 align:middle line:90%
philosophy.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.370 align:middle line:84%
I've left the question of books
to this stage of the program

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.112 align:middle line:84%
because I thought perhaps the
first few talks might arouse

00:01:38.112 --> 00:01:40.570 align:middle line:84%
your interest and you might
want to explore the matter more

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.670 align:middle line:90%
deeply.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.700 align:middle line:84%
So then, let's go,
first of all, to some

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.770 align:middle line:84%
of the questions
that have come up.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.600 align:middle line:84%
The first one has to do with
the problem of whether I'm

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.260 align:middle line:84%
trying to say that Eastern
culture is after all very much

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.400 align:middle line:84%
better than Western culture and,
therefore, as if I were trying

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.540 align:middle line:90%
to talk our own culture down.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.970 align:middle line:90%
That's not the point at all.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.479 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I want it
to be quite clear to you

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.320 align:middle line:84%
that the philosophical ideas
which I've been discussing

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.160 align:middle line:84%
are as a matter of
fact only-- oh, I

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.560 align:middle line:84%
would say-- held by quite a
minority of people in Asia.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.400 align:middle line:84%
Very often, the ideas that we
get about Oriental religion

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.100 align:middle line:84%
and philosophy from
books will discuss simply

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.550 align:middle line:84%
the beliefs of the general
masses of the people.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.990 align:middle line:84%
But what I've been talking
about are the insights

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.510 align:middle line:84%
of some of the very great
sages of the Asian world.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And just as here,
just as very few

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.220 align:middle line:84%
people are familiar with
the profounder levels

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.990 align:middle line:84%
of Western philosophy
and religion,

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.600 align:middle line:90%
so the same is true in Asia.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And these ideas filter
down to the masses

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.030 align:middle line:84%
in quite a distorted form,
just as they do here.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.180 align:middle line:84%
Now in that case,
I'm not trying to say

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.160 align:middle line:84%
that these ideas
have been carried out

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.020 align:middle line:84%
or are exemplified in Asian
culture on a large scale.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm only saying
that they are ideas

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.860 align:middle line:84%
from another part of the world,
from a minority of people

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.210 align:middle line:84%
in that other part of the
world, which are of possible use

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.310 align:middle line:90%
to us.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.170 align:middle line:84%
After all, we do have
something to learn from Asia,

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.990 align:middle line:84%
just as they have
something to learn from us,

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.660 align:middle line:84%
and as we have many things
that are useful to them.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And we should not visit
Asia or treat Asian peoples

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.210 align:middle line:84%
with the attitude that
they are simply backward,

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.240 align:middle line:84%
depressed folk in
need of our help.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.160 align:middle line:84%
This is really a very
insulting attitude.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.520 align:middle line:90%
But we can really help them.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And they will be in
the state of mind

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.590 align:middle line:84%
ready to receive
our help if we go

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.240 align:middle line:84%
to them with a certain humility
and say, yes, we have something

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.610 align:middle line:90%
that we want to learn from you.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.010 align:middle line:84%
Because in all
conscience, our culture,

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.692 align:middle line:84%
technologically
superior as it is,

00:04:02.692 --> 00:04:05.970 align:middle line:90%
is by no means free of problems.

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And in an age when our
scientific knowledge has

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.340 align:middle line:84%
by no means kept pace with our
moral or psychological fitness

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.410 align:middle line:84%
to control it, we can
certainly do with some wisdom.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.180 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately,
just at the very time

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.810 align:middle line:84%
when we are in crisis because
of these kinds of development.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.380 align:middle line:84%
Modern communications, both by
transportation and by printing

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.390 align:middle line:84%
and by radio and television,
put the other half

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.451 align:middle line:84%
of the world almost
in our backyard

00:04:36.451 --> 00:04:38.200 align:middle line:84%
so that we are, after
all, in the position

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.380 align:middle line:90%
to learn from them.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.080 align:middle line:84%
Now the second
question that comes up

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.800 align:middle line:84%
has to do with what I
was trying to communicate

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.850 align:middle line:84%
in a previous program about
Eastern ideas of death

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.820 align:middle line:84%
and rebirth,
particularly as they're

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.780 align:middle line:90%
found in Hinduism and Buddhism.

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.490 align:middle line:84%
I had suggested that the
idea that death is followed

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.280 align:middle line:84%
by everlasting unconsciousness
is intrinsically absurd.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.080 align:middle line:84%
But I went on to show that
these philosophies have

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.560 align:middle line:84%
an idea of rebirth which
does not involve belief

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:19.110 align:middle line:84%
in some kind of soul entity,
some kind of psychic ego

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.860 align:middle line:84%
that survives death and lives,
as it were, in a spirit world

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.230 align:middle line:84%
and then transfers
itself into the new life.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think,
possibly, some of you

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.740 align:middle line:84%
may have had some
difficulty in grasping

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.150 align:middle line:84%
that idea because
at first sight,

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.670 align:middle line:84%
it seems absurd to
talk about there being

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.560 align:middle line:84%
any possibility of the
rebirth of consciousness

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.830 align:middle line:84%
if there is not some surviving
soul that passes over

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.170 align:middle line:90%
from one life to another.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And what I suggested was that
although I death involves

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.160 align:middle line:84%
the destruction of memory and
therefore of what we call our I

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:58.610 align:middle line:84%
or ego, nevertheless, there
isn't just a blank after death.

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.465 align:middle line:84%
There isn't just
endless darkness

00:06:00.465 --> 00:06:02.650 align:middle line:90%
or endless nothingness.

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:08.180 align:middle line:84%
But rather, that
nature fills the vacuum

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:13.210 align:middle line:84%
created by unconsciousness
with a new consciousness.

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.960 align:middle line:90%
Look at it in this way.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.850 align:middle line:90%
Try and remember back.

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.140 align:middle line:84%
Who were you before
you were born?

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.090 align:middle line:84%
If we go back in memory
as far as we can go,

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.750 align:middle line:84%
we reach the same
total blankness

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.922 align:middle line:84%
that we reach when we try to
go forward and see what death

00:06:28.922 --> 00:06:31.130 align:middle line:84%
would be like if it was
something like going to sleep

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.460 align:middle line:90%
and never waking up.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:33.550 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:39.030 align:middle line:84%
You go into the same blankness
out of which you came.

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.640 align:middle line:84%
So is there really anything
to be afraid of in it?

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.840 align:middle line:84%
After death is the same
nothingness as before birth.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.960 align:middle line:84%
This, oddly enough, seems to
be a very creative nothingness.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:52.630 align:middle line:90%
Here you are.

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:53.700 align:middle line:90%
You're alive now.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:57.260 align:middle line:84%
You have absolutely no
memory of any former life.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.200 align:middle line:90%
You've come out of the darkness.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.140 align:middle line:84%
If you go back into it, well,
a you can come out of it again.

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.030 align:middle line:90%
But it'll be a different you.

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:08.294 align:middle line:84%
What has happened once can
always happen again, after all.

00:07:08.294 --> 00:07:09.960 align:middle line:84%
In a way, you could
say this is a matter

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.540 align:middle line:90%
of statistical probability.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:16.690 align:middle line:84%
If this universe persists
for endless time,

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:20.730 align:middle line:84%
there is always the probability
that life may arise again

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:24.130 align:middle line:84%
even if all life on this
planet were to be obliterated.

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:25.540 align:middle line:90%
Just give it enough time.

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And even on a statistical
basis, let alone anything else,

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:32.100 align:middle line:84%
there's the chance of
consciousness occurring again.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.160 align:middle line:84%
On this planet or another,
in this galaxy or another,

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:35.891 align:middle line:90%
it matters not.

00:07:35.891 --> 00:07:38.480 align:middle line:90%


00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:43.430 align:middle line:84%
Now then, the third question--
I have talked a good deal

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:47.470 align:middle line:84%
in this program about
the Eastern idea, which

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:51.640 align:middle line:84%
is shared by many of the great
spiritual traditions of Asia--

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.590 align:middle line:84%
Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism,
and so forth-- the idea

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:58.240 align:middle line:84%
that all life is
fundamentally one

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:02.520 align:middle line:84%
and that the height of
wisdom consists in some way

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.790 align:middle line:90%
to experience the unity of life.

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And you'll remember, I
pointed out at the same time

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:14.850 align:middle line:84%
that this does not involve a
consciousness of oneness which

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:18.220 align:middle line:84%
obliterates the
differences between people

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.870 align:middle line:90%
and between things.

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And so the problem which arises
about this very naturally is

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:28.920 align:middle line:84%
if the realization
that life is one

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.690 align:middle line:84%
does not obliterate
differences, how on Earth

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:32.690 align:middle line:90%
can one realize it?

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:37.000 align:middle line:84%
How on Earth can one detect
something, which, as it were,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.700 align:middle line:84%
permeates everything,
doesn't alter

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.280 align:middle line:90%
the differences between things?

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.332 align:middle line:84%
You might say, well, does it
make any difference at all.

00:08:44.332 --> 00:08:49.760 align:middle line:84%
If for example, I were
to say, every body

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.580 align:middle line:84%
in this universe, every
star, every planet

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:57.400 align:middle line:84%
is moving in a
certain direction.

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.470 align:middle line:84%
Now I said, every one
of them is moving.

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:01.930 align:middle line:84%
So how are we to know that
they're moving at all?

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:04.590 align:middle line:84%
This movement would
be undetectable.

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:09.490 align:middle line:84%
And so you might ask, would not
the underlying oneness of life

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:11.570 align:middle line:84%
be undetectable in
just the same way?

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:13.200 align:middle line:84%
And if it's
undetectable, how can you

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:17.100 align:middle line:84%
talk about there being
an experience of it?

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:25.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are certain
kinds of experience

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:27.880 align:middle line:84%
which are different from
what we would ordinarily

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.480 align:middle line:90%
called objective experience.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.650 align:middle line:90%


00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:36.740 align:middle line:84%
There is a kind
of knowledge which

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:41.160 align:middle line:84%
you could say is not knowledge
that we get by standing off

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.040 align:middle line:84%
from things and looking at
them but what I would rather

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.570 align:middle line:90%
call knowledge by participation.

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:51.190 align:middle line:84%
There is a Chinese Zen Buddhist
poem which puts the idea.

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:52.470 align:middle line:90%
I thought I'd write it.

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:55.630 align:middle line:90%


00:09:55.630 --> 00:10:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And this is in
reference to the kind

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.450 align:middle line:90%
of knowledge I'm talking about.

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:28.830 align:middle line:84%
The poem says, it
is like an eye which

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:53.890 align:middle line:90%
can see but does not itself see.

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:59.520 align:middle line:90%


00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.970 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
it is like an eye

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:04.310 align:middle line:84%
which can see but
does not see itself.

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:06.950 align:middle line:90%


00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And so in the same way, although
we constantly have sight

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:16.180 align:middle line:84%
and we are aware that we see,
in every experience of sight

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:18.430 align:middle line:84%
we are, after all,
aware of seeing.

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:20.940 align:middle line:90%
But we do not see sight.

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And so, in rather
the same way, one

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:26.760 align:middle line:84%
can have as a sort of
subjective knowledge,

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.320 align:middle line:84%
like the knowledge of
seeing, the knowledge

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.400 align:middle line:90%
of the unity of the whole world.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.540 align:middle line:84%
Also from the literature
of Zen Buddhism,

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:35.870 align:middle line:90%
I remember this story.

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:38.490 align:middle line:84%
Most of the literature
of Zen consists in

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:41.020 align:middle line:84%
rather pithy and
enigmatic stories.

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:44.350 align:middle line:84%
But this one, I don't think, is
so enigmatic as some of them.

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:47.420 align:middle line:84%
There was an old
master called Bokoju.

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And one of his students
came to him with a question.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.760 align:middle line:84%
We have to dress
and eat every day.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And how do we get
out of all that?

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:57.820 align:middle line:84%
In other words, he was
saying, most of our life

00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.410 align:middle line:90%
is a boring routine.

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:02.290 align:middle line:90%
And we get depressed by it.

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:07.430 align:middle line:84%
How do we escape from the
routine of the daily round?

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And the master
answered, we dress.

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.180 align:middle line:90%
We eat.

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And the student said,
I don't understand.

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:17.830 align:middle line:84%
And the master said, if
you don't understand,

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:21.220 align:middle line:84%
put on your clothes
and eat your food.

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:26.120 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
get right into it.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:34.080 align:middle line:84%
For this is a question, you see,
of knowledge by participation

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.930 align:middle line:84%
as distinct from
knowledge by standing off.

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And the point is that this
strange, powerful, convincing

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:47.870 align:middle line:84%
sense of the unity of life
comes to people who, as it were,

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:50.230 align:middle line:84%
become united with
their own experience.

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:52.960 align:middle line:84%
Now very often, one
has the sensation

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:58.260 align:middle line:84%
of one's experience as
being something out there

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.490 align:middle line:84%
and thus away from and
different from you.

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And you are aware
of yourself looking

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:05.646 align:middle line:90%
at what you're experiencing.

00:13:05.646 --> 00:13:08.020 align:middle line:84%
But when you thoroughly go
into experience-- for example,

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:10.040 align:middle line:84%
when you're listening
to a concert

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:13.530 align:middle line:84%
and you are really
absorbed in the concert,

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:15.810 align:middle line:84%
you don't think while
you're sitting there,

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:17.300 align:middle line:90%
well, I am listening to music.

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:21.130 align:middle line:84%
I am improving my culture
by being at this concert.

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:22.130 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:25.250 align:middle line:84%
You, as it were, become the
music in listening to it.

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And in this moment, you are
one with your experience.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:33.090 align:middle line:84%
The same thing is done
in every detail of life

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:37.830 align:middle line:84%
throughout one's whole total day
of, as it were, going into it

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:42.730 align:middle line:84%
and thus not having the
constant sensation of it

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:45.440 align:middle line:90%
is I am experiencing this.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And so when one, as
it were, becomes one

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:50.830 align:middle line:84%
with one's experience,
one can no longer

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:54.690 align:middle line:84%
be the victim of
one's experience.

00:13:54.690 --> 00:14:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And so to grasp the idea
of the oneness of life,

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.820 align:middle line:84%
you mustn't, as it
were, try to get it

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:07.560 align:middle line:84%
by thinking, and thinking,
and thinking about it.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:11.540 align:middle line:84%
You have to get it by
going right into your life

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:13.280 align:middle line:90%
as it happens.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:16.920 align:middle line:84%
You know, there are
limits to thinking.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:20.210 align:middle line:84%
It's like boiling an egg
or cooking a souffle.

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:23.030 align:middle line:84%
If you boil an egg too long,
it becomes much too hard.

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:24.780 align:middle line:84%
If you cook a souffle
too long in the oven

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:26.250 align:middle line:90%
it's absolutely ruined.

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:27.990 align:middle line:90%
And there's a moment to stop.

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:28.910 align:middle line:90%
And so with thinking.

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:30.870 align:middle line:84%
We can think, and think, and
think, and worry, and worry,

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.340 align:middle line:90%
and worry over certain problems.

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:35.000 align:middle line:84%
But beyond a certain point,
thinking about it anymore

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.700 align:middle line:84%
just makes things more
and more confused.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:39.860 align:middle line:84%
I remember another
of these Zen stories

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:42.800 align:middle line:84%
where there was a old
master called Gensha.

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:47.190 align:middle line:84%
And a student came to him to
be instructed in Buddhism.

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And he seemed to
do nothing but be

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:53.300 align:middle line:84%
a kind of personal
attendant on the master.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:57.250 align:middle line:84%
He took care of the
house and served

00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:58.580 align:middle line:90%
his master's very simple needs.

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And after about three months,
he said to the master, look,

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:03.480 align:middle line:84%
I've been here with
you three months.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:07.240 align:middle line:84%
And so far, I've receive no
instruction from you at all.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.580 align:middle line:90%
And the master said, "What?

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:09.630 align:middle line:90%
No instruction?

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:11.810 align:middle line:84%
I have been instructing
you all the time."

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:14.200 align:middle line:84%
"Well, in what way?,"
said the student.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.750 align:middle line:84%
"Well," said the master,
"when you brought me my rice,

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.450 align:middle line:90%
didn't I eat it?

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:21.040 align:middle line:84%
When you brought me my
tea, didn't I drink it?

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.180 align:middle line:84%
When you made salutations
to me, didn't I return them?

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:27.242 align:middle line:84%
When did I ever neglect
to instruct you?"

00:15:27.242 --> 00:15:30.550 align:middle line:84%
But the student said,
"I don't understand."

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And the master said, "If
you want to see into it,

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:36.150 align:middle line:90%
see into it directly.

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:38.280 align:middle line:84%
But when you begin
to think about it,

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:41.070 align:middle line:90%
it's altogether missed."

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:46.270 align:middle line:84%
Well now, I think I've dealt
with the main questions.

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And now we can go on to
the consideration of books.

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:59.240 align:middle line:84%
I have tried in choosing
books to talk about

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.670 align:middle line:84%
to pick books that
are very easily

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:04.630 align:middle line:90%
available and inexpensive.

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, most of
the ones I've chosen

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:11.180 align:middle line:90%
are pocketbooks in paper covers.

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And the first one is an
extraordinarily good book--

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:24.850 align:middle line:84%
Heinrich Zimmer's
"Philosophies of India"

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:26.725 align:middle line:90%
published by Meridian Books.

00:16:26.725 --> 00:16:29.580 align:middle line:90%


00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:36.880 align:middle line:84%
That's by Heinrich
Zimmer, Z-I-M-M-E-R.

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:43.370 align:middle line:84%
Heinrich Zimmer was a very,
very great German Orientalist.

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:48.890 align:middle line:84%
He came to this country
during the Nazi regime

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:54.110 align:middle line:84%
and, unfortunately, died in the
prime of his life around 1940.

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, his writings
have been edited from notes

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.460 align:middle line:90%
by Joseph Campbell.

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And this book is one of
the very best introductions

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:05.750 align:middle line:84%
to Indian philosophy
that you can get.

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:09.210 align:middle line:84%
It's extraordinarily
fascinatingly written.

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:13.079 align:middle line:84%
And it includes all
branches of Indian thought.

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:15.389 align:middle line:84%
It's a very
comprehensive book for it

00:17:15.389 --> 00:17:17.839 align:middle line:84%
deals not only with
the types of philosophy

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:19.540 align:middle line:84%
that I've been
talking about, those

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:21.940 align:middle line:84%
that deal with the
ultimate questions of life.

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:27.640 align:middle line:84%
It also deals with political
and social philosophies

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:29.790 align:middle line:90%
in the first part the book.

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And I recommend this
very, very highly indeed

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:38.360 align:middle line:84%
for getting a comprehensive view
of the whole thought of India.

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:41.160 align:middle line:90%


00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And then I think
what I should like

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:48.390 align:middle line:84%
to recommend next would be
some of the original sources

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:49.270 align:middle line:90%
of Indian philosophy.

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:51.970 align:middle line:90%


00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:59.420 align:middle line:84%
First of all, "The
Upanishads," the translation

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:07.940 align:middle line:84%
of the fundamental scriptures of
Indian philosophy, sacred texts

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:12.620 align:middle line:84%
which were composed,
oh, probably

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:19.310 align:middle line:84%
somewhere between about
800 BC and the beginning

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:22.230 align:middle line:90%
of the Christian Era.

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:26.150 align:middle line:84%
They are very, very
beautiful writings,

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:30.290 align:middle line:84%
largely in poetic form,
and largely consisting

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:35.610 align:middle line:84%
of dialogues and discussions
between the teachers or rishis,

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:39.870 align:middle line:84%
forest sages, and
their disciples.

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And this particular
edition has been translated

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:51.420 align:middle line:84%
from the Sanskrit by Swami
Prabhavananda and Frederick

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.000 align:middle line:90%
Manchester.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.440 align:middle line:90%
And it's in Mentor Books.

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:01.452 align:middle line:84%
I think I should write down the
name Prabhavananda as it's not

00:19:01.452 --> 00:19:02.910 align:middle line:84%
very clear on the
book and it's one

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:04.815 align:middle line:84%
of those complicated
Indian names,

00:19:04.815 --> 00:19:06.190 align:middle line:84%
if you want to
take a note of it.

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:24.360 align:middle line:90%


00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:28.220 align:middle line:84%
That's "The Upanishads."
fundamentally

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:33.600 align:middle line:84%
important to an understanding
of Indian philosophy.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:38.900 align:middle line:84%
It's really the original source
from which the teaching called

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:42.855 align:middle line:84%
Vedanta, which is kind
of the core of Hinduism,

00:19:42.855 --> 00:19:47.030 align:middle line:84%
it's the original source
on which that is based.

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:49.840 align:middle line:84%
Now the next book I
want to show is likewise

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:53.340 align:middle line:84%
an important source
of Indian philosophy.

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:57.890 align:middle line:90%
It's called "The Bhagavad-Gita."

00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:03.540 align:middle line:84%
This means the song, Gita,
Bhagavad, of the lord.

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:06.600 align:middle line:84%
You could say that
"The Bhagavad-Gita"

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:12.210 align:middle line:84%
is the most popular book
in India itself having

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:15.940 align:middle line:84%
to do with Hindu
philosophy and religion.

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:18.840 align:middle line:84%
This translation of
"The Bhagavad-Gita"

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:22.620 align:middle line:84%
is likewise by
Swami Prabhavananda

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:25.600 align:middle line:84%
and assisted by the novelist
and playwright, Christopher

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.710 align:middle line:90%
Isherwood.

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:30.580 align:middle line:90%
And this is also a Mentor Book.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:34.490 align:middle line:84%
"The Bhagavad-Gita"
is, for the most part,

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:38.460 align:middle line:84%
a dialogue between
Krishna, who is

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:42.730 align:middle line:84%
a divine sage, the
incarnation of Vishnu,

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:45.460 align:middle line:84%
one of the aspects
of the godhead,

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:48.725 align:middle line:84%
and a dialogue between
Krishna and Arjuna,

00:20:48.725 --> 00:20:52.190 align:middle line:84%
a warrior, which takes
place on a battlefield.

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And Krishna speaks with Arjuna
about his fear of slaying,

00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:58.356 align:middle line:84%
and death, and of
the turmoil of life.

00:20:58.356 --> 00:20:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And the symbol of
the battlefield

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:03.200 align:middle line:84%
is the symbol of the
whole turmoil and struggle

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:07.080 align:middle line:84%
of this world and what should
be one's attitude to it.

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.580 align:middle line:84%
That's "The
Bhagavad-Gita," the song

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:12.510 align:middle line:84%
of the lord or the
song of God, translated

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:16.530 align:middle line:84%
by Swami Prabhavananda
and Christopher Isherwood.

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:20.280 align:middle line:90%


00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.150 align:middle line:90%
Now let me see.

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:27.940 align:middle line:84%
The next I would very
strongly recommend

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:35.870 align:middle line:84%
is a book about Vedanta-- "Man
and His Becoming According

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:40.680 align:middle line:90%
to the Vedanta" by Rene Guenon.

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:45.070 align:middle line:84%
G-U-E-N-O-N. This is
published by Noonday.

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:48.170 align:middle line:90%


00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:51.050 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
best, you might say,

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:55.400 align:middle line:84%
textbooks about
Vedanta philosophy.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I'd warn
you about in reading

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.890 align:middle line:84%
the writings of
this particular man,

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:05.570 align:middle line:84%
he has an extraordinarily
haughty style of talking.

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:08.620 align:middle line:84%
He sounds, in a way,
insufferably proud.

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:13.474 align:middle line:84%
And he seems to
talk down to you.

00:22:13.474 --> 00:22:14.890 align:middle line:84%
You, I think, could
overlook that.

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:17.920 align:middle line:84%
Because in spite of
this attitude he has,

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:21.790 align:middle line:84%
he has a lot of things are
very well worth saying.

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And if you can overlook
this haughtiness of style

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:29.750 align:middle line:84%
and simply concentrate on
the positive information

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:32.850 align:middle line:84%
in the book, it's a very
valuable book indeed.

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so glad to see
that this has come out

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.630 align:middle line:90%
in a cheap edition.

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:40.010 align:middle line:84%
"Man and His Becoming
According to the Vedanta"

00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:43.550 align:middle line:90%
by Rene Guenon, French writer.

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:47.400 align:middle line:90%


00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:51.480 align:middle line:84%
Now I also think it's
important to read books

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:55.180 align:middle line:84%
that show something of the
effect of the philosophy

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:57.910 align:middle line:90%
upon the culture.

00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And in regard to Indian
philosophy and Indian culture,

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:04.980 align:middle line:84%
I would particularly
recommend this.

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:09.420 align:middle line:84%
It's called "The Dance of
Shiva" by Ananda Coomaraswamy.

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:12.140 align:middle line:90%


00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:15.350 align:middle line:84%
I think you can probably
see the name clearly.

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:19.040 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's another
complex Indian name.

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:22.540 align:middle line:84%
Ananda Coomaraswamy
was, for many years,

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:25.890 align:middle line:84%
a research fellow
at the Boston Museum

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:30.820 align:middle line:84%
of Fine Arts-- a man
an astounding learning.

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:35.720 align:middle line:84%
He knew ever so many languages
and was a great authority

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:43.280 align:middle line:84%
on comparative art,
religion, mythology, culture,

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:44.560 align:middle line:90%
all kinds of things.

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:48.500 align:middle line:84%
He was a very expert carpenter,
fisherman-- a very all-around

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:53.540 align:middle line:84%
man like the great characters
of the Renaissance,

00:23:53.540 --> 00:24:00.630 align:middle line:84%
men like Pico Della Mirandola
and Leonardo DaVinci, men

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:02.860 align:middle line:90%
of this stature.

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And his book "The
Dance of Shiva"

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:07.960 align:middle line:84%
is a discussion
of various aspects

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:17.160 align:middle line:84%
of Indian culture, its politics,
music, sculpture, painting,

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:20.430 align:middle line:84%
position of women,
philosophy of love,

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:23.840 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of questions in
relation to Indian philosophy.

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:27.870 align:middle line:84%
It's very readable and
a very excellent volume.

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:32.800 align:middle line:84%
That's "The Dance of
Shiva" by Coomaraswami,

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:33.770 align:middle line:90%
published by Noonday.

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:36.800 align:middle line:90%


00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.540 align:middle line:84%
Now I think we'll
move over to China.

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:44.560 align:middle line:90%


00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:48.160 align:middle line:84%
This, I think, is the
most easily available

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:51.160 align:middle line:84%
and one of the very best
books for an introduction

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:55.260 align:middle line:84%
to Chinese philosophy--
"The Wisdom

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:59.649 align:middle line:90%
of Laotse" by Lin Yutang.

00:24:59.649 --> 00:25:01.190 align:middle line:84%
It's published in
the Modern Library.

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:04.420 align:middle line:90%


00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:06.620 align:middle line:84%
Now the advantage
of this book is

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:12.680 align:middle line:84%
that it contains a translation
of the works of Laotse,

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:17.355 align:middle line:84%
the scripture that he wrote,
and the commentary-- well, it

00:25:17.355 --> 00:25:19.230 align:middle line:84%
isn't exactly a
commentary on it.

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:22.710 align:middle line:84%
Lin Yutang has so translated
it to use it as a commentary,

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:25.750 align:middle line:84%
but it's the writings of
another great Chinese Taoist

00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:26.660 align:middle line:90%
philosopher.

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:28.310 align:middle line:90%
And I'll write his name down.

00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:29.590 align:middle line:90%
He is called Chuang-Tzu.

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:32.970 align:middle line:90%


00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:38.150 align:middle line:84%
Chuang-Tze is an absolutely
delightful person,

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:43.850 align:middle line:84%
one of the most humorous
philosophers whoever wrote.

00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:46.960 align:middle line:84%
He's very, very
entertaining to read.

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:50.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he
illustrates his points

00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:52.920 align:middle line:84%
with all sorts of
delightful anecdotes.

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.770 align:middle line:84%
I remember one of two people
having an argument on a bridge

00:25:55.770 --> 00:25:58.124 align:middle line:90%
and looking down into the water.

00:25:58.124 --> 00:25:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And one of them says,
oh, how the fishes

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:01.954 align:middle line:84%
are enjoying themselves
down there in water.

00:26:01.954 --> 00:26:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And the other says, you,
not being a fish, how could

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:06.400 align:middle line:84%
you possibly know
how the fishes feel?

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.790 align:middle line:84%
To which he replies,
you, not knowing me,

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:11.890 align:middle line:84%
how could know
that I do not know?

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And that sort of thing is all
the way through Chuang-Tze.

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:19.535 align:middle line:84%
But Chuang-Tze is also one
of the most clear, and lucid,

00:26:19.535 --> 00:26:22.340 align:middle line:84%
and profound exponents
of the Taoist philosophy

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:24.380 align:middle line:90%
that ever lived.

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:27.450 align:middle line:84%
So these two men are both
translated in this volume

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:32.630 align:middle line:84%
of Lin Yutang's, "The Wisdom
of Laotse," L-A-O-T-S-E,

00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:37.810 align:middle line:84%
or you can spell it T-Z-U,
by Lin Yutang in the Modern

00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:40.160 align:middle line:90%
Library.

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:42.710 align:middle line:90%
Then books on Buddhism.

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:46.380 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult to find a
really good overall textbook

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:48.060 align:middle line:90%
about Buddhism.

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:49.800 align:middle line:84%
But certainly, I think
the best available

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:54.400 align:middle line:84%
is this one "Buddhism"
by Christmas Humphreys,

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:57.800 align:middle line:84%
in the Pelican Series
published by Penguin Books.

00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:00.080 align:middle line:90%
That's a British publication.

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.440 align:middle line:84%
This is an extraordinarily
comprehensive outline

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:07.520 align:middle line:84%
of Buddhism and is really
the most thorough study

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:10.370 align:middle line:84%
of the subject available
on the market today.

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:13.510 align:middle line:84%
Even though I feel there
are one or two rather

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:16.040 align:middle line:84%
serious defects in
it, nevertheless I

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:18.510 align:middle line:84%
think this is the
best available.

00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:21.610 align:middle line:90%


00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:26.560 align:middle line:84%
There is, incidentally,
a discussion

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:28.390 align:middle line:84%
of fundamentals
of Buddhism, which

00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:32.150 align:middle line:84%
you can get in a shorter
form, in my own book

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:35.160 align:middle line:90%
"The Way of Zen."

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:38.090 align:middle line:84%
The first chapters are
devoted to an outline

00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:42.890 align:middle line:84%
of some of the fundamental
ideas of Oriental philosophy.

00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And this book, "The Way of
Zen," is published by Pantheon.

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:55.000 align:middle line:84%
And then as a book which
sums up most of the ideas

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.150 align:middle line:84%
I've been talking to you about,
I would suggest this "Nature,

00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:02.500 align:middle line:84%
Man and Woman," also
published by Pantheon.

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:04.250 align:middle line:84%
And you might well
use it as a manual

00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:05.755 align:middle line:84%
to go along with
this whole series.

00:28:05.755 --> 00:28:10.534 align:middle line:90%
