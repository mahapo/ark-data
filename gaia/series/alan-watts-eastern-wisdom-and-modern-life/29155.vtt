00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.730 align:middle line:84%
>>There are some problems
which Western people have

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.760 align:middle line:84%
in understanding
the life of Zen.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that
before we go any further,

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.466 align:middle line:84%
I would devote this
program to discussing

00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:18.215 align:middle line:84%
one of the most crucial
of these problems.

00:01:18.215 --> 00:01:20.910 align:middle line:90%


00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.690 align:middle line:84%
It keeps coming up
as people in the West

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.800 align:middle line:84%
learn about Zen or in some
way come under its influence,

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.780 align:middle line:84%
whether they be painters,
or writers, or just

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.520 align:middle line:90%
so-called ordinary people.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:46.710 align:middle line:84%
And I think the central problem
is the question of whether Zen

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.130 align:middle line:84%
is a kind of capricious
do-as-you-like spontaneity

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.965 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's a very
rigorous discipline?

00:01:53.965 --> 00:01:56.890 align:middle line:90%


00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.000 align:middle line:84%
If you read, say, a book like
"The Dharma Bums" by Jack

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.980 align:middle line:84%
Kerouac, you might
get the impression

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.460 align:middle line:84%
that Zen is simply
living the way you feel,

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.910 align:middle line:84%
following the natural rhythm
of your own spontaneous inner

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.910 align:middle line:90%
life.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.220 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, if you
read some of the books

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.140 align:middle line:84%
by Doctor Suzuki or
other authorities on Zen,

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.880 align:middle line:84%
you would gather
quite the contrary,

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.000 align:middle line:84%
that it is an extremely rugged
and difficult undertaking.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And what the old masters
have to say about this

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.110 align:middle line:90%
is sometimes rather confusing.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:47.110 align:middle line:84%
For example, the old Chinese
master Lin-Chi has this to say.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.390 align:middle line:84%
In Buddhism, there is no
place for using effort.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.550 align:middle line:84%
Just be ordinary
and nothing special.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.420 align:middle line:90%
Move your bowels, pass water.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.750 align:middle line:90%
When you're hungry, eat.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.900 align:middle line:84%
When you're tired,
go and lie down.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.532 align:middle line:90%
The ignorant will laugh at me.

00:03:05.532 --> 00:03:06.740 align:middle line:90%
But the wise will understand.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.580 align:middle line:90%


00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And then another
old master, Mat-su,

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.090 align:middle line:84%
says, In the Way--
that is the Dao--

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.050 align:middle line:84%
there is nothing to
discipline oneself in.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.280 align:middle line:84%
If there were, the
completion of such discipline

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.190 align:middle line:84%
would be the
destruction of the Dao.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.520 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, if there
is no discipline at all,

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.895 align:middle line:90%
one remains an ignoramus.

00:03:30.895 --> 00:03:34.460 align:middle line:90%


00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.700 align:middle line:84%
So they seem to say no,
it isn't a discipline.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.160 align:middle line:90%
And yet, yes, it is.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.860 align:middle line:90%


00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we
outsiders, trying

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:51.080 align:middle line:84%
to understand what's going
on, remain profoundly puzzled.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:59.690 align:middle line:84%
For on the one hand, we see the
kind of floating life idealized

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.480 align:middle line:84%
by the old masters, the
life of cloud and water.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.550 align:middle line:84%
As I told you, a
Zen monk is called

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:11.130 align:middle line:84%
"unsui," which means that
he drifts like a cloud

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.150 align:middle line:90%
and flows like water.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.079 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand, here
they are in their monasteries,

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.089 align:middle line:84%
or, more correctly, seminaries,
living a very rugged life

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:24.750 align:middle line:84%
indeed, under the stern
supervision of their teacher.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.380 align:middle line:90%


00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And so to understand
this problem,

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.450 align:middle line:84%
I want to go back and look
at Zen in a social setting

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.880 align:middle line:84%
so that we can understand
what kind of thing it is.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And to do that, I
want to introduce you

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.020 align:middle line:84%
to some technical
ideas which Buddhism

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.890 align:middle line:84%
has about the basic
nature of the universe,

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.860 align:middle line:84%
so that we can understand
the function of discipline

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.110 align:middle line:90%
in relation to these ideas.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:16.100 align:middle line:90%


00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, there is a
special word which

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.720 align:middle line:84%
designates the
fundamental Buddhist

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:29.020 align:middle line:84%
idea of the character of the
universe in which we live.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And this Sanskrit word is
the "dharmadhatudhatu."

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:46.500 align:middle line:84%
The word "Dharma" has
many meanings in Sanskrit.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.670 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's doctrine.

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.360 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes it's method.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.420 align:middle line:84%
But here, I would say it
means something like function.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.540 align:middle line:84%
And "dhatu" means
realm or world.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:02.130 align:middle line:84%
So this is the doctrine
of the whole functioning

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.400 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And it gives us a
picture of a universe

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.337 align:middle line:84%
which is completely
relativistic.

00:06:09.337 --> 00:06:10.170 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.780 align:middle line:84%
If you stand on the
Earth, it seems to you

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.380 align:middle line:90%
that the Moon is moving.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:19.310 align:middle line:84%
If you stand on the Moon, it
seems that the Earth is moving.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And there's a Zen poem which
says, empty handed I go,

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.020 align:middle line:90%
and yet a spade is in my hand.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.370 align:middle line:84%
I walk on foot, and yet I'm
riding the back of an ox.

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.650 align:middle line:84%
When I cross the river, the
bridge flows and the water

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.890 align:middle line:90%
is still.

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:41.290 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I don't
know what an empty hand is,

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.180 align:middle line:84%
except in relation to a
hand with something in it.

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what it is to
walk on foot, unless it's

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.890 align:middle line:84%
in relation to some other
kind of transportation,

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:50.640 align:middle line:90%
such as riding.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And I don't notice
motion unless it's

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:56.460 align:middle line:84%
a relationship between
something that's still

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.160 align:middle line:90%
and something that's moving.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And so where you've got
an idea of the universe

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:07.440 align:middle line:84%
in which everything is relative
to everything else, you have,

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.850 align:middle line:84%
as it were, a scheme
of interconnections

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:21.700 align:middle line:84%
between innumerable points,
reminiscent of a spider's web

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:29.420 align:middle line:84%
with dew on it or of the
image of Indra's net, which

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:34.280 align:middle line:84%
is a tremendous
collection of jewels,

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.700 align:middle line:84%
all linked together
in such a way

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.765 align:middle line:84%
that each jewel
contains the reflection

00:07:38.765 --> 00:07:39.765 align:middle line:90%
of all the other jewels.

00:07:39.765 --> 00:07:42.700 align:middle line:90%


00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:48.590 align:middle line:84%
And in this sense
then, Buddhist doctrine

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:55.740 align:middle line:84%
is saying that our universe
is so interconnected in all

00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:01.980 align:middle line:84%
its parts that one part of
it, so-called, can exist only

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:05.820 align:middle line:90%
in relation to all the others.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:11.790 align:middle line:84%
All motion, too, is in
relation to all other motion.

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:15.030 align:middle line:84%
It works, as we would
say in physical theory,

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:16.810 align:middle line:90%
as a field of forces.

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:19.650 align:middle line:84%
There is no separate
center in which

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:23.160 align:middle line:84%
any motion or
activity originates.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.220 align:middle line:84%
All activity that occurs
at any spot, as it were,

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:29.450 align:middle line:84%
originates over
the whole system.

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And this is another meaning
of the Daoist idea of wu-wei.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:42.110 align:middle line:84%
You remember this term,
"wu-wei," acting or striving.

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:48.960 align:middle line:84%
The deeper meaning of this idea
is that nothing acts of itself.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:55.230 align:middle line:84%
There is, as it were, no
such thing as an agent.

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:58.910 align:middle line:84%
For action is the nature
of the whole thing.

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:02.430 align:middle line:84%
And it, as it were, appears
in one place in relation

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:04.930 align:middle line:84%
to stillness in
another, and so on.

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:12.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you have a highly
relative system of this nature,

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:15.330 align:middle line:84%
if you want to introduce
into it some kind of order,

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.550 align:middle line:84%
as we want to introduce
order into society,

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:22.680 align:middle line:84%
we can't base a social order
on a completely relative

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.210 align:middle line:90%
conception of the world.

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:29.180 align:middle line:84%
Because in order to have
cosmos instead of chaos,

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.830 align:middle line:84%
you've got to have
some standards.

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:37.670 align:middle line:84%
But since these standards don't
exactly exist in the universe,

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:39.610 align:middle line:90%
we invent them.

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And therefore our social
life depends, as it were,

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.355 align:middle line:84%
on practicing
certain deceptions.

00:09:44.355 --> 00:09:47.160 align:middle line:90%


00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.330 align:middle line:84%
The Western
philosopher Vaihinger

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:53.260 align:middle line:84%
invented the term the
philosophy of "as if."

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And all social order
and communication

00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:00.840 align:middle line:84%
depends upon certain
deceptions being practiced.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:06.190 align:middle line:84%
And I would say these
deceptions are as follows.

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:11.845 align:middle line:84%
The first deception is
that there are things.

00:10:11.845 --> 00:10:14.810 align:middle line:90%


00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:23.110 align:middle line:84%
That is to say that
these vortices or nexuses

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:25.640 align:middle line:84%
in the total pattern
of the universe

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.040 align:middle line:84%
are real and separate
from each other

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.070 align:middle line:90%
and can be treated as such.

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:33.100 align:middle line:84%
In other words, to describe,
to talk about the world,

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:37.820 align:middle line:84%
we have to break it down
into various different units.

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.190 align:middle line:84%
Just in the same way if
you're going to eat a chicken,

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:42.070 align:middle line:84%
you have to chop
it up in sections.

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:43.860 align:middle line:90%
And it's easier to eat that way.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:47.355 align:middle line:84%
But the cut-up fryer
doesn't come out of the egg.

00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:48.880 align:middle line:90%
It isn't found in nature.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:52.060 align:middle line:84%
Nor do you find eggs where
there are no chickens.

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:53.970 align:middle line:84%
Nor do you find
chickens where there

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:56.760 align:middle line:84%
is no environment suitable
to them, and so on.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.920 align:middle line:84%
So the pretense that things
are separable for each other

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:03.040 align:middle line:84%
is necessary in order to
think and talk about them.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.950 align:middle line:84%
The next thing we
have to pretend

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:07.255 align:middle line:90%
is that there are agents.

00:11:07.255 --> 00:11:13.000 align:middle line:90%


00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.900 align:middle line:84%
That, in other words,
the human individual

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:21.540 align:middle line:84%
is a separate thing, originating
action and responsible for it.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:25.150 align:middle line:84%
But in this conception of the
completely relative universe,

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:28.690 align:middle line:84%
action does not originate
at any particular spot.

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:30.990 align:middle line:84%
It's a property of
the whole field,

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:34.190 align:middle line:84%
as it were, focusing
action at these spots.

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:37.390 align:middle line:84%
But for purposes of
social intercourse,

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:42.370 align:middle line:84%
we have to pretend that we are
individual agents from whom

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:43.480 align:middle line:90%
action comes.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:53.474 align:middle line:84%
And this pretends is enhanced
by the third thing, the rewards

00:11:53.474 --> 00:11:54.140 align:middle line:90%
and punishments.

00:11:54.140 --> 00:12:07.210 align:middle line:90%


00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:08.980 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is terribly important.

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:13.140 align:middle line:90%


00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:19.500 align:middle line:84%
The reward for regarding
oneself as a responsible agent

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.530 align:middle line:84%
and acting accordingly
is a promise

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:24.070 align:middle line:84%
of something good coming
in the future, whether it

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:27.710 align:middle line:84%
be in this life or whether
it be in some other life.

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:30.240 align:middle line:84%
So that we are constantly
attracted and kept

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:33.170 align:middle line:84%
at this game based on
these three deceptions

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:36.720 align:middle line:84%
by living for a good thing
coming in the future.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.860 align:middle line:84%
And this, as it were,
conceals from us what

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:44.970 align:middle line:84%
our own proverb tells us in
saying, tomorrow never comes.

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:47.910 align:middle line:84%
We are only really
ever alive now.

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And we get distracted
from living fully

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:53.140 align:middle line:84%
now by having our
eye on the future.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:56.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, there is
a reasonable advantage

00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:58.240 align:middle line:90%
in planning for the future.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:01.730 align:middle line:84%
But a person who is, as it
were, hypnotized by the future

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:05.410 align:middle line:84%
and unable to be
awake now, really

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:07.040 align:middle line:84%
has no use in planning
for the future

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.420 align:middle line:84%
because when his plans
develop, he won't really

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:12.290 align:middle line:90%
be able to enjoy them.

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:14.790 align:middle line:84%
Punishments are not
only the punishments

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:19.200 align:middle line:84%
that parents and teachers mete
out to recalcitrant children,

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:24.060 align:middle line:84%
but we begin to get the
feeling that, for example,

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:28.750 align:middle line:84%
things like disease or
accidents are punishments.

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And that death, too,
is a punishment.

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And as if that
weren't sufficient,

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:37.140 align:middle line:84%
societies have always
invented a complicated system

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:41.260 align:middle line:84%
of post-mortem retribution,
various heavens and hells,

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.760 align:middle line:84%
whether they're
permanent or impermanent,

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.020 align:middle line:84%
in which the rewards and
punishments are further

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:46.520 align:middle line:90%
extended.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:49.260 align:middle line:90%


00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:55.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, this system
of deceptions-- we

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:57.210 align:middle line:90%
could say creative deceptions.

00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:58.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't want the
word "deception"

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:02.410 align:middle line:84%
to have a bad
favor-- is inculcated

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:08.600 align:middle line:84%
into us in childhood, in
every culture in the world.

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And it leaves a
permanent mark on us.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.990 align:middle line:84%
The mark being that
we come to believe

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:20.360 align:middle line:84%
that these three
things are real.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:25.290 align:middle line:84%
Having accomplished the job of
creating a social discipline

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:31.280 align:middle line:84%
and of getting human beings
to step to the right paces,

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:34.720 align:middle line:84%
to dance, as it were, to the
tune played by the piper,

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:38.660 align:middle line:84%
having done that, they
are burned into us.

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And so we come to feel that
we really are separate things.

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:48.800 align:middle line:84%
That we are agents
and sources of action.

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.380 align:middle line:84%
That we are actually
responsible for what we do.

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:53.810 align:middle line:84%
That there is that
ego thing inside us

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:55.780 align:middle line:84%
which is the
initiator, the doer,

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:58.310 align:middle line:90%
the will behind all action.

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And so we also come to believe
in these various rewards

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:04.400 align:middle line:84%
and punishments, whether it be
the Christian system of heaven

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.630 align:middle line:84%
and hell, or whether it
be the Hindu/Buddhist

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:10.830 align:middle line:84%
system of transmigration
or reincarnation,

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:13.420 align:middle line:84%
living life after
life after life,

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:16.500 align:middle line:84%
inheriting in each
following life

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.880 align:middle line:84%
the karma or destiny
which we prepared

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.840 align:middle line:84%
for ourselves in
the preceding one.

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And this is very convenient
because then there

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:26.640 align:middle line:84%
is no, as it were, way
of escaping the police.

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:29.740 align:middle line:84%
There are celestial police,
as well as terrestrial police.

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:32.092 align:middle line:84%
And by this, we
are kept in order.

00:15:32.092 --> 00:15:40.650 align:middle line:84%
But you see this stratagem
of these social deceptions

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:44.920 align:middle line:84%
is really like a raft that
we use to cross a river.

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:50.550 align:middle line:84%
When we have, in young
people, inculcated the order,

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:54.080 align:middle line:84%
to go on being taken
in by these deceptions

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:57.280 align:middle line:84%
is like picking up
the raft when you've

00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:00.030 align:middle line:84%
crossed to the opposite bank
and carrying it with you.

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:02.340 align:middle line:90%
And it becomes a burden.

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And so what Zen is
basically is a way

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:10.550 align:middle line:84%
of freeing human beings
from those deceptions,

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:13.180 align:middle line:84%
returning them to the
vision of the world

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:17.220 align:middle line:90%
in its complete relativity.

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:26.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, the training which one
goes through with a Zen teacher

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:29.440 align:middle line:84%
shall we say lifts these
deceptions off one's mind.

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:35.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, you might say I can
understand intellectually.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:39.080 align:middle line:84%
I can understand
the idea that I only

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:42.110 align:middle line:84%
seem to be an agent,
a source of action.

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And that things only seem to
be separate from each other,

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:48.240 align:middle line:90%
but are actually interconnected.

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:54.460 align:middle line:84%
But does this make me
feel any different inside?

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And you might say, well, no,
I don't think it really does.

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:04.270 align:middle line:84%
To understand it fully, I would
like to change the way I feel.

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:11.170 align:middle line:84%
But here comes the crucial point
in the understanding of Zen.

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:15.430 align:middle line:84%
On the one hand, if you set
out to change the way you feel,

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:17.849 align:middle line:84%
that might be
called a discipline.

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:19.829 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
if you decide simply

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:22.560 align:middle line:84%
to accept the way
you feel and not

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:24.490 align:middle line:84%
try to change your
inner feelings at all,

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:27.920 align:middle line:84%
that might be called
letting things alone.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.520 align:middle line:90%
But here's the point.

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:32.910 align:middle line:84%
If you have understood
clearly that you

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:35.730 align:middle line:84%
as a separate will
or a separate ego

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:41.980 align:middle line:84%
are a fiction, then, on the
one hand, you can't change it.

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And on the other hand, you
can't do nothing about it.

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:48.380 align:middle line:84%
Because there is no
agent, no separate doer,

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:54.050 align:middle line:84%
either to do something about
it or to do nothing about it.

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And so this situation
seems, as it were,

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:02.780 align:middle line:84%
paralyzing if you can't do,
and if you can't don't, what's

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:04.850 align:middle line:90%
going to happen?

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:08.590 align:middle line:84%
But the point of this
is that that paralysis

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:12.130 align:middle line:84%
is a realization
of the unreality

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:14.680 align:middle line:90%
of the individual agent.

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:17.570 align:middle line:90%
So what happens?

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:25.600 align:middle line:84%
From this point, one ceases
to take one's self seriously.

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:29.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, there
is always a danger

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.320 align:middle line:84%
in not taking the
things seriously

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:36.200 align:middle line:84%
which society says we
should take seriously.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.620 align:middle line:84%
There's the case
of the raw youth,

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:41.690 align:middle line:84%
the sort of juvenile
delinquent type

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:48.650 align:middle line:84%
who is in revolt against society
and would use the experiences

00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:53.280 align:middle line:84%
and ideas of Buddhism to
justify that revolution.

00:18:53.280 --> 00:19:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And that is why the
practice in Asia

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:04.690 align:middle line:84%
is to reveal this
point of view only

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:07.530 align:middle line:84%
to those who are
socially mature.

00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And so the discipline
of the Zen school

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:14.040 align:middle line:84%
is a safeguard for the
dangerous understanding,

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:19.000 align:middle line:84%
or the dangerous insight,
which is there, being hatched.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And so all those
rigorous tests which

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:24.510 align:middle line:84%
I explained, the
rigorous regimen of life,

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:26.970 align:middle line:84%
these, as it were,
do not directly

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:28.680 align:middle line:90%
produce the understanding.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:33.660 align:middle line:84%
That they are, as it were, the
guarded stockade around it.

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:34.820 align:middle line:90%
Well, Zen, you see.

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:37.790 align:middle line:90%
Is fundamentally an insight.

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:44.100 align:middle line:84%
The recognition, in other
words, of the deception,

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:47.110 align:middle line:84%
the "as ifness" of these
fundamental assumptions

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:51.550 align:middle line:84%
about the world, which are
necessary to social life.

00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:54.450 align:middle line:84%
But then, when you don't
take them seriously anymore,

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:57.640 align:middle line:84%
when you don't take your own
separate existence seriously

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:01.270 align:middle line:84%
any more, then you
have, as it were,

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:05.080 align:middle line:84%
been inwardly
relieved of the burden

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:07.089 align:middle line:84%
of this feeling
of responsibility

00:20:07.089 --> 00:20:08.130 align:middle line:90%
which society inculcates.

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:11.450 align:middle line:90%


00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:17.490 align:middle line:84%
So you might say that
the object of Zen

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:20.600 align:middle line:84%
is not to obliterate
the order of society

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.140 align:middle line:84%
or to get rid of
its conventions,

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:28.030 align:middle line:84%
but to take them lightly,
to treat the conventional,

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:30.920 align:middle line:90%
unconventionally.

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is reflective
in the art of Zen

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:40.890 align:middle line:84%
as where you see this Zen monk,
the Chinese [? Xuanzang ?]

00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:44.650 align:middle line:90%
treated like a kind of clown.

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:52.510 align:middle line:84%
Or again in such a
painting as this,

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:57.750 align:middle line:84%
which shows the great master
Hakuin, a Japanese master

00:20:57.750 --> 00:21:00.890 align:middle line:90%
of the 17th century.

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:03.220 align:middle line:84%
This was painted by
one of his students.

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And Hakuin himself
wrote a poem above it.

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And here is the
man, you see, who

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:09.480 align:middle line:90%
doesn't take himself seriously.

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:13.540 align:middle line:84%
It says, In the assembly
of one thousand Buddhas,

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:16.840 align:middle line:84%
the one disliked by
one thousand Buddhas.

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:19.820 align:middle line:84%
In the company of a
multitude of demonic spirits,

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:21.815 align:middle line:84%
the one hated by all
the demonic spirits.

00:21:21.815 --> 00:21:25.220 align:middle line:90%


00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:28.500 align:middle line:84%
Such an ugly, shabby,
dim-sighted, bald-headed one

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.020 align:middle line:84%
that he is, as he
is portrayed here,

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:34.330 align:middle line:84%
his ugliness is all the
more aggravated indeed.

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:41.560 align:middle line:84%
Or again, art treated artlessly
in this "Vase of Flowers"

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:46.960 align:middle line:84%
by the modern Chinese
painter [? Baishi, ?]

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.990 align:middle line:84%
a great master of the
craft of painting,

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:54.760 align:middle line:84%
but here painting almost
as naively as a child.

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:56.490 align:middle line:90%
For this is artless art.

00:21:56.490 --> 00:22:00.200 align:middle line:90%


00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:04.250 align:middle line:84%
Or again, the sacred
treated in a secular way,

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:08.080 align:middle line:84%
as in this painting
by [? Shingei, ?]

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:12.220 align:middle line:84%
another 17th century Japanese
master, of the three sages,

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:15.960 align:middle line:84%
Buddha in the center,
Lao-tze to the left,

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.960 align:middle line:90%
and Confucius to the right.

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:21.689 align:middle line:84%
You see they're treated in this
slightly humorous vein, that

00:22:21.689 --> 00:22:23.105 align:middle line:84%
doesn't take them
quite seriously.

00:22:23.105 --> 00:22:27.170 align:middle line:90%


00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:40.580 align:middle line:84%
Now in order to understand
the real element of discipline

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:43.710 align:middle line:84%
in Buddhism, Western
students often

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:47.880 align:middle line:84%
get phased or muddled
by a kind of what

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:57.600 align:middle line:84%
I would call mysterious East
department, a projection of too

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.870 align:middle line:84%
much excellence on
something foreign that

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:01.120 align:middle line:90%
is not familiar to us.

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:03.670 align:middle line:90%


00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And this occurs
particularly among people

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:12.970 align:middle line:84%
who think of Buddhist
practices as producing

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:17.330 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of fantastically
miraculous and psychic powers.

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And who think that if they
go to Japan to study Zen,

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:22.687 align:middle line:84%
they're going to come back
converted from human beings

00:23:22.687 --> 00:23:23.270 align:middle line:90%
into supermen.

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:26.480 align:middle line:90%


00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:31.910 align:middle line:84%
Of course, in popular
superstition in Asia itself,

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Buddhism is sometimes
regarded in this way.

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:37.010 align:middle line:84%
But really, it's a
very natural thing.

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And we shouldn't be
taken in by that.

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And when we see works
of art such as this,

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:46.380 align:middle line:84%
we sometimes have difficulty in
judging what kind of excellence

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:47.550 align:middle line:90%
is in them.

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:51.720 align:middle line:84%
What difference there is between
formal art on the one hand

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:54.300 align:middle line:84%
and Zen art on the other,
because we are so [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:58.070 align:middle line:84%
with these productions, we
belong to a foreign culture.

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's take an example of
a certain piece of calligraphy.

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:06.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm showing you now an informal
piece of Zen calligraphy

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:09.610 align:middle line:90%
by a very great Chinese master.

00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:13.520 align:middle line:90%
We, of course, can't read it.

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.139 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't mean anything to us.

00:24:15.139 --> 00:24:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it
seems to be nothing

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:21.715 align:middle line:84%
more than just lines on
paper, rather interestingly

00:24:21.715 --> 00:24:24.910 align:middle line:90%
and dynamically drawn.

00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:27.200 align:middle line:84%
But now this might be
compared with another piece

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:30.630 align:middle line:84%
of calligraphy, which
I'm showing you here.

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:32.810 align:middle line:84%
This, like the one done
by the Chinese master,

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:37.500 align:middle line:84%
is also written by someone to
whom the written forms have

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:38.850 align:middle line:90%
been familiar all his life.

00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:41.050 align:middle line:84%
He's practiced them again
and again and again.

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And he's written
them in the same kind

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:47.430 align:middle line:84%
of cursive, running,
informal style.

00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:51.350 align:middle line:90%
But you see, here it is.

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:55.460 align:middle line:84%
The moon in the water, written
in English with a brush.

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:58.320 align:middle line:84%
With the same amount
of fundamental practice

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:01.920 align:middle line:84%
involved, informing the
letters that anybody

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:06.350 align:middle line:84%
goes through in China or
Japan to learn to write.

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:11.590 align:middle line:90%


00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:15.180 align:middle line:84%
But the style is the same
informality, formality,

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:16.820 align:middle line:84%
showing the dynamics
of the brush.

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:32.300 align:middle line:90%


00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:36.770 align:middle line:84%
So you see a great part
of the discipline of Zen

00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:41.160 align:middle line:84%
is simply the discipline
of Far Eastern culture,

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:46.560 align:middle line:84%
whether it be the way of life,
such as the moral and ritual

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:49.220 align:middle line:84%
principles of
Confucianism, whether it

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:53.790 align:middle line:84%
be the art of painting, or
of writing, or of gardening,

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:59.260 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it may be,
Zen is something that

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:03.090 align:middle line:84%
exists in relation
to and is manifested

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:08.680 align:middle line:84%
through the ordinary cultural
disciplines of the Far East.

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:12.320 align:middle line:84%
But in itself, what's
Zen is is something

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:15.350 align:middle line:84%
quite different from
these disciplines.

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:22.400 align:middle line:84%
You see every discipline that
we undergo envisages success

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:25.140 align:middle line:90%
in achieving certain skills.

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And success is something
that we must always

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:32.730 align:middle line:84%
think about in relation to
the individual considered

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:35.210 align:middle line:90%
as a separate agent or will.

00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:39.270 align:middle line:84%
Do I succeed or
do I not succeed?

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:43.710 align:middle line:84%
Zen, however, you see,
is the essential insight

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:47.750 align:middle line:84%
that this individual
will is a fiction.

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:49.520 align:middle line:84%
It isn't a question
of fatalism either.

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:55.040 align:middle line:84%
Because fatalism is the idea
that the individual will

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:58.240 align:middle line:90%
is the puppet of circumstances.

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:02.220 align:middle line:84%
The insight of Zen is that
there is no individual will.

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:04.470 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, Zen
is fundamentally

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:07.450 align:middle line:90%
not a matter of success.

00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:11.680 align:middle line:84%
It's outside the range
of failure and success.

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, outside the range
of discipline or no discipline.

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:20.390 align:middle line:84%
One of the best books about
Zen that's been written

00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:25.420 align:middle line:84%
is called "Zen and the Art of
Archery" by a German professor.

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:29.242 align:middle line:84%
And it describes there a man
who was so proficient in archery

00:27:29.242 --> 00:27:30.700 align:middle line:84%
through the study
Zen that he could

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:33.130 align:middle line:90%
hit the bull's eye in the dark.

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:35.390 align:middle line:84%
But a friend of mine,
the composer John Cage,

00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:38.150 align:middle line:90%
was recently traveling in Japan.

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And a Japanese said
to him, something

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:43.480 align:middle line:90%
needs to be added to that book.

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:47.180 align:middle line:84%
We have a very, very
highly regarded Zen archery

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:50.280 align:middle line:84%
master in Japan today
and he can't even

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:51.825 align:middle line:84%
hit the bullseye
in broad daylight.

00:27:51.825 --> 00:27:54.570 align:middle line:90%


00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:57.314 align:middle line:90%
