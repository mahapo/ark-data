00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.740 align:middle line:84%
>>When I was in Europe
some months ago,

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.490 align:middle line:84%
I met a very remarkable
German scholar,

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.210 align:middle line:84%
who had studied Buddhism in
Japan for a number of years

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.890 align:middle line:84%
and was reflecting on
similarities between things

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.140 align:middle line:84%
that people
experience as a result

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.650 align:middle line:84%
of the study of their
Buddhism and things

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.950 align:middle line:84%
that people experience in
the course of their lives

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.710 align:middle line:90%
in the Western world.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And he made a very
interesting to me

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.670 align:middle line:84%
about experiences that had
happened to various people

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.460 align:middle line:84%
during the calamities
of the war.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.190 align:middle line:84%
He said that there were three
particular kind of instances

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.760 align:middle line:84%
which he had come across, where
people had found themselves

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.590 align:middle line:90%
in desperate situations.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of thoroughly
accepting these situations,

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.300 align:middle line:84%
they had had an experience
of the profound joy,

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.030 align:middle line:84%
and you might almost
say meaningfulness

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.520 align:middle line:84%
of life, that
corresponds very closely

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.550 align:middle line:84%
indeed to the kind of experience
that in Buddhism is called

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.000 align:middle line:84%
awakening or enlightenment--
satori in Zen language,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.960 align:middle line:84%
or liberation in Hinduism,
or what we might sometimes

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.046 align:middle line:84%
call in the West mystical
experience, the sensation

00:01:35.046 --> 00:01:38.870 align:middle line:84%
of the individual
finding himself one

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.320 align:middle line:84%
with God or with the ultimate
reality behind the universe.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And my friend then enumerated
these three instances.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.690 align:middle line:84%
He said there were
the cases where

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.766 align:middle line:90%
a person heard a bomb coming up.

00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And they heard the shriek
of the bomb descending.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And they were quite sure that
this was their last moment.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.580 align:middle line:90%
This was the end.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.480 align:middle line:90%
They accepted it completely.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.550 align:middle line:84%
They gave in to their
own obliteration.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.619 align:middle line:84%
But the bomb turned
out to be a dud,

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.160 align:middle line:84%
or it missed and
went somewhere else.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.480 align:middle line:90%
And they survived.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.590 align:middle line:84%
The second kind of
instance was where

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:23.630 align:middle line:84%
people were prisoners of war or
shut up in concentration camps,

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.610 align:middle line:84%
and had come to the point
of believing that they would

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.130 align:middle line:90%
never, never, never be released.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.830 align:middle line:84%
They were in a state
of complete despair.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.840 align:middle line:84%
But again, they saw
there was nothing

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.860 align:middle line:84%
to do except give in to
it, accept it completely

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.730 align:middle line:84%
to the point you might
almost say of affirming it.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.870 align:middle line:90%
And the same thing happened.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And then the third
instance he mentioned

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.740 align:middle line:84%
was when the disorganization
and chaos at war

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.910 align:middle line:84%
had so uprooted people,
had so destroyed everything

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.420 align:middle line:84%
that they had built up for
themselves by way of careers,

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.160 align:middle line:84%
professions, family, and
everything like that,

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.910 align:middle line:84%
that they got the sensation
that life in this world

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.700 align:middle line:84%
is totally meaningless, like
Shakespeare's phrase, "A tale

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.770 align:middle line:84%
told by an idiot, full of sound
and fury, signifying nothing."

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And again, when they
committed themselves to this,

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.140 align:middle line:84%
and thoroughly accepted the
idea that life was absolutely

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.930 align:middle line:84%
meaningless, there came the same
extraordinary transformation

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.000 align:middle line:84%
of experience,
this sense of joy,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.710 align:middle line:84%
and in some strange
and different way,

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.824 align:middle line:84%
a sense of the whole thing
really having meaning.

00:03:34.824 --> 00:03:37.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think that story
is very interesting,

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.575 align:middle line:84%
because we in the
Western world are

00:03:41.575 --> 00:03:46.770 align:middle line:84%
so concerned that our
lives should be meaningful,

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.570 align:middle line:90%
that they should make sense.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.605 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, one of the frequent
definitions of mental health

00:03:51.605 --> 00:03:56.290 align:middle line:84%
that you hear is that mental
health depends on one's

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.580 align:middle line:84%
having a purpose
in life and finding

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.970 align:middle line:90%
that life is meaningful.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And this is fairly
easy to preserve,

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.150 align:middle line:84%
provided one's life
is not disrupted

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.100 align:middle line:90%
by great catastrophes, like war.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.310 align:middle line:84%
It's fairly easy to
preserve on a small scale.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.620 align:middle line:84%
That is to say we
find it fairly easy

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.000 align:middle line:84%
to make our lives meaningful
and purposive in relation

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.230 align:middle line:84%
to our immediate community
or in relation to our work,

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.409 align:middle line:84%
where we can do something that
is a true vocation for us,

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:32.200 align:middle line:84%
or where in the community,
we can do things

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.630 align:middle line:84%
that are helpful
to other people.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.380 align:middle line:84%
But it's increasingly
difficult to get

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.090 align:middle line:84%
the sense of the fundamental
meaningfulness of things

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.320 align:middle line:84%
in a universe as it is now
seen by contemporary science.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.240 align:middle line:84%
In other words, when you
enlarge the framework,

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.860 align:middle line:84%
it's more and more difficult
to see any meaning in things.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.350 align:middle line:84%
Because while we can see the
significance of our lives

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.970 align:middle line:84%
over a few years--
maybe 100 years,

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.910 align:middle line:84%
maybe 200-- when we look at
the thing in vast perspectives,

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.300 align:middle line:84%
and when we see the human race
as such a tiny little sort

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.190 align:middle line:84%
of bacillus living on
an obscure piece of dust

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.630 align:middle line:84%
in the remote corner
of the universe,

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:21.970 align:middle line:84%
when we see this enormous,
almost cosmic nonsense

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:27.230 align:middle line:84%
of galaxies, of radioactive
material going around

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:30.660 align:middle line:84%
and around for colossal spans
of time for no apparent purpose

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:36.090 align:middle line:84%
at all, in that perspective it's
particularly difficult for us

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.500 align:middle line:84%
to believe that life is
fundamentally meaningful.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And this is a really
difficulty, because it's

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:48.220 align:middle line:84%
so hard to see something that
has real and abiding meaning

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:53.060 align:middle line:84%
against a background or as
part of a whole system which

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.535 align:middle line:84%
seems to be basically
nonsensical.

00:05:54.535 --> 00:05:57.750 align:middle line:90%


00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.750 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting
thing is that when

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:07.020 align:middle line:84%
we use these words meaningless
or purposeless of the universe,

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.456 align:middle line:90%
they have a bad feeling for us.

00:06:09.456 --> 00:06:10.580 align:middle line:90%
They're sort of cuss words.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.340 align:middle line:84%
They're bad words
to use about life.

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:19.770 align:middle line:84%
But it's very different
with people in the Far East.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.840 align:middle line:84%
There are certain schools of
thought in China and Japan

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.420 align:middle line:84%
where the word purposeless,
the word meaningless

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.200 align:middle line:84%
does not have a negative
connotation at all,

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.590 align:middle line:84%
but rather the
contrary, something

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.580 align:middle line:90%
very joyous and positive.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:42.190 align:middle line:84%
There's an old Chinese
philosophical text

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:47.110 align:middle line:84%
that uses the
expression "If purpose

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:53.420 align:middle line:84%
can be used to achieve
purposelessness, then the thing

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:54.990 align:middle line:90%
that has been grasped."

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.150 align:middle line:84%
The thing meaning the
whole point of life.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.730 align:middle line:90%


00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:03.450 align:middle line:84%
So then to understand
this point of view

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.721 align:middle line:84%
in Chinese and
Japanese thought, I

00:07:06.721 --> 00:07:08.470 align:middle line:84%
think we should
investigate, first of all,

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.740 align:middle line:84%
a little more
clearly just what we

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:14.330 align:middle line:90%
do mean by purpose and meaning.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.000 align:middle line:90%


00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.060 align:middle line:84%
Purpose is, I think,
a word generally

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:29.890 align:middle line:84%
used by us whereby events are
ordained to a future result.

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:37.750 align:middle line:84%
For example, if I do
something like this,

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.717 align:middle line:84%
just doing that
alone doesn't appear

00:07:39.717 --> 00:07:40.800 align:middle line:90%
to have very much purpose.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.330 align:middle line:90%


00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:55.520 align:middle line:84%
But if after I have done
that, in the future I do this,

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.860 align:middle line:84%
then it appears that what
I did in such a chaotic way

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:02.310 align:middle line:90%
in the first has purpose.

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:08.030 align:middle line:84%
So purpose is acts
acquiring a meaning

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:11.000 align:middle line:84%
in terms of a future to
which they are leading.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.790 align:middle line:84%
We say, I have a purpose when
I am going down to the store

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:16.930 align:middle line:90%
in order to buy groceries.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:20.130 align:middle line:84%
If I'm going down to the
town for no reason at all,

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:23.020 align:middle line:84%
then you might say my
action is purposeless.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.480 align:middle line:84%
But if I'm going
to buy groceries,

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.470 align:middle line:90%
then it has a purpose.

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:27.470 align:middle line:90%
Now, what about meaning?

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:30.080 align:middle line:90%


00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:34.260 align:middle line:84%
The idea of meaning is very
close to that of purpose.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And this may be a good
illustration of it.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:39.310 align:middle line:90%
Here is the word cross.

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:42.190 align:middle line:90%


00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:43.880 align:middle line:90%
And the word cross is a sound.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:44.910 align:middle line:90%
It's just a noise.

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:47.990 align:middle line:90%


00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:52.070 align:middle line:84%
But that noise has
meaning for us,

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:55.210 align:middle line:84%
because we know that
relates to this.

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:58.510 align:middle line:90%


00:08:58.510 --> 00:08:59.950 align:middle line:90%
That is a cross.

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:06.190 align:middle line:84%
But the noise cross
is not this figure.

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:11.910 align:middle line:84%
But cross has meaning because
it represents or stands

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:15.530 align:middle line:90%
for that actual concrete figure.

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And so, at any rate,
one's sense of meaning,

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:22.470 align:middle line:84%
which we might call here
the first sense of meaning,

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:27.750 align:middle line:84%
is the function of a
sign, a noise or a symbol

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.980 align:middle line:84%
which points to something
other than itself.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:33.040 align:middle line:84%
For example, if we didn't
take this as a cross,

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:37.510 align:middle line:84%
but took it as a plus sign,
then it would, in its term,

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:40.040 align:middle line:84%
become another sign
having meaning.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And its meaning would be
the process of adding.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.630 align:middle line:90%


00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:50.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, if life has
to be meaningful in these two

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:53.580 align:middle line:84%
senses, in the sense of
purpose already demonstrated

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.750 align:middle line:84%
in the sense of [INAUDIBLE]
first sense of meaning,

00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:01.460 align:middle line:84%
then it means that
events, people,

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:05.800 align:middle line:84%
things are only meaningful
or purposive insofar

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:09.300 align:middle line:84%
as they need lead to something
else, or insofar as they

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.190 align:middle line:90%
represent something else.

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:14.330 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, this
makes people and things

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:18.360 align:middle line:84%
rather like symbols and words,
which always refer to something

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:23.440 align:middle line:84%
beyond themselves and don't
mean anything in themselves.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.620 align:middle line:84%
There's also another
sense of meaning.

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:31.010 align:middle line:90%
And that is the sense of order.

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:35.320 align:middle line:84%
We would look at this
object, for example,

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:39.500 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, that's a
kind of a senseless shape.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.760 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't mean very much.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.410 align:middle line:90%
It's just a chaotic blob.

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:46.070 align:middle line:84%
But if we introduced
order into it

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:49.950 align:middle line:84%
by making that
object symmetrical,

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:53.600 align:middle line:84%
we will immediately recognize
the phenomenon of pattern,

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.632 align:middle line:84%
because an element of
recognition comes into it.

00:10:56.632 --> 00:11:00.670 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we
recognize the repetition

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:02.605 align:middle line:90%
of the shape in reverse.

00:11:02.605 --> 00:11:05.410 align:middle line:84%
And this element of
recognition makes

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:11.010 align:middle line:84%
it meaningful, patterned,
orderly in this particular way.

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:13.990 align:middle line:90%


00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the dominant
ways in which a person can

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:25.360 align:middle line:84%
say that life has meaning
is then that it has order.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:29.130 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand, if
the orderliness of life

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:33.520 align:middle line:84%
is taken too far,
we then move over

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.560 align:middle line:84%
into another kind
of meaninglessness,

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.320 align:middle line:90%
which we call monotony.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:42.775 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if every day is
the same as the day before it,

00:11:42.775 --> 00:11:45.380 align:middle line:84%
if we find ourselves
involved in routine

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:47.290 align:middle line:84%
where we are doing
exactly the same job

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:51.690 align:middle line:84%
day after day after day, we
find that through an excess

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:57.220 align:middle line:84%
of order, our life
begins to lose vitality.

00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And so it seems that we
need a kind of disorder

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:05.580 align:middle line:90%
in order to give life to order.

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:09.900 align:middle line:84%
We need a kind of
nonsense in order

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:13.090 align:middle line:84%
to make things
really meaningful.

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:17.570 align:middle line:84%
We need chaos as an
essential element of life.

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:20.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the Western
world, we tend

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:23.020 align:middle line:90%
on the whole to emphasize order.

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:26.000 align:middle line:84%
We are always pushing
things to make sense.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.880 align:middle line:84%
We are always trying to control
the world and make it obey us,

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.230 align:middle line:90%
and therefore make it orderly.

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And after all,
science is primarily

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.150 align:middle line:84%
a study of the
regularities in the nature,

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:42.730 align:middle line:90%
a study of natural order.

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:47.920 align:middle line:84%
But to a considerable extent in
Far Eastern thought, especially

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.440 align:middle line:84%
in Taoist and Buddhist
thought, the emphasis

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.520 align:middle line:90%
goes the other way.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:57.203 align:middle line:84%
There is an emphasis not so
much on the beauty of order

00:12:57.203 --> 00:13:02.180 align:middle line:84%
as the beauty of a certain
kind of disorder or nonsense.

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:05.610 align:middle line:84%
You see, look at
this that I drew

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:10.230 align:middle line:84%
just before I started
to make the face.

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:16.210 align:middle line:84%
This chaos of lines up here is
like life in certain aspects.

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:19.130 align:middle line:84%
So much of life is
this sort of thing,

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:22.790 align:middle line:84%
which does not become
this sort of thing.

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:28.460 align:middle line:84%
Events that don't seem
to make any sense at all.

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:32.030 align:middle line:84%
But the Chinese and
Japanese eye has

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:35.680 align:middle line:84%
been able to look at this sort
of phenomenon, which we would

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:38.630 align:middle line:84%
call nonsense phenomenon,
purposeless phenomenon,

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:43.440 align:middle line:84%
in a way that begins to reveal
a profounder kind of meaning

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.670 align:middle line:90%
in it.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:47.240 align:middle line:84%
Take, for example,
one of the greatest

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:52.220 align:middle line:84%
of the Japanese painters,
the artist Sesshu, who

00:13:52.220 --> 00:14:02.340 align:middle line:84%
was a Buddhist priest
living between about

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:05.330 align:middle line:84%
the beginning of
the 16th century.

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:10.410 align:middle line:84%
Actually, his dates
are 1421 to 1506.

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very, very
famous painting of his.

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:17.030 align:middle line:84%
But as you look
at it, you may be

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:20.120 align:middle line:84%
inclined to feel that it's
very like the mess which

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:24.140 align:middle line:84%
I drew that eventually
turned into somebody's hair.

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:27.280 align:middle line:84%
Because Sesshu did
paintings of this kind

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:32.510 align:middle line:84%
very often with fistfuls
of straw instead of brush.

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:34.810 align:middle line:84%
But as you look at that
thinking more carefully--

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:39.330 align:middle line:84%
it's done in black
ink on paper--

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:45.430 align:middle line:84%
you begin to realize that this
is a natural scene, that we

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:50.560 align:middle line:84%
are looking at a
system of rocks.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And far above
them, very faintly,

00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:57.530 align:middle line:90%
there is a few mountain peaks.

00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:04.080 align:middle line:84%
That is called the [? haiboku ?]
or rough technique landscape.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:10.240 align:middle line:84%
And as you begin to
recognize what it represents,

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.790 align:middle line:84%
you begin, perhaps, to feel
that it has some meaning.

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:17.470 align:middle line:90%


00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And yet why do we feel that
those at-first-sight chaotic

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:33.750 align:middle line:84%
lines have meaning when we
discover that they represent

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:38.090 align:middle line:84%
a natural scene, a mass
of higgledy-piggledy rocks

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:43.570 align:middle line:84%
and trees, which in themselves
do not have meaning in quite

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:47.510 align:middle line:84%
the senses that I
have so far defined?

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:53.010 align:middle line:84%
After all, if a word like
cross represents an object,

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:55.240 align:middle line:90%
what do rocks represent?

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:56.680 align:middle line:90%
What do trees represent?

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.030 align:middle line:90%
What do mountains represent?

00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:00.420 align:middle line:90%
Do they symbolize something?

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:04.550 align:middle line:84%
Do they have some purpose in
that they are intentionally

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:07.725 align:middle line:84%
working to produce
a future result?

00:16:07.725 --> 00:16:10.440 align:middle line:84%
Do the waves
washing on the shore

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.260 align:middle line:84%
and making strange patterns
of foam on the sand

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:14.502 align:middle line:90%
have some intention?

00:16:14.502 --> 00:16:17.230 align:middle line:90%
Are they symbolizing anything?

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:19.556 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:16:19.556 --> 00:16:25.400 align:middle line:84%
But then why does the artist so
often copy the forms of nature?

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:29.550 align:middle line:84%
Surely he does it because
he is paying a tribute

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:32.520 align:middle line:84%
to a certain kind
of meaninglessness,

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:39.340 align:middle line:84%
a certain kind of joyous
purposelessness in nature.

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:44.835 align:middle line:84%
And this fact of
our being constantly

00:16:44.835 --> 00:16:50.210 align:middle line:84%
fascinated by the
freedom of natural forms

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:54.610 align:middle line:84%
from having to mean something,
from having to make sense,

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:58.110 align:middle line:90%
that is a kind of relief to us.

00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And so there is
a Chinese saying,

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:04.440 align:middle line:84%
which is that the
beauty of a mountain

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.656 align:middle line:84%
is that it's much
like a mountain.

00:17:06.656 --> 00:17:09.859 align:middle line:84%
The beauty of water is that
it's so much like water.

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:13.230 align:middle line:84%
They have this way of putting
it in a little figure.

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:17.099 align:middle line:90%


00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:25.064 align:middle line:90%
"Mountain gets mountain."

00:17:25.064 --> 00:17:28.696 align:middle line:90%
And then you write it across.

00:17:28.696 --> 00:17:40.210 align:middle line:84%
"Water gets water,"
meaning after all,

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:44.060 align:middle line:84%
a mountain is wonderful because
it's so much like a mountain.

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:47.591 align:middle line:84%
Water is wonderful because
it's so much like water.

00:17:47.591 --> 00:17:52.850 align:middle line:84%
And thus it is the quality of
the the whimsical waywardness--

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:57.620 align:middle line:84%
shall we say, the wandering
quality, the undesigned quality

00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:01.390 align:middle line:84%
in all these things that pleases
us in so marvelous a way.

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And this has been picked up by
the artists of the Far East.

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.730 align:middle line:84%
After all, wandering,
doing something

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:10.880 align:middle line:84%
with no particular purpose,
just strolling down

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:13.320 align:middle line:84%
the street looking at the
sky, or sitting and twiddling

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.120 align:middle line:90%
your thumbs.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:15.960 align:middle line:84%
This, in a way, it is
always an expression

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:20.290 align:middle line:84%
of fullness, or
profound content,

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:23.650 align:middle line:84%
and there's a kind of prejudice
against wondering in our world.

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:26.007 align:middle line:84%
What happens if you got
out in a big city nowadays,

00:18:26.007 --> 00:18:27.090 align:middle line:90%
and you're just wandering.

00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:27.965 align:middle line:90%
You're going nowhere.

00:18:27.965 --> 00:18:29.755 align:middle line:90%
And a cop stops you.

00:18:29.755 --> 00:18:30.925 align:middle line:90%
Where are you going?

00:18:30.925 --> 00:18:32.480 align:middle line:90%
Why, I wasn't going anywhere.

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.550 align:middle line:90%
Ah, don't tell me that.

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:36.412 align:middle line:84%
People who aren't
going anywhere,

00:18:36.412 --> 00:18:38.370 align:middle line:84%
people who are not certain
where they're going,

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:40.580 align:middle line:84%
people who are
just wandering, are

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:44.244 align:middle line:84%
regarded by our civilization
as rather dangerous.

00:18:44.244 --> 00:18:45.410 align:middle line:90%
But look what we're missing.

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:48.320 align:middle line:90%


00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:54.230 align:middle line:84%
Here is a very marvelous
example of wandering.

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:58.690 align:middle line:84%
It's a print by a great
contemporary Japanese

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:03.980 align:middle line:84%
who died a year or two
ago, Sabro Hasegawa.

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:07.480 align:middle line:84%
He made this print from
pieces of an old boat that

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.820 align:middle line:90%
were washed up on the beach.

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And he rubbed them with ink
and printed them on paper.

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And what he especially
wanted to reveal

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:24.320 align:middle line:84%
was the beauty of the
simple wandering lines

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:27.720 align:middle line:90%
of the grain and the wood.

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.750 align:middle line:84%
He, in other words,
had an insight,

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:33.020 align:middle line:84%
which is the same
insight Sesshu had

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:36.040 align:middle line:84%
when he did that rough
landscape, an insight

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:40.490 align:middle line:84%
into the essential joyousness
of wandering lines.

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:44.090 align:middle line:84%
That print in its outline is
not made to represent anything.

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:46.620 align:middle line:90%
It isn't a symbol of anything.

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:50.645 align:middle line:84%
It's just for one to look
at and enjoy for itself

00:19:50.645 --> 00:19:54.690 align:middle line:84%
with no purpose
whatsoever beyond it.

00:19:54.690 --> 00:20:02.200 align:middle line:84%
One also finds a similar
kind of thing in calligraphy,

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:07.470 align:middle line:84%
in certain ways of writing
Chinese characters.

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And this sort of rough,
undisciplined, jazzy way we

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:17.550 align:middle line:84%
would say of writing
Chinese characters.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:21.540 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they have meaning,
because the words actually

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:23.020 align:middle line:90%
are a poem.

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:26.270 align:middle line:84%
But what is especially
attractive to connoisseurs

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:30.830 align:middle line:84%
of fine writing is not only
the meaning of the poem,

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:33.610 align:middle line:84%
but the character
in the strokes,

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:37.720 align:middle line:84%
the vitality, all
those little hairlines

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:41.460 align:middle line:84%
of the brush dancing
on paper in what

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:46.135 align:middle line:84%
appears to be a kind
of haphazard tracking

00:20:46.135 --> 00:20:46.940 align:middle line:90%
of the brush.

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:52.870 align:middle line:90%


00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And because we have
begun to see the beauty

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:58.810 align:middle line:84%
of this kind of
thing for ourselves--

00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:02.710 align:middle line:84%
to some extent, tutored
by Far Eastern artists--

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:07.250 align:middle line:84%
we can also recognize
the splendor of, say,

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:13.660 align:middle line:84%
the forms of driftwood, such
as this piece that stands here.

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Nowadays, many people
are going along

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:18.090 align:middle line:84%
to the beach and collecting
objects like this

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:23.300 align:middle line:84%
to put in their houses,
where the wood charms us

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:27.720 align:middle line:84%
because of its strangely
chaotic, and again,

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:32.060 align:middle line:84%
nonsensical,
meaningless outline.

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And this sort of thing was also
brought to a kind of perfection

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:42.710 align:middle line:84%
by the great ceramic
artists of Japan.

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:44.590 align:middle line:84%
When they made
something like this--

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:50.080 align:middle line:84%
this is a ceremonial tea bowl
for chanoyu as it's called,

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:52.810 align:middle line:90%
or tea ceremony.

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And once upon a
time, a potter who

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:59.540 align:middle line:84%
was making one of these
bowls had an accident.

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:03.640 align:middle line:84%
He let the glaze run
on it by mistake.

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:05.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
can see on this bowl

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:09.420 align:middle line:84%
that the glaze here
is just a blob which

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:12.930 align:middle line:84%
has run down the
side of the bowl.

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:14.810 align:middle line:84%
The first man to
whom that happened,

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:19.400 align:middle line:84%
many hundred years ago, thought,
oh dear, it's a mistake.

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:21.790 align:middle line:84%
But then he looked
at it and realized

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:25.170 align:middle line:84%
that the unintentional,
the nonsensical mistake,

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:27.450 align:middle line:90%
was peculiarly beautiful.

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And thereafter there
has grown a tradition

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:36.640 align:middle line:84%
of ceramic art in Japan
which, as it were,

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:41.670 align:middle line:84%
capitalizes on what will
happen when the glaze runs all

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:42.330 align:middle line:90%
by itself.

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:46.540 align:middle line:90%


00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:57.030 align:middle line:84%
So this art of natural nonsense
is a kind of perception

00:22:57.030 --> 00:23:02.900 align:middle line:84%
that the beauty of the
world is that it's a dance.

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:07.210 align:middle line:84%
And just when we dance, we don't
dance in order to go anywhere.

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:10.730 align:middle line:84%
We don't dance in order to get
to the other side of the room.

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:13.446 align:middle line:84%
We dance just to go round
and round and round.

00:23:13.446 --> 00:23:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And so it is in
the same way when

00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:18.780 align:middle line:84%
we look at the outlines
of the mountains.

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:21.050 align:middle line:90%
What do they mean?

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:24.945 align:middle line:84%
They mean just whoop, whoop,
whoop, whee, whee, whee, whoop

00:23:24.945 --> 00:23:26.670 align:middle line:90%
whoop, like that.

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:29.047 align:middle line:90%
And that is the delight of it.

00:23:29.047 --> 00:23:34.520 align:middle line:90%


00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:44.530 align:middle line:84%
In other words, this
nonsense of quality of life

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:50.840 align:middle line:84%
begins to make its appeal
to us, begins to show us

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:54.650 align:middle line:84%
its hidden meaning
and its hidden beauty.

00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:58.960 align:middle line:84%
When we don't, as it were,
pick a quarrel with the world

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:01.160 align:middle line:84%
and try to make
something of it--

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:03.376 align:middle line:84%
you know our own slang
is often so revealing.

00:24:03.376 --> 00:24:04.750 align:middle line:84%
When somebody says
to you, do you

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:05.958 align:middle line:90%
want to make something of it?

00:24:05.958 --> 00:24:08.670 align:middle line:90%


00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:12.530 align:middle line:84%
That means the situation
is definitely hostile.

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:16.550 align:middle line:84%
And so likewise, when our
constant attitude to the world

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:18.410 align:middle line:84%
is that we want to
make something of it,

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:20.540 align:middle line:84%
we want to force
it to make sense,

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:22.980 align:middle line:84%
we want to force
it to make order,

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:28.630 align:middle line:84%
then to that extent the world
hides its meaning from us.

00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And we find a greater
meaning when we are able,

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:36.900 align:middle line:84%
like the person in the story
I told at the beginning,

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:40.400 align:middle line:84%
like the person who found
that life was senseless

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:43.540 align:middle line:84%
and profoundly accepted
its senselessness,

00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:47.170 align:middle line:84%
he converted that nonsense
into a kind of joy.

00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:50.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, after all, this isn't
really foreign to, say,

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:53.390 align:middle line:90%
Christian ideas.

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:56.770 align:middle line:84%
It's true that we hear a great
deal in Christian teaching

00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:59.220 align:middle line:90%
about the purposes of God.

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:01.420 align:middle line:84%
But surely there
is a deeper secret

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:04.800 align:middle line:84%
within Christian teaching,
that the purposes of God

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.897 align:middle line:84%
lead in the end to
purposelessness.

00:25:07.897 --> 00:25:09.980 align:middle line:84%
After all, isn't it the
historic, ancient doctrine

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:15.480 align:middle line:84%
of Christianity that the true
purpose or the true end of man

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:18.580 align:middle line:90%
is to behold the vision of God.

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And then you might ask,
what is the purpose of that?

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:26.180 align:middle line:84%
If people find themselves in
Heaven, face to face with God,

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:28.890 align:middle line:84%
do they look at God
and say, so what?

00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:29.990 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:32.604 align:middle line:84%
According to ancient
Christian symbolism,

00:25:32.604 --> 00:25:34.270 align:middle line:84%
they join with the
saints and the angels

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:37.770 align:middle line:84%
in singing hallelujah,
hallelujah, hallelujah!

00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:40.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, the word hallelujah
once meant something.

00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:43.540 align:middle line:84%
But what it means now
is celestial whoopee.

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:45.470 align:middle line:90%
It's an expression of sheer joy.

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:46.570 align:middle line:90%
It's a babble.

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:48.286 align:middle line:90%
It's like the sound of a brook.

00:25:48.286 --> 00:25:51.640 align:middle line:84%
And we love to listen
to the babble of a brook

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:55.080 align:middle line:84%
because it's a joyous sound
that just doesn't mean anything

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:57.240 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:04.090 align:middle line:84%
You see, God in that sense
does not need to mean anything,

00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:05.820 align:middle line:90%
because he is complete.

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:10.000 align:middle line:84%
He has no future
purpose to fulfill.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.170 align:middle line:84%
He is not a symbol
signifying something.

00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:17.670 align:middle line:84%
But in the Far Eastern ideas
of which I have been speaking,

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:20.830 align:middle line:84%
life is regarded
in the same way.

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:27.865 align:middle line:84%
Life itself, the mountains, the
stars, the rivers, the trees,

00:26:27.865 --> 00:26:31.700 align:middle line:84%
the earth, our very selves
and our own behavior,

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:35.160 align:middle line:84%
they are not looked upon
as mere signs leading

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:38.050 align:middle line:84%
to something else, mere
existences about which we

00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:39.800 align:middle line:90%
must always say, so what?

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:42.290 align:middle line:90%
Where are you going?

00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:49.210 align:middle line:84%
They are regarded as being
in a state of fulfillment

00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:52.270 align:middle line:90%
at every moment.

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And it is as Goethe said, "The
highest to which man can attain

00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:58.760 align:middle line:90%
is wonder.

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And if these prime phenomenon
of life make us wonder,

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:03.840 align:middle line:90%
that is the limit.

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:06.200 align:middle line:90%
No more should we ask."

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:08.246 align:middle line:90%
