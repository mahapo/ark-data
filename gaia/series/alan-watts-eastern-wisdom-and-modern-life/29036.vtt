00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.952 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:01.952 --> 00:00:47.280 align:middle line:90%


00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.290 align:middle line:84%
>>Man at his birth
is supple and tender.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.420 align:middle line:84%
But in death, he is
a rigid and hard.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.010 align:middle line:84%
Thus, suppleness and
tenderness accompany life.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.507 align:middle line:84%
But rigidity and
hardness accompany death.

00:01:06.507 --> 00:01:09.190 align:middle line:90%


00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.240 align:middle line:90%
I was quoting Lao-tzu.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.660 align:middle line:90%


00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.795 align:middle line:84%
The philosophy of the
strength of weakness.

00:01:17.795 --> 00:01:20.310 align:middle line:90%


00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:27.870 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's a strange thing
how I think men in the West,

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.760 align:middle line:84%
and particularly men
in the United States,

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.295 align:middle line:84%
don't realize how much
softness is strength.

00:01:36.295 --> 00:01:38.840 align:middle line:90%


00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.350 align:middle line:84%
One of old Lao-tzu favorite
analogies was water.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.220 align:middle line:84%
And he spoke of
water as the weakest

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.890 align:middle line:90%
of all things in the world.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And yet, there is nothing
to be compared with it

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.460 align:middle line:84%
in overcoming what
is hard and strong.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.082 align:middle line:90%
You can cut water with a knife.

00:01:58.082 --> 00:02:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And it lets the knife
go right through.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.760 align:middle line:84%
But when the knife
is withdrawn, there's

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.270 align:middle line:90%
not even the trace of a wound.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.880 align:middle line:90%


00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And Lao-tzu also said
that while being a man,

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.960 align:middle line:84%
one should retain a certain
essential feminine element.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And he who does this will become
a channel for the whole world.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.700 align:middle line:90%


00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.820 align:middle line:84%
The ideal of the 100% tough
guy, the rigid, rugged fellow

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:36.670 align:middle line:84%
with muscles like rocks,
is really a weakness.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.860 align:middle line:84%
Probably we assume the
sort of tough exterior

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.480 align:middle line:84%
as a hard shell to
protect ourselves, not

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.380 align:middle line:84%
so much from the
outside, as from fear

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.810 align:middle line:90%
of weakness on the inside.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.880 align:middle line:84%
What happens if
an engineer builds

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.160 align:middle line:90%
a completely rigid bridge?

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.440 align:middle line:84%
If, for example, the Golden
Gate or the George Washington

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.470 align:middle line:90%
bridges didn't sway in the wind?

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.610 align:middle line:84%
If they had no
give, no yielding,

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.880 align:middle line:90%
they'd come crashing down.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And so you can always be
sure that when a man pretends

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.690 align:middle line:84%
to be a 100% man, he's
in doubt of his manhood.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.880 align:middle line:84%
If he can allow
himself to be weak,

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.350 align:middle line:84%
he can allow himself
what is really

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.560 align:middle line:84%
the greatest strength,
not only of human beings,

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.970 align:middle line:90%
but of all living things.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And so it is upon the philosophy
of the strength of weakness

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:43.150 align:middle line:84%
that came from China to Japan,
through the migration of Zen

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.060 align:middle line:84%
Buddhism, that there has
largely been inspired

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:53.080 align:middle line:84%
one of the most astonishing
forms of self-defense

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.120 align:middle line:84%
that the world knows,
what is called judo,

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.335 align:middle line:84%
or, perhaps more
popularly, jujitsu.

00:03:59.335 --> 00:04:01.930 align:middle line:90%


00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.560 align:middle line:84%
The word "judo" is
fascinating because it means,

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.840 align:middle line:90%
"ju", the gentle, "do, way.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.170 align:middle line:84%
Do is the Japanese way of
pronouncing the Chinese Dao.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:22.160 align:middle line:84%
And so it is the gentle Dao,
the philosophy of the Dao as

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.260 align:middle line:90%
applied to self defense.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.870 align:middle line:90%


00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, this philosophy
has various components.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most basic things
to the whole practice of judo

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.025 align:middle line:90%
is an understanding of balance.

00:04:39.025 --> 00:04:41.580 align:middle line:90%


00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.910 align:middle line:84%
Balance, indeed, is
a fundamental idea

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.050 align:middle line:90%
in Daoist philosophy.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.380 align:middle line:84%
Because as I've pointed out from
time to time in these programs,

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.990 align:middle line:84%
the philosophy of the
Dao has a basic respect

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.150 align:middle line:90%
for the balance of nature.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.210 align:middle line:90%
You don't upset that balance.

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.350 align:middle line:84%
You try to find out what
it is and go along with it.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.480 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you
avoid such mistakes

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.160 align:middle line:84%
as wholesale slaughter
of an insect pest

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.900 align:middle line:84%
or introducing rabbits into
a country like Australia

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.960 align:middle line:84%
without thought as to whether
the rabbit has a natural enemy.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And through such interferences
with the balance of nature,

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.880 align:middle line:90%
you find yourself in trouble.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.010 align:middle line:84%
So the philosophy of
balance, respect for balance,

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:39.990 align:middle line:84%
is the number one thing that all
students of judo have to learn.

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes this is
illustrated with a ball.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:50.210 align:middle line:84%
You see, wherever I push
it, the ball yields.

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.420 align:middle line:90%


00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:59.030 align:middle line:84%
But the ball never
loses its balance.

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:06.910 align:middle line:84%
It's the safest form in the
world, completely contained

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:11.150 align:middle line:90%
and never off center.

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And thus to be completely
contained, never

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:22.940 align:middle line:84%
able to be put off center,
never phased by anything,

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.730 align:middle line:90%
this is what is aimed at in Zen.

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:31.330 align:middle line:90%


00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:35.100 align:middle line:84%
This is also
symbolized sometimes

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:41.140 align:middle line:84%
in the figure of the legendary
founder of Zen, Bodhidharma.

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And Japanese toy
makers represent him

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:49.560 align:middle line:84%
as a little dumpy toy figure
like a shmoo, weighted

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.330 align:middle line:84%
in such a way that
however you hit it,

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.260 align:middle line:90%
it always comes upright.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:07:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And so in the same
way, the expert in Zen,

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:05.040 align:middle line:84%
as well as in judo, as well as
in the Japanese art of fencing,

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.530 align:middle line:84%
must be a man who
is never phased.

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:11.640 align:middle line:84%
That has to say, he is never
brought to a point of doubt

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.670 align:middle line:84%
where he hesitates,
where there's

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:20.930 align:middle line:84%
an interval between the action
of life and his response to it.

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:30.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we look at these
principles of judo,

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:35.220 align:middle line:84%
the problem of balance
is easily demonstrated

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.660 align:middle line:84%
with the question of lifting
a heavy roll of material.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:41.120 align:middle line:90%


00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:50.230 align:middle line:84%
We would be foolish to try
and just pick it up like this

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:52.470 align:middle line:84%
because that shows
no understanding

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:54.150 align:middle line:90%
of the laws of balance.

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:56.330 align:middle line:84%
If you want to
lift such a thing,

00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:00.640 align:middle line:84%
you go below its center of
gravity, put your shoulder

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:08.310 align:middle line:84%
to it, and you see,
undermine it, and so lift it.

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And that principle
goes throughout judo.

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:16.840 align:middle line:90%


00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.390 align:middle line:84%
Also involved as part of
the understanding of balance

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:24.420 align:middle line:84%
in judo is to learn
to walk in such a way

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.480 align:middle line:90%
that you're never off center.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:31.550 align:middle line:84%
That is to say, your
feet-- your legs,

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:37.190 align:middle line:84%
rather, form a triangle and
your body is on the apex of it.

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And when you turn, you
always try and keep

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.100 align:middle line:84%
your feet approximately
underneath your shoulders.

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:47.280 align:middle line:84%
And in this way, you're
never off balance.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:53.750 align:middle line:84%
Now then, the second principle,
beyond keeping balance

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:56.540 align:middle line:84%
and understanding
balance, is not

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:59.300 align:middle line:90%
to oppose strength to strength.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:03.350 align:middle line:84%
When one is attacked by the
enemy, you do not oppose him.

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:05.480 align:middle line:84%
You yield to him
just like the ball

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:09.120 align:middle line:84%
and you use his strength
and the principle of balance

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.870 align:middle line:90%
to bring about his downfall.

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:12.640 align:middle line:84%
Supposing, for example,
there is a blow

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.360 align:middle line:84%
coming at me from
this direction.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:20.385 align:middle line:84%
Instead of defending oneself
and pushing the blow off,

00:09:20.385 --> 00:09:24.260 align:middle line:84%
the idea in judo is to
carry the blow this way.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:28.340 align:middle line:84%
The knee goes out, below the
adversary's point of balance.

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:34.050 align:middle line:84%
And he goes bang, on his own
initiative and your cunning.

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:36.640 align:middle line:90%


00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:40.460 align:middle line:84%
The same attitude
of, as it were,

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:46.380 align:middle line:84%
relaxed gentleness is most
beautifully seen, for instance,

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:48.950 align:middle line:90%
in watching cats.

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:54.050 align:middle line:84%
When a cat falls off a tree,
the cat let's go of itself.

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:56.940 align:middle line:84%
The cat becomes completely
relaxed and lands

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.230 align:middle line:90%
on the ground with a heavy thud.

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:03.029 align:middle line:84%
And thus, if, for example, a cat
were about to fall off a tree

00:10:03.029 --> 00:10:05.070 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly make up its
mind that it didn't want

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:09.050 align:middle line:84%
to follow at tall, and go
all tense like this, [WHINE],

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:11.420 align:middle line:84%
it would land and be just
a bag of broken bones

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.750 align:middle line:90%
when it hit the ground.

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And so in the same way
it's a philosophy of Zen

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:19.380 align:middle line:84%
that we are all
falling off a tree.

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:21.400 align:middle line:84%
That is to say the
moment we were born,

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.920 align:middle line:90%
we were kicked off a precipice.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And we're falling and there's
nothing that can stop it.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:32.319 align:middle line:84%
And so instead of going into a
state of tension all the time

00:10:32.319 --> 00:10:34.610 align:middle line:84%
and clinging to all sorts of
things, which are actually

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:38.540 align:middle line:84%
falling with us because the
whole world is impermanent,

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.520 align:middle line:90%
be like a cat.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:48.510 align:middle line:84%
And so this cat-like attitude
to falling is all through judo.

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:52.170 align:middle line:84%
If I, for example,
fall straight forward,

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:54.388 align:middle line:90%
I learn to land like a cat.

00:10:54.388 --> 00:11:00.271 align:middle line:90%
[THUD] No trouble.

00:11:00.271 --> 00:11:09.610 align:middle line:90%


00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:13.710 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, this
is the philosophy

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:16.660 align:middle line:84%
which is illustrated
in a Zen poem, which

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:22.180 align:middle line:84%
says, while living, be a
dead man, thoroughly dead.

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:26.100 align:middle line:84%
And then whatever you do, just
as you will, will be right.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:29.130 align:middle line:90%


00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:32.090 align:middle line:84%
It's again what I called
in the last program,

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:36.500 align:middle line:84%
the backwards law,
the law of paradox.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:40.500 align:middle line:84%
That in one sense the more
dead you become, the more alive

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:41.910 align:middle line:90%
you become.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:45.990 align:middle line:84%
The more soft you become,
the stronger you become.

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:49.625 align:middle line:84%
Because this is the principal
of bend and survive.

00:11:49.625 --> 00:11:52.880 align:middle line:90%


00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:59.930 align:middle line:84%
It's illustrated by the image
of the pine tree and the willow.

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:02.890 align:middle line:84%
In the snow, the
pine tree's trunk

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:08.790 align:middle line:84%
strands rigid and the snow piles
up, and piles up, and piles up.

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:09.900 align:middle line:90%
The branch doesn't give.

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And finally, crack,
and it's done for.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:15.740 align:middle line:84%
But the willow, as soon as
a little snow accumulates

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:17.190 align:middle line:90%
on the branch, down it goes.

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:21.470 align:middle line:84%
The snow falls off and the
branch springs up again.

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:25.390 align:middle line:84%
So this isn't quite
the idea of limpness.

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:27.740 align:middle line:84%
It's not softness in
the sense of being just

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:35.490 align:middle line:84%
limp and flaccid, but of
being springy, of having give.

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:39.940 align:middle line:84%
And thus, in this
way, you might say

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:44.010 align:middle line:84%
that judo would turnaround
our ordinary proverb,

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:46.830 align:middle line:84%
necessity is the
mother of invention,

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:51.480 align:middle line:84%
and say, laziness is
the mother of invention.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:56.610 align:middle line:84%
How to achieve what you want
to achieve by the easiest

00:12:56.610 --> 00:13:02.690 align:middle line:90%
possible way, by letting go.

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And this after all is the
height of intelligence.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:08.180 align:middle line:90%


00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:10.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think it would be
interesting to see this

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:14.630 align:middle line:84%
in a more practical
demonstration than I can give,

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:18.510 align:middle line:84%
by watching one of the great
modern masters of judo,

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:23.580 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Mifune in contest
with a number of pretty

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:24.265 align:middle line:90%
tough customers.

00:13:24.265 --> 00:13:25.140 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:28.996 align:middle line:84%
A little old man
of 70 years old,

00:13:28.996 --> 00:13:32.790 align:middle line:84%
here he's in contest with
a husky, young Britisher

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:35.500 align:middle line:84%
by the name of Palmer,
who's been studying judo

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:39.070 align:middle line:90%
in Japan for about 10 years.

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And little Mr. Mifune who
is 70, and very frail,

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:48.420 align:middle line:84%
he only weighs just a
little over 100 pounds,

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:53.521 align:middle line:84%
watch him work with
this tough guy.

00:13:53.521 --> 00:13:54.020 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:57.820 align:middle line:90%


00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:03.850 align:middle line:84%
Watch his balance and
how he bent to survive,

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:06.170 align:middle line:84%
pretended defeat, and
overthrew his opponent.

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:13.630 align:middle line:90%


00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:14.639 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:14:14.639 --> 00:14:15.930 align:middle line:90%
He can't catch him off balance.

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:17.270 align:middle line:90%
He's trying to trip him.

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:19.600 align:middle line:84%
But Mifune's feat are
always in the right place.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:28.580 align:middle line:90%


00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:30.180 align:middle line:84%
That was one of the
most astonishing

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:32.638 align:middle line:84%
throws I've ever seen because
there was practically no body

00:14:32.638 --> 00:14:33.140 align:middle line:90%
contact.

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:34.973 align:middle line:84%
Mifune simply seem to
do it with his wrists.

00:14:34.973 --> 00:14:37.980 align:middle line:90%


00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:41.750 align:middle line:84%
Again, notice how he goes
below the point of balance,

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:43.760 align:middle line:84%
with the knee
underneath the hips.

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:45.780 align:middle line:90%
They salute one another.

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And then another
contestant comes out.

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:49.900 align:middle line:90%
Look at this one.

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:54.830 align:middle line:84%
This is a Japanese, but pretty
close to 7 feet, a really

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:57.490 align:middle line:90%
husky fellow.

00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And incidentally, by virtue
of wearing a black belt,

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:08.980 align:middle line:84%
that means that he's attained
at least the rank of first dan.

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:11.510 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I think he's
fourth dan, as it's called.

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:14.950 align:middle line:90%
The ranks go higher.

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:16.699 align:middle line:84%
You start with one,
two, three, four.

00:15:16.699 --> 00:15:17.990 align:middle line:90%
And you can get up to about 14.

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:23.970 align:middle line:90%


00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:28.160 align:middle line:84%
Again, his efforts to put
Mr. Mifune off balance

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.770 align:middle line:90%
are absolutely to no avail.

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:32.060 align:middle line:90%
This man cannot be phased.

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:33.210 align:middle line:90%
Again, he goes down.

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:33.770 align:middle line:90%
He stoops.

00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:35.311 align:middle line:84%
And that's the end
of the big fellow.

00:15:35.311 --> 00:15:41.400 align:middle line:90%


00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:45.690 align:middle line:84%
Now you'll notice
throughout this

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:50.670 align:middle line:84%
that the important
central, fundamental thing

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:56.980 align:middle line:84%
in the Mifune's technique,
huh, is he never stops.

00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:00.110 align:middle line:90%
He never hesitates.

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:06.210 align:middle line:84%
He responds to the attack
without any interval.

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:13.280 align:middle line:84%
This also would be a
characteristic of dancing.

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:18.460 align:middle line:84%
Good dancing partners look as if
they were one single organism.

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:22.900 align:middle line:84%
There is no interval between
the man's lead and the woman's

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:24.690 align:middle line:90%
following.

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And when you are accustomed
to a partner with whom you've

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:31.560 align:middle line:84%
worked some time and who
is expert in dancing,

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:35.280 align:middle line:84%
it almost feels as if she
were part of your own body

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:39.760 align:middle line:84%
because she moves so completely
responsibly to your initiative.

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:44.870 align:middle line:84%
In just the same way, the leaf
on a tree responds to the wind.

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:48.130 align:middle line:84%
The wind blows and
the leaf doesn't just

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:51.140 align:middle line:84%
stop and think, well, should
I get around to wagging?

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:54.120 align:middle line:84%
Immediately the wind comes,
the leaf goes with it.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And the same way when you
watch a ball floating on water.

00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:00.390 align:middle line:84%
It responds instantly to
the slightest modulation

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:02.410 align:middle line:90%
of the waves.

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:06.609 align:middle line:84%
And this attitude of
their being no interval

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:12.069 align:middle line:84%
is what is the real
meaning of the Buddhist

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:15.660 align:middle line:90%
ideal of detachment.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:20.339 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that a man is
detached from the world, who

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:24.020 align:middle line:84%
has no emotions,
who has no appetite.

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:29.470 align:middle line:84%
What are attachments are
almost in the surgical sense

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:32.130 align:middle line:84%
of an attachment or a
lesion inside the body,

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:35.580 align:middle line:84%
where something sticks together
where it shouldn't stick.

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:37.900 align:middle line:84%
Stickiness is the
best translation

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:39.820 align:middle line:90%
of attachment in Buddhism.

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:45.610 align:middle line:84%
And so the expert in judo
has to be without sticky.

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:49.100 align:middle line:84%
He has to flow with
life in the same way

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:52.189 align:middle line:84%
that the ball responds to
the movements of the water.

00:17:52.189 --> 00:17:53.480 align:middle line:90%
And then he's never caught out.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:56.180 align:middle line:90%


00:17:56.180 --> 00:18:01.300 align:middle line:84%
Aside from judo, Zen has had
perhaps even more influence

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:04.600 align:middle line:84%
on the Japanese the
fencing called kendo.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:08.000 align:middle line:84%
"Ken" is the sword, "do,"
the Way of the Sword.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And this surprises many
people because they

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:16.870 align:middle line:84%
think how can the pacific
philosophy of Buddhism

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:19.470 align:middle line:84%
be connected with
anything so ferocious

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:21.640 align:middle line:90%
as the art of fighting?

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:23.840 align:middle line:90%
But it was.

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Shortly after Zen Buddhism
was introduced into Japan,

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:30.130 align:middle line:84%
it became the
favorite way of life

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:33.950 align:middle line:84%
of the samurai, those
feudal Japanese warriors who

00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:37.150 align:middle line:84%
were for many centuries
there involved

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:42.160 align:middle line:84%
in perpetual civil war between
the various feudal lords.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And as they lived in constant
danger, constant insecurity,

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:50.660 align:middle line:84%
they took up Zen as a way of
peace in the midst of fighting.

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:53.680 align:middle line:84%
But what about the
ethics of this?

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:57.040 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me quite
a simple problem.

00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:01.090 align:middle line:84%
Either we're going to have
fighting and war or we're not.

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:04.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we've made up our minds
that it's necessary to fight,

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:07.060 align:middle line:84%
that there must
be soldiers, then

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:12.500 align:middle line:84%
surely there is no
alternative but to do it well.

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:16.030 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if you're going
to chop somebody's head off,

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:18.580 align:middle line:84%
chop it off with
complete decision

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:23.900 align:middle line:84%
because a half-hearted chop is
very agonizing for the victim.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:26.590 align:middle line:84%
So in the same way,
as somebody said,

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:28.920 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to tell a
lie, make it a good one.

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.510 align:middle line:84%
No shilly-shallying
about these things.

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:33.360 align:middle line:90%
And that's the attitude of Zen.

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:36.060 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to do an
evil deed, really do it.

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:39.620 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to make a
mistake, make a good one.

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And so the whole
philosophy of the sword

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:45.420 align:middle line:90%
is deeply imbued with Zen.

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:48.375 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at one
of these Japanese swords.

00:19:48.375 --> 00:19:51.500 align:middle line:90%


00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.530 align:middle line:90%
They venerate these things.

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:58.390 align:middle line:84%
Look how beautifully this
is wrapped in its silk case,

00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:01.060 align:middle line:84%
with brocade on
it, a lovely thing.

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:03.810 align:middle line:90%


00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:10.930 align:middle line:84%
This one has a blade, oh,
probably about 400 years old.

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And it was lent to
me by Mr. Shibata.

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:19.820 align:middle line:90%


00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:25.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a terrifying
instrument, just

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:30.750 align:middle line:84%
a great, big, heavy,
two-handed razor.

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:31.380 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:40.610 align:middle line:90%


00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:47.600 align:middle line:84%
Worn at the side, you don't
draw it and then go into action.

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.390 align:middle line:84%
You can draw it and go
into action at one moment.

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:53.820 align:middle line:90%


00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And its principle
of balance is such

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:02.465 align:middle line:84%
that the right hand holds
it at its convenient center

00:21:02.465 --> 00:21:03.705 align:middle line:90%
of balance.

00:21:03.705 --> 00:21:06.820 align:middle line:84%
And the left hand can
simply control the movement

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:10.020 align:middle line:84%
very rapidly, with a good
principle of leverage.

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:12.750 align:middle line:84%
So that practically
all the defense

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:15.270 align:middle line:84%
of blows from either
side is simply

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:18.870 align:middle line:84%
accomplished by slight
movements of the blade from side

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:22.290 align:middle line:84%
to side, giving great
economy of movement.

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:25.760 align:middle line:84%
There is sometimes only one
rather startling and dramatic

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:28.140 align:middle line:84%
looking form of defense
used against a blow

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:33.020 align:middle line:84%
to the head, which is one
that turns into a cut, thus.

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:37.490 align:middle line:84%
The principal
movements of the sword,

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:39.820 align:middle line:84%
always taking the
center of gravity

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:44.470 align:middle line:84%
as what is called in Japanese
seika tanden or the belly,

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:47.930 align:middle line:84%
the belly center,
the solar plexus.

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:53.850 align:middle line:84%
The blows are to the neck this
way, to the neck that way,

00:21:53.850 --> 00:22:00.510 align:middle line:84%
to the side, the wrist
cut, and only one thrust

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:03.890 align:middle line:90%
straight at the throat.

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And then the blow
to the head, ho!

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:13.120 align:middle line:84%
You've probably heard that
shout on samurai films.

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And you wonder
perhaps what that is?

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:20.190 align:middle line:90%
That comes from Zen.

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:23.860 align:middle line:84%
There was an old Chinese
Zen master called Rinzai.

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And when people asked him what
is the meaning of Buddhism,

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:29.130 align:middle line:90%
he'd say, ho!

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:32.220 align:middle line:90%


00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:34.610 align:middle line:84%
They were profoundly
disconcerted.

00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:36.160 align:middle line:84%
If you're a
philosophical gentleman,

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:39.570 align:middle line:84%
you don't answer polite
questions like that.

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:43.050 align:middle line:84%
But that again is a trap,
to see if the questioner can

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:45.070 align:middle line:90%
be phased and thrown off center.

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And so in the same way,
the samurai in attack

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:51.480 align:middle line:84%
uses the same terrifying
shout, as it were,

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:54.920 align:middle line:84%
to startle his opponent
into losing his balance

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.330 align:middle line:90%
and thinking for a moment.

00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And if he thinks and
hesitates, he's lost.

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:01.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, the
practice of this

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:04.050 align:middle line:84%
is carried out
with bamboo swords.

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:05.170 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And we can watch a young
Japanese fencing student

00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:15.530 align:middle line:84%
putting on his bamboo armor
and getting ready for a bout.

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:21.850 align:middle line:84%
They wear this helmet, which
is somewhat like the old style

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:25.630 align:middle line:84%
steel helmets worn by the
samurai in medieval times.

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And they wear breast plates
of lacquer and heavily

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.970 align:middle line:90%
padded gauntlets.

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And then in the fencing
room, they salute one another

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:38.600 align:middle line:90%
and start in.

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:41.725 align:middle line:84%
And now you can see this
two-handed sword in use.

00:23:41.725 --> 00:24:02.160 align:middle line:90%


00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:11.040 align:middle line:84%
This then, again, as in judo,
one must move without stopping.

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:16.335 align:middle line:84%
So in fencing, there is to
be no interval between attack

00:24:16.335 --> 00:24:16.835 align:middle line:90%
and defense.

00:24:16.835 --> 00:24:19.410 align:middle line:90%


00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:25.000 align:middle line:84%
Watching good fencers, they seem
to dance together and, as it

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.360 align:middle line:84%
were, be going through
the motions as one body.

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And then there's just
that critical moment

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:35.600 align:middle line:84%
when one man loses his
guard and he's done for.

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:40.270 align:middle line:84%
So the attitude is called, in
Chinese, "mo chih chu," which

00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:42.280 align:middle line:90%
means going straight ahead.

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:45.830 align:middle line:84%
A Zen poem says, under
the sword lifted high,

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:48.920 align:middle line:90%
is hell making you tremble?

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:54.360 align:middle line:84%
But go straight ahead and
there is the land of bliss.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:59.110 align:middle line:84%
No stopping, complete
response to the moment.

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And this is particularly
true, for example,

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:05.210 align:middle line:84%
if a single man is surrounded
with several opponents.

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:07.490 align:middle line:84%
He can't hesitate
and wonder what

00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:10.970 align:middle line:84%
is this fellow going to do next
because when he's defending

00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:13.680 align:middle line:84%
himself here, and
he, as it were,

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:17.610 align:middle line:84%
his mind is stuck
on an opponent here,

00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:20.550 align:middle line:84%
he can be caught unawares
from an opponent over there.

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:24.850 align:middle line:84%
So what he has is what is called
an unstuck mind, an ability

00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:27.950 align:middle line:84%
to be alert to the whole
situation around you

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:29.430 align:middle line:84%
so that if your
mind gets fastened

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:32.840 align:middle line:84%
at any particular point,
you're caught by that point.

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And so this unstuck mind is
the fundamental requirement,

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:39.440 align:middle line:84%
not only for the
artist in fencing,

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:44.730 align:middle line:84%
but also for the
practitioner of Buddhism.

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:51.900 align:middle line:84%
Now in the hands of
a man who is really

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:57.600 align:middle line:84%
both adept in Zen
and adept in fencing,

00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:02.880 align:middle line:84%
the sword of destruction
can in a curious way

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.080 align:middle line:90%
to become a symbol of mercy.

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:07.150 align:middle line:84%
For the highest school
of Japanese fencing

00:26:07.150 --> 00:26:12.690 align:middle line:84%
is called the no sword
school, to be able never

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:15.090 align:middle line:90%
to use the sword.

00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:18.700 align:middle line:84%
A good story about this
as it was a great samurai

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:21.150 align:middle line:90%
traveling on a ferry boat.

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And just as they
were putting off,

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:27.450 align:middle line:84%
another drunken, rowdy samurai
stepped on and started bragging

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:28.680 align:middle line:90%
about his powers.

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.330 align:middle line:84%
And he turned to
the first samurai

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:34.390 align:middle line:84%
and said, well, what's your
school of sportsmanship?

00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And the first samurai
politely answered,

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.600 align:middle line:90%
mine is the no sword school.

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:39.690 align:middle line:90%
Ha, ha, he said.

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:41.927 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to see your
no sword school.

00:26:41.927 --> 00:26:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And immediately he
challenged him to a fight

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:45.486 align:middle line:90%
and pulled out his sword.

00:26:45.486 --> 00:26:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And the first samurai
said, excuse me,

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:51.210 align:middle line:84%
but if we find on this boat, we
made hurt innocent bystanders.

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:54.750 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we go and fight
on that island over there?

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:57.070 align:middle line:84%
So they got the boatmen
to move over to the island

00:26:57.070 --> 00:27:00.930 align:middle line:84%
and as they arrived, the ruffian
jumped off onto the island,

00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:02.150 align:middle line:90%
all ready to begin the fight.

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment,
the other samurai

00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:07.330 align:middle line:84%
grabbed the oar from the
boatmen and pushed the boat away

00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:10.650 align:middle line:84%
into the water and left
the rowdy stranded.

00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:14.320 align:middle line:84%
There, he said, is
my no sword school.

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.510 align:middle line:84%
This applies, too, even
in the actual making

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:21.325 align:middle line:84%
of the sword by the swordsmiths,
whose craft in Japan

00:27:21.325 --> 00:27:23.960 align:middle line:90%
is something of a ritual.

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And as an example of
no sword, in the work

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:30.320 align:middle line:84%
of a very skilled swordsmith,
let me tell this story.

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.367 align:middle line:84%
There were two
swordsmiths in old Japan,

00:27:32.367 --> 00:27:34.617 align:middle line:84%
one who was considered the
greatest and the other just

00:27:34.617 --> 00:27:36.016 align:middle line:90%
a little inferior.

00:27:36.016 --> 00:27:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And they had a test
one day as to which

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.890 align:middle line:90%
of them made the best blade.

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:43.460 align:middle line:84%
And they first took the blade
of the second best swordsman

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:46.130 align:middle line:84%
and put it in the stream like
this and set a piece of paper

00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:48.050 align:middle line:90%
floating down towards it.

00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And the sword simply slid
through the piece of paper.

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:53.200 align:middle line:84%
And it joined
together and went on.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.360 align:middle line:90%
How could that be improved?

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:56.920 align:middle line:84%
They put in the sort of
the greatest swordsmith.

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:58.310 align:middle line:90%
How good he go better than that?

00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:00.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, what happened
was the piece of paper

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:03.860 align:middle line:84%
came down like this and it
went round it and went on.

00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:07.101 align:middle line:90%


00:28:07.101 --> 00:28:09.770 align:middle line:90%
