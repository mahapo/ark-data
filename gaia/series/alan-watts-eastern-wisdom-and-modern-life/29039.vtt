[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.473 --> 00:00:58.970 align:middle line:90%


00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.430 align:middle line:84%
>>When we compare
Christianity with Buddhism,

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.590 align:middle line:84%
the first thing to
remember is that we

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.070 align:middle line:84%
are talking about two
very different things.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's really confusing when
you try to treat both of them

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.780 align:middle line:90%
under the name of religion.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.460 align:middle line:90%


00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.320 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there are many books
about comparative religions,

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.430 align:middle line:84%
but somehow when you see put
together under the same class

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.250 align:middle line:84%
things which are so different
as Christianity on the one hand

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.890 align:middle line:84%
or Buddhism on the other,
it gives me at any rate

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.340 align:middle line:84%
the same kind of shock I
would get as if I were reading

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.600 align:middle line:84%
a book about geology
and suddenly came

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.805 align:middle line:90%
upon a chapter on birds.

00:01:48.805 --> 00:01:52.060 align:middle line:90%


00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think the lack
of understanding

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:05.060 align:middle line:84%
that the functions, the
aims, of these two traditions

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.330 align:middle line:84%
are so different, if we could
understand this clearly,

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.000 align:middle line:84%
it would make for a great
deal less recrimination

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.222 align:middle line:84%
between people who
like to say, well,

00:02:18.222 --> 00:02:19.555 align:middle line:90%
my religion's better than yours.

00:02:19.555 --> 00:02:22.140 align:middle line:90%


00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.160 align:middle line:84%
You see, the word religion
is a very vague word,

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.370 align:middle line:84%
and it's used for so
many different things.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And if we will agree to use the
word religion for Christianity

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.090 align:middle line:84%
and for things like
Christianity, such as Judaism

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.930 align:middle line:84%
or Islam, then we would have
to find another word altogether

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:47.800 align:middle line:90%
for Buddhism.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.350 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise,
the word religion

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.450 align:middle line:84%
would mean so many different
things as to mean nothing.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.350 align:middle line:84%
Now strictly, the
word "religion"

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:04.380 align:middle line:84%
comes from a Latin verb
meaning "to bind back."

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And thus the essence of a
religion is a rule of life.

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.700 align:middle line:84%
If you use the word "religion"
in its very, very strict sense

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.160 align:middle line:84%
and you say of someone that
he's gone into religion,

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.690 align:middle line:84%
this doesn't mean that he
suddenly got converted.

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.270 align:middle line:84%
It means that he joined
a religious order-- that

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.630 align:middle line:84%
is to say, became
a monk or a nun.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And that is one, in other
words, who submits himself

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.880 align:middle line:90%
to a rule or law of life.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.880 align:middle line:90%


00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:44.470 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, Buddhism
is not a submission to a rule.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And I have called Buddhism
a way of liberation

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:48.900 align:middle line:90%
instead of a religion.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.520 align:middle line:90%


00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And we can see the
difference most effectively

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.250 align:middle line:84%
if we look at Buddhism
and Christianity

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.100 align:middle line:84%
with regard to their
different social functions.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.980 align:middle line:84%
A religion like Christianity
serves the social function

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.380 align:middle line:84%
of cementing a
community together,

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:18.430 align:middle line:84%
giving that community its
laws, its principles of ethics,

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.665 align:middle line:90%
and its common objectives.

00:04:19.665 --> 00:04:22.440 align:middle line:90%


00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.330 align:middle line:84%
The function of Buddhism,
on the other hand,

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.720 align:middle line:84%
as a way of liberation
is, as it were,

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:37.870 align:middle line:84%
to provide a cure for the
inevitable ill effects

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.080 align:middle line:84%
of making the conventions
of a community

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.520 align:middle line:84%
too strong, making the bonds
of a community too strong.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.870 align:middle line:84%
We all realize
nowadays that it's

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.350 align:middle line:84%
very unhealthy for a society to
be too conformist, to rule out

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.360 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of eccentricity,
individuality,

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.330 align:middle line:90%
and independent thought.

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.130 align:middle line:84%
At the same time,
it would be equally

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.070 align:middle line:84%
unhealthy to go to
the other extreme

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.550 align:middle line:84%
and have everybody
acting, talking,

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.070 align:middle line:90%
and thinking at cross purposes.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And so in this way, a religion
and a way of liberation

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.260 align:middle line:90%
complement one another.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And a way of liberation
can prevent a religion

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.595 align:middle line:84%
from becoming too
great a burden.

00:05:22.595 --> 00:05:24.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's a
wonderful Chinese proverb

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.660 align:middle line:90%
which I always enjoy.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:32.050 align:middle line:84%
"Do not swat a fly on a
friend's head with a hatchet."

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And thus when the law is
laid down too firmly--

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.410 align:middle line:84%
and all religions have the
temptation to do this--

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.170 align:middle line:84%
it puts the observance
of the law in danger,

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:45.820 align:middle line:84%
just as swatting the fly on a
friend's head with a hatchet

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.410 align:middle line:90%
puts his head in danger.

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:54.765 align:middle line:84%
Now you see, a religion,
then, as I've defined

00:05:54.765 --> 00:06:01.320 align:middle line:84%
it comes into being because
of the necessity for someone

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.326 align:middle line:84%
to lay down the law
in order that there

00:06:04.326 --> 00:06:05.450 align:middle line:90%
shall be a human community.

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.990 align:middle line:90%


00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.740 align:middle line:84%
And so if we go back to the
social origins of religion,

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.610 align:middle line:84%
I can think we can understand
how this purpose works.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And so let's go and
look at the board,

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.100 align:middle line:84%
and I want to try and put
this in a diagrammatic form.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:44.170 align:middle line:90%


00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:50.930 align:middle line:84%
Religions as a phenomenon seem
to have arisen historically

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:54.290 align:middle line:84%
with the transition from
what we might call hunting

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:58.480 align:middle line:90%
cultures to agrarian cultures.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.410 align:middle line:84%
In the type of life
which we'd call

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:04.830 align:middle line:84%
a hunting or nomadic
culture, we don't really

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:09.650 align:middle line:84%
have religion in any
institutional sense.

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.995 align:middle line:84%
Instead of the priest,
there is the shaman.

00:07:12.995 --> 00:07:16.150 align:middle line:90%


00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And a shaman is a man who
has a religious experience

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.020 align:middle line:90%
of his own.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.260 align:middle line:84%
He goes out into
the forest and he

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:30.470 align:middle line:84%
meditates, he encounters
the forces of the unknown,

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:32.740 align:middle line:84%
the spirits, or
whatever it may be.

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And from his own experience,
he acquires his magical powers,

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:40.350 align:middle line:84%
which give him a certain
respect in the community.

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And also in the hunting
culture, every male member

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:48.150 align:middle line:84%
of the culture knows
all the culture.

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.510 align:middle line:84%
In other words, he knows
all the arts and skills

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:52.622 align:middle line:90%
necessary for survival.

00:07:52.622 --> 00:07:57.210 align:middle line:84%
But a very different situation
arises where a settled agrarian

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:59.036 align:middle line:90%
culture comes to birth.

00:07:59.036 --> 00:08:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And rather naturally,
such a culture

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.650 align:middle line:84%
comes to birth at a
place where people

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:08.680 align:middle line:84%
meet-- you might
say at a crossroads.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.190 align:middle line:90%


00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And where people
meet and settle,

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.720 align:middle line:84%
they tend of course to build
a village and a protection

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:27.250 align:middle line:84%
around it, a stockade,
which not only is

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:29.970 align:middle line:84%
the physical stockade
protecting them

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:33.820 align:middle line:84%
from enemies and wild
animals, but also the stockade

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:37.789 align:middle line:84%
of the rules of behavior by
which that community must

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:38.289 align:middle line:90%
abide.

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:40.870 align:middle line:90%


00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:44.240 align:middle line:84%
In addition to the necessity
for a settled community

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:49.490 align:middle line:84%
to agree about ways
of behavior and laws,

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:51.940 align:middle line:84%
it must also agree
about language.

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:55.080 align:middle line:84%
But furthermore, in the more
complex life of an agrarian

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.270 align:middle line:84%
community, there must
be a division of labor

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:01.480 align:middle line:84%
and a division of functions,
so that the male members

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:06.230 align:middle line:84%
of the community no longer are
masters of the whole culture.

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And we find there is a tendency
to divide the specializations

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:16.210 align:middle line:84%
or functions of people
into four main groups.

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:18.870 align:middle line:84%
So that if we look at
ancient Hindu society

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:24.220 align:middle line:84%
we shall find the groups named
as follows, the four castes.

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:36.110 align:middle line:84%
The caste called brahmana,
that is a priesthood.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:45.395 align:middle line:84%
The caste called
kshatriya, nobility.

00:09:45.395 --> 00:09:48.472 align:middle line:90%


00:09:48.472 --> 00:10:01.380 align:middle line:84%
A caste called vaishya, those
would be merchants and farmers.

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And finally, a caste
called sudra, the laborers,

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:12.260 align:middle line:84%
the hewers of wood and
the drawers of water.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.470 align:middle line:90%


00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And then in this way, as I said,
a community is constituted.

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:23.790 align:middle line:90%
Classes are divided.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And the classes originally
correspond not so much

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:30.320 align:middle line:84%
to questions of
prestige and rank

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.310 align:middle line:84%
but simply to
divisions of function.

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:36.320 align:middle line:84%
Later on, of course, problems
of rank and prestige arise.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:41.410 align:middle line:84%
But this is the fundamental
pattern of Hindu society,

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:44.560 align:middle line:84%
and we can compare it
with almost exactly

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:50.850 align:middle line:84%
the same fundamental pattern
of medieval Western Christian

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:54.230 align:middle line:90%
society under the feudal system.

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:59.445 align:middle line:84%
For here you have an exactly
similar division of functions.

00:10:59.445 --> 00:11:03.190 align:middle line:90%


00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:07.600 align:middle line:84%
The lords spiritual, or
the priests, the church.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:11.920 align:middle line:90%


00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:20.620 align:middle line:84%
The nobility-- the kings princes
and dukes, and feudal lords.

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:23.835 align:middle line:84%
The agriculturists and
merchants, called the commons.

00:11:23.835 --> 00:11:28.820 align:middle line:90%


00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:35.420 align:middle line:84%
And finally, the serfs,
corresponding exactly

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.255 align:middle line:90%
to the sudra, the slaves.

00:11:37.255 --> 00:11:40.500 align:middle line:90%


00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:45.880 align:middle line:84%
And so you see that
in order to maintain

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:54.400 align:middle line:84%
this kind of arrangement,
the uncultured individual,

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:59.420 align:middle line:84%
the spontaneous type of man who
would be your nomadic hunting

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:03.350 align:middle line:84%
type, has to submit
himself to a rule.

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:06.320 align:middle line:90%
He has to be put under a yoke.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:12.090 align:middle line:84%
And so he has to sacrifice
himself for the common welfare,

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:16.530 align:middle line:84%
and this might be called
a kind of cruciformation,

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:18.110 align:middle line:90%
or crucifixion, of man.

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:21.060 align:middle line:90%


00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And thus in this way, the
crucifix, the central emblem

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:middle line:84%
of Christianity,
becomes a symbol

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:34.300 align:middle line:84%
of this particular
function of religion.

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.210 align:middle line:84%
But you'll see when you
look at this crucifix,

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:40.820 align:middle line:84%
that it has a rather
rich quality, that it

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.600 align:middle line:90%
is almost regal.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
situation, you see,

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:51.230 align:middle line:84%
when a society and the
religion are at one,

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:55.000 align:middle line:84%
as when in feudal
Europe, Christianity

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.870 align:middle line:84%
was the religion
of the ruling class

00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:59.240 align:middle line:90%
and of everybody in the society.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.960 align:middle line:84%
And so the symbol of
the suffering Christ

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:07.080 align:middle line:84%
becomes, as it were, identical
with the spirit of sacrifice

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.430 align:middle line:90%
for the common good.

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And you will see
also that if you

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:17.370 align:middle line:84%
look at, say, a painting such
as this, The Annunciation

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:21.700 align:middle line:84%
by Martini, from
approximately the same period,

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:27.130 align:middle line:84%
that the setting of the
personages in the picture

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:29.980 align:middle line:90%
is extremely luxurious.

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Look in at a detail of
the Virgin Mary's face

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:37.610 align:middle line:84%
and see the rich
garment that surrounds

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:40.750 align:middle line:84%
her and the glorious
aureole behind her head.

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:44.150 align:middle line:84%
Not a peasant woman
at all, but a queen.

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And this is the point
of view of the artist,

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:50.840 align:middle line:84%
of a conception of
Christianity when

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:54.210 align:middle line:84%
Christianity and the
social order are identical.

00:13:54.210 --> 00:14:03.310 align:middle line:84%
When, in other words, the
symbol of the divine being

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:07.800 align:middle line:90%
is at one with the social order.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:11.200 align:middle line:84%
But of course, there is
a kind of double nature

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.460 align:middle line:84%
about Christianity
in this respect.

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:17.230 align:middle line:84%
Because on the one
hand, we will speak

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:20.580 align:middle line:84%
of Christianity in a
society where Christianity

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:24.890 align:middle line:84%
is firmly established as
being the religion which

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:26.260 align:middle line:90%
upholds the society.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.780 align:middle line:90%


00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:32.740 align:middle line:84%
In other words, to
be a good Christian

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:38.170 align:middle line:84%
would also to be a good
member of the society.

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:40.010 align:middle line:84%
But there is
something paradoxical

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:42.470 align:middle line:84%
in the whole history
of Christianity.

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:47.380 align:middle line:84%
Because Jesus himself was not
acknowledged by his own society

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:49.530 align:middle line:84%
as being a particularly
good member of it.

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:52.580 align:middle line:90%
In fact, it put him to death.

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And this was because he was in
the great tradition of Hebrew

00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:58.700 align:middle line:90%
prophetism.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:02.520 align:middle line:84%
The prophet was always
the man who came--

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.760 align:middle line:84%
or a sort of wandering
dervish, as a matter

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:08.270 align:middle line:84%
of fact, who came in from
the wilderness, who came in

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:13.760 align:middle line:84%
from outside society to say
to the priests and the nobles

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.600 align:middle line:84%
and the merchants and the
serfs, you have fallen away

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:21.230 align:middle line:84%
from the will of God, and
you're not doing right.

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And he would condemn
that society--

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:28.860 align:middle line:84%
but of course with the object of
restoring the order of society

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:31.300 align:middle line:90%
to the order of God.

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And so Jesus is,
in a way, thought

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.570 align:middle line:84%
of in Christianity
in both these roles,

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:46.070 align:middle line:84%
or has been thought of, as
on the one hand the upholder

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:52.480 align:middle line:84%
and lord d of the Christian
society and on the other hand

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:57.990 align:middle line:84%
as the prophet, the one
despised and rejected

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:04.210 align:middle line:84%
of men, the suffering god
coming into human society

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:07.070 align:middle line:90%
in order to change it.

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And of course, as the feudal
system of Europe broke up

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:18.190 align:middle line:84%
and Western society
tend to turn against it,

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:23.880 align:middle line:84%
you pass from these somewhat
regal representations of Christ

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:29.870 align:middle line:84%
to the representation of
him in intense suffering--

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:33.690 align:middle line:84%
as, for example,
in the fantastic

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:39.430 align:middle line:84%
Isenheim Altarpiece by
Grunewald, where Christ

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:44.235 align:middle line:84%
is depicted crucified on the
most rough, brutally wooden

00:16:44.235 --> 00:16:44.735 align:middle line:90%
cross.

00:16:44.735 --> 00:16:47.620 align:middle line:90%


00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:50.210 align:middle line:90%
Tortured completely.

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And those around him showing
every emotion of agony.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:58.150 align:middle line:84%
This is Christ the
revolutionary prophet,

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:01.300 align:middle line:84%
condemned by the world,
as distinct from Christ

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:07.690 align:middle line:84%
the triumphant ruler,
the pillar and mainstay

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:09.639 align:middle line:90%
of the Christian society.

00:17:09.639 --> 00:17:13.819 align:middle line:90%


00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And so, in a way, both Hindu
society and Christian society

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:26.270 align:middle line:84%
have this paradoxical
element in them.

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:31.470 align:middle line:84%
For the Hindu society
always recognizes

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:37.120 align:middle line:84%
the right of an individual
to break from society.

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:43.720 align:middle line:84%
You see, there's a kind of
pattern of life in India

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:49.050 align:middle line:84%
whereby when you've fulfilled
your work in society

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:51.880 align:middle line:84%
in whatever caste
you happen to be,

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:56.580 align:middle line:84%
and you, say, have raised a
son who can carry your work on,

00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:02.290 align:middle line:84%
you can then leave caste
and go back to the forest.

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:06.750 align:middle line:84%
That is to say, you
can become a holy man.

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:11.190 align:middle line:84%
And the holy man is called,
in Sanskrit, vanaprastha.

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:17.200 align:middle line:90%


00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.660 align:middle line:90%
That means a forest-dweller.

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:22.790 align:middle line:90%


00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:27.510 align:middle line:84%
The man who, in other
words, returns back again

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:30.020 align:middle line:90%
to the state of nature.

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.840 align:middle line:84%
Only he is a very
different kind of man

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.390 align:middle line:84%
from the man who came
out of nature into this.

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:middle line:90%
He has undergone a discipline.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:43.420 align:middle line:84%
He has been forced to fit into
one of these compartments.

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:45.065 align:middle line:84%
He has, in a way,
been crucified.

00:18:45.065 --> 00:18:47.610 align:middle line:90%


00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:51.640 align:middle line:84%
And so he returns out of
this to find out again

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:53.120 align:middle line:90%
who he really is.

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:56.870 align:middle line:84%
He no longer identifies himself
with the Reverend So-and-so,

00:18:56.870 --> 00:19:00.230 align:middle line:84%
the priest, or with the Lord
So-and-so, the noble, or Mr.

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:04.670 align:middle line:84%
So-and-so, the merchant,
or Bill Smith, the laborer.

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:09.070 align:middle line:84%
But he seeks again to
find his true identity.

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:11.510 align:middle line:84%
And so in a parallel
way, but with rather

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:16.450 align:middle line:84%
different ideas
involved, in the West,

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:21.300 align:middle line:84%
outside these four
castes, there could always

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:29.720 align:middle line:84%
be the hermit, or the cloistered
monk, outside society.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
that when the Hindu

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:36.960 align:middle line:84%
monk or the Christian
monk leaves society,

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:42.120 align:middle line:84%
he renounces his class and
he takes on a new name.

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And the character of that
name is usually a divine name.

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:51.230 align:middle line:84%
He becomes, instead of
Joe Doakes, Brother Peter,

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:53.580 align:middle line:84%
taking the name
Peter the Apostle.

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:56.830 align:middle line:84%
Instead of being Mr.
Mukhapadjaya in India,

00:19:56.830 --> 00:20:02.220 align:middle line:84%
he comes Krishnananda, the
name of Krishna and bliss.

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:04.230 align:middle line:84%
He takes a divine
name, indicating,

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:06.880 align:middle line:84%
you see, the transformation
of his personality.

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:10.100 align:middle line:84%
He's no longer, as it
were, a chopped-up person.

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:12.250 align:middle line:90%
He's no longer divided.

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:17.430 align:middle line:84%
Because this division
of labor divides man.

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:18.630 align:middle line:90%
He becomes again one.

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:20.860 align:middle line:90%
He becomes again integrated.

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:24.595 align:middle line:84%
He is, in a sense, remembered,
having been dismembered.

00:20:24.595 --> 00:20:27.680 align:middle line:90%


00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:32.300 align:middle line:84%
And so it's interesting,
then, against this background

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.540 align:middle line:84%
to see a very
important difference

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:38.560 align:middle line:90%
between Jesus and the Buddha.

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:42.120 align:middle line:84%
From what caste did
the Buddha come?

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:46.970 align:middle line:84%
He came from the kshatriya
caste, the class of nobles.

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:47.910 align:middle line:90%
He was a prince.

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:50.750 align:middle line:84%
He was heir to his
father's throne,

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:53.580 align:middle line:90%
and he renounced that throne.

00:20:53.580 --> 00:21:01.830 align:middle line:84%
Jesus was a carpenter and came
from the caste of the laborers.

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:04.700 align:middle line:84%
And this makes an
enormous difference.

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:07.980 align:middle line:84%
Look for a moment at
Rembrandt's conception

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:11.260 align:middle line:90%
of the crucified Christ.

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:17.130 align:middle line:84%
Here is no regal figure, but
a strong, muscular laborer,

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:19.030 align:middle line:90%
suffering.

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:22.330 align:middle line:84%
A man, as a matter of
fact, who in the world

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:27.090 align:middle line:84%
has never had authority,
and who stands always

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:30.460 align:middle line:90%
for the underdog, the depressed.

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And for this reason, the
emphasis of Christianity

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:38.100 align:middle line:84%
is constantly upon
transforming society

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:41.850 align:middle line:84%
and improving it and
making it better.

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:47.125 align:middle line:84%
But look at this very
typical face of Buddha.

00:21:47.125 --> 00:21:50.550 align:middle line:90%


00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:54.430 align:middle line:84%
Typical of so many
Buddha images,

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:57.540 align:middle line:84%
because the face is
unquestionably regal,

00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:02.305 align:middle line:84%
aristocratic, calm--
but, in a way, resigned.

00:22:02.305 --> 00:22:06.151 align:middle line:90%


00:22:06.151 --> 00:22:10.588 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:10.588 --> 00:22:18.490 align:middle line:90%


00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And this speaks a great
deal for the difference

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:24.270 align:middle line:84%
between Christianity
and Buddhism.

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:27.740 align:middle line:90%


00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:34.490 align:middle line:84%
On the one hand,
Christianity is vitally

00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:39.630 align:middle line:84%
concerned with the
transformation of the world.

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:45.530 align:middle line:84%
It is fundamentally a
revolutionary doctrine.

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:49.470 align:middle line:90%
And also a historical doctrine.

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:53.400 align:middle line:84%
That is to say,
when you consider

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.510 align:middle line:84%
what Christian
doctrines are, they

00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:59.700 align:middle line:84%
are really the
telling of a story.

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:01.970 align:middle line:84%
The doctrine can be
summed up so briefly

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:04.530 align:middle line:84%
by saying that in
the beginning, there

00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:07.690 align:middle line:90%
was God, who created the world.

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:12.510 align:middle line:84%
But that through the evil
one and through the fall

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:16.080 align:middle line:84%
of man, the world fell
away from the perfection

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:18.700 align:middle line:90%
in which he made it.

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:23.300 align:middle line:84%
To restore it to that
perfection, God the son

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:27.660 align:middle line:84%
himself entered into
the world and became man

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:33.820 align:middle line:84%
in the historical Jesus of
Nazareth, and took upon himself

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:36.530 align:middle line:84%
all the tragedy, all the
evil, and all the suffering

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:39.950 align:middle line:84%
of the world in the
act of being crucified.

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:42.390 align:middle line:84%
And in doing this,
he, as it were,

00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:45.980 align:middle line:84%
united the divine nature and
the divine power with death

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:49.920 align:middle line:84%
itself in such a way
as to transform death.

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:55.890 align:middle line:84%
He rose from the dead
and founded a church.

00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:57.835 align:middle line:84%
Note this-- he
founded a community.

00:23:57.835 --> 00:24:00.710 align:middle line:90%


00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And this community
has as its purpose,

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:09.720 align:middle line:84%
as it were, the bringing
together of the whole universe,

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:14.310 align:middle line:90%
back to the sovereignty of God.

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:16.840 align:middle line:90%


00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:20.770 align:middle line:84%
So it is a historical
religion, looking

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:25.930 align:middle line:84%
for its fulfillment
in the course of time.

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:30.100 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, its
objective is to put God--

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:32.520 align:middle line:84%
or to acknowledge God,
rather, not to put him--

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:35.850 align:middle line:90%
as a ruler of the universe.

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:38.400 align:middle line:84%
For it is fundamental
to the whole conception

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:42.120 align:middle line:84%
of Christianity that
God is the ruler.

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And here one sees the figure of
God the Son, the Eternal Word,

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:50.150 align:middle line:84%
in the act of
creating the world.

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:54.700 align:middle line:84%
Notice how he is measuring
it out with his compasses,

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:58.510 align:middle line:84%
creating it, as it
were, as an artifact.

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And so the goal of Christianity
is the kingdom of God.

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And you see in, say,
Dante's Paradiso,

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:11.040 align:middle line:84%
where the final version of
the perfection of the world

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:17.200 align:middle line:84%
is shown, that it is a vision of
the rulership of God over all.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:22.680 align:middle line:84%
For he says in the end,
"But my volition now

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:27.020 align:middle line:84%
and my desires were moved like
wheel revolving evenly by love

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:32.120 align:middle line:84%
that moves the sun
and starry fires."

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:36.740 align:middle line:84%
So the monarchical ideal of
everything perfectly submitted

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:41.530 align:middle line:84%
to the will of God is contrasted
with the ideal of the Buddha,

00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:46.280 align:middle line:84%
who having been a monarch is
not so interested in monarchy.

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:52.160 align:middle line:84%
Having been a monarch, he has
seen the difficulties of rule

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:54.640 align:middle line:90%
and is not anxious to rule.

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:58.030 align:middle line:84%
And in the Buddhist
conception of the universe,

00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:00.100 align:middle line:90%
there is no ruler.

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:02.230 align:middle line:90%
There is no king.

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:05.120 align:middle line:90%
But the universe is self-ruling.

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.980 align:middle line:90%
It goes by itself.

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:10.270 align:middle line:90%
It orders itself.

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And Buddhism does
not look forward

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:17.610 align:middle line:84%
to a transformation
of the world in time.

00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:20.890 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it does look forward to
a transformation of the world,

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:24.380 align:middle line:84%
but not at the end
of time, but now,

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:28.996 align:middle line:84%
through the overcoming of our
self-centered point of view.

00:26:28.996 --> 00:26:33.132 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's a wonderful
old story from India,

00:26:33.132 --> 00:26:36.545 align:middle line:84%
that in the far-off days
when men didn't wear shoes,

00:26:36.545 --> 00:26:39.530 align:middle line:84%
the stony ground was
hot on their feet.

00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:43.920 align:middle line:84%
And a great king said, "Let us
sacrifice hundreds of cattle

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:47.862 align:middle line:84%
and cover this intolerably
rough earth with their skins."

00:26:47.862 --> 00:26:51.930 align:middle line:84%
But a wise sage at his court
said, "No, sire, just kill

00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:55.400 align:middle line:84%
a few cattle, and let
us take their skins

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:59.110 align:middle line:84%
and bind small pieces of skin
to the bottom of our feet,

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:02.850 align:middle line:84%
so that we shall have
protection wherever we go."

00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And this story is rather typical
about the different attitudes

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:10.760 align:middle line:84%
of East and West to the
transformation of the world.

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:13.840 align:middle line:84%
The West is like wanting
to cover the whole ground

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:18.050 align:middle line:84%
with skins, to transform
outward events.

00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:22.200 align:middle line:84%
The East, like putting
a sandal on one's foot,

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:25.370 align:middle line:90%
to transform one's own mind.

00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:27.610 align:middle line:84%
So that it is said
in Buddhism that when

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:32.450 align:middle line:84%
every phase of our mind is in
accord with the mind of Buddha,

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:34.790 align:middle line:84%
there shall not be
one atom of dust

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:38.430 align:middle line:84%
that does not enter
into Buddhahood.

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:42.670 align:middle line:84%
To see the world in a new
way by altering one's self

00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:50.780 align:middle line:84%
rather than changing the world,
so that as the old Zen master

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:56.540 align:middle line:84%
Hakuin said, when we
get this point of view,

00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:59.660 align:middle line:84%
this Earth is the
lotus land of purity,

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:03.242 align:middle line:84%
and this body is
the body of Buddha.

00:28:03.242 --> 00:28:07.880 align:middle line:90%
