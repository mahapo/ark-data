00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.670 align:middle line:84%
>>Have you ever set too
few places at a table

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.830 align:middle line:84%
or poured out too few
drinks because you

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.970 align:middle line:90%
forgot to count yourself?

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.430 align:middle line:90%
Funny, isn't it?

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.350 align:middle line:84%
One's self is the
closest thing to you.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.310 align:middle line:84%
And yet just because
it's so close

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.430 align:middle line:84%
and your eyes don't look at
you, you're difficult to see

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.170 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes you
forget yourself.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.611 align:middle line:90%


00:00:58.611 --> 00:01:04.830 align:middle line:84%
There's a strange way in which
obviousness conceals things.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.660 align:middle line:84%
I've often been
struck by the fact

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.470 align:middle line:84%
that some of the very greatest
discoveries that man has made

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.420 align:middle line:84%
have been occasions when he's
suddenly noticed something that

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.930 align:middle line:84%
was staring him in
the face all the time.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And when we see it,
we say, good heavens,

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.790 align:middle line:84%
why didn't I ever
see that before?

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.014 align:middle line:84%
There it was, right under the
my nose and I never noticed it.

00:01:29.014 --> 00:01:30.680 align:middle line:84%
Oh, this sort of thing
happens I suppose

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.870 align:middle line:84%
every day when you
lose your glasses.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And you go around all over
the house looking for them.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.905 align:middle line:84%
And then, suddenly,
they're on your nose.

00:01:39.905 --> 00:01:45.310 align:middle line:84%
Or you've lost your handbag and
there it is over your shoulder.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.760 align:middle line:84%
There's an old story about an
Indian king who one day woke up

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.460 align:middle line:84%
in the morning and
turned to his bedside

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.040 align:middle line:84%
to look at himself
in the mirror.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.430 align:middle line:84%
He had a mirror like this,
these old bronze mirrors which

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.230 align:middle line:84%
used to be polished
on one side and then

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.920 align:middle line:84%
have a design of some
kind on the other.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And here he was with the
mirror beside his bed.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.640 align:middle line:84%
And he was kind of
bleary-eyed the morning.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And he picked it up and
looked into the wrong side.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.360 align:middle line:90%
And he said, where's my head?

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.270 align:middle line:90%
I've lost it.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And he summoned
all his attendants

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.210 align:middle line:84%
and started running around
all over his apartment looking

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.109 align:middle line:90%
for his head.

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And when the attendants
arrived, they said,

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.332 align:middle line:84%
but your majesty, oh,
king, live forever,

00:02:31.332 --> 00:02:32.540 align:middle line:90%
it's still on your shoulders.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.331 align:middle line:84%
You looked in the wrong
side of the mirror.

00:02:34.331 --> 00:02:36.810 align:middle line:90%


00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.910 align:middle line:84%
And that story is told
as an illustration

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.420 align:middle line:84%
of what is after
all the greatest

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:51.370 align:middle line:84%
theme of Indian philosophy,
the recollection or remembering

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:58.020 align:middle line:84%
of something that mankind as a
whole seems to have forgotten.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.870 align:middle line:84%
I was talking a moment ago about
great discoveries of benefit

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.660 align:middle line:84%
to the human race,
how there are things

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.750 align:middle line:84%
that might have been
obvious all the time.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.410 align:middle line:84%
Supposing there was a
very greatest discovery,

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.880 align:middle line:84%
something that would really
set the heart of man at peace?

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's the most
obvious thing there is

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.460 align:middle line:84%
and nobody is
noticing it at all.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.030 align:middle line:90%
What might it be?

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, when in
Indian philosophy it

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.410 align:middle line:84%
is said that the objective
of the whole thing

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.050 align:middle line:84%
is remembering or
recollecting something

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.710 align:middle line:84%
that has been
forgotten, what is that?

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:48.430 align:middle line:84%
It means remembering who
or what we really are?

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.820 align:middle line:90%


00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course, if we
say, well, whom am I?

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.940 align:middle line:84%
We say, well, I'm
I. I'm a person.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.330 align:middle line:90%
Well, what is a person?

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.050 align:middle line:90%
Here is a person.

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.805 align:middle line:90%


00:04:05.805 --> 00:04:12.080 align:middle line:84%
A person is originally
an actor's mask,

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.300 align:middle line:84%
whether for a ordinary dramatic
performance or a ritual

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.730 align:middle line:90%
performance.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And in the Greco-Roman
world, these masks

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.296 align:middle line:90%
were called persona.

00:04:26.296 --> 00:04:32.930 align:middle line:84%
For the word
"persona" means that

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.780 align:middle line:90%
through which there comes sound.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And those old
masks, as they were

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.810 align:middle line:84%
made for the Greco-Roman
stage, had mouthpieces

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:49.310 align:middle line:84%
that were shaped like a
megaphone, rather wide mouths.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And so because those mouths
emphasized the sound,

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.460 align:middle line:84%
persona became the
name for a mask.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And this use of the
word still survives

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.900 align:middle line:84%
when you look in the
title pages of a play

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.340 align:middle line:84%
and you see a list
called dramatis

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.430 align:middle line:84%
personae, the
persons of the drama.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.770 align:middle line:84%
Because this was originally
a list of the masks

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.040 align:middle line:84%
that the actors
were going to wear.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And so it isn't it strange
that the word "person," which

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.930 align:middle line:84%
originally meant
a mask, has come

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:31.640 align:middle line:84%
to mean what we really and
truly feel ourselves to be?

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And this is perhaps a very,
very significant confusion.

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.210 align:middle line:84%
For after all, what
one is as a person,

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.170 align:middle line:84%
that is to say as a mask,
as a part in a play,

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:48.210 align:middle line:84%
is what we nowadays
call one's role.

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And we are such, aren't
we, that we very much

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:58.740 align:middle line:84%
depend for our personal security
and our social security,

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.610 align:middle line:84%
we very we tend to fix
upon and identify ourselves

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.620 align:middle line:90%
with certain roles.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think one of the
best illustrations of this

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.090 align:middle line:84%
is when you go to
a party and you're

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:12.690 align:middle line:90%
meeting a lot of strange people.

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.500 align:middle line:84%
And when your hostess
introduces you to each other,

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.750 align:middle line:84%
she always give some little
indication in her introduction

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.700 align:middle line:84%
so that another person
can identify your role.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:26.020 align:middle line:84%
She says, oh, I do want
you to meet Mr. Smith.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.930 align:middle line:90%
Mr. Smith is a painter.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.630 align:middle line:90%
I do want you to meet Mr. Jones.

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.900 align:middle line:90%
Mr. Jones is a banker.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And so Mr. Smith and Mr.
Jones know who they are.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.330 align:middle line:84%
But what they know is not
exactly who they really are.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.410 align:middle line:84%
They know what roles
they play in society.

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And by knowing their
roles, they are

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.660 align:middle line:84%
able to converse with each
other without difficulty.

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.710 align:middle line:84%
You have, in other
words, a starting point

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:52.850 align:middle line:90%
for conversation.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:54.360 align:middle line:84%
Oh, it may be
something so trivial.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.220 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I do want you
to meet Mrs. Doakes

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.009 align:middle line:84%
because she comes
from your home state.

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And then immediately
the conversation

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:05.440 align:middle line:84%
can begin quite easily, talking
about one's home town or home

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.360 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And in this way, you
can talk with people

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.250 align:middle line:84%
without ever really meeting
them by identifying clearly

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.430 align:middle line:84%
with your role and
playing your part.

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:17.720 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I mean it may be some
other part than banker,

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:18.750 align:middle line:90%
or doctor, or lawyer.

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:25.290 align:middle line:84%
It may be regular guy,
or buffoon, or bohemian,

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:28.150 align:middle line:84%
or whatever sort of role
one identifies oneself with.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.660 align:middle line:84%
By playing this part,
you can completely

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:33.860 align:middle line:84%
conceal yourself
from other people.

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:38.492 align:middle line:84%
The only people who don't
really need these role keys

00:07:38.492 --> 00:07:40.855 align:middle line:84%
in meeting each
other are children.

00:07:40.855 --> 00:07:43.410 align:middle line:84%
A child has no embarrassment
in going straight up to you

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:45.410 align:middle line:84%
and saying, oh,
what a pretty face

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.300 align:middle line:84%
you have or isn't that
a funny nose you've got.

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.240 align:middle line:84%
He can go right
into conversation

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:56.290 align:middle line:84%
without having to meet your
persona, your front, your mask.

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And that is, of course, why
great philosophers and sages

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.650 align:middle line:84%
have always admired children
and have in that respect

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:05.190 align:middle line:90%
tried to emulate them.

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:09.380 align:middle line:84%
So then, society encourages
us, not only modern society,

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.860 align:middle line:84%
but ancient society, have
encouraged the individual

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:16.350 align:middle line:84%
to identify himself
with a consistent role

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:19.590 align:middle line:84%
and to play his
part consistently.

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:23.560 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we all find that
the moment in which we really

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.470 align:middle line:84%
make fools of ourselves,
when something goes wrong,

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:28.370 align:middle line:90%
is when we act out a role.

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:30.310 align:middle line:84%
In other words, my
role at the moment

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:33.390 align:middle line:84%
is being a speaker on
television and talking to you.

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:36.049 align:middle line:84%
And I would be considered to
flub the show if suddenly I

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:39.659 align:middle line:84%
acted out of role and did
something that simply speakers

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:41.030 align:middle line:90%
don't do.

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:43.650 align:middle line:84%
And if I did this
unintentionally,

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:48.520 align:middle line:84%
I would feel embarrassed
because my role had slipped.

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:54.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, in Indian society,
the roles that people play

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:57.610 align:middle line:84%
are what we now know
as their castes.

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:02.990 align:middle line:84%
In old Indian society, there
were for principal castes,

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:07.730 align:middle line:84%
the priests, the warriors
and rulers, the merchants,

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:09.540 align:middle line:90%
and the laborers.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.570 align:middle line:84%
Rather much, as in
medieval European society,

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:16.900 align:middle line:84%
there were lords spiritual,
lords temporal, commons,

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:18.760 align:middle line:90%
and serfs.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And then within each one
of these caste groups,

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:23.310 align:middle line:84%
there were many
subdivisions corresponding

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:26.512 align:middle line:84%
to the various vocations
that people adopted.

00:09:26.512 --> 00:09:29.490 align:middle line:84%
But Indian society contains
an interesting custom,

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:31.390 align:middle line:90%
an interesting tradition.

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And that is that when a
man has established himself

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.590 align:middle line:84%
in his role, about the
middle of his life,

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:39.500 align:middle line:84%
he hands over his vocation,
the running of his business

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:43.040 align:middle line:84%
or his shop, or whatever it
may be, to his oldest son,

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.490 align:middle line:90%
and says, now you carry on.

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And the man who gives up
his job or gives up his role

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.840 align:middle line:84%
becomes what is called
a forest dweller.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.110 align:middle line:90%
He retires from active life.

00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:01.120 align:middle line:84%
He changes his name and
he gives up his role.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And this is done in
the pursuit of what

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:09.150 align:middle line:84%
is called in Hindu
philosophy, liberation

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:16.530 align:middle line:84%
or to use the technical
term, "moksha."

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And this means
becoming a nobody.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:27.090 align:middle line:84%
You give up your
identifying role.

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:31.590 align:middle line:84%
You drop caste and become,
as it were, no one.

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:35.952 align:middle line:84%
You, in other words, go
to find the great question

00:10:35.952 --> 00:10:40.070 align:middle line:84%
of all life, who behind
these masks, these parts

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:43.330 align:middle line:90%
I play in life, who am I really?

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:47.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, we often talk
about finding ourselves.

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.710 align:middle line:84%
We often talk about finding
ourselves in relation

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:50.630 align:middle line:90%
to our work.

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:53.740 align:middle line:84%
Am I doing the job
I am fitted for?

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:56.730 align:middle line:84%
Am I married to the person
who really suits me?

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:59.140 align:middle line:84%
Am I living in the
part of the world that

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:01.920 align:middle line:84%
is really congenial
to my nature?

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.550 align:middle line:84%
But this, you see, raises
the question, doesn't it,

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:07.150 align:middle line:84%
what is one's
fundamental nature?

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And if you look into
this question carefully,

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:13.320 align:middle line:84%
you suddenly find yourself
rather like an onion.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.020 align:middle line:84%
You start peeling
off masks, or skins,

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:18.090 align:middle line:84%
looking deeper and
deeper and deeper,

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:20.830 align:middle line:84%
until you get to the
point of ultimate puzzle.

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:23.880 align:middle line:84%
What is it behind
all this that is

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:27.250 align:middle line:84%
the very foundation
of my consciousness?

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:30.570 align:middle line:90%
What am I really?

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And in Hindu philosophy,
the answer to that question

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:38.040 align:middle line:84%
is always behind all the
many masks of the world,

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:41.450 align:middle line:84%
be they masks of men, or
masks of animals, or plants,

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:45.880 align:middle line:84%
or stars, or mountains,
there is one actor.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:50.690 align:middle line:84%
There is the supreme
self of the universe,

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:52.980 align:middle line:90%
which is called Brahman.

00:11:52.980 --> 00:12:03.080 align:middle line:84%
Brahman in it's personal
form, Brahma, but Brahman,

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:09.220 align:middle line:84%
is the name thus
accorded to the one actor

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:16.580 align:middle line:84%
playing all the different
personae or parts.

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And the deepest
self in man, the one

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.980 align:middle line:84%
who is under all
those onion skins,

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:31.880 align:middle line:84%
really us, is called
Atman, meaning the self.

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And the great formula of Indian
philosophy is Atman is Brahman.

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:43.950 align:middle line:84%
You are not really
this role, this mask,

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:48.530 align:middle line:84%
whether it be the social
mask or the mask of skin

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:50.180 align:middle line:90%
over one's body.

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:54.310 align:middle line:84%
What you are fundamentally
is the Brahman.

00:12:54.310 --> 00:13:01.380 align:middle line:84%
And so comes this
formula, which sums up

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:06.111 align:middle line:84%
the whole inner
doctrine of Hinduism.

00:13:06.111 --> 00:13:06.610 align:middle line:90%
Excuse me.

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:08.235 align:middle line:84%
I've started to write
it the wrong way.

00:13:08.235 --> 00:13:12.050 align:middle line:90%
We'll begin over here, tat.

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:14.356 align:middle line:90%
That means that.

00:13:14.356 --> 00:13:31.010 align:middle line:84%
[SANSKRIT] that thou art, or,
in ordinary English order,

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:34.280 align:middle line:90%
though art that.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:37.160 align:middle line:84%
The very word "that" English
is I think originally

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:42.730 align:middle line:84%
from this Sanskrit
expression, tat.

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is, in a
way, the best word

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:47.970 align:middle line:84%
that can be used
for the underlying

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:50.170 align:middle line:90%
reality of the world.

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps I can try
and explain to you why.

00:13:53.270 --> 00:14:00.920 align:middle line:84%
Now when I was in
my teens, I first

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:03.290 align:middle line:90%
became interested in this.

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:07.080 align:middle line:84%
And I very much fervently
wanted to realize

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.990 align:middle line:84%
what it would be like to
experience the whole world

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:13.700 align:middle line:84%
as a unity and myself
as being involved

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:19.630 align:middle line:84%
in that unity, of being it,
of being the one self which

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:22.540 align:middle line:90%
is all?

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:26.480 align:middle line:84%
And at first I thought,
well, I suppose

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.650 align:middle line:84%
this is a state of
consciousness, which,

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:31.530 align:middle line:84%
if one realized it,
all the distinctions

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:34.562 align:middle line:84%
and outlines of things
would disappear.

00:14:34.562 --> 00:14:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And the whole
world would kind of

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:42.400 align:middle line:84%
go blewah, into a great sea
of cosmic jello, like this.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:46.940 align:middle line:84%
Or else I thought perhaps that
it wouldn't be quite like that,

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:50.460 align:middle line:84%
but maybe everything
would become suffused

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:53.110 align:middle line:84%
with a kind of omnipresent
interior light, something

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:56.050 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:59.944 align:middle line:84%
But I couldn't make
it happen that way.

00:14:59.944 --> 00:15:01.110 align:middle line:90%
And you know it was strange.

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:02.805 align:middle line:84%
There was one thing
in my experience--

00:15:02.805 --> 00:15:05.180 align:middle line:84%
I was living in London in
those days-- which really stuck

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:09.640 align:middle line:84%
in my craw, one thing that I
just couldn't make disappear

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:14.740 align:middle line:84%
into this jello or this
infinite continuum of the one

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:17.870 align:middle line:84%
ultimate reality, the true
self behind everything.

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:20.787 align:middle line:84%
And that happened to
be a London taxi cab.

00:15:20.787 --> 00:15:22.745 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if you've ever
seen in London taxicab?

00:15:22.745 --> 00:15:24.250 align:middle line:90%
They used to look like this.

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:36.120 align:middle line:90%


00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.570 align:middle line:90%
They were upright.

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:39.000 align:middle line:90%
They were ugly.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:45.300 align:middle line:84%
They were the most individual,
impertinently definite things

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:47.130 align:middle line:90%
you could imagine.

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And I could not make these
silly gadgets, which I saw all

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:54.000 align:middle line:84%
around me, disappear
into the one.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly it
dawned on me one day

00:15:57.270 --> 00:16:00.040 align:middle line:84%
that to see the
unity behind life,

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:02.820 align:middle line:84%
things don't have
to merge into jello.

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:05.820 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to become
suffused within a light.

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:07.690 align:middle line:90%
I saw it with that taxi cab.

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:10.270 align:middle line:84%
I saw that that
taxicab, by being

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:13.400 align:middle line:84%
the very upright,
impertinent, stupid

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:17.490 align:middle line:84%
looking thing that it
is, precisely as taxicab,

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:21.520 align:middle line:84%
it manifested the one
underlying reality.

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:26.070 align:middle line:84%
In other words, this
is not a question

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:29.510 align:middle line:84%
of imposing upon the
world of differences

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:33.330 align:middle line:84%
some abstract conception
of unity in your mind.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:36.090 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to go around
saying to yourself, now,

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:36.969 align:middle line:90%
don't get fussed.

00:16:36.969 --> 00:16:37.760 align:middle line:90%
Don't be disturbed.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:38.400 align:middle line:90%
Be at peace.

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.420 align:middle line:84%
All things are
fundamentally one.

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:43.710 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
do that at all.

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:46.490 align:middle line:84%
You have to see the
secret that it's

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:50.470 align:middle line:84%
the very differences of
things, the very individuality

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:55.190 align:middle line:84%
of things, their prickly,
personal reality,

00:16:55.190 --> 00:17:00.900 align:middle line:84%
that manifests, that shouts out,
that advertises the underlying

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:02.200 align:middle line:90%
unity.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.640 align:middle line:84%
You remember perhaps that
in a previous program,

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.585 align:middle line:84%
I was talking to you about
the contrast of figure

00:17:07.585 --> 00:17:08.890 align:middle line:90%
and background.

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:10.589 align:middle line:84%
And we saw what
happened to my figure

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:13.074 align:middle line:90%
when the background disappeared.

00:17:13.074 --> 00:17:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And we were getting from that
the idea that it's precisely

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:17.230 align:middle line:84%
the difference
between the figure

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:20.060 align:middle line:84%
and the background that
makes us able to see

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:22.140 align:middle line:84%
both the background
and the figure.

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:24.470 align:middle line:84%
There is, in other
words, a hidden unity

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:28.050 align:middle line:90%
underlying these contrasts.

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And so, then, it is
through seeing the fact

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:38.300 align:middle line:84%
that the differences
themselves are the unity,

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:42.000 align:middle line:84%
that we come to
an inward, clearer

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:48.400 align:middle line:84%
realization of, after all, the
thing that we've forgotten.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:53.590 align:middle line:90%


00:17:53.590 --> 00:18:00.630 align:middle line:84%
Because going about
our everyday tasks

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:06.510 align:middle line:84%
involves constantly focusing
on the details of things,

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:10.002 align:middle line:84%
focusing on the contrasts and
the differences between them.

00:18:10.002 --> 00:18:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And so in this absorption, in
dealing with the difference

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.970 align:middle line:84%
aspect of the world
we simply forget,

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:21.720 align:middle line:84%
we overlook the unity
aspect of the world which

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.310 align:middle line:84%
the very differences
so clearly proclaim.

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:28.350 align:middle line:90%


00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:38.090 align:middle line:84%
So then, if we know that the
differences reveal the unity,

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:45.240 align:middle line:84%
then we see that what we
really are is tat, that, it.

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:45.955 align:middle line:90%
So what?

00:18:45.955 --> 00:18:49.620 align:middle line:90%


00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:52.330 align:middle line:90%
Does it make any difference?

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:56.500 align:middle line:84%
Does it make anybody any
happier to understand

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.500 align:middle line:84%
that behind all the
differences of life

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:04.100 align:middle line:84%
is a unity which
each one of us is?

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:08.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, it does, doesn't
it, in this way.

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:12.690 align:middle line:84%
If you really notice,
you come to a point

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:16.430 align:middle line:90%
where nothing can phase you.

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:21.790 align:middle line:84%
For you know that
you aren't anymore

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:26.390 align:middle line:90%
just the fragmented individual.

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:31.000 align:middle line:84%
You know that what you are
deep down at the very center

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.580 align:middle line:84%
is something beyond
time and change,

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:39.190 align:middle line:84%
the eternal Atman,
the self of the world.

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course,
that just doesn't

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:47.950 align:middle line:84%
mean that you become,
oh, insensitive.

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:54.300 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that you
go beyond human emotions.

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:59.550 align:middle line:84%
That you're no longer ever
afraid, no longer sad.

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:02.727 align:middle line:84%
No longer loving other people
because you see it's all one

00:20:02.727 --> 00:20:04.310 align:middle line:84%
and so it doesn't
make any difference.

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:05.230 align:middle line:90%
It's not like that.

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:09.020 align:middle line:90%


00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:13.810 align:middle line:84%
In Buddhism, they
say, our object is not

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:18.140 align:middle line:84%
to make stone Buddhas,
but living Buddhas.

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:21.480 align:middle line:84%
A stone Buddha is
a symbol of what

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:26.150 align:middle line:84%
we might call an ultra-stoic,
a person who so represses

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:30.780 align:middle line:84%
his fears and his emotions
that he doesn't have any left.

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:36.420 align:middle line:84%
And they say, well, if
that's your idea of a sage,

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:37.915 align:middle line:90%
a rock will do just as well.

00:20:37.915 --> 00:20:40.940 align:middle line:90%


00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:43.290 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't mean that.

00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:48.980 align:middle line:84%
It means, rather, that you're no
longer afraid of being afraid.

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:53.880 align:middle line:84%
You're no longer afraid
of grief, of pain,

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.920 align:middle line:90%
of being sensitive.

00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:00.290 align:middle line:84%
You're no longer
afraid, in other words,

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:04.100 align:middle line:90%
to go into life with total zest.

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:07.380 align:middle line:90%


00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:10.970 align:middle line:84%
In other words, when we say
you're not phased by anything,

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:12.540 align:middle line:90%
it means you don't block.

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:15.640 align:middle line:90%


00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:19.390 align:middle line:84%
Blocking is always
difficult to overcome.

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:21.470 align:middle line:84%
Just about the time
of year when we

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:25.710 align:middle line:84%
have to do a lot of figuring,
say to work out our income tax,

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:28.770 align:middle line:84%
don't you sometimes when you're
adding columns of figures

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:30.270 align:middle line:84%
that there are
certain combinations,

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:35.340 align:middle line:84%
like maybe 9 and 7, or something
like that, at what you block?

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:36.240 align:middle line:90%
And this annoys you.

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.170 align:middle line:84%
Every time you reach
this combination,

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:41.560 align:middle line:84%
you think, oh, 9 and 7 is,
um, 1, 2 3, 4, 5, 6, 9.

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:42.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:43.380 align:middle line:90%
Oh, 13.

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:46.620 align:middle line:90%
And you block.

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:48.380 align:middle line:84%
9 and 7 aren't 12
anyway, you see.

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:50.260 align:middle line:90%
You see how it is.

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:53.090 align:middle line:90%
Well, anyway, that happens.

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:55.656 align:middle line:84%
If you get annoyed
that you block at it,

00:21:55.656 --> 00:21:57.360 align:middle line:90%
you block at blocking.

00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:00.950 align:middle line:84%
And it gets worse
and worse and worse.

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:02.420 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't
get annoyed at it,

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:04.510 align:middle line:84%
you say, oh, well, I'm
going to block anyway,

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:07.060 align:middle line:84%
and you don't resist the
fact that you block, it's OK.

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And you'll eventually
stop blocking.

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:13.050 align:middle line:84%
So in this way too,
it isn't a question

00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:17.250 align:middle line:84%
of a state of mind which enables
us not to be afraid at all,

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:19.010 align:middle line:90%
of not to be sad at all.

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:22.550 align:middle line:84%
It's a state of mind in which
we don't block at being afraid.

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:25.990 align:middle line:90%
We are not afraid of fear.

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And so, as I said,
this enables one

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:36.400 align:middle line:84%
to go into life with a
certain kind of zest.

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:43.240 align:middle line:84%
Once upon a time, there was
a Chinese Buddhist master.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And one of his disciples
asked him a question.

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:47.820 align:middle line:90%
What is the Tao?

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:52.280 align:middle line:84%
You know I've used that word
before, T-A-O. Tao means

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:56.750 align:middle line:90%
the way of nature in one sense.

00:22:56.750 --> 00:23:00.200 align:middle line:84%
It has almost the same
meaning as Brahman.

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:05.450 align:middle line:84%
It is the same one reality
underlying the whole universe.

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:09.640 align:middle line:84%
Also Tao means a way of
life, a way of behaving,

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:11.510 align:middle line:90%
a way of conduct.

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:15.930 align:middle line:84%
So both meanings were
involved in his question.

00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:18.320 align:middle line:90%
What is the ultimate reality?

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:21.460 align:middle line:84%
What is the way of
conduct by which one

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:25.090 align:middle line:90%
comes into accord with it?

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:30.568 align:middle line:84%
And the teacher answered
him in two words, walk on.

00:23:30.568 --> 00:23:31.144 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no.

00:23:31.144 --> 00:23:33.060 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like a
policeman when he comes out

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:34.450 align:middle line:84%
with a crowd hanging
about the streets.

00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:35.160 align:middle line:90%
And he says, come on out.

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:35.660 align:middle line:90%
Keep moving.

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:37.590 align:middle line:90%
Keep moving.

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:40.340 align:middle line:84%
For after all, keeping
moving in the sense

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:45.270 align:middle line:84%
is keeping alive, keeping
things circulating, not holding,

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:46.470 align:middle line:90%
not blocking.

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:49.690 align:middle line:84%
Not, as it were, getting
clots of blood in one's

00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:53.900 align:middle line:84%
psychological and
spiritual arteries.

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:55.940 align:middle line:84%
Another illustration
that is given

00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:59.910 align:middle line:84%
of this state in Chinese
Buddhist philosophy

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:03.870 align:middle line:84%
is the way of behavior of a
ball on a mountain stream.

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:07.400 align:middle line:84%
Think of a ping-pong
ball on rough water.

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:09.760 align:middle line:84%
The ball keeps dancing,
dancing, dancing.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.170 align:middle line:90%
And it is never swamped.

00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:12.135 align:middle line:90%
It never stops moving.

00:24:12.135 --> 00:24:15.900 align:middle line:84%
It's always instantly responsive
to the motion of the water.

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And so in this way,
when we are living,

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:27.050 align:middle line:84%
to be able to go straight into
things without hesitation,

00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:30.590 align:middle line:84%
without blocking, we
have our own proverb.

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:34.130 align:middle line:90%
He who hesitates is lost.

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And hesitation is
what is basically

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:46.210 align:middle line:84%
meant in Buddhist thought by
attachment in a bad sense,

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:50.665 align:middle line:84%
in the sense of evil
attachments to the world.

00:24:50.665 --> 00:24:53.170 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't mean love.

00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:57.490 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean joy and
sorrow in that sense.

00:24:57.490 --> 00:25:01.130 align:middle line:84%
It means blocking at love,
blocking at joy and sorrow,

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:02.430 align:middle line:90%
blocking at fear.

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:04.850 align:middle line:84%
This is the
attachment from which

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:08.040 align:middle line:84%
the sage is going
to be liberated.

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:14.230 align:middle line:84%
And so in his answer, walk
on, keep going-- sometimes

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:18.450 align:middle line:84%
you wake up, maybe
Monday morning,

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:20.920 align:middle line:84%
and you think of
the week coming up

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:24.320 align:middle line:84%
and all the chores
you've got to do.

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And right as you
wake up in bed, you

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:29.224 align:middle line:84%
feel this fundamental
block to going any further.

00:25:29.224 --> 00:25:31.140 align:middle line:84%
And you think, oh, I
wish time wouldn't go on.

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:33.300 align:middle line:84%
I'd just like to lie
here and let it stop.

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:36.138 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to face it.

00:25:36.138 --> 00:25:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And the longer you lie that
way, the more and more difficult

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:40.370 align:middle line:90%
it becomes to wake up.

00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:43.270 align:middle line:90%


00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:48.710 align:middle line:84%
And the answer that's
given to us over and over

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:50.060 align:middle line:90%
again is just get up.

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:51.180 align:middle line:90%
Don't think about it.

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:51.680 align:middle line:90%
Move.

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:52.420 align:middle line:90%
Walk on.

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:56.992 align:middle line:84%
For the moment one moves into
it, the problem becomes simple.

00:25:56.992 --> 00:26:01.590 align:middle line:84%
It's only when you stop to think
about it that it's difficult.

00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:07.240 align:middle line:84%
I referred to a previous program
to that astonishing gentleman

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:10.350 align:middle line:84%
Bodhidharma, the
sage who is supposed

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:13.160 align:middle line:84%
to been one of the people
who introduced Buddhism

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:17.910 align:middle line:90%
from India into China.

00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:20.330 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at a picture
of Bodhidharma again.

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:22.110 align:middle line:84%
This is here he is in
rather an odd form.

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:24.770 align:middle line:90%


00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:30.820 align:middle line:84%
You can see him there looking
like a kind of a roly-poly.

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And here he is rolling
around various positions.

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And at the top it says,
jinsei nana korobi ya oki,

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:47.540 align:middle line:84%
which means, seven times down,
eight times up, such is life.

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:50.070 align:middle line:90%


00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And here he is, the
doll that can never

00:26:55.420 --> 00:27:00.480 align:middle line:84%
be phased because he's
not afraid of yielding.

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.720 align:middle line:84%
[TINKLING] Whichever
way you knock him,

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:10.210 align:middle line:84%
he always comes up again
because down becomes up.

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:11.520 align:middle line:90%
You can never defeat him.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:14.220 align:middle line:90%


00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:15.570 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't block.

00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:17.720 align:middle line:90%
[TINKLING]

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:29.734 align:middle line:90%
