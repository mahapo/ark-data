00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.360 align:middle line:84%
>>You know, it's not surprising
that in this day and age,

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.500 align:middle line:84%
the most up-to-date
and respectable form

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.450 align:middle line:84%
of academic philosophy
taught in our universities

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.530 align:middle line:84%
is what is called
logical analysis.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.280 align:middle line:84%
The logical analyst,
you know, is the kind

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.370 align:middle line:84%
of fellow, who, the moment
you say something, you hardly

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.620 align:middle line:84%
get a word out of your mouth
before he says, now, just

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.910 align:middle line:84%
precisely what do
you mean by that?

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.475 align:middle line:84%
You can't take a step
of the way in unfolding

00:01:09.475 --> 00:01:14.860 align:middle line:84%
a proposition or a thesis or an
idea without his going minutely

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.840 align:middle line:84%
into the meaning of
each word that you say.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of
this sort of technique,

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.340 align:middle line:84%
most logical analysts have
come to the conclusion

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.110 align:middle line:84%
that the problems that have
been discussed by philosophers

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.460 align:middle line:84%
for several thousand years are
mostly meaningless problems.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.610 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
look very precisely

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.450 align:middle line:84%
at the form of words in
which they're stated,

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.050 align:middle line:84%
and you analyze each word bit by
bit, you come to the conclusion

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.700 align:middle line:84%
that it didn't
really mean anything.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.640 align:middle line:84%
But I think there's a profound
fallacy in this, because it's

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.110 align:middle line:84%
based on the assumption
that the meaning of words

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.420 align:middle line:90%
is supposed to be precise.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.790 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately, for this
sort of approach to things,

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.300 align:middle line:84%
we're living in a world
which isn't precise,

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.330 align:middle line:84%
where nature on the whole
is extraordinary vague.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it would be
very nice for purposes

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.960 align:middle line:84%
of precise calculation
if the Earth,

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.760 align:middle line:84%
in its orbit around the sun,
went around in a neat 360 days.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.470 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.010 align:middle line:84%
It goes around in 365 and
some wretched fraction.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.170 align:middle line:90%
Everything's a little odd.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.750 align:middle line:84%
Everything's a
little off center.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.070 align:middle line:84%
For example, how are we to
decide exactly when now is?

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.910 align:middle line:90%
When is now?

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.400 align:middle line:84%
If I look at my watch, and take
a good look at the second hand

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.490 align:middle line:84%
to find out exactly where now
is, well, that secondhand,

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:49.130 align:middle line:90%
I can see it.

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.270 align:middle line:90%
So it must have some size.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.540 align:middle line:84%
So let's take out
a magnifying glass.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.500 align:middle line:84%
Then it appears that
the thing that marks now

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.780 align:middle line:90%
looks about so wide.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And then, well, let's
draw it a bit finer,

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.470 align:middle line:84%
and draw it a bit
finer, but we never

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.350 align:middle line:84%
seem to be able to get
the end of analyzing it.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.810 align:middle line:90%
Now, you see, is fuzzy.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.540 align:middle line:90%
It's vague.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.540 align:middle line:84%
It's like the field
of vision which

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.140 align:middle line:90%
you have in front of your eyes.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.930 align:middle line:84%
You can see clearly
in the middle,

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.830 align:middle line:84%
but going out to
the sides, things

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.310 align:middle line:90%
get a little bit blurred.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.590 align:middle line:84%
Or where exactly does the
head stop and the neck begin?

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.217 align:middle line:90%
Is it here?

00:03:24.217 --> 00:03:25.618 align:middle line:90%
Is it here?

00:03:25.618 --> 00:03:27.960 align:middle line:90%
Is it here?

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.110 align:middle line:90%
We can't really decide.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.930 align:middle line:84%
The only way to be
perfectly clear about where

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.450 align:middle line:84%
the head stops and the neck
begins is to chop off the head.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.790 align:middle line:84%
Then you got a
neat dividing line.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.960 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the whole
process of analysis is

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.090 align:middle line:84%
a process of chopping,
of cutting apart,

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.155 align:middle line:84%
of approaching nature with a
knife, with a dividing line,

00:03:53.155 --> 00:03:55.640 align:middle line:90%
with a scalpel. .

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And although there
is most definitely

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.220 align:middle line:84%
a place in life for precision,
for clear distinctions,

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.490 align:middle line:84%
for the attitude of the
knife, this kind of thing

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.900 align:middle line:90%
can be enormously overdone.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And if one approaches
the poet-- I

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.719 align:middle line:84%
remember a cartoon once
I saw in a newspaper.

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:19.040 align:middle line:84%
It showed Shakespeare walking
on the clouds of immortality,

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.470 align:middle line:84%
holding his head
in his hands, oh.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And he was being pursued
by a pedestrian little man

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.790 align:middle line:84%
wearing a cap and gown,
saying, Mr. Shakespeare,

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.970 align:middle line:84%
your use of the
conjunction "if."

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And one knows all too well a
certain style of personality

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:46.080 align:middle line:84%
which likes to be precise,
the sort of person

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.000 align:middle line:84%
who always in his
opinions and attitudes

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.100 align:middle line:84%
seems to be using his
thought as a means of tearing

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.470 align:middle line:90%
other people to pieces.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.580 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it wonderful
to be equipped

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.090 align:middle line:84%
with a rigorous
philosophical method that

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.447 align:middle line:84%
can tear all fuzzy
thinking to shred?

00:05:01.447 --> 00:05:02.030 align:middle line:90%
You know, The.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.550 align:middle line:84%
Kind of person who says,
I don't like fuzziness.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.690 align:middle line:84%
I like to be definite,
clear, and ridiculous.

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.270 align:middle line:84%
You almost feel that person's
got his knife into life.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.310 align:middle line:84%
Or sometimes you meet among
scientists the sort of person

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.106 align:middle line:84%
who likes to talk
about brute facts.

00:05:20.106 --> 00:05:22.960 align:middle line:90%
Why must facts be brute?

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:29.370 align:middle line:84%
Hard and clear facts aren't also
facts that are soft and vague?

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.150 align:middle line:84%
But you see, that
kind of attitude

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.390 align:middle line:84%
represents, and in a way
caricatures, something

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.820 align:middle line:84%
that is, on the whole,
rather characteristic

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.960 align:middle line:84%
of the total attitude
of Western civilization

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.240 align:middle line:90%
to the environment.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.060 align:middle line:84%
One of the first things
that Oriental peoples notice

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:55.090 align:middle line:84%
about us so-called white
people is our noses.

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.300 align:middle line:84%
After all, the bridge of a
Chinese nose is rather flat.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.110 align:middle line:90%
Same with Negroes.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.370 align:middle line:84%
When they see us Caucasians
for the first time, what they

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.980 align:middle line:84%
notice about us is this
nose that goes out like this

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.970 align:middle line:84%
and seems to be prodding
into everything,

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.310 align:middle line:84%
and the deep-set eyes
with a fixed stare.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at old
Japanese screens which

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.370 align:middle line:84%
show what we call caricatures,
but what they thought

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.890 align:middle line:84%
were fairly good representations
of the first Western people

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.240 align:middle line:90%
they saw.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.972 align:middle line:84%
They look like tenjin or goblins
because of their long noses.

00:06:27.972 --> 00:06:30.070 align:middle line:84%
For it seems that
this Western man

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:34.000 align:middle line:84%
has this prodder out in front of
him, which is into everything.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.680 align:middle line:90%
He can't leave anything alone.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And although, as I say, there
is a place for precision,

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.120 align:middle line:84%
nevertheless a
fundamentally hostile

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:53.230 align:middle line:84%
cutting up attitude
to life gives us

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:57.100 align:middle line:84%
dead knowledge instead
of living knowledge.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.980 align:middle line:90%
It kills things.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:05.230 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's a way of
approaching everything

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:08.060 align:middle line:84%
rather on the lines of the
old story about Achilles

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:08.790 align:middle line:90%
and the tortoise.

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:11.440 align:middle line:90%


00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:17.090 align:middle line:84%
You know, perhaps, the problem
of Achilles and the tortoise.

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:20.310 align:middle line:84%
Achilles on the tortoise
agree to have a race.

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:26.560 align:middle line:84%
But because Achilles can run
twice as fast as the tortoise,

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.460 align:middle line:90%
the tortoise gets a head start.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.150 align:middle line:90%
Achilles begins here.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.700 align:middle line:90%
And the tortoise begins here.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:41.130 align:middle line:84%
Now then, when the tortoise
has gone half the distance

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:45.300 align:middle line:84%
between his starting point
and Achilles' starting point,

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.650 align:middle line:84%
when the tortoise goes
that much and is here,

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:54.120 align:middle line:84%
Achilles, who can run twice as
fast, moves from here to here.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.930 align:middle line:90%


00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:03.030 align:middle line:84%
Then the tortoise goes half
as far as that distance.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:06.370 align:middle line:84%
Achilles does twice as
much, and he lands up here.

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:09.180 align:middle line:90%


00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And then the tortoise
goes half as far

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:15.080 align:middle line:84%
as he went again
and lands up here.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Achilles does twice as
much, and he's here.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And so the tortoise
goes half as far again.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.880 align:middle line:84%
And Achilles does twice as
much, and he lands up here.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And notice you see, Achilles
is still behind the tortoise.

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:33.789 align:middle line:84%
And the next time the tortoise
will go half as much as that.

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And Achilles will
come up to here.

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:38.289 align:middle line:84%
And we shall go on
doing this, thinking

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:41.350 align:middle line:84%
about smaller and smaller
and smaller intervals.

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And as a result
of this, Achilles

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.850 align:middle line:84%
will never overtake
the tortoise.

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:52.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, in actual
life, Achilles jolly

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:54.020 align:middle line:90%
well does overtake the tortoise.

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.670 align:middle line:90%
He goes right by him.

00:08:56.670 --> 00:09:00.240 align:middle line:84%
But why this is a
problem is it is

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:04.550 align:middle line:84%
a way of thinking about the
situation that is infinite

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:07.990 align:middle line:90%
and indefinitely analytical.

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:11.900 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't, as it
were, let life go on,

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:14.570 align:middle line:84%
but it stops to analyze
the whole business.

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:17.810 align:middle line:84%
It breaks it down into minuter
and minuter and minuter

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:21.840 align:middle line:84%
quantities so that the
whole thing is delayed.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:26.890 align:middle line:84%
The whole situation is, as
it were, stopped and killed.

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:29.280 align:middle line:84%
And this will always
happen whenever

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:37.510 align:middle line:84%
we get into the bind, the rut of
trying to think too precisely.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's for this reason
that the Taoist and I

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:44.416 align:middle line:84%
think also the Confucian
philosophers of China

00:09:44.416 --> 00:09:48.970 align:middle line:84%
are very mistrustful of
logic chopping, of being too

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:53.080 align:middle line:84%
analytical about the
meaning of words.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.970 align:middle line:84%
Let's take, for
example, a word that

00:09:55.970 --> 00:10:01.080 align:middle line:84%
is absolutely fundamental to
Chinese thought, a word which

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:06.560 align:middle line:84%
I've used a great deal
in this program-- "Tao."

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:10.840 align:middle line:84%
You know, this is in
English spelled this way.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:14.660 align:middle line:90%


00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:16.235 align:middle line:90%
Tao in Chinese.

00:10:16.235 --> 00:10:32.760 align:middle line:90%


00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:39.600 align:middle line:84%
We usually translate that
"the way--" the way of nature,

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.052 align:middle line:90%
the way of things.

00:10:41.052 --> 00:10:42.760 align:middle line:84%
But that's only one
of its many meanings.

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.420 align:middle line:90%


00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:49.460 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, the term is
so difficult to define

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:53.790 align:middle line:84%
that Lao-Tzu-- you know
this man, the man who

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:57.000 align:middle line:84%
was the founder of
Taoist philosophy.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:06.522 align:middle line:84%
L-A-O T-Z-U. Lao-Tzu started
out his book by saying--

00:11:06.522 --> 00:11:08.980 align:middle line:84%
and this is a
phrase which already

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.690 align:middle line:84%
shows how many
meanings the word has.

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:21.010 align:middle line:90%
Tao, which can be Tao.

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:22.620 align:middle line:90%
But here the word means spoken.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:25.340 align:middle line:90%
It has that double meaning.

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:37.730 align:middle line:84%
"The Tao which can be
spoken is not the eternal--"

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:43.240 align:middle line:84%
the regular, or you might
say the real-- "tao."

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.920 align:middle line:90%
Oh yes, he was inconsistent.

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.680 align:middle line:84%
He then went on to write
a whole book about it.

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:53.260 align:middle line:84%
But really the whole purport of
the book is to show that Tao,

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.260 align:middle line:84%
the fundamental
nature of the world,

00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:00.460 align:middle line:84%
is something you cannot
get too precise about.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:05.920 align:middle line:84%
You can't think about it
and understand it that way.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:10.110 align:middle line:84%
In other words, what is
the fundamental basis

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:13.220 align:middle line:84%
of one's life as of
one's thought always

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:16.640 align:middle line:90%
has to remain undefined.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:20.980 align:middle line:84%
You see, if you insist--
and Chinese philosophers

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.040 align:middle line:84%
and scholars always are
very clear about this.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.200 align:middle line:84%
If you insist on defining
works meticulously,

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.720 align:middle line:84%
you always have to
have other words

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.552 align:middle line:90%
to define your definitions.

00:12:29.552 --> 00:12:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to have
words to define those words

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.170 align:middle line:90%
and words to define those words.

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:34.590 align:middle line:90%
And there's no end to it.

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:37.650 align:middle line:84%
Or otherwise you can get around
this by going in a circle.

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:39.400 align:middle line:84%
You know, when you
look up the dictionary,

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.245 align:middle line:84%
and look up "to be," you find
the definition "to exist."

00:12:42.245 --> 00:12:42.780 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:45.690 align:middle line:84%
You look up "to exist," and you
find the definition "to be."

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:47.770 align:middle line:90%
And then where are you?

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:50.740 align:middle line:84%
Either you go around in a
circle, which fundamentally

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.837 align:middle line:84%
tells you nothing,
or else you go

00:12:52.837 --> 00:12:54.545 align:middle line:84%
on and on and on
getting more meticulous,

00:12:54.545 --> 00:12:57.000 align:middle line:90%
and you never arrive.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.430 align:middle line:84%
Once a Western psychologist
asked a Chinese friend,

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:06.380 align:middle line:90%
what do you mean by Tao?

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:08.832 align:middle line:84%
And the friend said go and
look out of the window.

00:13:08.832 --> 00:13:11.010 align:middle line:84%
And he went and look
out of the window.

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:12.386 align:middle line:90%
What do you see?

00:13:12.386 --> 00:13:15.260 align:middle line:84%
He said, I see houses
and the street.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:16.520 align:middle line:90%
What else?

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.470 align:middle line:90%
I see people moving around.

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:19.900 align:middle line:90%
What else?

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.540 align:middle line:90%
I see clouds in the sky.

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:23.110 align:middle line:90%
What else?

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:26.060 align:middle line:90%
And the wind is blowing.

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:28.990 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese extended his
hand like this and said,

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:32.780 align:middle line:90%
that is the Tao.

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:38.725 align:middle line:84%
And so I remember too a
very great Japanese artist

00:13:38.725 --> 00:13:41.270 align:middle line:84%
who was teaching over
here in the United States.

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And he was always being
pressed by his students

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:44.980 align:middle line:90%
to define himself.

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:46.970 align:middle line:90%
And he used certain expressions.

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:48.600 align:middle line:84%
They say, now exactly
what do you mean?

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:49.530 align:middle line:90%
They were always saying this.

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:50.770 align:middle line:90%
And one day, he got mad.

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And he said, what's
the matter with you.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.212 align:middle line:90%
Can't you feel?

00:13:55.212 --> 00:14:01.860 align:middle line:84%
And so it is that there
are certain basic ideas,

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:09.370 align:middle line:84%
like Tao, which the Chinese
feel must come to us.

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:11.150 align:middle line:90%
We can't go out to get them.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:12.340 align:middle line:90%
We can't grab them.

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:19.030 align:middle line:84%
They must come to us in the same
way as light comes to our eyes.

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:24.670 align:middle line:84%
This thing, then, is
mysterious and unknown,

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:29.540 align:middle line:84%
like the hermit sage in one
of the most famous of all

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:34.240 align:middle line:84%
Chinese poems,
Jia Dao's "Seeking

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:39.110 align:middle line:84%
for the Hermit in
Vain." "I asked the boy

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:41.750 align:middle line:90%
beneath the pines.

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:46.620 align:middle line:84%
He said, the master's gone
alone herb picking, somewhere

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:54.600 align:middle line:84%
on the mountain, cloud
hidden, whereabouts unknown."

00:14:54.600 --> 00:15:00.190 align:middle line:84%
The whole power of the poem is
in the mysterious imprecision

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:06.860 align:middle line:84%
of the old man's whereabouts,
which, somehow or other, brings

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:09.050 align:middle line:84%
the spirit of the
hermit sage closer

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:13.650 align:middle line:84%
to the inquirer than
an actual meeting.

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:18.190 align:middle line:84%
His absence says more
than his presence.

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:21.690 align:middle line:84%
Lost somewhere on the
cloud-hidden mountain,

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:24.316 align:middle line:84%
he communicates
far more than if he

00:15:24.316 --> 00:15:25.690 align:middle line:84%
had come down to
explain himself.

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:28.460 align:middle line:90%


00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.950 align:middle line:84%
And the spirit would
be totally missed

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:33.950 align:middle line:84%
by the literal-minded,
no-nonsense sort of person,

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:36.390 align:middle line:84%
who at this point,
would want to clear away

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:39.360 align:middle line:84%
the clouds and the mystery,
to rush in and find out just

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.500 align:middle line:84%
exactly where the
old fellow has gone,

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:44.744 align:middle line:84%
and just what herbs
he is picking.

00:15:44.744 --> 00:15:49.090 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's
absolutely impossible

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:53.100 align:middle line:84%
to understand and appreciate
our natural universe

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:57.180 align:middle line:84%
unless you know when
to stop investigating.

00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:00.620 align:middle line:84%
In our restlessness,
we're always

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:04.600 align:middle line:84%
tempted to climb every hill
and cross every skyline

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:08.560 align:middle line:90%
to find out what lies beyond.

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:12.480 align:middle line:84%
Yet as you get
older and wiser, it

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.230 align:middle line:84%
isn't just flagging
energy, but rather

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:18.050 align:middle line:84%
increasing wisdom
that teaches you

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:21.030 align:middle line:84%
to look at mountains
from below, or perhaps

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:23.550 align:middle line:90%
just climb them a little way.

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:27.760 align:middle line:84%
For at the top, you can no
longer see the mountain.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And beyond on the
other side, there

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:32.090 align:middle line:84%
is perhaps just another
valley like this.

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:34.930 align:middle line:90%


00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:39.225 align:middle line:84%
An old Indian aphorism
says, "What is beyond

00:16:39.225 --> 00:16:43.610 align:middle line:90%
is that which is also here."

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And you mustn't mistake this
for a kind of blase boredom,

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:50.370 align:middle line:90%
tiring of adventure.

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:54.210 align:middle line:84%
It's the startling recognition
that in the place where

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:57.570 align:middle line:84%
we are now, we have
already arrived.

00:16:57.570 --> 00:16:59.230 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:03.140 align:middle line:84%
What we are seeking is, if
we are not totally blind,

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:06.079 align:middle line:90%
already here.

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:10.342 align:middle line:84%
For if you must follow that
trail up the mountainside

00:17:10.342 --> 00:17:14.270 align:middle line:84%
to its bitter end,
you will discover

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:18.240 align:middle line:84%
that it leads eventually
right back to the suburbs.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:21.030 align:middle line:84%
But only an exceedingly
stupid person

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:25.990 align:middle line:84%
will think that that's
where the trail really goes.

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:29.660 align:middle line:84%
For the actual truth
is that the trail

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:34.210 align:middle line:84%
goes to every single
place that it crosses.

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:39.560 align:middle line:84%
It leads also to where you
are standing and watching it.

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:42.430 align:middle line:84%
Watching it vanish
into the hills,

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:45.797 align:middle line:84%
you are already in the true
beyond to which it leads.

00:17:45.797 --> 00:17:48.780 align:middle line:90%


00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:53.870 align:middle line:84%
Many a time, I have
had intense delight

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:58.668 align:middle line:84%
in listening to some hidden
waterfall in a mountain canyon,

00:17:58.668 --> 00:18:03.680 align:middle line:84%
a sound all the more wonderful
since I have set aside

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:09.360 align:middle line:84%
the urge to ferret the thing
out, clear up the mystery,

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.685 align:middle line:84%
and find out just where
the stream comes from

00:18:11.685 --> 00:18:12.700 align:middle line:90%
and where it goes.

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:15.320 align:middle line:90%


00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:20.180 align:middle line:84%
Every stream, every road,
if followed persistently

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:27.500 align:middle line:84%
and meticulously to its
end, leads nowhere at all.

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:34.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is why the compulsively
investigative mind is always

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:36.850 align:middle line:84%
landing up in what
it believes to be

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:40.730 align:middle line:84%
the disillusion, the
hard and bitter reality

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:41.800 align:middle line:90%
of the actual facts.

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:44.450 align:middle line:90%


00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:47.110 align:middle line:84%
Playing a violin is,
after all, only scratching

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:50.160 align:middle line:90%
cats' entrails with horse hair.

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:53.430 align:middle line:84%
The stars in heave
are, after all,

00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:57.810 align:middle line:90%
only radioactive rocks and gas.

00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:01.170 align:middle line:84%
But this is the
illusion that truth

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:03.440 align:middle line:84%
is to be found only
by picking everything

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.110 align:middle line:90%
to pieces like a spoiled child.

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:08.250 align:middle line:90%


00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:11.520 align:middle line:84%
This is why the
painters of the Far East

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:19.870 align:middle line:84%
so seldom tell all, why they
avoid filling in every detail,

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:21.700 align:middle line:84%
and why they leave
in their paintings

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:25.670 align:middle line:84%
great areas of
emptiness and vagueness.

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:29.550 align:middle line:84%
These aren't just
unfilled background.

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:33.480 align:middle line:84%
They are integral parts
of the whole composition,

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:38.060 align:middle line:84%
suggestive and pregnant voids
and mists which leave something

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:42.280 align:middle line:84%
to our imagination, even
though we don't make

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:44.410 align:middle line:84%
the mistake of trying
actually to fill them

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:48.380 align:middle line:84%
in with detail in
the mind's eye.

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:49.630 align:middle line:90%
We let them remain suggestive.

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:53.050 align:middle line:90%


00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:56.080 align:middle line:84%
"Autumn clouds,
vague and obscure.

00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:00.870 align:middle line:90%
The evening, lonely and chilled.

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:05.700 align:middle line:84%
I felt the dampness on my
garments, but saw no spot

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:11.110 align:middle line:90%
and heard no sound of rain."

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:15.410 align:middle line:84%
"Cliffs that rise a thousand
feet without a break.

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:20.390 align:middle line:84%
Lake that stretches a
hundred miles without a wave.

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:25.420 align:middle line:84%
Sands that are white through
all the year without a stain.

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Pine tree woods, winter
and summer, evergreen.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:35.910 align:middle line:84%
Streams that forever flow
and flow without a pause.

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:40.350 align:middle line:84%
Trees that for 20,000
years your vows have kept.

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:43.750 align:middle line:84%
You have suddenly healed the
pain of a traveler's heart

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:49.370 align:middle line:84%
and moved his brush
to write a new song."

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:54.520 align:middle line:84%
"There was something vague
before heaven and earth arose.

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:58.320 align:middle line:90%
How calm, how void.

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.022 align:middle line:90%
It stands alone, unchanging.

00:21:01.022 --> 00:21:05.690 align:middle line:90%
It acts everywhere, untiring.

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:09.910 align:middle line:84%
It may be considered the mother
of everything under heaven.

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:16.960 align:middle line:84%
I do not know its name, but
call it by the word Tao."

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:20.900 align:middle line:84%
"The Tao is something
and indistinct.

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:27.230 align:middle line:84%
How indistinct, how blurred,
yet within it, our images.

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:33.240 align:middle line:84%
How blurred, how indistinct,
yet within it are things.

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:42.460 align:middle line:84%
How dim, how confused, yet
within it is creative power."

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:47.460 align:middle line:84%
"Picking chrysanthemums
along the eastern fence.

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:50.900 align:middle line:84%
Gazing in silence of
the southern hills.

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:54.660 align:middle line:84%
The birds fly home in pairs
through the soft mountain

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:57.180 align:middle line:90%
air of dusk.

00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:00.830 align:middle line:84%
In all these things,
there is a deep meaning.

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:04.430 align:middle line:84%
But when we are
about to express it,

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:09.570 align:middle line:90%
we suddenly forget the words."

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:13.650 align:middle line:84%
"The song of birds,
the voices of insects,

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:18.250 align:middle line:84%
are all means of conveying
truth to the mind.

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:24.510 align:middle line:84%
In flowers and grasses, we
see messages of the Tao.

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:30.430 align:middle line:84%
The scholar, pure and clear of
mind, serene and open of heart,

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:34.810 align:middle line:84%
should find in everything
what nourishes him.

00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:41.250 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to know
where the flowers come from,

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:46.270 align:middle line:84%
even the god of
spring doesn't know."

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:53.120 align:middle line:84%
"Things are produced around us,
but no one knows the whence.

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:58.950 align:middle line:84%
They issue forth, but
no one sees the portal.

00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:02.310 align:middle line:84%
Men, one and all, value
that part of knowledge

00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:04.140 align:middle line:90%
which is known.

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:08.160 align:middle line:84%
They do not know how to avail
themselves of the unknown

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.340 align:middle line:90%
in order to reach knowledge.

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:15.730 align:middle line:90%
Is not this misguided?"

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:20.390 align:middle line:84%
But it isn't by pushing
relentlessly and aggressively

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:23.110 align:middle line:84%
beyond those hills
that we discover

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:26.955 align:middle line:84%
this unknown and persuade
nature to disclose her secrets.

00:23:26.955 --> 00:23:30.080 align:middle line:90%


00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:32.930 align:middle line:84%
What is beyond,
that is also here.

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:36.030 align:middle line:90%


00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:40.000 align:middle line:84%
Any place where we
are may be considered

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.220 align:middle line:90%
the center of the universe.

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:45.910 align:middle line:84%
Anywhere that we stand
can be considered

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:47.600 align:middle line:90%
the destination of our journey.

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.490 align:middle line:90%


00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:54.780 align:middle line:84%
But we have to be
receptive and open.

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:57.620 align:middle line:84%
We have, in other words,
to do what Lao-Tzu advised

00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:03.070 align:middle line:84%
when he said,
"While being a man,

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:08.660 align:middle line:84%
yet one should also preserve
a certain femininity.

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And thereby one will become a
channel for the whole universe.

00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And you know, that's one of
the things which I believe,

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:23.800 align:middle line:84%
in our culture of the
West, is submerged.

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:28.310 align:middle line:84%
The feminine values
are despised values.

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And we find,
typically among men,

00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:35.620 align:middle line:84%
a strange kind of
reluctance to be anything

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:43.090 align:middle line:84%
but a man, a kind of
anxiety to be 100% male.

00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:45.100 align:middle line:90%
And that's a kind of monster.

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:49.610 align:middle line:84%
A man who is 100%
male, 100% tough guy,

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:53.740 align:middle line:84%
is a sort of human
mollusk who has

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:56.840 align:middle line:90%
no softness and no sensitivity.

00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, it's a common
psychological observation

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:03.430 align:middle line:84%
that people who are
constantly anxious to prove

00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:06.950 align:middle line:84%
their masculinity, who are
scared to death of being sissy,

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:09.950 align:middle line:84%
of being weak, of
being unaggressive,

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:12.020 align:middle line:84%
those are the very
people who have

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:13.980 align:middle line:84%
doubts about their
own masculinity, who

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:17.360 align:middle line:90%
are not really sure of it.

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:22.500 align:middle line:84%
And so there is a
tremendous necessity for us

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:25.940 align:middle line:84%
to value alongside, as it
were, the aggressive masculine

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:31.500 align:middle line:84%
element symbolized by the sword,
the receptive feminine element

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:35.681 align:middle line:84%
symbolized, perhaps,
by the open flower.

00:25:35.681 --> 00:25:42.920 align:middle line:84%
For after all, our human
senses are not knives.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:45.100 align:middle line:90%
They're not hooks.

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:49.910 align:middle line:84%
They are the soft ball of
the eye, the delicate drum

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:54.100 align:middle line:84%
of the ear, the soft skin
on the tips of the fingers

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:55.700 align:middle line:90%
and on the body.

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:59.110 align:middle line:84%
It is through these
delicate receptive things

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:03.080 align:middle line:84%
that we basically receive
our knowledge of the world.

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:08.210 align:middle line:84%
And therefore its is through a
kind of weakness and softness

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:13.420 align:middle line:84%
that it is possible for
knowledge to come to us.

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:19.300 align:middle line:84%
So putting it in
another way, we have

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:25.510 align:middle line:84%
to come to terms with nature by
wooing her rather than fighting

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:27.120 align:middle line:90%
her.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:30.780 align:middle line:84%
Not just putting nature
at the so-called distance

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:32.710 align:middle line:84%
of objectivity, as
if she were an enemy

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:40.730 align:middle line:84%
to be shot, but something
rather to be known by embrace,

00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:41.630 align:middle line:90%
like a beloved wife.

00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:44.740 align:middle line:90%


00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:49.840 align:middle line:84%
For you see, what does one
really want to know about it?

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:54.060 align:middle line:84%
Does one rather want to
manage the whole thing?

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:57.280 align:middle line:84%
Does one want to be a kind
of omnipotent god in control

00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:00.120 align:middle line:90%
of it all?

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:04.150 align:middle line:84%
Or does one, rather,
want to enjoy it?

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:08.680 align:middle line:84%
One cannot, after all, enjoy
what you all the time anxious

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:11.570 align:middle line:90%
about controlling.

00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:13.560 align:middle line:84%
One of the nice things
about one's own body

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:17.450 align:middle line:84%
is you don't have to think
about it all the time.

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:19.420 align:middle line:84%
If you had, when you
woke up in the morning,

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:22.950 align:middle line:84%
to think about every
detail of your circulation,

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:24.810 align:middle line:90%
you would never get to the day.

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:28.050 align:middle line:84%
As was well said,
the mystery of life

00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:30.940 align:middle line:84%
is not a problem to be
solved, but a reality

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:32.790 align:middle line:90%
to be experienced.

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:34.912 align:middle line:90%
