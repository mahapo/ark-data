00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.520 align:middle line:84%
>>Throughout this
series, I have been

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.420 align:middle line:84%
trying to explain two
fundamentally different ways

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.940 align:middle line:84%
of looking at our world-- one
characteristic, predominantly

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.930 align:middle line:84%
of the West, and the
other of the East.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And these might be
called, respectively,

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.690 align:middle line:84%
the way of description as
opposed to the way of seeing.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.400 align:middle line:84%
The way, in other words,
of understanding things

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.120 align:middle line:90%
in words or in terms.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.110 align:middle line:84%
Contrasted with the way of
understanding through looking

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.020 align:middle line:84%
and seeing a field or a
subject totally all at once.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.900 align:middle line:84%
Or you might call
these the linear view,

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.920 align:middle line:84%
strung out in a line, or the
total view, seeing all at once.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.500 align:middle line:84%
Or the serial view
on the one hand,

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.980 align:middle line:84%
as contrasted with the
simultaneous view on the other.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, in classical
Western science,

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.920 align:middle line:84%
we have depended largely on
this serial, or analytic,

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.340 align:middle line:84%
view, which understands
the world by translating it

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:31.030 align:middle line:84%
into ideas, into words, or into,
say, even series of numbers.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.050 align:middle line:84%
The basic feature of
it being that things

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:40.520 align:middle line:84%
are understood in a step
by step way, in sequence.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.220 align:middle line:84%
And insofar as we constantly
look at nature in that way,

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.840 align:middle line:84%
we tend to think of nature
as something constructed.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.350 align:middle line:84%
Something, in other words,
made or put together as we

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.840 align:middle line:84%
ourselves make and
put things together

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.700 align:middle line:90%
through a series of steps.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps this
gives us the feeling

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.130 align:middle line:84%
that if we understood nature
sufficiently, if we understood

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.070 align:middle line:84%
in full detail all
the steps which

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.220 align:middle line:84%
go to the making
of our universe,

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.830 align:middle line:90%
we could ourselves make it.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's here, you see, that we
get a very fundamental contrast

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.350 align:middle line:84%
between East and
West, and especially

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.790 align:middle line:84%
through Chinese
and Japanese ideas

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.140 align:middle line:90%
of the formation of nature.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.710 align:middle line:84%
Because for them,
it seems extremely

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:36.290 align:middle line:84%
odd to think of nature as
being constructed or made

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.720 align:middle line:84%
by a sort of step
by step procedure.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.390 align:middle line:84%
Their feeling is rather
that the world and its forms

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.560 align:middle line:84%
are not so much
constructed as grown.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.340 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
most important keys

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.990 align:middle line:84%
to an understanding
of Far Eastern thought

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:58.730 align:middle line:84%
is to see the difference between
a view of a constructed world

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.960 align:middle line:90%
and a grown world.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, to give a sort of
crazy illustration of this,

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.160 align:middle line:90%
supposing I construct something.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.100 align:middle line:84%
For example, an
artificial flower.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And you know, when
you get instructions

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.906 align:middle line:84%
how to do this, and you but
a book of do it yourself

00:03:10.906 --> 00:03:12.860 align:middle line:84%
artificial flowers,
you get a step

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.820 align:middle line:84%
by step procedure which
tells you what to do.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.030 align:middle line:84%
Step one, take a piece of
wire with a black button

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.080 align:middle line:90%
and affix it to the end.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.880 align:middle line:84%
Step two, take the stamens,
previously cut out,

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.590 align:middle line:90%
and affix it to the button.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.020 align:middle line:84%
Next step, insert a
disk of sticky material,

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.200 align:middle line:84%
push the wire
through the middle,

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.131 align:middle line:90%
and then affix the petals.

00:03:44.131 --> 00:03:45.160 align:middle line:90%
Here they go.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And notice that
as I put them on,

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:56.730 align:middle line:84%
I take them from outside and
around me things that are bits,

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:04.110 align:middle line:84%
and I bring these
bits together to make

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.470 align:middle line:84%
the flower, the
construction, or whatever

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:13.680 align:middle line:84%
form it is that I'm
intending to create.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.959 align:middle line:84%
And so from going
around to the center,

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.430 align:middle line:84%
from getting something
that was previously pieces

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.780 align:middle line:84%
and bringing it all
together, I get my flower.

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.420 align:middle line:84%
But now, watch how an
actual flower grows.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.400 align:middle line:84%
How it starts, as it
were, from the center.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And it unfolds itself,
not bit by bit,

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.420 align:middle line:84%
but all the parts of the
flower exfoliating together,

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.100 align:middle line:90%
from the center outwards.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.340 align:middle line:84%
In contrast to the
making process,

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.880 align:middle line:84%
which goes from the
outside inwards.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:58.400 align:middle line:84%
From a situation where the
parts our originally all apart,

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.760 align:middle line:90%
all in bits, and then assembled.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.850 align:middle line:84%
Contrasting with
a situation where

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.720 align:middle line:84%
you have some simple beginning,
like a seed or a bud.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And as it expands, it
constellates, or forms,

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.530 align:middle line:84%
its own parts from
within itself.

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.680 align:middle line:84%
And this is the fundamental
process of natural growth.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.410 align:middle line:84%
It's in the same way
that the human baby

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.220 align:middle line:90%
is formed within the womb.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.550 align:middle line:84%
It's in the same way that
if you watch crystals

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.320 align:middle line:84%
under a microscope
forming in a solution,

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.460 align:middle line:84%
you will notice the whole
area of the crystal,

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.680 align:middle line:84%
the whole structure
of the crystal coming

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.300 align:middle line:90%
into being all together at once.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And you will not
see a kind of bit

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:43.590 align:middle line:84%
by bit assemblage, which we
use when we make machines,

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.850 align:middle line:90%
or make houses, or make tools.

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:47.810 align:middle line:84%
Even when we carve
a block of wood,

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.800 align:middle line:84%
although the block of
wood is not originally

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.810 align:middle line:90%
a lot of distinct parts.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.040 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, we work
upon it from the outside

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.470 align:middle line:90%
towards the inside.

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.090 align:middle line:84%
Whereas all processes of
growth go from the inside

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.640 align:middle line:90%
to the outside.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:07.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, in our current
scientific way

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.130 align:middle line:84%
of thinking in the West,
this kind of growth,

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.810 align:middle line:84%
this kind of formation
is always talked

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.180 align:middle line:84%
about in terms of what
we call field theory.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.720 align:middle line:90%
Fields of force.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And I suppose one of the most
striking exhibitions of what

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.390 align:middle line:84%
a field is can be
seen in looking

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:37.150 align:middle line:84%
at the formation of magnetic
lines of force in iron filings.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:44.280 align:middle line:84%
As when we take filings
that are not magnetized,

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:48.060 align:middle line:84%
just thrown chaotically
over an area.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And then with the
magnets underneath,

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:57.760 align:middle line:84%
notice that all the filings
form together into a pattern.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.900 align:middle line:84%
The whole area moving together,
every single part of it

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.350 align:middle line:90%
simultaneously into its shape.

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And that shows us the whole
nature of a field of force.

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:13.940 align:middle line:90%


00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, the fascinating
thing is that some

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:19.650 align:middle line:84%
of these fundamental
words which we've

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:22.120 align:middle line:84%
been studying
throughout this program

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.250 align:middle line:84%
form the basic
principle of nature,

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:28.810 align:middle line:84%
or the basic reality
underlying the world,

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:33.850 align:middle line:84%
are words that have
the meaning of a field.

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:36.990 align:middle line:84%
Let's take, for
example, the word

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:41.000 align:middle line:84%
I introduced to you
some programs ago.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.040 align:middle line:90%
A term used in Buddhism, Sunya.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:54.080 align:middle line:84%
Sunya, which meant the void--
the great space, as it were,

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.850 align:middle line:90%
underlying the whole world.

00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:59.260 align:middle line:84%
This has in it the
idea of a field

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:05.350 align:middle line:84%
in the same way that basic
Chinese word Tao also

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:08.630 align:middle line:84%
has the idea of a
field of forces,

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.460 align:middle line:84%
an area in which
everything happens.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:15.780 align:middle line:84%
Or again, the
Hindu word Brahman.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:19.650 align:middle line:84%
Although it doesn't
literally mean a field,

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:26.480 align:middle line:84%
it's also often symbolized by
the idea of a vast inclusive

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.580 align:middle line:90%
space.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And the direct connection of
this with the idea of a field

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:39.270 align:middle line:84%
comes out in another Buddhist
word which describes the entire

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:39.770 align:middle line:90%
.

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:40.770 align:middle line:90%
Universe.

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:53.040 align:middle line:84%
This Sanskrit word, Dharma, that
means, well, law or function.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.920 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it means
the Buddhist doctrine.

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.660 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it means a method.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:00.250 align:middle line:84%
But you could say Dharma,
in this particular context,

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:03.410 align:middle line:84%
means the fundamental
order of the world.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:08.800 align:middle line:84%
And so the expression meaning
universe is Dharma-Dhatu.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And this Sanskrit word, Dhatu,
is usually translated "realm."

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:19.760 align:middle line:84%
But it has the idea of a
field, especially when you

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:23.410 align:middle line:84%
see its Chinese equivalent,
which is written this way.

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:27.800 align:middle line:90%


00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And here we have the character
at the top actually means

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.820 align:middle line:90%
a field.

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And the bottom part of the
character means a shellfish,

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.530 align:middle line:84%
but think of something like
a clam with two shells.

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And giving one the idea of
inclusion, or enclosing in.

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:49.540 align:middle line:90%
The enclosed within a field.

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:50.820 align:middle line:90%
This is Dharma-Dhatu.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.390 align:middle line:90%


00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:59.410 align:middle line:84%
And then in turn, in the
field there is a structure.

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And the structure
of the field is

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:05.280 align:middle line:84%
thought of as governing the
formation of the universe.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.570 align:middle line:84%
And you may remember
that in the last program

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:10.800 align:middle line:84%
I gave you a particular
Chinese word which

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.530 align:middle line:84%
meant the basic pattern
or order of the world.

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:16.380 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember this word
which is pronounced Lee,

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:24.310 align:middle line:84%
and which had as its original
meaning the markings in jade,

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:28.730 align:middle line:84%
the fiber in muscle,
or the grain in wood.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:35.970 align:middle line:84%
This word then designates the
basic structure within the Tao,

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:40.780 align:middle line:84%
within the fundamental
field of the world.

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:46.800 align:middle line:84%
And thus, its order,
which can be, as it were,

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.940 align:middle line:90%
understood by looking at it.

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:54.062 align:middle line:84%
But is too complex, too much
happening so fast, all together

00:10:54.062 --> 00:10:58.920 align:middle line:84%
at once for us ever to be able
to analyze it in the relatively

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.830 align:middle line:90%
clumsy language of words.

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:02.530 align:middle line:84%
Now thus, you see,
it seems to us

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:07.790 align:middle line:84%
that that order is
enormously complex.

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:12.570 align:middle line:84%
The order of nature, the order
of beauty, the order of ethics,

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:15.460 align:middle line:84%
all these kinds of
orders baffle us

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:19.580 align:middle line:84%
when we try to think
about them bit by bit.

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:24.930 align:middle line:84%
But actually, this order
is only a complicated order

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:27.470 align:middle line:90%
when we try to think about it.

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:29.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's very
simple, isn't it,

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:31.730 align:middle line:84%
to drink water if you put
it in a cup or a glass

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:33.330 align:middle line:90%
and toss it down.

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:35.320 align:middle line:84%
But it would be
extraordinarily complex

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:39.420 align:middle line:84%
if one tried to drink
water with a fork.

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And in the same way, the world
and the order of the world,

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:47.320 align:middle line:84%
the activity within the field,
seems incredibly complicated

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.710 align:middle line:84%
to us when we try
to translate it

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:53.020 align:middle line:90%
into thinking and into words.

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:58.320 align:middle line:84%
But this then is the fundamental
Chinese Taoist and Indian

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:06.030 align:middle line:84%
Buddhist view of how the
formations of the world arise.

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:11.980 align:middle line:84%
Not by a step by step process
which can be put down in a line

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.880 align:middle line:84%
like the instructions
for making the flower .

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:19.120 align:middle line:84%
But by something which happens
spontaneously all together

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.720 align:middle line:90%
at once.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And this particular
form of activity

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:28.330 align:middle line:84%
is commonly represented
in Eastern art

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:34.640 align:middle line:84%
by many armed and many headed
figures of various divinities.

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:41.840 align:middle line:84%
Such as this particular
Tibetan figure of Quan Yin.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:46.740 align:middle line:84%
You know, Quan Yin is sometimes
known as the goddess of mercy,

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.310 align:middle line:84%
but actually, Quan
Yin only became

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:54.400 align:middle line:84%
a goddess figure when
it reached China.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:58.740 align:middle line:84%
The original meaning
of this figure

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:07.370 align:middle line:84%
is a representation of the
power aspect of nature.

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And this wonderful
Tibetan figure

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:14.180 align:middle line:84%
is graciously lent from the
collection of my friend, Mr.

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:17.250 align:middle line:84%
Ching Wah Lee here
in San Francisco.

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:19.460 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting
thing about it

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:25.040 align:middle line:84%
is, you see, that the figure
has three faces and eight arms.

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And you might think
that that presents

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:28.975 align:middle line:84%
an incredible problem
of coordination.

00:13:28.975 --> 00:13:31.950 align:middle line:90%


00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:38.040 align:middle line:84%
But isn't it really
the same problem

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:41.510 align:middle line:84%
that we have in being alive
in the simplest and most

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:43.320 align:middle line:90%
fundamental way?

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:46.480 align:middle line:84%
Our own bodies, without our
thinking about it at all,

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.900 align:middle line:84%
are doing all kinds of
things all together at once,

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:51.885 align:middle line:84%
and we don't have to
stop to think about it.

00:13:51.885 --> 00:13:55.900 align:middle line:84%
You remember the little
rhyme-- thinking of creatures

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:59.420 align:middle line:84%
with many arms-- the
little rhyme that says,

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:03.030 align:middle line:84%
the centipede was happy
quite until a toad in fun

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:06.620 align:middle line:84%
said, pray, which
leg goes after which?

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.640 align:middle line:84%
This worked its
mind to such a pitch

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:13.097 align:middle line:84%
it lay distracted in a ditch,
considering how to run.

00:14:13.097 --> 00:14:15.180 align:middle line:84%
And you may have noticed
the same thing can happen

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:18.310 align:middle line:84%
to us when we think too
hard about how we breathe.

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:20.650 align:middle line:84%
Or if you're doing
something to which you're

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:22.580 align:middle line:84%
accustomed in quite
a mechanical way,

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:25.379 align:middle line:84%
like knitting or
tying your neck tie.

00:14:25.379 --> 00:14:27.920 align:middle line:84%
When you begin to think about
it too hard, you get balled up,

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.640 align:middle line:90%
and you start dropping stitches.

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:34.235 align:middle line:84%
And so one might ask, how
is it possible for Quan

00:14:34.235 --> 00:14:38.710 align:middle line:84%
Yin, this figure that we have
seen, to use so many arms,

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:41.150 align:middle line:84%
to use so many
faces, so many eyes?

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:42.270 align:middle line:90%
It's the same question.

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:44.660 align:middle line:84%
How can the centipede
use so many legs?

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:47.980 align:middle line:84%
How can we make our
bodies function,

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:50.720 align:middle line:84%
all the different parts of
it going together at once

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.920 align:middle line:84%
without having our having
to think about it at all.

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:56.390 align:middle line:84%
And the answer that the
Eastern world would give

00:14:56.390 --> 00:15:00.640 align:middle line:84%
is that it happens because
it is a field of forces.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:05.070 align:middle line:84%
It is, in other words, the
process that's going on,

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:11.900 align:middle line:84%
not governed by a boss, but a
process that is self-governing.

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:17.840 align:middle line:84%
Because you see, their
idea of nature corresponds,

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:21.740 align:middle line:84%
perhaps we would say, to
a democracy rather than

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:24.470 align:middle line:90%
a monarchy.

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:27.810 align:middle line:84%
In a monarchy, we have a
political type of order

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:32.940 align:middle line:84%
where one mastermind is telling
all the other people what

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:34.820 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:38.860 align:middle line:84%
But we are aspiring, aren't
we, in a democratic kind

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:41.430 align:middle line:90%
of political setup.

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:44.090 align:middle line:84%
To have something that is
not so much like a monarchy

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:50.130 align:middle line:84%
as it is like a living organism
which is self-governing,

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:53.220 align:middle line:84%
where all the parts
develop independently

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:58.230 align:middle line:84%
and yet harmoniously in terms
of the pattern in a field.

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And so speaking of the
fundamental principle

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:05.970 align:middle line:84%
behind the world, old
Lao-Tzu-- you remember him.

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:08.750 align:middle line:84%
I'll write his name
down again, just

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:13.640 align:middle line:84%
in case you forget
this rather difficult

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:21.420 align:middle line:84%
Chinese pronunciation, Lao-Tzu,
the founder of the Taoist

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:23.280 align:middle line:90%
philosophy.

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:27.320 align:middle line:84%
Said to have lived about 600 BC,
but probably lived much later.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.920 align:middle line:84%
He said, speaking of
Tao, the great Tao

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:35.610 align:middle line:84%
flows everywhere, both to
the left and to the right.

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:38.710 align:middle line:84%
By it, all things
come in to being.

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:44.430 align:middle line:84%
It loves and nourishes them,
but does not lord it over them.

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:49.050 align:middle line:84%
Merits accomplished,
it lays no claim to.

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:53.700 align:middle line:84%
In other words, this is an idea
of the ultimate reality which

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.160 align:middle line:84%
does not govern the
universe by ruling it,

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.860 align:middle line:84%
by telling it what to
do, but by, as it were,

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:03.790 align:middle line:84%
letting it be free to
organize itself harmoniously.

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:06.640 align:middle line:84%
In the same way as you
saw the iron filings

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.260 align:middle line:84%
organizing themselves
within the magnetic field.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.910 align:middle line:84%
In the same way as
you saw the natural

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:15.470 align:middle line:84%
rose growing as distinct from
the artificial daisy being

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:19.150 align:middle line:90%
made by being put together.

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:27.750 align:middle line:84%
Now then, these forms
of Asian philosophy

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:33.760 align:middle line:84%
want us, as individuals,
to feel that we participate

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:38.390 align:middle line:84%
in this great
democracy of nature.

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:42.100 align:middle line:84%
No longer as
isolated individuals

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:46.390 align:middle line:84%
trying to push it
around, or command it

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:49.560 align:middle line:90%
like monarchs or bosses.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:54.930 align:middle line:84%
For their conception of
the omnipotence of nature

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:58.700 align:middle line:84%
is not like the
omnipotence of a king,

00:17:58.700 --> 00:17:59.950 align:middle line:90%
but of a self-governing state.

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:03.010 align:middle line:90%


00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:07.370 align:middle line:84%
Not a mere collection
of units, but a body,

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:11.400 align:middle line:90%
a self-organizing pattern.

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And they want us to feel that
the true self of each one of us

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:18.550 align:middle line:90%
is that entire pattern.

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:21.740 align:middle line:90%


00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:25.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the ordinary
way, we feel

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:30.780 align:middle line:84%
that although I am doing certain
things, nevertheless most

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:32.980 align:middle line:84%
of what is going
on in the world is

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:36.650 align:middle line:84%
happening quite
independently of me.

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:40.600 align:middle line:84%
The motions of the
clouds and winds,

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:45.370 align:middle line:84%
the circling of the stars,
the fluctuation of the tides,

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:47.570 align:middle line:90%
the flowing rivers.

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:53.080 align:middle line:84%
All these seem to happen quite
independently of the individual

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:53.580 align:middle line:90%
me.

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:56.290 align:middle line:90%


00:18:56.290 --> 00:19:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And yet, the flowing
of rivers, which

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:04.060 align:middle line:84%
seem to go along by
themselves, are surely

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:07.430 align:middle line:84%
neither more nor
less independent

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:12.920 align:middle line:84%
of the individual me than
the beating of my own heart.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:18.400 align:middle line:84%
Which, although it seems to
go on independently-- I mean,

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.920 align:middle line:84%
I don't will the
beating of my heart.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:23.900 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, what is
more fundamentally me,

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:27.850 align:middle line:84%
the very center of my
physiological life?

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And if I don't will the
beating of my heart, might it

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:35.440 align:middle line:84%
not also be possible to
feel that although I do not

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:40.050 align:middle line:84%
will the motions of the winds,
the tides, and the stars,

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:42.690 align:middle line:84%
that these are
nevertheless just as much

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:48.080 align:middle line:84%
my activity as the coursing
of the blood in my veins.

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:51.070 align:middle line:84%
Moving without my having
to think about it,

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:53.420 align:middle line:90%
like the centipede's legs.

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:57.350 align:middle line:84%
Might we not be able to feel
that the whole eternal universe

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:58.920 align:middle line:90%
is our body?

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:01.800 align:middle line:84%
Like this system here
in which every point

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:05.430 align:middle line:84%
is defined by its ties
with every other point.

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:11.170 align:middle line:84%
Now then, the fundamental and
final question that remains

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:17.260 align:middle line:84%
is, how are we to
come to feel that way?

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:24.370 align:middle line:84%
How are we not just to think,
but actually to realize,

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:28.000 align:middle line:84%
to make real to
ourselves, to feel

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.660 align:middle line:84%
that the motions of
the heavenly bodies,

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:38.310 align:middle line:84%
the rivers, the seas, the
winds, are all my body.

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:44.680 align:middle line:84%
How are we to feel the general
impression of life in which man

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:50.990 align:middle line:84%
is no longer the isolated,
lonely, separate ego trying

00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:55.480 align:middle line:84%
desperately to defend
himself by attempting

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:58.060 align:middle line:90%
to become the world's monarchy?

00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:01.870 align:middle line:84%
But feeling rather,
instead, a profound kinship,

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:03.890 align:middle line:84%
and fellowship,
and fundamentally

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:08.790 align:middle line:84%
love for the whole world just
as if it were his own body,

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:10.090 align:middle line:90%
which in this view, it is.

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:14.170 align:middle line:90%


00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:18.450 align:middle line:84%
The thing which all these great
Eastern philosophies insist

00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:22.860 align:middle line:84%
upon, whether they be Indian
or whether they be Chinese,

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:27.840 align:middle line:84%
is at first sight
rather depressing to us.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:34.160 align:middle line:84%
Because the fundamental insight
is that our ego and our will

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:38.510 align:middle line:84%
can do nothing to
acquire this feeling

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:40.870 align:middle line:84%
of fundamental unity
and solidarity.

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:43.220 align:middle line:90%
It can't do anything at all.

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And the feeling cannot
be had until, as we say,

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:50.520 align:middle line:90%
we have given up our own will.

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:53.300 align:middle line:90%
Set aside our own ego.

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:56.925 align:middle line:84%
This after all too corresponds
with the great basic Christian

00:21:56.925 --> 00:22:03.580 align:middle line:84%
insight where, as for example,
Dante says of the will of God,

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:06.225 align:middle line:90%
in his will is our peace.

00:22:06.225 --> 00:22:09.590 align:middle line:84%
Or as another
Christian writer says,

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:12.780 align:middle line:84%
our wills are ours
to make them thine.

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:15.960 align:middle line:84%
In all the great religious
traditions of the world,

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:19.360 align:middle line:84%
there is the recurrent
theme of self-surrender

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:22.500 align:middle line:90%
of giving up one's self.

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.740 align:middle line:84%
Now at first sight, this
seems something spineless.

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:31.650 align:middle line:84%
This seems something weak and
namby pamby, as if-- you know,

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:34.960 align:middle line:84%
the Marxists always
say, religion

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:37.130 align:middle line:90%
is the opium of the people.

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:42.150 align:middle line:84%
And they validate their point
of view by saying, look,

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:44.800 align:middle line:84%
religion always tells people
to give up their will.

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:47.010 align:middle line:84%
That's so that the tyrant
can push them around,

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:50.730 align:middle line:84%
the nasty capitalists can
make them do what they want.

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:57.310 align:middle line:84%
But they forget that in the
giving up of our own will,

00:22:57.310 --> 00:23:02.280 align:middle line:84%
we do not surrender
power, we gain power.

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.995 align:middle line:84%
Because in the giving
up of our own will,

00:23:04.995 --> 00:23:07.840 align:middle line:84%
we are, as it were,
making ourselves

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:12.760 align:middle line:84%
an empty channel through which
a greater power than our own

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:14.480 align:middle line:90%
can pass through.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:19.250 align:middle line:84%
Lao-Tzu said, you know,
the usefulness of a window

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:24.100 align:middle line:84%
is not so much in the
frame as in the empty space

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:26.846 align:middle line:84%
through which
something can be seen.

00:23:26.846 --> 00:23:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And so in the same
way, you might

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:32.010 align:middle line:84%
say that the power
of a human being

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:37.190 align:middle line:84%
is not so much in his
particular individual identity

00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:39.930 align:middle line:84%
as in a certain
kind of emptiness

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:43.750 align:middle line:84%
through which
something can flow.

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And so all the great
religions of the world,

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.470 align:middle line:84%
and most especially
those of the Asian world,

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:57.210 align:middle line:84%
have as their deepest
insight the principle

00:23:57.210 --> 00:24:02.550 align:middle line:84%
that man comes into his own
and finds his true power

00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:06.090 align:middle line:90%
in standing out of his own way.

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:10.650 align:middle line:90%
In getting out of his own light.

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And this involves, as I said,
the surrender of our own will.

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:18.080 align:middle line:84%
But you see, always
the problem is

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:21.110 align:middle line:84%
how does the will
surrender the will?

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:25.130 align:middle line:84%
There is a Chinese saying
that when the wrong man uses

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:30.339 align:middle line:84%
the right means, the right
means work in the wrong way.

00:24:30.339 --> 00:24:31.880 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if
I'm the wrong man,

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:34.620 align:middle line:84%
that is a willful, selfish,
domineering person.

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:37.120 align:middle line:84%
Anything I do to
give up my will will

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:40.860 align:middle line:84%
be motivated by my
fundamental selfishness.

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:43.930 align:middle line:84%
I shall be, in other
words, like a clever woman

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:46.010 align:middle line:90%
who wants to get her man.

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:48.120 align:middle line:84%
But she knows that this
particular man always

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.970 align:middle line:90%
runs away if you go after him.

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:51.600 align:middle line:84%
So she acts as if
she doesn't want him.

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.980 align:middle line:90%
She gives him up apparently.

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:55.830 align:middle line:84%
But her real motive is,
of course, to get him.

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:58.620 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, she is just,
as it were, playing a trick.

00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:01.950 align:middle line:84%
It's a kind of clever
feminine wile, or deceit.

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And so in the same
way, if we say,

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:06.250 align:middle line:84%
now, I'm going to
surrender my ego.

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:07.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be unselfish.

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:13.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give up my will so
that I can become one with God.

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:17.620 align:middle line:84%
Also that I can feel
this splendid fellowship

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:19.090 align:middle line:84%
with the whole
universe, and feel

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:23.040 align:middle line:84%
that my identity is no longer
lonely little me, but all.

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:26.090 align:middle line:84%
I shall have as the fundamental
motive doing it, after all,

00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:28.240 align:middle line:90%
for my own advantage.

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:31.020 align:middle line:84%
After all, because
this is a new way

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:35.100 align:middle line:84%
of finding spiritual and
psychological security.

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:39.779 align:middle line:84%
And so because it is basically
insincere, it won't work.

00:25:39.779 --> 00:25:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, what
is at first sight

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:44.015 align:middle line:84%
depressing about
Eastern insights

00:25:44.015 --> 00:25:51.350 align:middle line:84%
into this matter is not
only that our will, when

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:53.460 align:middle line:84%
it is aggressive and
assertive, stands

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:55.830 align:middle line:84%
in the way of this
understanding.

00:25:55.830 --> 00:26:00.790 align:middle line:84%
It also goes on to say that we
cannot even surrender our will

00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:02.890 align:middle line:90%
on purpose.

00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And that when it becomes
perfectly clear to us

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:10.110 align:middle line:84%
that there is nothing at
all that we can do about it,

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:12.760 align:middle line:84%
either positively by trying
to achieve something,

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:15.700 align:middle line:84%
or negatively by
giving ourselves up,

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:18.666 align:middle line:84%
this is the
fundamental deflation

00:26:18.666 --> 00:26:24.040 align:middle line:84%
of our ego and its whole
domineering quality.

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:25.840 align:middle line:90%
This is the limit.

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.380 align:middle line:84%
At this, it doesn't
give itself up.

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:32.260 align:middle line:84%
It sees that it has no
alternative but to give up.

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:38.450 align:middle line:84%
And from the
emptiness, the silence,

00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:44.710 align:middle line:84%
the feeling of impotence
that follows this,

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:50.160 align:middle line:84%
the whole vision of
a united world busts

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.960 align:middle line:90%
like a flower from its bud.

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:59.834 align:middle line:90%
