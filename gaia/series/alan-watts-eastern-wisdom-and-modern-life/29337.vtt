00:00:00.984 --> 00:00:04.428 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.428 --> 00:00:37.096 align:middle line:90%


00:00:37.096 --> 00:00:41.990 align:middle line:84%
>>In our now last
talk, I was trying

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.540 align:middle line:84%
to explain what
training in Zen Buddhism

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.985 align:middle line:84%
does to change
human consciousness.

00:00:48.985 --> 00:00:52.420 align:middle line:90%


00:00:52.420 --> 00:01:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And I showed that it takes
away our ingrained tendency

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.840 align:middle line:84%
to block ourselves
in thought and action

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.410 align:middle line:84%
by the mechanisms of
self-consciousness.

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:13.240 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that a person
can't be self-conscious anymore

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.630 align:middle line:84%
but he can't think
about what he has to do

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.670 align:middle line:90%
and how to control himself.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:30.410 align:middle line:84%
But he no longer experiences
his observing self-- you know,

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.480 align:middle line:84%
the self that says, what
will other people think?

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.840 align:middle line:90%
Do I make sense?

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.990 align:middle line:90%
Am I right?

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.390 align:middle line:84%
He no longer senses
this as an obstacle.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.430 align:middle line:90%


00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And he receives training
in acting spontaneously

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.780 align:middle line:90%
rather than deliberately.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And as I pointed out,
that as a way of action

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.400 align:middle line:84%
which we are not
ordinarily taught.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.860 align:middle line:84%
All our education
consists in knowing

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.310 align:middle line:84%
how to act and
think deliberately.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And this gives a certain
stickiness or artificiality

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.540 align:middle line:90%
to everything that we do.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.660 align:middle line:84%
But when he has been put
through this training, which

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.450 align:middle line:84%
involves a kind of dying to
himself-- that is to say,

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.300 align:middle line:84%
he gets in a
situation where he's

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.510 align:middle line:84%
faced with an unanswerable
question, the koan, the zen

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.370 align:middle line:90%
problem for meditation.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And all his wits are
exhausted in trying

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.350 align:middle line:90%
to answer this question.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.550 align:middle line:84%
The question being, in
effect, however it is phrased,

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.210 align:middle line:84%
to perform perfectly is
spontaneous, genuine, natural

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.000 align:middle line:90%
act.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.820 align:middle line:90%
Express your true self.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.623 align:middle line:84%
And nobody can do
that intentionally.

00:02:55.623 --> 00:02:59.280 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's
a proverb in India

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.970 align:middle line:84%
that if you think of a monkey
while you're drinking medicine,

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.730 align:middle line:90%
the medicine doesn't cure you.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.240 align:middle line:84%
So imagine a person trying
not to think of a monkey

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.220 align:middle line:90%
while taking medicine.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.890 align:middle line:84%
That's the sort of bind we get
into when we try intentionally

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.840 align:middle line:90%
to be natural.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's only when all
our intentional wisdom,

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.650 align:middle line:84%
our contriving wisdom is
frustrated and brought

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.470 align:middle line:84%
to an end, brought to a
kind of death-- at any rate,

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.580 align:middle line:84%
temporarily-- that a completely
genuine action as possible.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.240 align:middle line:84%
As a Western saying goes, man's
extremity is God's opportunity.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.990 align:middle line:90%


00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, you might
raise the question,

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:51.490 align:middle line:84%
how does a person express
this kind of freedom?

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.360 align:middle line:84%
I finished last time on
the note of the Zen student

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.090 align:middle line:84%
being as free as the
clouds in the water.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.930 align:middle line:84%
The image of the clouds
drifting unobstructedly

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.220 align:middle line:84%
through the sky, the
water flowing on,

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.030 align:middle line:84%
always taking the line
of least resistance,

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.410 align:middle line:84%
but always overcoming even
the hardest obstacles.

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.474 align:middle line:84%
If a person acts
without inner conflict,

00:04:17.474 --> 00:04:21.860 align:middle line:84%
and he acts with true
spontaneity, how does he act?

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.330 align:middle line:84%
What does he do to
express himself?

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of the
very best examples of this

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:35.380 align:middle line:84%
is from the influence of Zen
upon Far Eastern painting.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:41.410 align:middle line:84%
The art of China and Japan
has been very, very profoundly

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.250 align:middle line:90%
influenced by Zen.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, I suppose most of you
know that Chinese painting is

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.750 align:middle line:84%
intimately connected with
Chinese writing, which

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.070 align:middle line:84%
was originally a
pictographic language.

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:03.210 align:middle line:84%
You can see for example
here, how at the top left

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.330 align:middle line:84%
the pictogram of mountains
has become the formal symbol

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.560 align:middle line:84%
written with a brush,
which now means

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.310 align:middle line:84%
mountain or hill in
Chinese characters.

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.750 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty obvious
how concrete objects

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.720 align:middle line:84%
can be represented
by a pictogram.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting to see
how abstract ideas can also

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:24.540 align:middle line:90%
be conveyed.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.530 align:middle line:84%
The next drawing you see
the shows at the top right

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.590 align:middle line:90%
the pictogram of a lizard.

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And below the formal brush
character as now written,

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.700 align:middle line:84%
which means change,
perhaps because this

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.350 align:middle line:84%
was a chameleon who
changed color according

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.560 align:middle line:84%
to his background, or
perhaps because the movements

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.280 align:middle line:84%
of the lizard are so
slippery and rapid.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And then again, you can see
another abstract idea conveyed.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:55.800 align:middle line:84%
The pictogram at the top shows
a mat with a pattern on it.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And the formal brush-written
character below means cause.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.780 align:middle line:84%
Because just as a mat is a
firm basis for something,

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:09.610 align:middle line:84%
so it represents the cause
of a certain situation.

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, every child
brought up in China

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:24.250 align:middle line:84%
learns the discipline of writing
these characters, and to learn,

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.140 align:middle line:84%
as it were, the alphabetic
characters-- how, for example,

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:32.650 align:middle line:84%
to make a cross stroke,
which should look something

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.980 align:middle line:90%
like a bone.

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Or he learns perhaps
the character

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:47.580 align:middle line:84%
which is supposed to contain
all the strokes, the character

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:48.400 align:middle line:90%
meaning eternal.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:53.324 align:middle line:90%


00:06:53.324 --> 00:06:56.320 align:middle line:84%
A lot of you have seen
this writing and work

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.320 align:middle line:84%
done by Mr. [? Maconie ?],
who's a real artist.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And I don't pretend to be
any great calligrapher.

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:09.540 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just showing you
that the art of the brush

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.600 align:middle line:84%
involves endless,
endless practice

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.260 align:middle line:90%
to get these things correct.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.910 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I haven't
done this very well here,

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:18.600 align:middle line:84%
because the top
of this character

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.020 align:middle line:90%
should be more stubby.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.460 align:middle line:84%
But of course, I'm
doing something

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.543 align:middle line:84%
I shouldn't really do at
all, and that's touch up.

00:07:25.543 --> 00:07:30.360 align:middle line:90%


00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.120 align:middle line:84%
All the characters are made
up of certain basic elements.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.420 align:middle line:90%
There are certain basic strokes.

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.283 align:middle line:84%
This is supposed to involve
about seven of them.

00:07:39.283 --> 00:07:41.588 align:middle line:84%
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

00:07:41.588 --> 00:07:44.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where
the seventh is.

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.680 align:middle line:84%
But in learning these
basic strokes, which

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:50.180 align:middle line:84%
are practiced again
and again and again,

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:51.890 align:middle line:84%
the person studying
Chinese writing

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:55.610 align:middle line:84%
acquires, as it were, not
an alphabet in our sense,

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:56.970 align:middle line:90%
but an alphabet of strokes.

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:01.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, in exactly the same
way in the art of painting.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:05.510 align:middle line:84%
Chinese painting is made up of
an alphabet of various strokes

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:06.790 align:middle line:90%
that convey various things.

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And you can see, for example,
how the brush lends itself

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.630 align:middle line:84%
quite naturally to
drawing certain form.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.400 align:middle line:84%
If we take, for example,
just-- that's rather wiggly.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.110 align:middle line:84%
But here is the
leaf of a bamboo.

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:20.750 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.270 align:middle line:90%
The brush draws it naturally.

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:24.840 align:middle line:84%
And it even conveys,
with the part

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.640 align:middle line:84%
at the end where the
ink runs a little dry,

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:31.990 align:middle line:84%
the tip of the leaf where
it may get a bit ragged.

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:33.929 align:middle line:84%
And so with immense
repetitive rapidity,

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:36.780 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of different
sorts of leaves

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:39.530 align:middle line:84%
can be drawn with a
brush-- little leaves

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.554 align:middle line:90%
or wisps of grass.

00:08:41.554 --> 00:08:44.780 align:middle line:90%


00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And there is a book called "The
Mustard Seed Garden," which

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:50.980 align:middle line:84%
is published in this
country under the title

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:56.270 align:middle line:84%
"The Tao of Painting," T-A-O of
painting, by Mai-Mai Sze, which

00:08:56.270 --> 00:09:03.710 align:middle line:84%
shows all the formal executions
the artist goes through

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:09.190 align:middle line:84%
to convey different
shapes-- clouds,

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:14.740 align:middle line:84%
so on-- all in accordance
with the nature of the brush.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, here for example is a
painting by the Japanese artist

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:22.085 align:middle line:84%
Josetsu, showing a very
masterly study of bamboos.

00:09:22.085 --> 00:09:27.190 align:middle line:84%
If you look a little bit over
to the left of the painting,

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:31.980 align:middle line:84%
you can see a spray of bamboos
almost just within view.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:35.650 align:middle line:84%
And actually, the painting
shows a rather amusing subject.

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:39.610 align:middle line:84%
It's a man trying to
catch a fish in a gourd.

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is suggestive
of the futile attempt

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:52.920 align:middle line:84%
to grasp life in
intellectual terms,

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:57.310 align:middle line:84%
to catch the mystery
of being in words.

00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And in the same way, there is
a Chinese proverb which says,

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:09.600 align:middle line:84%
"One picture is
worth 10,000 words."

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:16.210 align:middle line:84%
You see, the problem
is painting is perhaps

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:22.730 align:middle line:84%
a little closer to the
real world than talking.

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:26.790 align:middle line:84%
If I wanted to show you, for
example, how to do something

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:31.170 align:middle line:84%
rather complex,
like tying a knot,

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:35.780 align:middle line:84%
it would be very difficult
to explain in so many words

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:38.020 align:middle line:90%
how that knot is to be tied.

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:41.070 align:middle line:84%
But in an instant,
I can show you.

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And in this way, the
picture shows us far more

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:53.664 align:middle line:84%
than words ever could, and
so it's closer to nature.

00:10:53.664 --> 00:11:00.110 align:middle line:84%
So then the question arises,
is painting something

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:01.680 align:middle line:90%
purely representational?

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.520 align:middle line:84%
Is it an activity,
in other words,

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:10.980 align:middle line:84%
in which man confronts nature,
looks at it, and copies it?

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:14.750 align:middle line:84%
This is a problem that arose
not only in the Far East,

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:19.110 align:middle line:84%
but also arises today in the
world of contemporary art,

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:23.210 align:middle line:84%
contemporary painting,
which incidentally has felt

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:29.510 align:middle line:84%
to some considerable extent the
influence of Far Eastern ideas

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:32.400 align:middle line:90%
and particularly of Zen.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:36.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, very often now we go to
our museums and art galleries.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And we see something on the
walls, which an ordinary Joe

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:44.570 align:middle line:84%
says, that doesn't look
to me like a painting.

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:45.930 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:50.680 align:middle line:84%
Because he has expected to see
a representation of something.

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.840 align:middle line:84%
He has expected to see
the artist do by hand what

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:57.470 align:middle line:90%
the camera does mechanically.

00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't strike him
that a painting does not

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:06.040 align:middle line:90%
have to be a picture.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:11.240 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't necessarily
have to copy nature.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And thus in the Far
East, under the influence

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:17.680 align:middle line:84%
of Taoism and
Buddhism, there has

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:24.890 align:middle line:84%
been evolved what you might call
the natural art of painting,

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:28.920 align:middle line:84%
or painting considered
not as a copy of nature,

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:32.740 align:middle line:90%
but as a work of nature.

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And this has been shown
in an exemplary way

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:43.160 align:middle line:84%
by artists who were
trained in Zen.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:51.060 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they
would master a technique

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:54.780 align:middle line:84%
by all kinds of
careful training.

00:12:54.780 --> 00:13:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And then, when that mastery
of technique-- first of all,

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:03.730 align:middle line:84%
learning to write
Chinese characters;

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:06.100 align:middle line:84%
after that, learning
the basic alphabet of

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:07.920 align:middle line:90%
strokes necessary for painting.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.900 align:middle line:84%
When they had mastered
that technique,

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:14.860 align:middle line:84%
they would give themselves
up completely to spontaneity.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:17.630 align:middle line:84%
One of the most interesting
examples of this

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:22.090 align:middle line:84%
is a great Japanese master of
the 13th century called Sesshu.

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And if you look closely
at this painting,

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:28.880 align:middle line:90%
you can see two things.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:33.860 align:middle line:84%
First of all, there's it's
undoubted technical excellence.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, if
you look closely,

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:40.240 align:middle line:84%
you can see its
relationship to writing,

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:44.840 align:middle line:84%
to the use of the brush
for drawing letters-- what

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.370 align:middle line:90%
you might call the calligraphic.

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:48.550 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you know the
word calligraphic simply

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:52.200 align:middle line:90%
means beauty of writing.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.010 align:middle line:84%
So calligraphy is
beautiful writing.

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:59.500 align:middle line:84%
But you can see the calligraphic
character of this painting.

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that Sesshu had
the most astonishing technique.

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:06.950 align:middle line:84%
He was no one who,
like some people

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:09.020 align:middle line:84%
suspect some contemporary
artists of being,

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:10.930 align:middle line:84%
a person who could
draw, and therefore

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:13.700 align:middle line:90%
did something formless instead.

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:16.670 align:middle line:84%
But now what happens
when a man like Sesshu

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:20.050 align:middle line:90%
really lets himself go?

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:23.210 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:25.680 align:middle line:84%
It's not, perhaps,
until you begin

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:28.360 align:middle line:84%
to move up the
painting a bit and see

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:33.070 align:middle line:84%
what lies above that
you begin to recognize

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:35.755 align:middle line:84%
that this is a
mountain landscape.

00:14:35.755 --> 00:14:38.390 align:middle line:90%


00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:47.130 align:middle line:84%
And this is done with
incredible speed.

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:51.480 align:middle line:84%
Sesshu sometimes, in order to
get a kind of rough effect,

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.980 align:middle line:84%
would use straw with the
ink on instead of a brush.

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:58.280 align:middle line:90%


00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:03.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, what happens when the
same thing is done in writing?

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:06.460 align:middle line:90%


00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:09.130 align:middle line:84%
The formal character
of writing gives way

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:13.080 align:middle line:84%
to a purely spontaneous
way of writing

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.540 align:middle line:90%
in what is called grass style.

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:20.680 align:middle line:84%
Here is a poem which
says, "The morning dawns,

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:23.680 align:middle line:84%
but the dusky
night follows soon.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:27.270 align:middle line:84%
So is life like a
crystal drop of dew.

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:30.900 align:middle line:84%
Unconcerned, the morning
glory goes on, blooming,

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:35.730 align:middle line:84%
blooming, its short
yet full life."

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:37.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, I happen to
know the translation,

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.576 align:middle line:84%
but I can assure
you that when you

00:15:39.576 --> 00:15:41.700 align:middle line:84%
get into that kind of grass
style of writing, which

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:44.940 align:middle line:84%
looks almost like the
tendrils of the morning glory,

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:47.210 align:middle line:84%
Japanese has almost as much
difficulty in reading it

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:47.790 align:middle line:90%
as we have.

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:53.030 align:middle line:90%


00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:57.470 align:middle line:84%
Now let us consider the
medium more carefully

00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:59.380 align:middle line:90%
with which this work is done.

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:03.060 align:middle line:90%


00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:07.349 align:middle line:84%
First of all,
consider the brush.

00:16:07.349 --> 00:16:09.140 align:middle line:84%
A great deal of our
painting is, of course,

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:13.510 align:middle line:84%
done with rather firm brushes
with the kind of bristles

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:15.960 align:middle line:90%
in use for oil.

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:20.250 align:middle line:84%
But the Chinese brush is an
astonishingly flexible thing.

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:23.780 align:middle line:90%


00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:29.890 align:middle line:84%
And notice that is used
with the wrist unsupported.

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:34.820 align:middle line:84%
You don't use it like this
and scratch your drawing away

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:37.660 align:middle line:90%
as we do with a pen.

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:40.040 align:middle line:90%
Your arm is free.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, as it were, the
dynamics of your whole body

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:47.430 align:middle line:90%
go into making a brush stroke.

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:51.030 align:middle line:90%


00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And in this way, the brush being
so responsive to your slightest

00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:03.950 align:middle line:84%
motion reveals character more
strongly than anything else.

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:06.960 align:middle line:90%


00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:10.184 align:middle line:90%
Next, consider ink.

00:17:10.184 --> 00:17:13.569 align:middle line:90%


00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:15.510 align:middle line:84%
Actually, although
this is black ink

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:21.920 align:middle line:84%
rubbed from a
solid stick of ink,

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.510 align:middle line:84%
you might say that it's
capable of enormous variations

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:27.420 align:middle line:90%
in color.

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:30.280 align:middle line:84%
You can mix it with
varying degrees of water

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:34.580 align:middle line:84%
and show all kinds
of depths of black

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:37.080 align:middle line:84%
so that it has
tremendous variation.

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And also here, where
the brush runs dry,

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:46.680 align:middle line:84%
you get a kind of what they
call flying hairlines, which

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:49.435 align:middle line:90%
show the motion of the stroke.

00:17:49.435 --> 00:17:52.600 align:middle line:84%
You know sometimes when
we want to show motion,

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.680 align:middle line:84%
and somebody, say,
is moving his hand--

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:58.674 align:middle line:84%
and here we've got an arm, and
somebody is hitting somebody

00:17:58.674 --> 00:17:59.590 align:middle line:90%
over the head with it.

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:01.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, to show that
the arm is moving,

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:02.430 align:middle line:90%
we do little things like this.

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:05.990 align:middle line:90%


00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:07.720 align:middle line:84%
Here's a hammer in
the hand, you see,

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.928 align:middle line:90%
and the hammer's coming down.

00:18:08.928 --> 00:18:10.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, to show
motion, we do this.

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:14.760 align:middle line:84%
But in this way, motion is shown
in Chinese painting and writing

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:18.580 align:middle line:84%
by the flying hairlines
of the brush, which

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:21.130 align:middle line:90%
give a dynamic quality.

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:24.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, another thing that's very
important about the medium

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:28.610 align:middle line:84%
for purposes of Zen
art is the quality

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:31.780 align:middle line:84%
of the paper or silk upon which
the painting or writing is

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:33.810 align:middle line:90%
done.

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:35.840 align:middle line:90%
This is absorbent paper.

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:41.810 align:middle line:84%
And therefore you notice that
if I don't draw a line smoothly,

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:47.150 align:middle line:84%
that I hesitate,
in a little while,

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:53.320 align:middle line:84%
you will see that becomes an
area where too much ink has run

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:56.616 align:middle line:84%
onto the paper, and
you get a bulge.

00:18:56.616 --> 00:18:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, unless
you intentionally

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.530 align:middle line:84%
want a bulge at a
particular point,

00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:05.590 align:middle line:84%
your motion writing with the
brush must be entirely smooth.

00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:08.640 align:middle line:90%


00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.635 align:middle line:90%
There I want it to bulge.

00:19:10.635 --> 00:19:15.690 align:middle line:90%


00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:17.530 align:middle line:84%
And in this sense,
that is a kind

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:23.050 align:middle line:84%
of parallel between
painting and life.

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:27.380 align:middle line:84%
You know as Omar Khayyam says,
"The moving finger writes,

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:31.120 align:middle line:90%
and having writ, moves on.

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:34.690 align:middle line:84%
Not all thy piety nor
wit can lure it back

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:38.860 align:middle line:84%
to cancel half a line,
nor all thy tears

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:41.740 align:middle line:90%
wash out a word of it."

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:45.090 align:middle line:84%
And so in the same
way, the painter

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:49.980 align:middle line:84%
or the writer in this medium
has to move without hesitation.

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:55.350 align:middle line:84%
As our own proverb says,
he who hesitates is lost.

00:19:55.350 --> 00:20:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And thus it involves
particularly the quality

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:04.160 align:middle line:84%
of what is called in
Zen [FOREIGN LANGUAGE],

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:07.860 align:middle line:84%
going straight
aheadness without doubt.

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And this quality, when it is
ingrained in our character

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:17.640 align:middle line:84%
through learning to trust
our own spontaneity,

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:21.390 align:middle line:84%
becomes the greatest
instrument of the artist.

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And the man, in other words,
who has that character,

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:28.710 align:middle line:84%
can, however he goes at
this, hardly make a mistake.

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:31.930 align:middle line:84%
His character is revealed
and everything he does.

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And as his action is
completely unobstructed,

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:40.840 align:middle line:84%
so there is a kind of flowing
vitality in all of his work.

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:48.340 align:middle line:84%
So in the sense the man who is,
as it were, dead to himself,

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:50.950 align:middle line:84%
there is a Zen poem which
says, "While living,

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:53.540 align:middle line:90%
be a dead man, thoroughly dead.

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And then whatever you do, just
as you will, will be right."

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:01.820 align:middle line:84%
So a man who has this
becomes a superb artist.

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:05.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the most interesting
characteristics of Zen art

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:09.150 align:middle line:90%
is its kind of playfulness.

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:14.321 align:middle line:84%
Because you see, a person
who has died to himself

00:21:14.321 --> 00:21:16.070 align:middle line:84%
doesn't take himself
seriously any longer.

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:18.800 align:middle line:90%


00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:27.950 align:middle line:84%
He has a sense of life, as
we say in our own slang,

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:31.710 align:middle line:90%
not being any longer a drag.

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:34.160 align:middle line:84%
He's not in conflict
with himself.

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:37.550 align:middle line:84%
He has already, as it were,
given himself up to death.

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And so here is his
spirit in a painting

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:44.330 align:middle line:84%
by Sengai, a great Zen
master of the 17th century,

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:47.190 align:middle line:90%
which shows Hotei.

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:50.640 align:middle line:84%
You often see him as the
so-called Fat Buddha.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:55.730 align:middle line:84%
You can buy figures of him
in any Chinese artwork store.

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:59.480 align:middle line:90%
Hotei-- he is a kind of a tramp.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And here he's waking
up from his sleep.

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And the poem written
above him on the painting

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:11.360 align:middle line:90%
says, "Buddha is already dead.

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.520 align:middle line:84%
Maitreya-- who is supposed
to be the next Buddha

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:17.990 align:middle line:84%
to come in many years--
Maitreya has not yet come.

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:21.410 align:middle line:84%
I have had a wonderful
sleep and didn't even dream

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:25.740 align:middle line:90%
about Confucious."

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:29.456 align:middle line:84%
It seems, you see a kind
of irreligious attitude.

00:22:29.456 --> 00:22:34.110 align:middle line:84%
For just as the art
of Zen artless art,

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:38.790 align:middle line:84%
so the religion of Zen is
religion without religiosity.

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:43.160 align:middle line:90%


00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:50.670 align:middle line:84%
The masters are never drawn in
a kind of pompous, sacred style,

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:53.870 align:middle line:84%
but always looking more
like hobos and bums.

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:57.790 align:middle line:84%
This painting is a
Chinese painting entitled

00:22:57.790 --> 00:22:59.399 align:middle line:84%
"Zen Master in
Meditation," but he

00:22:59.399 --> 00:23:00.690 align:middle line:90%
looks more as if he was asleep.

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:03.710 align:middle line:90%


00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And this I would call,
this drawing of the saint

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:13.380 align:middle line:84%
meditating as if he
were asleep, a kind

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:16.840 align:middle line:84%
of religion of no
religion, which

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:20.180 align:middle line:90%
doesn't take itself seriously.

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:25.020 align:middle line:84%
There was once a Zen student
who asked his teacher how

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:28.002 align:middle line:84%
he was getting along
in his study of Zen.

00:23:28.002 --> 00:23:29.460 align:middle line:84%
The teacher said,
you're all right,

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:31.490 align:middle line:90%
but you've got a trivial fault.

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:33.050 align:middle line:90%
And what's that?

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:36.500 align:middle line:84%
You've all together too
much Zen, he replied.

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:38.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, he said, if
you're studying Zen,

00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:41.450 align:middle line:84%
isn't it very natural
to talk about it?

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:44.540 align:middle line:84%
Oh, he said, when it's like
an everyday conversation,

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:47.400 align:middle line:90%
it's somewhat better.

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And here you see in
another painting by Sengai,

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:57.100 align:middle line:84%
it's an everyday
matter, just blossoms.

00:23:57.100 --> 00:24:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And yet this is Zen,
all these marvelous

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:09.050 align:middle line:84%
persimmons by the great
Chinese Zen monk Mu Chi.

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:13.340 align:middle line:84%
Just persimmons, sitting
there, in a spirit of what

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:17.470 align:middle line:90%
is called in Japanese sonomama.

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:21.620 align:middle line:90%
Sonomama means just like that.

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:24.290 align:middle line:84%
I can perhaps illustrate
the spirit of sonomama

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:30.430 align:middle line:84%
by a haiku poems, which says,
"Weeds in the rice field.

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:31.790 align:middle line:90%
Cut them down.

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And sonomama--" just as
they are-- "fertilizer."

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:50.220 align:middle line:84%
Or again, Sengai showing the
two Buddhist hermits, Hanshan

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:56.540 align:middle line:84%
and Shide, looking
like a pair of idiots.

00:24:56.540 --> 00:25:00.660 align:middle line:84%
Because again, just as Zen
represents its religion

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:05.380 align:middle line:84%
in the secular, its holiness
in a kind of fat tramp,

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:08.530 align:middle line:84%
looking as if he
was fast asleep,

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:15.830 align:middle line:84%
and its wisdom as the
behavior of a lunatic.

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:17.795 align:middle line:84%
You see, it doesn't
take itself seriously.

00:25:17.795 --> 00:25:22.400 align:middle line:90%


00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:27.650 align:middle line:84%
Here is a Zen painter of modern
times, Saburo Hasegawa, a self

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:29.280 align:middle line:90%
portrait.

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And the writing thing underneath
is a quotation from Lao Tzu.

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:35.020 align:middle line:84%
"The people of the
world seem so satisfied,

00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:37.450 align:middle line:84%
as if partaking of
a formal dinner,

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:40.110 align:middle line:84%
as if climbing a
terrace in spring time.

00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:44.820 align:middle line:84%
I alone am mild, like
one with nothing to do,

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:48.680 align:middle line:84%
like a baby that cannot
get smile, unattached,

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:51.050 align:middle line:90%
as if without a home.

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:53.560 align:middle line:84%
The people of the world
seem to have everything.

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.470 align:middle line:84%
But I seem to have
lost everything, minus

00:25:56.470 --> 00:26:01.260 align:middle line:90%
the heart of a fool."

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And here again is another
piece by Hasegawa.

00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:06.700 align:middle line:90%


00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:10.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a print from
an old boat that

00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:12.510 align:middle line:90%
was washed up on the beach.

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And the character written
over it is "time."

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And here again, you see, in
this marvelous arrangement

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:27.180 align:middle line:84%
of the natural grain and wood,
we have the artist expressing

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:31.690 align:middle line:84%
once again that character I
showed you in the last talk,

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:37.245 align:middle line:84%
[? "li," ?] which means the
infinitely complex patterning

00:26:37.245 --> 00:26:38.020 align:middle line:90%
of nature.

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:43.290 align:middle line:90%


00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:51.610 align:middle line:90%
And so it is playing on.

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:53.602 align:middle line:84%
And you may ask,
what does it mean?

00:26:53.602 --> 00:26:55.410 align:middle line:90%
What do the stars mean?

00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:58.822 align:middle line:90%


00:26:58.822 --> 00:26:59.780 align:middle line:90%
What does the wind say?

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:03.030 align:middle line:90%


00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:04.310 align:middle line:90%
Where are the clouds going?

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:12.310 align:middle line:90%


00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:17.060 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:17.060 --> 00:29:04.100 align:middle line:90%
