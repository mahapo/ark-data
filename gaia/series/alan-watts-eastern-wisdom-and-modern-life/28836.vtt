00:00:12.584 --> 00:00:21.940 align:middle line:84%
>>"Eastern Wisdom and Modern
Life," with Alan W. Watts,

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:28.920 align:middle line:84%
produced by KQED, San Francisco,
for the Educational Television

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:29.945 align:middle line:90%
and Radio Center.

00:00:29.945 --> 00:00:38.380 align:middle line:90%


00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.940 align:middle line:84%
Alan Watts is a
scholar, lecturer,

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.706 align:middle line:84%
and the author of
many widely read books

00:00:43.706 --> 00:00:46.640 align:middle line:84%
on comparative
philosophy and religion.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:57.140 align:middle line:90%


00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.580 align:middle line:84%
>>We were talking
last time about

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.319 align:middle line:84%
the extraordinary conflict
between man and nature

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:09.340 align:middle line:84%
which exists among almost
all highly civilized peoples.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And especially here
in the Western world,

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.996 align:middle line:84%
where we talk so much about
our conquest of nature,

00:01:16.996 --> 00:01:20.580 align:middle line:84%
our mastery of
space, our subjection

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.790 align:middle line:90%
of the physical world.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of
the main reasons why

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.020 align:middle line:84%
we feel in this
particular way is

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.830 align:middle line:84%
that each individual
experiences himself

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.940 align:middle line:90%
as a peculiarly separate being.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:39.920 align:middle line:84%
In other words, every
man thinks of this world

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.720 align:middle line:90%
as a collection of objects.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.180 align:middle line:90%
The world is a lot of things.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.735 align:middle line:84%
And each person considers
himself as a thing.

00:01:50.735 --> 00:01:52.860 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder if you've ever
stopped to ask yourself

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.430 align:middle line:84%
what a thing is and why
you think you are a thing?

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.150 align:middle line:84%
Are you quite sure
that you are a thing?

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.000 align:middle line:90%


00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.770 align:middle line:84%
Because if we take
a look at ourselves

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.350 align:middle line:84%
from another point of view,
for example like this,

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.470 align:middle line:84%
we shall find that we
are not one thing at all.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.110 align:middle line:84%
We're an extraordinary
number of things.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.660 align:middle line:84%
For what you're looking at
there is the cell structure

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.850 align:middle line:84%
of your own body,
a whole multitude

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.510 align:middle line:84%
of tiny, tiny
little individuals.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.110 align:middle line:90%


00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And now we might ask again,
what other points of view

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.640 align:middle line:90%
could we take to ourselves?

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.670 align:middle line:84%
We could of course take
the sociologist's point

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.850 align:middle line:84%
of view, where we're are
not really a thing at all,

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.070 align:middle line:90%
but a sub-member of a group.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.780 align:middle line:84%
Or, still more, if
a man visiting us

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.420 align:middle line:84%
from another planet in
something like a flying saucer

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.260 align:middle line:84%
were to hover down and look
at what sort of creature

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.140 align:middle line:84%
is inhabiting this
Earth, what would he see?

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.290 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look and get
some idea of his view.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.990 align:middle line:84%
This is the kind of
creature he would

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.670 align:middle line:90%
find inhabiting this planet.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.220 align:middle line:84%
A sprawly, knobbly
thing, with various lines

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.290 align:middle line:90%
connecting bits of it.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.580 align:middle line:84%
That would be, in his view,
the kind of thing that we are.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.810 align:middle line:84%
For you see, how
many things we are

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.110 align:middle line:84%
depends upon the point
of view which one takes.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.210 align:middle line:90%


00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.860 align:middle line:84%
Every point of view
that we've taken,

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.092 align:middle line:84%
the point of view of the
cells, the point of view

00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:39.050 align:middle line:84%
of the man hovering about
the Earth in a flying

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.220 align:middle line:84%
saucer or an airplane is
a correct point of view.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And according to the
way in which we look,

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.690 align:middle line:84%
so we divide the
things of the world.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.760 align:middle line:84%
For you see, it's
interesting, isn't it,

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.090 align:middle line:84%
that the word "thing" is
they like the word "think."

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.650 align:middle line:84%
Because by breaking down
our world into things

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.510 align:middle line:84%
is the way in which
we think about it.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:11.910 align:middle line:84%
We break down what we call the
material world into objects

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.560 align:middle line:84%
and assign to those
objects the kind of words

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.000 align:middle line:90%
we describe as nouns.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And then the world of
action, we break into events

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:25.990 align:middle line:84%
and assign to events the
kind of word we call verbs.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.590 align:middle line:84%
But things and events
are fundamentally

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.030 align:middle line:84%
the ways of breaking
up our complex world so

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.800 align:middle line:90%
that we can think about it.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.820 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if any of you have
ever been to a psychologist

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.150 align:middle line:84%
and taken a Rorschach
test and been

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.420 align:middle line:84%
asked to look at one of
these extraordinary blots?

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, actually the blot
that we're looking at here

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.660 align:middle line:84%
isn't a real Rorschach
blot because you're not

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.910 align:middle line:84%
allowed to show them in
public in case people saw them

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:57.720 align:middle line:90%
before the test.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.210 align:middle line:90%
But they're something like this.

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.047 align:middle line:84%
And they're made by
splodging ink on paper

00:05:02.047 --> 00:05:03.630 align:middle line:84%
and folding the paper
over so that you

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:04.800 align:middle line:90%
get a symmetrical block.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.350 align:middle line:84%
And the psychologist
says to you,

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:07.876 align:middle line:84%
when you look at
that, now, please

00:05:07.876 --> 00:05:09.370 align:middle line:84%
will you tell me
a story about it?

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.997 align:middle line:90%
What do you think it looks like?

00:05:10.997 --> 00:05:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And you might say, well, I think
it looks like a great big cat

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.100 align:middle line:84%
face, or maybe it's
a woman's handbag,

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.180 align:middle line:84%
or maybe it's a
dancer, waving his arms

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.370 align:middle line:84%
in front of a pair of pine
trees, with some rocks around.

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.380 align:middle line:84%
All sorts of stories you
could invent about it,

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.980 align:middle line:90%
anything you like.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.545 align:middle line:84%
And the psychologist will
use the kind of information

00:05:29.545 --> 00:05:31.480 align:middle line:84%
that you've given him,
the sort of things

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.480 align:middle line:84%
that you project out of
your own mind into that blot

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.955 align:middle line:84%
and he will then form some
diagnosis of the kind of person

00:05:40.955 --> 00:05:43.630 align:middle line:90%
you are.

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.460 align:middle line:84%
But you see, he's not
interested in the information

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.130 align:middle line:84%
which you give
him about the blot

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.250 align:middle line:90%
as a description of the blot.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.120 align:middle line:84%
He's interested in what you
say as a description of what

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.910 align:middle line:90%
is going on inside you.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.560 align:middle line:84%
In other words, what
you are saying about

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.650 align:middle line:84%
that blot is a
projection of yourself

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:07.020 align:middle line:84%
into its strange and
complicated conformations.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, you see, our whole
world is in many ways

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.310 align:middle line:84%
not so very much unlike
this peculiar blot.

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And you might think that there
might be some persuasive person

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:23.260 align:middle line:84%
who stands up and gives a story
about the blot of the world

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.510 align:middle line:84%
and other people agree
with what he said.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.470 align:middle line:84%
He says, look here,
that's a mountain.

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:29.600 align:middle line:90%
That's a tree.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.295 align:middle line:90%
That's a rock.

00:06:31.295 --> 00:06:33.795 align:middle line:84%
And everybody else would agree
because he was so persuasive.

00:06:33.795 --> 00:06:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And we would all be beginning
to give the same story

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.960 align:middle line:90%
about the cosmic Rorschach blot.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:46.370 align:middle line:84%
Because after all, our world
is a very wiggly affair.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:57.600 align:middle line:84%
Consider, for example,
clouds, or clouds

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:10.470 align:middle line:84%
with mountains across
them, or waters, or stars.

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:13.790 align:middle line:90%


00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:20.990 align:middle line:84%
All the world is
a wiggly affair,

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:24.350 align:middle line:84%
not at all unlike that
blot we were looking at.

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And we have to find out
ways of making sense of it.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:34.340 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps, one of the
strangest and most

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.020 align:middle line:84%
difficult to understand
things that men first

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:40.500 align:middle line:84%
began to make sense of in
this kind of Rorschach blot

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.304 align:middle line:84%
interpretation way, were
the stars in heaven.

00:07:44.304 --> 00:07:47.056 align:middle line:90%


00:07:47.056 --> 00:07:48.430 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
ways in which they

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:55.160 align:middle line:84%
did this what was to
project upon the skies

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.730 align:middle line:84%
figures of all kinds of
mythological monsters

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:06.185 align:middle line:84%
and beasts, such as the idea
of a dipper for the Great Bear,

00:08:06.185 --> 00:08:09.300 align:middle line:84%
for those stars in the Great
Bear that look like a ladle,

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.326 align:middle line:84%
or some people
call them the Plow.

00:08:12.326 --> 00:08:15.990 align:middle line:84%
Or here, perhaps on a
celestial sphere of this kind,

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:19.570 align:middle line:84%
you can see quite clearly the
outline of the constellation

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:22.880 align:middle line:84%
Leo, the Lion, a lion
drawn in the sky.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:28.400 align:middle line:84%
So that men could find their
way about in the stars,

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.840 align:middle line:84%
recognize their
outlines by associating

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:34.409 align:middle line:84%
certain groups of stars
with familiar images.

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:36.110 align:middle line:84%
But you see, this
is fundamentally

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:40.669 align:middle line:84%
a projection of ideas out of
our own minds onto nature.

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:45.230 align:middle line:84%
Nature itself we take all
kinds of different projections.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And no one is necessarily
the right one.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.810 align:middle line:84%
They work for us so long
as we agree about them.

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:56.350 align:middle line:84%
That is, so long as we
abide by convention.

00:08:56.350 --> 00:09:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And in Indian philosophy,
the fundamental word

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:09.370 align:middle line:84%
for this kind of thing is
the Sanskrit term "Maya."

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:23.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to write that down
for you, pronounced Maya.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.290 align:middle line:90%


00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And this word comes from a root
in the Sanskrit language, ma.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:41.130 align:middle line:90%


00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:44.830 align:middle line:84%
And the word "ma" is at the
basis of all kinds of words

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:48.430 align:middle line:90%
that we use in our own tongue.

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:55.150 align:middle line:84%
It's at the basis of matter,
of the Latin mater or mother,

00:09:55.150 --> 00:10:00.620 align:middle line:84%
at the basis of matrix or metric
because the fundamental meaning

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:05.250 align:middle line:90%
of the roof ma is to measure.

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And so it works in
this sort of way.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.160 align:middle line:84%
I was talking about
our world being

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.320 align:middle line:90%
wiggly, something like this.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:21.220 align:middle line:90%


00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:22.990 align:middle line:84%
That is the typical
sort of shape

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:25.960 align:middle line:84%
that we're having to
deal with all the time.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think you'll see at
once that a shape like that

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.870 align:middle line:84%
is extraordinarily
difficult to talk about.

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:33.610 align:middle line:84%
If I were talking on the
radio at the moment and not

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:36.680 align:middle line:84%
on television, I would have
the greatest difficulty

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.890 align:middle line:84%
in describing that line
for you in such a way

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:42.640 align:middle line:84%
that you could write it
down on a piece of paper

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.130 align:middle line:84%
in front of you
without seeing it.

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:45.430 align:middle line:90%
But here you can see it.

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And you can
understand it at once.

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:52.510 align:middle line:84%
But it isn't enough just
to be able to see things.

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:54.620 align:middle line:84%
We want to be able
to talk about them.

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.360 align:middle line:84%
We want to be able
to describe them

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.847 align:middle line:84%
exactly so that we can control
them and deal with them.

00:10:59.847 --> 00:11:02.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean supposing this were the
outline of a piece of territory

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:03.520 align:middle line:90%
on a map.

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.410 align:middle line:84%
Then you might want
to tell someone

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:08.439 align:middle line:84%
an exact spot to
which he should go.

00:11:08.439 --> 00:11:10.730 align:middle line:84%
And then you would have to
be far more precise about it

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:14.060 align:middle line:84%
than you can be when you just
get the general idea of it

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:16.090 align:middle line:90%
by looking at it.

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And so we introduce
then the idea

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:21.809 align:middle line:84%
of Maya by essentially
doing this.

00:11:21.809 --> 00:11:25.481 align:middle line:90%


00:11:25.481 --> 00:11:34.630 align:middle line:84%
This might be called a
matrix, lines crossed by lines

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:38.050 align:middle line:84%
in a very formal,
simple pattern.

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And the moment we
do that, it becomes

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:44.620 align:middle line:84%
very easy indeed to talk about
this wiggly line because we

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.810 align:middle line:84%
could, for example,
number all these

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:51.280 align:middle line:84%
squares across, 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and so on.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.430 align:middle line:84%
We can also number
them downwards.

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And then in terms of numbers
across and numbers down,

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:06.110 align:middle line:84%
we can indicate the
exact points on this grid

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:09.770 align:middle line:90%
which cross the wiggly line.

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And by numbering those
points one after another,

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:16.970 align:middle line:84%
we can give an accurate
description of the way

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:19.090 align:middle line:90%
that line moves.

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And furthermore, supposing
the line under our grid

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.390 align:middle line:90%
were not still like this one.

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:25.960 align:middle line:84%
But supposing it was
wiggling, in motion,

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.890 align:middle line:84%
supposing it was a flea or
something dipped in ink, who

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:30.760 align:middle line:84%
was crawling across
the paper and we

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.320 align:middle line:84%
wanted to know where
he was going to go?

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:37.140 align:middle line:84%
All we would have to
do would be to plot out

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:39.650 align:middle line:84%
the positions which
he has covered.

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And then we could calculate
statistically a trend,

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:47.287 align:middle line:84%
which would indicate where he
would be likely to go next.

00:12:47.287 --> 00:12:49.370 align:middle line:84%
And if he went there next,
we should say, by Jove,

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:50.870 align:middle line:90%
isn't that incredible?

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:53.610 align:middle line:84%
This little flea
crawling across the paper

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:57.500 align:middle line:84%
is obeying the
laws of statistics.

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, as a matter
of fact, he isn't.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:05.310 align:middle line:84%
What he is doing is--
or rather I should

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:09.410 align:middle line:84%
say, not what he is doing,
but what we are doing,

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:12.840 align:middle line:84%
is we are making a very,
very abstract model

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.410 align:middle line:84%
of the way in which
that line is shaped

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:20.310 align:middle line:84%
or in which that
flea is crawling.

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:22.750 align:middle line:84%
We are breaking it
up into little bits.

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:25.980 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, in fact, it is
not a lot of little bits.

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:28.540 align:middle line:90%
It is a continuous sweep.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:32.130 align:middle line:84%
But by treating it in this
way as if it were broken up

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:33.980 align:middle line:90%
into bits, we are measuring it.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:37.090 align:middle line:90%
We are making a Maya.

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And these crossed lines are
a Maya, just in the same way

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:44.470 align:middle line:84%
as the idea of the lion, the
Leo constellation in the stars

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:47.840 align:middle line:90%
is a Maya, a way of projecting.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.620 align:middle line:84%
You see this thing, it
comes out of our minds.

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And we project it
upon nature like this.

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And break nature
into bits so that it

00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:59.966 align:middle line:84%
can be easily talked
about and handled.

00:13:59.966 --> 00:14:03.830 align:middle line:90%


00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:06.630 align:middle line:84%
But you see, this
tends to give us

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:12.420 align:middle line:84%
the impression that our
world is a lot of bits

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:15.950 align:middle line:84%
and that things are really
separate from each other.

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:21.800 align:middle line:84%
You see, how could I
demonstrate how this is?

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:22.550 align:middle line:90%
I have an idea.

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:26.790 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Cameraman, will
you focus the camera

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:31.270 align:middle line:84%
on one small, tiny
spot in the set?

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And come very close to it
and travel along bit by bit

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:37.458 align:middle line:90%
by bit by bit.

00:14:37.458 --> 00:14:40.780 align:middle line:90%


00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:44.840 align:middle line:84%
Now you see, this is looking
at the world little bit

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.350 align:middle line:84%
by little bit, as
if we were only

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:51.480 align:middle line:84%
using the central vision of
our eyes, the kind of vision

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:55.390 align:middle line:84%
we use for reading and
close work of that kind.

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:59.240 align:middle line:84%
But if this were the only way
we had of looking at things,

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:02.980 align:middle line:84%
it would be very difficult to
make any sense of life at all

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:05.820 align:middle line:84%
because we would see everything
in series, bit after bit,

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:07.870 align:middle line:90%
after bit.

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:12.310 align:middle line:84%
But, fortunately, we are also
able to enlarge the whole view

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:15.550 align:middle line:84%
and take in everything at
once in a single sweep.

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:18.150 align:middle line:90%


00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And you see, this shows
all the advantages

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:25.490 align:middle line:84%
and the disadvantages
of looking at things

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:28.500 align:middle line:84%
in the way that Indian
philosophy calls Maya.

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:31.030 align:middle line:90%


00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Because if Maya were
the only way we had

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:36.310 align:middle line:84%
for looking at
things, we should only

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:40.480 align:middle line:84%
be able to understand
one thing at a time.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And our world is
not just one thing

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:44.970 align:middle line:84%
happening one after
another, one at a time.

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:49.100 align:middle line:84%
Our world is an enormous
volume, a great vastness

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:52.580 align:middle line:84%
in which everything is
happening all together, at once.

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:55.250 align:middle line:90%


00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:58.600 align:middle line:84%
Now being able to think
of things one at a time

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:02.260 align:middle line:84%
is extraordinarily
useful because this

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.130 align:middle line:84%
is what enables us
to have science,

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.620 align:middle line:84%
to have scientific
control of nature,

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:10.700 align:middle line:84%
to be able to count things,
measure them, manage

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:15.350 align:middle line:84%
them, and predict their
behavior in the future.

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:18.460 align:middle line:84%
But it is inclined
to run away with us

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:24.830 align:middle line:84%
and give us the impression if
we think too hard about things

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:28.960 align:middle line:84%
or if we put too much faith
in thinking, that the world is

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.120 align:middle line:84%
made up of a lot
of separate bits

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.800 align:middle line:84%
so that we have a kind of bit
by bit approach to nature, what

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:38.460 align:middle line:84%
I might call a putt, putt,
putt, putt view of life.

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:42.135 align:middle line:84%
It's useful indeed to break
things down into things

00:16:42.135 --> 00:16:44.200 align:middle line:90%
and to classify them.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.670 align:middle line:84%
But the moment it
gives us the impression

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:49.680 align:middle line:84%
that these little bits into
which we have divided the world

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.900 align:middle line:84%
are really and in nature
separate from each other,

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:54.744 align:middle line:90%
we get into confusion.

00:16:54.744 --> 00:17:01.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, how do we know that divided
things aren't really separate?

00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:03.542 align:middle line:90%
Look, for example, at me.

00:17:03.542 --> 00:17:04.940 align:middle line:90%
How do you know I'm here?

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:07.829 align:middle line:84%
How can you make out
the outlines of my body?

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:13.010 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it because there is a
contrast between the background

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:16.569 align:middle line:90%
behind me and my figure?

00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:19.264 align:middle line:84%
You know where the
background ends and I begin

00:17:19.264 --> 00:17:21.117 align:middle line:90%
and so you are able to see me.

00:17:21.117 --> 00:17:23.200 align:middle line:84%
But now what would happen
if the background should

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.950 align:middle line:90%
vanish and disappear?

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:30.130 align:middle line:90%
And I would no longer be there.

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:34.000 align:middle line:84%
But the figure in the ground
instead would be my button.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.400 align:middle line:84%
In order to see me, you have to
see a background along with me.

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And so if we go back and look
again at the whole thing,

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:50.610 align:middle line:90%
then we can see once again.

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:53.450 align:middle line:90%
Now, what does that tell us?

00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:58.180 align:middle line:84%
Surely the thing that it
tells us is not merely

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:07.200 align:middle line:84%
that the background is one
thing and the figure is another.

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.870 align:middle line:84%
Since the two must
go together, it

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:13.690 align:middle line:84%
indicates that there is a
connection between them.

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:16.980 align:middle line:90%


00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:20.490 align:middle line:84%
If you can't have the
perception of a figure without

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:25.300 align:middle line:84%
a background, if you simply
cannot see it if there is no

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:29.570 align:middle line:84%
background there, doesn't
mean that the background

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:31.990 align:middle line:84%
and the figure are in
some way inseparable?

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:33.130 align:middle line:90%
They're different, yes.

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:36.060 align:middle line:84%
But they're inseparable
differences.

00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:38.210 align:middle line:90%
Take, for example, a coin.

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:45.400 align:middle line:84%
When you have a coin, it has
two sides, heads and tails.

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And these two sides
are indeed different.

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:51.150 align:middle line:84%
You might say they
are separate sides.

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:54.820 align:middle line:84%
But what would happen if we take
a file and start rubbing away

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:57.014 align:middle line:90%
to get rid of one of the sides?

00:18:57.014 --> 00:18:58.555 align:middle line:84%
Well, we would rub,
and rub, and rub.

00:18:58.555 --> 00:19:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And when we finally
got rid of the side,

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:02.920 align:middle line:84%
the other side would
have vanished too

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:06.480 align:middle line:84%
because the two sides
of a coin go together.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.521 align:middle line:90%
Yes, they are different.

00:19:07.521 --> 00:19:08.770 align:middle line:90%
But they are also inseparable.

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:11.370 align:middle line:90%


00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:15.910 align:middle line:84%
And this is true of almost
every thing in the world

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:21.460 align:middle line:84%
because we distinguish
things from their background.

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:23.550 align:middle line:84%
We distinguish one
side from another,

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:25.307 align:middle line:90%
as we distinguish up from down.

00:19:25.307 --> 00:19:27.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, imagine what would happen
if we arranged everything

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:29.890 align:middle line:84%
in this set, or tried
to arrange everything,

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:31.240 align:middle line:90%
so that nothing were down.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.510 align:middle line:90%
Everything had to be up.

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:36.366 align:middle line:84%
If we could really, in
nature, separate the up

00:19:36.366 --> 00:19:40.350 align:middle line:84%
from the down, why
we couldn't do it.

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:43.290 align:middle line:90%
Because up goes with down.

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:46.520 align:middle line:84%
Is unintelligible apart
from down in the same way

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.990 align:middle line:84%
that the head side of
a coin goes together

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:52.630 align:middle line:90%
with the tail side.

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And so in this way,
we as individuals,

00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:01.350 align:middle line:84%
as separate beings,
are really inseparable

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:05.610 align:middle line:84%
from the whole natural
environment in which we live.

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:08.170 align:middle line:90%
We go together.

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And you cannot have the
one without the other.

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:14.170 align:middle line:84%
Without what we call things,
there would be no world.

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:16.800 align:middle line:84%
But without what we would
call the whole world,

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.790 align:middle line:90%
there would be no things.

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And this is not
only true of what

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:26.330 align:middle line:84%
we call things and
objects, it's also

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:28.590 align:middle line:90%
true of many of our experiences.

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:30.930 align:middle line:84%
Let's take, for example,
one of the most fundamental

00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:35.900 align:middle line:84%
distinctions in experience, what
is pleasant and what is not.

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:39.440 align:middle line:84%
Now a great many people are
bending the whole effort

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:47.810 align:middle line:84%
of their lives to have
pleasure and get rid of pain.

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:51.130 align:middle line:84%
This pursuit of
pleasure is regarded

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:57.430 align:middle line:84%
as the fundamental aim
of human existence.

00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And you know when
you start to read

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:03.562 align:middle line:84%
old books on Indian
philosophy, Chinese philosophy,

00:21:03.562 --> 00:21:05.980 align:middle line:84%
they very often say that
the first thing a man must

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:11.960 align:middle line:84%
understand is to give up
the pursuit of pleasure.

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And people who read these things
think that these are likely

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:20.785 align:middle line:84%
Puritans, people who have
a sour attitude to life,

00:21:20.785 --> 00:21:23.590 align:middle line:84%
who burnt their fingers in the
game of the pursuit of pleasure

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:27.480 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, let's not get
mixed up with that any more.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:33.065 align:middle line:84%
But as a matter of fact, this
is just a plain, clear, sensible

00:21:33.065 --> 00:21:34.970 align:middle line:90%
statement.

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:41.120 align:middle line:84%
It's like saying you cannot
have up without down.

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:44.830 align:middle line:84%
You cannot have a figure
without a background.

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:49.690 align:middle line:84%
And in the same way exactly,
you cannot experience pleasure

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:54.060 align:middle line:84%
unless there is something with
which you can contrast it.

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:56.495 align:middle line:84%
You know what happens
when a person who

00:21:56.495 --> 00:21:59.560 align:middle line:84%
has longed to make a great
deal of money all his life

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:00.500 align:middle line:90%
and he makes it.

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.345 align:middle line:84%
Finally, he gets
a million dollars.

00:22:02.345 --> 00:22:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And he thinks this
is the answer.

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:06.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's fine, just in
the moment of transition,

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:10.800 align:middle line:84%
while he is going from
poverty to richness.

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:14.020 align:middle line:84%
But when he's had his million
dollars for a few months,

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:16.930 align:middle line:90%
everything adjusts itself.

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And he begins to feel just the
same as he always felt before.

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:23.540 align:middle line:84%
Conversely, if some of you
have lived near a tannery

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:31.020 align:middle line:84%
or near a public utility place
like a gas producing factory,

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:33.324 align:middle line:84%
you get so used to the bad
smell in the background

00:22:33.324 --> 00:22:34.490 align:middle line:90%
that you cease to notice it.

00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:36.230 align:middle line:90%
It becomes the normal smell.

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And so you don't notice
it anymore as a bad smell.

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:44.330 align:middle line:84%
But both the bad and the good
need each other as contrasts.

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, when we try
to get rid of one of the pair

00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:04.070 align:middle line:84%
and possess the
other only, we do

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:07.090 align:middle line:84%
something that is
profoundly nonsensical.

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:10.290 align:middle line:84%
We think we can do
it because in Maya,

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:14.420 align:middle line:84%
that is to say in
conventional thinking,

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:17.020 align:middle line:84%
in terms of that
kind of measurement

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:19.866 align:middle line:84%
that we call thought,
we can separate the one

00:23:19.866 --> 00:23:20.490 align:middle line:90%
from the other.

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:23.890 align:middle line:84%
We can talk about up
as different from now.

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:27.910 align:middle line:84%
We can talk about one thing as
different from other things.

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:30.810 align:middle line:84%
But in actual experience,
it can't be done.

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:33.730 align:middle line:84%
Just as in actual
experience, that wiggly line

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:39.030 align:middle line:84%
was a continuous line and
not a series of points.

00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And in another way
too, we can't really

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:51.330 align:middle line:84%
pursue pleasure
because pleasure is

00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:53.980 align:middle line:84%
something that
has to come to us.

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:59.890 align:middle line:84%
For example, you
can pursue a cow.

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And you can go out and catch
it, and kill it, and serve it up

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:04.760 align:middle line:90%
as steak.

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:07.500 align:middle line:90%
That you could do.

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:09.980 align:middle line:84%
But you can't
pursue the pleasure

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:13.071 align:middle line:90%
that you get from eating steak.

00:24:13.071 --> 00:24:15.859 align:middle line:84%
If, in other words, you
try to get pleasure out

00:24:15.859 --> 00:24:17.400 align:middle line:84%
of steak-- supposing
I sit here and I

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.510 align:middle line:84%
have a great, big splendid
steak served to me.

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And I say this is the
best steak I ever ate.

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:21.810 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:22.685 align:middle line:90%
It's a chateaubriand.

00:24:22.685 --> 00:24:24.427 align:middle line:90%
And it costs $12 a plate.

00:24:24.427 --> 00:24:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, I must make
the very maximum effort

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:27.300 align:middle line:90%
to enjoy it.

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:28.370 align:middle line:90%
And I cut the thing up.

00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:30.130 align:middle line:84%
And I put it into
my mouth and say,

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:32.870 align:middle line:84%
now, I really got
to get the most out

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:34.320 align:middle line:90%
of this piece of steak.

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:35.975 align:middle line:84%
And so I chew it
with all my might

00:24:35.975 --> 00:24:37.390 align:middle line:90%
to get the very best out of it.

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:38.900 align:middle line:90%
And what happens?

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:41.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm making so much
muscular strain,

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying so hard to
get something out it,

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:50.520 align:middle line:84%
that I frustrate the very
pleasure that it should give.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.320 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:58.610 align:middle line:84%
Surely it is because pleasure
is a function of nerves.

00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And you can't make an
effort with your nerves.

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:03.765 align:middle line:84%
Catching a cow is a
function of muscles.

00:25:03.765 --> 00:25:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And you can make an
effort with your muscles.

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:08.260 align:middle line:90%


00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:10.260 align:middle line:84%
Think of another illustration
of the same thing.

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:13.490 align:middle line:84%
Supposing I want to see an
object in the far distance.

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:16.420 align:middle line:84%
I want to make out the
time on a distant clock.

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:19.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, my eyes are nervous
rather than muscular.

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And if I strain
my eyes very hard

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:25.020 align:middle line:84%
to make out what is way off on
the clock in the distance, what

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:25.780 align:middle line:90%
happens?

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:30.370 align:middle line:84%
All the images of the figures
on the clock go fuzzy.

00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:37.670 align:middle line:84%
But if I relax my eyes and let
the image come to it, as light

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:41.510 align:middle line:84%
does in fact come
to the eye, then I

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:42.826 align:middle line:90%
can see the image clearly.

00:25:42.826 --> 00:25:47.200 align:middle line:90%


00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:55.430 align:middle line:84%
So when we think of the
world as consisting primarily

00:25:55.430 --> 00:26:02.160 align:middle line:84%
of a lot of disconnected things
and ourselves as one of them,

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.570 align:middle line:84%
so that we go out
and get those things,

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:08.890 align:middle line:84%
or we can push those things
around to suit ourselves,

00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:13.940 align:middle line:84%
we forget so easily that
the entire system of nature,

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:17.200 align:middle line:84%
ourselves included,
is interconnected

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:20.509 align:middle line:90%
in every conceivable way.

00:26:20.509 --> 00:26:22.050 align:middle line:84%
You know what happens
when you think,

00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:23.640 align:middle line:84%
well, we've got a
lot of mosquitoes

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.175 align:middle line:84%
around here, all
kinds of insects

00:26:25.175 --> 00:26:26.600 align:middle line:90%
that bite us and bother us.

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:27.630 align:middle line:90%
Let's get rid of them.

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:30.410 align:middle line:84%
So we bring in the DDT and
we send an airplane over

00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:33.706 align:middle line:84%
and spray the whole
surrounding territory with DDT.

00:26:33.706 --> 00:26:36.090 align:middle line:90%
And what happens?

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:40.360 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly we find that other
insects or other pests which

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:43.870 align:middle line:84%
those insects we destroyed
were feeding upon,

00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:46.430 align:middle line:90%
multiply and increase.

00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:49.119 align:middle line:90%
And we have a new problem.

00:26:49.119 --> 00:26:50.285 align:middle line:90%
We have to get rid of those.

00:26:50.285 --> 00:26:52.479 align:middle line:84%
It's like when they brought
rabbits into Australia

00:26:52.479 --> 00:26:54.270 align:middle line:84%
because they thought
they'd be useful there

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:55.170 align:middle line:90%
for some reason or other.

00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:56.670 align:middle line:84%
The rabbits multiplied
because there

00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:58.110 align:middle line:90%
was nothing that fed on rabbits.

00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Then they had a
plague of rabbits.

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:04.610 align:middle line:84%
You see, you cannot
just push nature around.

00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:07.280 align:middle line:84%
You cannot regard it as
something to be attacked

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:11.730 align:middle line:84%
so that you could grab bits from
it and shove it around any old

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:14.850 align:middle line:84%
way, as if it were a machine
that you could bang around like

00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:15.910 align:middle line:90%
a mechanic.

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:18.878 align:middle line:84%
You need even machines, as
any good mechanic knows,

00:27:18.878 --> 00:27:23.940 align:middle line:84%
are not that simple
to play with.

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:27.910 align:middle line:84%
But if we do not see that
our view of the separateness

00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:31.910 align:middle line:84%
of the world is based on
a convention of thinking,

00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:34.770 align:middle line:90%
it exists, as it were, in here.

00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:40.070 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't exist out here
in actual, concrete reality.

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And if we are
confused, then we jump

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:49.000 align:middle line:84%
to follow our thoughts
instead of our senses.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.174 align:middle line:90%
And this is no sense.
