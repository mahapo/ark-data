00:00:11.924 --> 00:00:21.620 align:middle line:84%
>>Eastern wisdom and modern
life with Alan W Watts,

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:28.650 align:middle line:84%
produced by KQED San Francisco
for the Educational Television

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.660 align:middle line:90%
and Radio Center.

00:00:37.292 --> 00:00:40.620 align:middle line:84%
Alan Watts is a
scholar, lecturer,

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.430 align:middle line:84%
and the author of
many widely read books

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.840 align:middle line:84%
on comparative
philosophy and religion.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.019 align:middle line:84%
>>I suppose most
of you are familiar

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.970 align:middle line:90%
with this old optical illusion.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And you're asked
the question, which

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.380 align:middle line:84%
of the three thick black
lines is the longer?

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And I suppose one's
natural reaction

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.730 align:middle line:90%
is to say, the one on the left.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think you
know that this is

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.970 align:middle line:84%
a result of the
illusion of perspective,

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.170 align:middle line:84%
an illusion to
which we are so used

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.870 align:middle line:84%
and by which we are
so easily fooled,

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.300 align:middle line:84%
once we've accustomed
ourselves to it.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.570 align:middle line:84%
You might-- if that picture
were drawn more vividly-- even

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.480 align:middle line:84%
be predisposed to thinking that
was a real passage stretching

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.076 align:middle line:84%
away from you with
doors at the end.

00:01:46.076 --> 00:01:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And of course, if you came
up against that kind of thing

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.340 align:middle line:84%
painted against
the wall, you might

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.991 align:middle line:84%
make the mistake of walking
into it and banging your nose.

00:01:53.991 --> 00:01:57.220 align:middle line:90%


00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:04.270 align:middle line:84%
But this is an example of what
we were talking about last time

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.050 align:middle line:84%
as "maya," that word
from Indian philosophy

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.610 align:middle line:84%
which generally has the
meaning of "illusion,"

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.210 align:middle line:84%
or rather, illusions brought
about by the acceptance

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.166 align:middle line:84%
of certain conventions, of which
perspective was an example.

00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And when we are not aware
that certain things which

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.400 align:middle line:84%
we take for granted-- like
the separateness of things

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.280 align:middle line:84%
from each other-- is a
matter of convention,

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.390 align:middle line:90%
we are apt to be fooled.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think one of the
conventions by which we

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:50.310 align:middle line:84%
tend to be fooled more than
almost any other is time.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And for all human
beings, time as a matter

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.780 align:middle line:90%
of extraordinary importance.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps, this is one
of the principal ways

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.360 align:middle line:90%
in which we differ from animals.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.990 align:middle line:84%
Because man has been called
a time-binding animal.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.890 align:middle line:84%
That is to say, a creature who
is vividly aware of the fact

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:17.820 align:middle line:84%
that his life moves, as it were,
along a line from the past,

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.740 align:middle line:84%
through the present,
and into the future.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.800 align:middle line:84%
Animals, apparently, live
pretty much moment-by-moment.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.060 align:middle line:84%
They don't appear to have
very strong memories.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.705 align:middle line:84%
But because man has
a strong memory,

00:03:33.705 --> 00:03:36.070 align:middle line:84%
he is able to bear
the past in mind

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.910 align:middle line:84%
and, as it were, cast it forward
into visions of the future,

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.160 align:middle line:84%
based upon what has
happened in the past.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, although
this facility gives man

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.200 align:middle line:84%
the most extraordinary
ability to plan his life,

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.730 align:middle line:84%
to prepare for
future eventualities,

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.780 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, there
is a very heavy price

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:56.920 align:middle line:90%
which he pays for it.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And especially, if he takes
this ability too seriously.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.370 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if he
doesn't realize that

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.950 align:middle line:84%
the true reality
in which he lives

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.260 align:middle line:90%
is the present moment-- now.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.760 align:middle line:84%
For example, the
animal probably doesn't

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.825 align:middle line:84%
concern itself very
much with problems

00:04:17.825 --> 00:04:20.354 align:middle line:84%
of future disease,
death, or starvation,

00:04:20.354 --> 00:04:22.780 align:middle line:90%
and things of that kind.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.670 align:middle line:84%
If an animal sees another
dead animal lying around,

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't suppose he
thinks to himself, well,

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.670 align:middle line:84%
one day that's going
to happen to me.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.430 align:middle line:84%
Rather, he just
sees a dead animal,

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.920 align:middle line:84%
sniffs it, sees whether it's
good to eat, and wanders away.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.970 align:middle line:84%
But for human beings,
it's entirely different.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.800 align:middle line:84%
Because we actually
spend most of our time

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.940 align:middle line:84%
and a great deal of our
emotional energy living

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.710 align:middle line:84%
in time which is not here,
living in an elsewhere which

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.330 align:middle line:90%
is not concretely real.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.640 align:middle line:84%
So much so that, although we may
be quite comfortable and happy

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.400 align:middle line:84%
in our present circumstances,
if there is not

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.220 align:middle line:84%
a guarantee, not a promise of
a good time coming tomorrow

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.030 align:middle line:84%
and tomorrow and tomorrow and
tomorrow, we are, at once,

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:11.120 align:middle line:84%
unhappy, even in the midst
of pleasure and affluence.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And so, we develop a kind of
chronic anxiety about time.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.710 align:middle line:84%
We want to be sure,
more and more,

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.160 align:middle line:84%
because of our sensitivity
to the feeling of time,

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.490 align:middle line:90%
that our future is assured.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And for this reason,
the future becomes

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.950 align:middle line:84%
of more importance to most
human beings than the present.

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And in this sense, we are
hooked, taken in by a maya.

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.580 align:middle line:84%
Because it is of
very little use to us

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.560 align:middle line:84%
to be able to control
and plan the future

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.540 align:middle line:84%
unless we are capable, at the
same kind, of living totally

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.480 align:middle line:90%
in the present.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.410 align:middle line:84%
And so, when, in
civilized societies,

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.640 align:middle line:84%
we spend so much of our
time living for the future,

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:04.270 align:middle line:84%
we become very much like
those celebrated donkeys

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:09.610 align:middle line:84%
that have a carrot fastened on
a stick that's tied to the neck,

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:10.900 align:middle line:90%
behind here.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:11.870 align:middle line:90%
And it comes over.

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And there's the carrot
dangling in front of them.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.955 align:middle line:84%
And they pursue it, pursue
it, pursue it, but could never

00:06:15.955 --> 00:06:16.612 align:middle line:90%
reach it.

00:06:16.612 --> 00:06:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And so, in exactly the same
way, it's that way with us.

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.796 align:middle line:84%
My goodness, don't you remember
when you went first to school?

00:06:23.796 --> 00:06:26.270 align:middle line:90%
And you went to kindergarten.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And in kindergarten,
the idea was

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.147 align:middle line:84%
to push along so that you
could get into first grade.

00:06:31.147 --> 00:06:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And then, push along
so that you could

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:34.740 align:middle line:84%
get into second grade,
third grade, and so on,

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:35.430 align:middle line:90%
going up and up.

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And then, you went
to high school.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.290 align:middle line:84%
And this was a great
transition in life.

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And now, the pressure
is being put on.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.310 align:middle line:90%
You must get ahead.

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:43.010 align:middle line:84%
You must go up the
grades and, finally,

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.550 align:middle line:84%
be good enough to
get to college.

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:47.560 align:middle line:84%
And then, when you
get to college,

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.360 align:middle line:84%
you're still going step-by-step
up to the great moment

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.290 align:middle line:84%
in which you're ready to
go out into the world.

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And then, when you get out
into this famous world,

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:59.630 align:middle line:84%
there comes the
struggle for success

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.690 align:middle line:90%
in profession or business.

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And again, there seems to
be a ladder before you,

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:07.840 align:middle line:84%
something for which you're
reaching all the time.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And then, suddenly, when you're
about 40 or 45 years old,

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.854 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of life, you
wake up one day and say, huh?

00:07:16.854 --> 00:07:19.660 align:middle line:90%


00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.270 align:middle line:90%
I've arrived.

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:25.920 align:middle line:84%
And by Jove, I feel pretty much
the same as I've always felt.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.630 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I'm not so
sure that I don't

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:30.590 align:middle line:90%
feel a little bit cheated.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.095 align:middle line:84%
Because, you see,
you were fooled.

00:07:33.095 --> 00:07:37.344 align:middle line:84%
You were always living for
somewhere where you aren't.

00:07:37.344 --> 00:07:40.190 align:middle line:90%


00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And while, as I said, it
is of tremendous use for us

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:49.070 align:middle line:84%
to be able to look ahead
in this way and to plan,

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:52.394 align:middle line:84%
there is no use planning
for a future which,

00:07:52.394 --> 00:07:54.310 align:middle line:84%
when you get to it and
it becomes the present,

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:55.439 align:middle line:90%
you won't be there.

00:07:55.439 --> 00:07:57.730 align:middle line:84%
You'll be living in some
other future, which hasn't yet

00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:59.320 align:middle line:90%
arrived.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.430 align:middle line:84%
And so, in this way, one
is never able, actually,

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:05.880 align:middle line:84%
to inherit and enjoy the
fruits of one's action.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.670 align:middle line:90%


00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:13.600 align:middle line:84%
You can't live at all unless
you can live fully now.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.990 align:middle line:90%


00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:19.840 align:middle line:84%
And because now is
never satisfactory,

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.800 align:middle line:84%
because we're never
really living in it,

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.570 align:middle line:84%
we get more and more avid to
go ahead and pursue the future.

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:29.730 align:middle line:84%
We develop our technology
to a fantastic ability

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:32.600 align:middle line:84%
where we can, more and
more, fulfill our desires

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.580 align:middle line:84%
for the future
almost immediately,

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:40.153 align:middle line:84%
working towards a sort
of push-button world.

00:08:40.153 --> 00:08:44.049 align:middle line:84%
But have you ever stopped to
think what the world would

00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:49.400 align:middle line:84%
be like if you could fulfill
every wish the moment

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.760 align:middle line:90%
you wished it?

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.400 align:middle line:84%
Suppose, for example, on
going to bed at night,

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:59.690 align:middle line:84%
you could always dream
whatever you wanted to dream.

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:01.540 align:middle line:90%
What would happen after a while?

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.550 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I suppose
at first, you

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:08.560 align:middle line:84%
would dream fantastic
pleasures, wonderful adventures,

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.547 align:middle line:84%
fulfillment of all the
things you ever wished.

00:09:11.547 --> 00:09:13.130 align:middle line:84%
Then, as time went
on, don't you think

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:16.850 align:middle line:84%
you'd want to be a
little bit surprised?

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:19.350 align:middle line:84%
To have a little bit
less control over what

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.300 align:middle line:90%
was happening to you?

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.550 align:middle line:84%
And after you'd experimented
with this for some months

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:28.970 align:middle line:84%
or years, you might even want
dreams in which you suffered.

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:34.170 align:middle line:84%
Because there is
no real delight,

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.995 align:middle line:84%
no real fulfillment,
without delay.

00:09:36.995 --> 00:09:39.800 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't every child know, on
a hot day, when you think,

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm terribly
thirsty, and I'd like

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:45.820 align:middle line:84%
an ice-cream soda-- haven't you
tried the experiment of putting

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:46.578 align:middle line:90%
of drinking it?

00:09:46.578 --> 00:09:48.786 align:middle line:84%
Putting off, so that you
get thirstier and thirstier?

00:09:48.786 --> 00:09:52.442 align:middle line:84%
And it's so much fun when
you finally get to it?

00:09:52.442 --> 00:09:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And so, in the same way,
impatience with time,

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:58.670 align:middle line:84%
always wanting the
future, is frustrating.

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:01.250 align:middle line:90%


00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:10.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, in Indian thought, one
of the basic myths or ideas

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:15.630 align:middle line:84%
is of Brahma, the world
creator who has infinite power

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:18.310 align:middle line:84%
and has everything
that he wants.

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:21.650 align:middle line:90%
But he is like our dreamer.

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And he wants to do something
with the infinite time

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:27.000 align:middle line:90%
at his disposal.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, what he does
is to dream just like this,

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:34.610 align:middle line:84%
to dream the existence
of the world.

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And he does it over enormous and
incalculable periods of time,

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:44.250 align:middle line:84%
dreaming that he is
the knower, the self,

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:47.250 align:middle line:84%
in every single creature
that exist in the world,

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:50.160 align:middle line:84%
dreaming them all at once,
experiencing their joys

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.060 align:middle line:84%
and sorrows, completely
plunging himself

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:57.940 align:middle line:84%
into the adventure of
forgetting who he is.

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:02.890 align:middle line:84%
But he does this for
immense and vast periods,

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:05.140 align:middle line:84%
rivaling in
conception the latest

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:09.860 align:middle line:84%
modern astronomical ideas
of the extent of time.

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:13.860 align:middle line:84%
You know, the basic
reckoning period

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:18.220 align:middle line:84%
of time in the life of Brahma
the Creator is called a kalpa.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:23.840 align:middle line:90%


00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And that is a period
of 4,320,000 years.

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:37.450 align:middle line:84%
And the kalpas are called
the days of Brahma.

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:42.106 align:middle line:84%
One day from Brahma's
life is a kalpa.

00:11:42.106 --> 00:11:43.981 align:middle line:84%
And so, there are
the periods-- which

00:11:43.981 --> 00:11:45.730 align:middle line:84%
you can call his days
or nights, whichever

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:47.415 align:middle line:84%
you wish-- where
he goes into dream.

00:11:47.415 --> 00:11:49.125 align:middle line:90%
And he dreams the world.

00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And then, for the
following kalpa,

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:53.560 align:middle line:84%
he wakes up and realizes
who he is again.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And then, he dreams again, going
on and on and on through years

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:01.940 align:middle line:84%
of kalpas, of 360 days and
nights of Brahma, centuries

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:05.820 align:middle line:84%
of kalpas, endlessly,
endlessly, endlessly.

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:10.720 align:middle line:84%
For the Hindu doesn't think
of time in quite the same way

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.710 align:middle line:90%
that we do.

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:15.590 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, we think
of time as linear, day

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:19.650 align:middle line:84%
after day after day after
day, going along in a line.

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:24.550 align:middle line:84%
Or sometimes, we like to think
of time as this sort of line,

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:27.292 align:middle line:84%
going up, and up, and up,
and up, and up, and up,

00:12:27.292 --> 00:12:29.000 align:middle line:84%
and getting better
and better and better.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.900 align:middle line:90%


00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:35.550 align:middle line:84%
But that's not the
fundamental idea of time.

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:37.770 align:middle line:84%
For almost any
people in the world,

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:42.020 align:middle line:84%
outside of Western
civilization-- in nearly

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:46.090 align:middle line:84%
every other part of the world,
time is thought of as a circle.

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:55.300 align:middle line:90%


00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And they say, after
all, isn't it reasonable

00:12:58.410 --> 00:12:59.950 align:middle line:90%
for it to be a circle?

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:01.560 align:middle line:90%
Look at your watch.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.380 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't your watch
go round and round?

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:06.420 align:middle line:90%


00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:10.360 align:middle line:84%
But the Hindus not only think
of time as cycling-- going round

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:13.090 align:middle line:84%
and round and round forever,
just as the Earth cycles round

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:18.360 align:middle line:84%
and around the sun-- they also
think of it in another, quite

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:22.600 align:middle line:84%
fundamentally different way
from our conception of time.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.710 align:middle line:84%
I referred to this idea
that's common among us,

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:28.100 align:middle line:84%
that time is going
up and up, and things

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.090 align:middle line:90%
are getting better and better.

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:34.380 align:middle line:84%
But in the general Hindu
view, in every cycle of time,

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:38.970 align:middle line:84%
things tend, on the whole,
to get worse and worse.

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:42.420 align:middle line:84%
They divide the
kalpa into a number

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:46.550 align:middle line:84%
of shorter periods, each
of which is called a yuga.

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:51.520 align:middle line:90%


00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:56.100 align:middle line:84%
But the yugas are so
arranged that there

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.570 align:middle line:84%
are four of them
in what is called

00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:01.900 align:middle line:90%
a mahayuga, or "great yuga."

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:05.775 align:middle line:84%
The first one, occupying
this period, is the longest.

00:14:05.775 --> 00:14:09.030 align:middle line:90%


00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:16.440 align:middle line:84%
The second one occupies a
shorter period from here

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.940 align:middle line:90%
to here.

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:22.055 align:middle line:84%
The third, still
shorter than the second.

00:14:22.055 --> 00:14:25.820 align:middle line:84%
And the fourth, the
shortest of all.

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And the names that
are given to them

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:31.030 align:middle line:84%
are the names of the throws
in the Indian game of dice.

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:34.880 align:middle line:84%
The best throw, the throw
of four is called krita.

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And that lasts for
the longest time.

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:44.330 align:middle line:84%
It is a golden age where
everything is just fine.

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:49.170 align:middle line:84%
The next one is called
treta, the throw of three,

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:53.260 align:middle line:84%
pretty good, but
not quite so good.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:58.640 align:middle line:84%
The third is called
dvapara, the throw of two.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And here, good and evil are
equally balanced, not so hot.

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:09.510 align:middle line:84%
The final throw, the throw
of one, is called kali,

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:10.749 align:middle line:90%
the worst throw.

00:15:10.749 --> 00:15:12.040 align:middle line:90%
And that's the shortest period.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:14.790 align:middle line:84%
And of course, according
to Hindu ideas,

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:16.370 align:middle line:90%
we're living in it now.

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:19.150 align:middle line:84%
But in kali yuga,
everything goes to pieces

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:20.610 align:middle line:90%
and becomes dreadful.

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:23.190 align:middle line:90%
And time goes faster.

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:28.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, why do they feel that
time deteriorates in this way?

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:32.310 align:middle line:84%
It is because, as
one lives in time

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:34.720 align:middle line:84%
and becomes more and
more conscious of time,

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:38.170 align:middle line:84%
we tend, more and more,
to pursue the future,

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:40.810 align:middle line:90%
as I said a little while ago.

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And as we pursue the
future, present time

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:47.060 align:middle line:84%
becomes more and
more unsatisfactory.

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:50.760 align:middle line:84%
And we feel that we have
to chase our happiness

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:53.460 align:middle line:90%
at greater and greater speeds.

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:57.250 align:middle line:84%
I was talking the other day to
a college president who said,

00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:58.880 align:middle line:84%
you know, I'm so
busy now that I'm

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:01.430 align:middle line:84%
going to have to
get a helicopter.

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:03.500 align:middle line:84%
I said, whatever
you do, don't do it.

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:07.030 align:middle line:84%
Because if you get it, more
will be expected of you.

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:11.400 align:middle line:84%
You'll be expected to go
to more places faster.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:14.630 align:middle line:84%
And you see, in this
whole problem of speed,

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:16.920 align:middle line:84%
of getting advantages
in life because we

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:21.860 align:middle line:84%
can move about rapidly, we
forget that speed is only

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:24.120 align:middle line:84%
of real advantage
for you if you're

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:26.360 align:middle line:90%
the only person who has it.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:29.190 align:middle line:84%
Then, you can get
ahead of other people.

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:31.780 align:middle line:84%
But the minute everybody
else catches up with you,

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:35.040 align:middle line:84%
you're all back where you were,
only going much faster and much

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:39.800 align:middle line:84%
more nervously, going, as
it were, faster and faster

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:43.770 align:middle line:84%
to less and less
desirable objectives.

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:46.220 align:middle line:90%
We hurry everything we do.

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:50.210 align:middle line:84%
We make our products, our
houses, our furniture,

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:54.850 align:middle line:84%
our clothes so that they
become obsolete quickly.

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:57.530 align:middle line:84%
We're in such a hurry
to get everything done,

00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:01.555 align:middle line:84%
we pay attention to the
front rather than the back.

00:17:01.555 --> 00:17:06.810 align:middle line:84%
Who, for example,
in this day and age,

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:08.524 align:middle line:84%
has time to do
anything like this?

00:17:08.524 --> 00:17:11.528 align:middle line:90%


00:17:11.528 --> 00:17:13.069 align:middle line:84%
Here's a piece of
Chinese embroidery.

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:17.079 align:middle line:90%


00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:20.960 align:middle line:84%
Those among you who've ever
done any embroidery, some

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.829 align:middle line:84%
of the ladies, will
no doubt recognize

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:27.790 align:middle line:84%
that this is a kind of
stitch called needle-point.

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:31.160 align:middle line:84%
It's done on a material made
up of minute little squares

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:35.990 align:middle line:84%
of thread, like a grid
or lattice of thread.

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And this work here is
so minute that there

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:44.050 align:middle line:84%
are 1,024 stitches
to the square inch.

00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:47.060 align:middle line:84%
So well done, further more,
that if you turn it over

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:53.610 align:middle line:84%
and look at the back, the back
is almost as neat as the front.

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:57.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, ordinarily, when you
embroider, you take shortcuts

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.200 align:middle line:84%
around the back
and take threads,

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:03.300 align:middle line:84%
jumping spaces and tying
knots and things of that kind.

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:04.560 align:middle line:90%
But here, no hurry.

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:08.530 align:middle line:90%


00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:15.050 align:middle line:84%
Or take such an ordinary
object as a lady's pocketbook.

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:18.870 align:middle line:84%
This, again, is Chinese
embroidery work in shaded silk,

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:22.870 align:middle line:84%
very patiently done
over a padded base

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:27.340 align:middle line:84%
underneath so that
the figures stand out.

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And inside it, a little sewing
case, which opens up, showing,

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:44.520 align:middle line:84%
concealed within, the
place for the scissors,

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:46.070 align:middle line:90%
about the most delicate work.

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:49.700 align:middle line:90%


00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:54.400 align:middle line:84%
But in this day and age,
we don't have time for it.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:58.590 align:middle line:90%


00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:03.970 align:middle line:84%
Because we are always in a
hurry to get things finished.

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And so the things that we
finish weren't worth finishing,

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:08.730 align:middle line:90%
because they were done so fast.

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:13.380 align:middle line:90%


00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:16.950 align:middle line:84%
After all, the
enjoyment of our world

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:20.310 align:middle line:84%
is not really unlike
listening to music.

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:23.740 align:middle line:84%
We don't play music in
order to get somewhere.

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:25.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if the
objective of music

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:27.760 align:middle line:84%
were to arrive at the
point-- say the last bar,

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.630 align:middle line:84%
the final great crashing
chords of the symphony-- well,

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:32.690 align:middle line:90%
then we'd be, just hurry up.

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:33.310 align:middle line:90%
It's playing.

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:35.070 align:middle line:84%
Play it as fast
as possible so as

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:39.720 align:middle line:84%
to get to the culmination,
the end, as soon as possible.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.420 align:middle line:84%
Or just cut out
the whole symphony

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:42.600 align:middle line:90%
and play only the last bars.

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:45.600 align:middle line:90%


00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:49.460 align:middle line:84%
To be able to enjoy
it, we have got

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:51.710 align:middle line:84%
to live each moment
of the playing,

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:54.220 align:middle line:84%
and listen to it as if
it were the only thing

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:57.730 align:middle line:90%
important to listen to.

00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And then, if we
do that, our time

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:05.190 align:middle line:84%
has an entirely
different quality.

00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:10.180 align:middle line:84%
It's represented in
a Buddhist saying

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:14.730 align:middle line:84%
that spring does not
become the summer.

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:16.170 align:middle line:90%
There is spring.

00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:18.920 align:middle line:90%
And then, there is summer.

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.930 align:middle line:84%
Firewood does not
turn into ashes.

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:23.992 align:middle line:90%
There is, first, firewood.

00:20:23.992 --> 00:20:26.790 align:middle line:90%
And then, there are ashes.

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:33.030 align:middle line:84%
The two stages being, as it
were, sufficient by themselves.

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is intended to
give the idea of living

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:40.630 align:middle line:84%
in a fully concrete present
into which you settle in.

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:42.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the present,
for most of us,

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:46.786 align:middle line:84%
isn't it just a
hairline on a dial?

00:20:46.786 --> 00:20:49.100 align:middle line:90%
And the hand goes by it, flash!

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing in
it, one after another.

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:55.080 align:middle line:84%
But here, there is an
entirely different sense

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.930 align:middle line:84%
of the present as something
you can settle into.

00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:00.870 align:middle line:90%


00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:06.890 align:middle line:84%
There's a line behind
me from a Chinese poem.

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And it says,
literally, day, ditto.

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:17.850 align:middle line:84%
In other words, day,
day, that is good day.

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:20.920 align:middle line:90%
Every day is a good day.

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And it comes as the
last line of this poem.

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:28.630 align:middle line:90%
In spring, hundreds of flowers.

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:31.956 align:middle line:90%
In summer, refreshing breeze.

00:21:31.956 --> 00:21:35.100 align:middle line:90%
In autumn, the moon.

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:38.780 align:middle line:84%
Free your mind
from idle thoughts.

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And for you, every
season is a good season.

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:45.100 align:middle line:90%
Or every day is a good day.

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And idle thoughts mean
illusory thoughts, thoughts

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:57.460 align:middle line:84%
of pursuing a future, thoughts
of making one's happiness

00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:00.300 align:middle line:84%
depend on something
which isn't here at all.

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:05.770 align:middle line:90%


00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:11.250 align:middle line:84%
But when one can come to
realize that the present is

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:13.910 align:middle line:84%
the only place in
which you live,

00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:16.200 align:middle line:84%
and that the past and
the future are now

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:20.920 align:middle line:84%
no more than useful illusions--
still useful, but useful only

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:23.650 align:middle line:84%
if one can live in the
present-- then, as I say,

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:27.690 align:middle line:84%
one can settle into
full participation

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:31.180 align:middle line:84%
with the momentary
reality of life,

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:34.958 align:middle line:84%
as it goes along--
just like music.

00:22:34.958 --> 00:22:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And so, in the arts
of the Far East,

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:42.450 align:middle line:84%
there is reflected a kind
of delight in momentariness.

00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:45.490 align:middle line:90%


00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:49.830 align:middle line:84%
One can really
consider, for example,

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:53.130 align:middle line:90%
this stem of a broken bamboo.

00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:59.160 align:middle line:90%


00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:07.720 align:middle line:84%
Or not only in painting
but in poetry--

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:11.060 align:middle line:84%
a poem in the
Japanese haiku style.

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:14.410 align:middle line:84%
Poems which just
crystallize a single moment.

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:19.031 align:middle line:84%
In the dark forest,
a berry drops.

00:23:19.031 --> 00:23:20.490 align:middle line:90%
The sound of the water.

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:24.220 align:middle line:90%


00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:29.230 align:middle line:84%
Or a painting of a man
sitting all alone in his boat

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:30.530 align:middle line:90%
and listening to the water.

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:33.760 align:middle line:90%


00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.340 align:middle line:90%
He is not asleep.

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:37.730 align:middle line:90%
He is not dreaming.

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:41.930 align:middle line:84%
He's a man living in
an entirely real world,

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:45.930 align:middle line:90%
a world which we neglect.

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:53.550 align:middle line:84%
Because we have no time to
sit and listen to the water.

00:23:53.550 --> 00:24:02.970 align:middle line:84%
After all, are not the
memories which you go over,

00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:06.880 align:middle line:84%
memories which persuade you that
it's really worth being alive,

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:11.050 align:middle line:84%
really memories of certain
moments in which life

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:15.560 align:middle line:84%
itself brought you
completely awake?

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:19.280 align:middle line:84%
I know we all think of things
like the smell of coffee

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:26.180 align:middle line:84%
and bacon cooking on
an autumn morning.

00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:29.510 align:middle line:90%
The smell of burning leaves.

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:32.550 align:middle line:84%
I remember, particularly
for me, one glimpse

00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:36.188 align:middle line:84%
of a flock of sunlit pigeons
against the dark background

00:24:36.188 --> 00:24:37.021 align:middle line:90%
of the thundercloud.

00:24:37.021 --> 00:24:39.790 align:middle line:90%


00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's instances
like that that

00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:49.480 align:middle line:84%
are very largely celebrated
in Far Eastern art and poetry,

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:55.020 align:middle line:84%
perceptions of the full reality
and intensity of the moment.

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:58.100 align:middle line:90%
Such a one is this.

00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:00.300 align:middle line:90%
The sea darkens.

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:03.620 align:middle line:84%
The voices of the wild
ducks are faintly white.

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:06.590 align:middle line:90%


00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:10.740 align:middle line:84%
A brushwood gate and,
for a lock, this snail.

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:13.620 align:middle line:90%


00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:20.370 align:middle line:84%
Or paintings where one sees
just a few birds on a branch,

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:22.610 align:middle line:84%
so vividly alive
that you somehow

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:24.970 align:middle line:84%
think the next time
you look at the branch,

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:26.145 align:middle line:90%
the birds won't be there.

00:25:26.145 --> 00:25:29.290 align:middle line:90%


00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:35.030 align:middle line:84%
This is all an art form,
possible for people

00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:40.020 align:middle line:84%
who feel themselves to be living
in this real momentary world.

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:43.950 align:middle line:90%


00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:48.440 align:middle line:84%
I remember, once, a very
wise man who used to give

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:53.090 align:middle line:84%
lectures on philosophical
matters of this kind--

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:55.680 align:middle line:84%
before he started
giving any lecture,

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:59.532 align:middle line:84%
would sit for a while, looking
at his audience very intently,

00:25:59.532 --> 00:26:00.500 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:10.190 align:middle line:90%


00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And then, quite suddenly,
he would say, wake up!

00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:17.376 align:middle line:90%
You're all fast asleep!

00:26:17.376 --> 00:26:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't wake up,
I won't give any lecture.

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:26.060 align:middle line:90%


00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And another Chinese sage
pointed one day at some flowers

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:36.580 align:middle line:84%
while talking to
a friend and said,

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:39.800 align:middle line:84%
most people look at these
as if they were in a dream.

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:43.210 align:middle line:90%


00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And Buddha, one of the
wisest of the sons of Ayesha.

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:51.500 align:middle line:90%
His real name was Gautama.

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:53.920 align:middle line:84%
But he was called
Buddha because Buddha

00:26:53.920 --> 00:27:01.450 align:middle line:84%
means "the awakened one,"
"the man who woke up."

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:05.060 align:middle line:90%
Now, in what sense was he awake?

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:09.380 align:middle line:84%
He was awake in the sense that
he was completely all here.

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:13.250 align:middle line:84%
After all, we say about a person
who is nuts, he's not all here.

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:16.140 align:middle line:90%
He's not all there.

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:19.770 align:middle line:84%
But our whole culture, our whole
civilization-- insofar as it

00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:23.510 align:middle line:84%
is involved with time and living
only for a future-- is nuts.

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:25.860 align:middle line:90%
It's not all here.

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:28.110 align:middle line:90%
We are not awake.

00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:31.690 align:middle line:90%
We are not complete alive now.

00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And consequently, we are
so hungry and so greedy.

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:37.890 align:middle line:84%
Because everything
seems tasteless.

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:42.760 align:middle line:84%
We are living for an abstraction
which has not had come to be.

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know
what really is.
