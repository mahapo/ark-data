00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.870 align:middle line:84%
Alan Watts is a
scholar, lecturer,

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.200 align:middle line:84%
and the author of
many widely read books

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.490 align:middle line:84%
on comparative
philosophy and religion.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:59.980 align:middle line:90%


00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.670 align:middle line:84%
>>I have often
puzzled and puzzled

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.630 align:middle line:84%
about what it must be like to
go to sleep and never wake up.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.220 align:middle line:90%


00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.280 align:middle line:84%
be simply not there
forever and ever.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.710 align:middle line:84%
After all, one has
some intimation

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.060 align:middle line:84%
of this by the
interval that separates

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.990 align:middle line:90%
going to sleep from waking.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.110 align:middle line:84%
When we don't have any
dreams, but go to sleep,

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.950 align:middle line:84%
and then suddenly,
we're there again.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.600 align:middle line:84%
And in the interim,
there was nothing.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.390 align:middle line:90%


00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And if there was never
any end to that interval,

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:51.150 align:middle line:84%
if the waking up didn't happen,
that's such a curious thought.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And yet, you know, I believe
that although that's rather

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.710 align:middle line:84%
gloomy kind of
consideration, I found

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.870 align:middle line:84%
that's one of the most
creative thoughts I ever

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.600 align:middle line:90%
thought in my life.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.390 align:middle line:90%
And I keep going back to it.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.420 align:middle line:84%
It's in line with a lot of
the very fundamental questions

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.780 align:middle line:84%
that children ask when they
say, "Mommy, who would I

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.130 align:middle line:84%
have been if you're
married someone else?"

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.810 align:middle line:84%
These are the kinds of questions
that make us puzzle profoundly

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.510 align:middle line:90%
about our existence.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
reasons why, I think,

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.330 align:middle line:84%
thinking about not being,
about total non-existence,

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:47.010 align:middle line:84%
is so creative, is that in
comparison with that thought,

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.075 align:middle line:84%
the fact that we are
seems kind of queer.

00:02:52.075 --> 00:02:52.700 align:middle line:90%
Incredibly odd.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.820 align:middle line:90%


00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.520 align:middle line:84%
But in the Western
world, I suppose

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:08.150 align:middle line:84%
we have two dominant ideas about
what happens to us when we die.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.310 align:middle line:84%
There's the old fashioned
idea that after we

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.470 align:middle line:90%
die we go to another world.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.830 align:middle line:84%
I say old fashioned, not
to say it's out of date.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.850 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
the answer to this is.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.020 align:middle line:84%
But that's the traditional
answer of the Western world.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.000 align:middle line:84%
When you die you
go to another life.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.440 align:middle line:84%
Maybe heaven, maybe purgatory,
maybe hell, who knows?

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.450 align:middle line:84%
I think nowadays, though,
the more general idea,

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.870 align:middle line:84%
the more plausible
idea to many people

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.370 align:middle line:84%
is that when we die
we just cease to be.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.790 align:middle line:90%
That's all there is to it.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.970 align:middle line:84%
But we're inclined, I
think, to have in our minds

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.990 align:middle line:84%
a picture of this, which indeed,
is depressing of being shut up

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.950 align:middle line:84%
in the dark for always,
and always, always.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.110 align:middle line:84%
To be kind of buried
alive in a blackness

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.739 align:middle line:84%
where we are blind,
deaf, and dumb

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:00.905 align:middle line:90%
but somehow still conscious.

00:04:00.905 --> 00:04:03.580 align:middle line:90%


00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.050 align:middle line:84%
But in the Eastern world, there
are different ideas of this.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.470 align:middle line:90%


00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.090 align:middle line:84%
The major Eastern idea
is what is generally

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.680 align:middle line:90%
known as a reincarnation.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.440 align:middle line:84%
Of going through life,
after life, after life

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.750 align:middle line:90%
in an endless series.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.680 align:middle line:84%
A process that is represented
in this Japanese print

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.460 align:middle line:84%
of the Wheel of Life, the
Buddhist Wheel of Life.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.030 align:middle line:84%
This painting was lent
to me by Mr. and Mrs.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.915 align:middle line:84%
Imamura of Berkeley
in California.

00:04:40.915 --> 00:04:46.010 align:middle line:84%
He used to be the priest of
the Berkeley Buddhist Church.

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And it shows the wheel
of stages of existence

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.620 align:middle line:84%
through which
beings pass clutched

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.640 align:middle line:84%
by the great demon
of impermanence.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.860 align:middle line:84%
This is rather an
unusual representation

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.290 align:middle line:90%
of the Wheel of Life.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.070 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps some of you
have seen these before.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.350 align:middle line:84%
They usually have six
divisions in the central part

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.910 align:middle line:90%
of the wheel here.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And this one happens
to have five,

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.570 align:middle line:84%
and it's the Chinese-Japanese
version of the Wheel of Life.

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.860 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, I think,
prints in books--

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.090 align:middle line:84%
I know there was one some years
ago in "Life" magazine usually

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.540 align:middle line:90%
show the Tibetan version.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.410 align:middle line:84%
But what we have here,
and I think what I'll do,

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.390 align:middle line:84%
is I'll explain to begin with
the popular interpretation

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.150 align:middle line:90%
of it.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.230 align:middle line:84%
And then go on to see what more
philosophical Buddhists think

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.860 align:middle line:90%
of it in a deeper way.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.510 align:middle line:84%
These then are the five,
or sometimes six realms

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.000 align:middle line:84%
of existence through
which, as I said,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.300 align:middle line:84%
beings pass through
their various lives.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.830 align:middle line:84%
We could start
here, for example.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.800 align:middle line:90%
This is the human world.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And then next to this is the
world of the Devas, D-E-V-A,

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.880 align:middle line:84%
which we would translate
into English as angel.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.460 align:middle line:84%
Then this is the
world of the animals.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.140 align:middle line:84%
This is the world that is
sometimes called the hells.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.260 align:middle line:84%
Only that's not quite
a correct term for it.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.570 align:middle line:84%
It should be called the
world of the purgatories,

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:19.160 align:middle line:84%
because in this scheme
of the universe,

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.570 align:middle line:90%
there is no everlasting state.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.310 align:middle line:84%
There's no everlasting
heaven and there's

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.870 align:middle line:90%
no everlasting hell.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.720 align:middle line:84%
The Demon of Impermanece
clutches the whole thing,

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.970 align:middle line:90%
and they all terminate.

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:34.160 align:middle line:84%
Next to the hells, there is
the realm of what are called

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.930 align:middle line:84%
pretas, P-R-E-T-A. They
are frustrated spirits,

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:44.470 align:middle line:84%
sometimes shown with very large
stomachs and very tiny mouths.

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:50.390 align:middle line:84%
Enormous appetite, but very
small means of satisfying it.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is, you
see, that in the course

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:58.730 align:middle line:84%
of his development,
the individual

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:02.320 align:middle line:90%
goes through life after life.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.400 align:middle line:84%
If he does well, he ascends
towards the heavens.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:10.460 align:middle line:84%
If he does ill, he
descends to the hells.

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Or you may fall from the human
state to the animal state.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.940 align:middle line:84%
Or fall from the human state
to the state of the ghosts.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.910 align:middle line:90%


00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:26.570 align:middle line:84%
But the point that has to be
remembered in the Buddhist

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:31.320 align:middle line:84%
idea of transmigration
or reincarnation,

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:35.150 align:middle line:84%
is that you can
never stop anywhere.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.440 align:middle line:84%
You may ascend to
heaven, but what goes up

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.280 align:middle line:90%
must eventually come down.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.280 align:middle line:84%
You may descend to
hell, but what goes down

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.390 align:middle line:90%
must eventually come up.

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And so one goes on and on moving
through these various world's

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.970 align:middle line:84%
until in Buddhist ideas
you become sufficiently

00:07:53.970 --> 00:08:00.690 align:middle line:84%
awakened to become a Buddha, one
who is released from the wheel.

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And who does not fall anymore
into the sequence of rebirth

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:09.510 align:middle line:84%
but enters the eternal
state of nirvana.

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:11.030 align:middle line:84%
Now if you will
look closer again,

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:13.340 align:middle line:84%
you will see that there
are a number of figures

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:16.140 align:middle line:90%
around the outside of the wheel.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And these represent
what is called

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:24.920 align:middle line:84%
the 12-fold chain of
dependent origination.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:28.230 align:middle line:84%
That is to say,
they are a series

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:34.330 align:middle line:84%
of links which form what might
be called the sequence of life.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:37.380 align:middle line:84%
They are, as it were,
a schematic diagram

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:43.130 align:middle line:84%
of the force or the process
that keeps this wheel rotating.

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:48.430 align:middle line:84%
And the chain starts with a
demon down at the bottom here

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:53.370 align:middle line:84%
who represents ignorance,
or perhaps unconsciousness,

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:56.400 align:middle line:90%
the state of not knowing.

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.940 align:middle line:84%
Then next in order, you
will see a potter's wheel.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And this represents
potentialities of life.

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:07.720 align:middle line:84%
Next comes a monkey who
represents consciousness.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.600 align:middle line:90%


00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.660 align:middle line:90%
A man in a boat.

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:16.740 align:middle line:84%
For some reason this
represents the combination

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.250 align:middle line:90%
of name and form.

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:22.490 align:middle line:90%
Words bringing out shapes.

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:27.240 align:middle line:84%
Words identifying shapes
and things in the world.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.080 align:middle line:84%
Here comes sense
consciousness, the five senses.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.280 align:middle line:84%
A man's body with
the senses exposed.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And here comes contact,
a pair of lovers.

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:43.420 align:middle line:84%
After this, there
comes perception.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:46.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm not quite sure what the
symbol in this wheel is.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.790 align:middle line:84%
It seems to show a man with
a sword behind a screen

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:52.920 align:middle line:84%
and two women playing
in front of the screen.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:56.720 align:middle line:84%
The usual symbol you'll
find here for perception

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:02.130 align:middle line:84%
is a man with an arrow in his
eye showing the pain involved

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:04.450 align:middle line:90%
in the perception of the world.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:09.040 align:middle line:90%
The next in the link is desire.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:12.680 align:middle line:90%
It shows a woman with twins.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:17.350 align:middle line:84%
The next one here
is called grasping,

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:19.890 align:middle line:84%
and that shows a man with
a basket into which he

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:22.900 align:middle line:84%
is trying to get
the fruits of life.

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And then as we come
over around the wheel,

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:30.900 align:middle line:84%
we get a figure,
which means growth.

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:34.180 align:middle line:84%
I think this is one of
the gods of prosperity.

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:37.570 align:middle line:84%
But it means growth,
the fullness of life.

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:40.770 align:middle line:84%
Here is birth, a
woman in parturition.

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:44.330 align:middle line:90%
Here is old age.

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:47.100 align:middle line:84%
And then, although
the final stage

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.680 align:middle line:84%
of the links of dependent
origination as they

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:54.260 align:middle line:84%
are usually drawn, shows
this one as the last,

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:55.896 align:middle line:90%
and calls it old age and death.

00:10:55.896 --> 00:10:57.270 align:middle line:84%
In this particular
wheel, they've

00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:05.240 align:middle line:84%
been spread out, so that you get
old age, grief-- no, excuse me,

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.290 align:middle line:90%
this is sickness.

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:16.020 align:middle line:84%
Old age, sickness, death,
grief, compassion, suffering

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:17.720 align:middle line:90%
and, again back into ignorance.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.290 align:middle line:84%
Here's another
figure of ignorance,

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:24.270 align:middle line:84%
the camel being
led by a blind man.

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:28.500 align:middle line:84%
Now what I want you to notice
particularly about this

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:36.770 align:middle line:84%
is that the chain represents
what is called in Sanskrit

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:38.922 align:middle line:90%
the process of karma.

00:11:38.922 --> 00:11:40.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to write
that word because it's

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:43.249 align:middle line:84%
very fundamental
to an understanding

00:11:43.249 --> 00:11:44.165 align:middle line:90%
of this whole problem.

00:11:44.165 --> 00:11:47.420 align:middle line:90%


00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:56.840 align:middle line:84%
Karma is sometimes
understood, and maybe

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.940 align:middle line:84%
your ordinary dictionaries
give it to you,

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:01.060 align:middle line:90%
as the law of cause and effect.

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:09.780 align:middle line:84%
But actually, it comes
from the route Kri-

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:16.020 align:middle line:84%
which in Sanskrit
means to act or to do.

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And the basic idea
of karma is that it

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:26.690 align:middle line:84%
is action which always involves
the necessity for other action.

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:33.330 align:middle line:84%
As the Buddha once expressed
it, this arises, that becomes.

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:37.050 align:middle line:84%
Now this isn't quite the same
thing as cause and effect.

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:39.870 align:middle line:84%
It is rather the
idea of linkage.

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:47.840 align:middle line:84%
For example, when I pick up this
brush, I lift it by one end,

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.210 align:middle line:90%
and the other end comes up.

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:53.014 align:middle line:84%
Now we could say, this
is cause and effect,

00:12:53.014 --> 00:12:55.430 align:middle line:84%
although this would be a rather
cumbersome way of thinking

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.929 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:12:55.929 --> 00:12:58.280 align:middle line:84%
I could say, for
example, that the coming

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:02.720 align:middle line:84%
up of the brush at this end
is the effect of the cause

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.590 align:middle line:90%
my lifting it at this end.

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:08.300 align:middle line:84%
But we don't ordinarily think
so complicatedly about it.

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:10.730 align:middle line:84%
We think in a simpler
fashion, namely,

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:14.350 align:middle line:84%
that to pick up this end is
also to lift up that end,

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:17.670 align:middle line:90%
because it's all one.

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:22.050 align:middle line:84%
So in the same way,
Buddhists and Hindus

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:31.290 align:middle line:84%
who follow the idea of karma,
believe that life and death

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:34.800 align:middle line:84%
involve each other
in the same way

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.730 align:middle line:84%
that the two ends of
the brush lifting up one

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:39.320 align:middle line:90%
involves lifting up the other.

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.830 align:middle line:84%
So in this way,
living involves dying.

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:46.550 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't say that the
cause of death is birth.

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:50.580 align:middle line:84%
But birth and death go together
and they are inseparable.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And so if we will look again
for a moment at the wheel,

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:59.330 align:middle line:84%
we can see that there are
these important phases of it

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:00.850 align:middle line:90%
all together.

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:05.040 align:middle line:84%
Here it ends with the sequence
of pictures representing

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.750 align:middle line:84%
death and suffering and
its attendant grief.

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:12.520 align:middle line:84%
Ending in the blind
man leading the camel,

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.770 align:middle line:84%
and the demon, which
together, represent

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:18.980 align:middle line:90%
ignorance or unconsciousness.

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:23.500 align:middle line:84%
But once again here, we have
the potentiality of life,

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:27.490 align:middle line:84%
and then the monkey
representing consciousness.

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:33.480 align:middle line:84%
All these things are looked
upon as linked and therefore

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.290 align:middle line:90%
inseparable.

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And thus, you see, we
don't look upon ignorance

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:44.470 align:middle line:84%
as the first step or the
first link in the chain

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:46.700 align:middle line:84%
from a chronological
point of view.

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:50.250 align:middle line:84%
We only start numbering
the steps of the change

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:55.000 align:middle line:84%
here, because one has to begin
somewhere when one's talking.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And so the basic
idea of this link

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:06.510 align:middle line:84%
is interrelatedness,
interlockness,

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:12.460 align:middle line:84%
so that death and life, as
I said, imply each other.

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:15.420 align:middle line:84%
So that you might, speaking
from the standpoint

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:19.360 align:middle line:84%
of Indian philosophy of
Hinduism, of Buddhism,

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.620 align:middle line:84%
you might pick an argument
with Hamlet and say,

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:25.570 align:middle line:84%
to be or not to be
is not the question.

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:27.470 align:middle line:90%
These are not alternatives.

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:31.260 align:middle line:84%
They are things that go together
just like up and down, back

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:35.510 align:middle line:90%
and front, solid and space.

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:38.850 align:middle line:84%
Now there's another
aspect to karma,

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:41.550 align:middle line:84%
which needs to be
considered here.

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:45.630 align:middle line:84%
And that is that
karma also involves

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:49.300 align:middle line:84%
the idea of the
continuity of pattern.

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:51.960 align:middle line:90%


00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:55.020 align:middle line:84%
You know, strictly
speaking, Buddhists

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:59.460 align:middle line:84%
don't believe that there
is any soul entity which

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:02.150 align:middle line:90%
passes from one life to another.

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:08.170 align:middle line:84%
There is no sort of fixed
eye, or fixed ego which

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:10.420 align:middle line:84%
once was an animal,
and then became a man,

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:11.920 align:middle line:84%
and then became
an angel, and then

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:15.690 align:middle line:84%
eventually became a Buddha
or something like that.

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:18.950 align:middle line:84%
The idea of karma as
the linking factor

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:21.740 align:middle line:84%
between the various
lives is what

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:25.310 align:middle line:84%
we might call
continuity of pattern.

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:31.430 align:middle line:84%
For example, consider
an army regiment.

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:36.270 align:middle line:84%
A certain regiment goes on
year, after year, after year.

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:38.000 align:middle line:84%
Old European
regiments, for example,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.620 align:middle line:84%
have existed for
hundreds of years.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And yet, the personnel
of those regiments,

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:45.750 align:middle line:84%
and even the barracks in
which they are stationed,

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:47.940 align:middle line:90%
are entirely changed.

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:50.710 align:middle line:90%
In the same way a university.

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:54.520 align:middle line:84%
Harvard University has
existed for a long time.

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:57.080 align:middle line:90%
Oxford for a lot longer.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And yet, there is
not a single member

00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:01.070 align:middle line:84%
of the faculty, not
a single student,

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:03.332 align:middle line:84%
who was there when
it first began.

00:17:03.332 --> 00:17:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And yet, you see, the
university goes on.

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:13.240 align:middle line:84%
Because what goes on is a
pattern, a form of life.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:17.490 align:middle line:84%
In the same way, the individual
body of man, every seven years,

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:20.619 align:middle line:84%
I think, all the
molecules composing out

00:17:20.619 --> 00:17:23.520 align:middle line:84%
physical structure
are entirely changed.

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And yet, something identifiable
as the pattern, which

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:32.290 align:middle line:84%
we associate with Mr. or Mrs.
So-and-So, is still there.

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:35.960 align:middle line:84%
Another fascinating illustration
of continuity of pattern,

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.774 align:middle line:90%
in a sense, is wave motion.

00:17:38.774 --> 00:17:40.190 align:middle line:84%
It's perhaps easiest
to illustrate

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:43.310 align:middle line:84%
with something like
a barber's pole.

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:48.240 align:middle line:84%
When you twirl it,
now as you twirl it,

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:51.260 align:middle line:84%
there's an illusion of
something moving upwards

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:52.960 align:middle line:84%
from the bottom to
the top of the pole.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.480 align:middle line:84%
It seems that the
strips go along.

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.700 align:middle line:84%
Now actually, they
don't go along.

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:00.390 align:middle line:90%
They just go round.

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And in the same way, also,
when waves move across water,

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:08.060 align:middle line:84%
there's no water
moving across, there

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:09.800 align:middle line:84%
is the wave pattern
moving across.

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.760 align:middle line:84%
The water is just
going up and down

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.610 align:middle line:84%
as you can tell when you see,
say, a dead leaf floating

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:19.900 align:middle line:84%
on the water's surface, and it
isn't moved along by the waves.

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:23.200 align:middle line:84%
So this idea of
continuity of pattern

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:29.280 align:middle line:84%
is the solution which
Indian philosophy

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.820 align:middle line:84%
offers on the matter of
the problem of death.

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:38.660 align:middle line:84%
The individual as it were
entity is constantly changing.

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:42.560 align:middle line:84%
He does not go on, but
the pattern or the karma,

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:45.490 align:middle line:90%
the pattern of action, goes on.

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's all embraced
by that figure

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:53.760 align:middle line:84%
you saw of the great
Demon of Impermanence.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.430 align:middle line:84%
Could we look at that
demon once again?

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:57.054 align:middle line:84%
I want to say something
more about him.

00:18:57.054 --> 00:19:00.890 align:middle line:90%


00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:05.500 align:middle line:84%
From our Western ideas, this
fellow looks pretty evil.

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And we might associate him
with the devil in the Hebrew

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:12.440 align:middle line:84%
or Christian sense of
a principle of evil.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.890 align:middle line:84%
In Buddhism, demons
are not evil.

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:18.440 align:middle line:90%
They are really benevolence.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:21.860 align:middle line:84%
They have a frightening
aspect, but underneath this

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.810 align:middle line:90%
there is a deeper meaning.

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:27.950 align:middle line:84%
This demon represents
change or impermanence.

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:31.950 align:middle line:84%
But deep inside,
underlying this,

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:37.820 align:middle line:84%
is that change is a
liberating factor.

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:40.120 align:middle line:90%
Death is a liberating factor.

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:45.540 align:middle line:84%
Did it not exist, life
would not exist either.

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And, therefore, the wise man
is not afraid of the demon.

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:51.490 align:middle line:84%
He goes as it were
straightforward to him

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:53.250 align:middle line:84%
to embrace him,
and at that moment,

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:55.770 align:middle line:90%
the demon is transformed.

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:58.360 align:middle line:84%
So in the same way
in a deeper sense,

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:01.210 align:middle line:84%
Buddhists do not think
of these various realms

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:03.750 align:middle line:84%
of the wheel as
literal worlds where

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:07.080 align:middle line:84%
there are angels, and
demons, and starved ghosts.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:12.180 align:middle line:84%
But they represent the various
phases of conscienceness.

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:16.570 align:middle line:84%
Equanimity, a general kind
of medium consciousness,

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:18.730 align:middle line:84%
quiet consciousness
as the human state.

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:21.020 align:middle line:84%
The angel state is
supreme happiness.

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:24.110 align:middle line:84%
The animal state
is an animality.

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:27.980 align:middle line:84%
Here is misery in
its extreme, and here

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:30.240 align:middle line:90%
is frustration in its extreme.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.900 align:middle line:84%
But the fundamental
idea of the whole wheel

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:35.880 align:middle line:84%
that we have to remember,
the idea of karma,

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:40.140 align:middle line:84%
is the interlocking,
the interdependence,

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:43.900 align:middle line:84%
of being and not being,
of death and life.

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that
the demon of change

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:55.330 align:middle line:84%
is really a disguise of
the very source of life.

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:58.610 align:middle line:84%
The death, without which,
life is impossible.

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:01.920 align:middle line:84%
The change, without which,
life is totally boring.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:05.100 align:middle line:90%


00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:10.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, when any
idea like that is explained,

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:13.590 align:middle line:84%
the first thing that
we ask is is it true?

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:16.280 align:middle line:90%


00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:20.485 align:middle line:90%
Is there a process of rebirth?

00:21:20.485 --> 00:21:28.820 align:middle line:84%
Do our patterns go on
and on and have influence

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:30.130 align:middle line:90%
to an illimitable future?

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:33.000 align:middle line:90%


00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.960 align:middle line:84%
But as this idea is held
by deeply thoughtful Hindus

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:41.620 align:middle line:84%
and Buddhists, it isn't
a belief in something

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:43.210 align:middle line:90%
which we can't prove.

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:47.170 align:middle line:84%
It's really quite a
self-evident notion.

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:48.910 align:middle line:90%
Think of it in this way.

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:52.590 align:middle line:90%
Supposing I make two statements.

00:21:52.590 --> 00:22:00.060 align:middle line:84%
Statement one-- after I
die, I shall be reborn again

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:05.450 align:middle line:84%
as a baby, but I shall
forget my former life.

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:11.881 align:middle line:84%
Statement two-- after I
die, a baby will be born.

00:22:11.881 --> 00:22:14.470 align:middle line:90%


00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:16.460 align:middle line:84%
Now I believe that
those two statements

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:19.420 align:middle line:84%
are saying exactly
the same thing.

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And we know that the
second one is true.

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:23.730 align:middle line:90%
Babies are always being born.

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:25.980 align:middle line:84%
Conscious beings of
all kinds of constantly

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:30.780 align:middle line:84%
coming into existence
after others die.

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:35.310 align:middle line:84%
But why would I think that
the two statements are really

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:37.920 align:middle line:90%
the same statement?

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:43.200 align:middle line:84%
Because after all, if you
die and your memory comes

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:47.460 align:middle line:84%
to an end, and you forget
who you were, being reborn

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:51.550 align:middle line:84%
again is exactly the equivalent
of somebody else being born.

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:54.670 align:middle line:84%
Because we have no
consciousness of our continuity

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:55.990 align:middle line:90%
unless we have memory.

00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:58.670 align:middle line:84%
If the memory goes, then
we might just as well

00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:01.790 align:middle line:90%
be somebody else.

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:05.070 align:middle line:84%
But it seems to me that the
fascinating thing about this

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:10.680 align:middle line:84%
is that, although a particular
set of memories vanish,

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:14.910 align:middle line:84%
death is not the end
of consciousness.

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:20.410 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we are
diluted by a kind of fantasy.

00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:28.340 align:middle line:84%
If we think of death as endless
darkness, endless nothingness,

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:32.880 align:middle line:84%
is not only inconceivable,
but it's logically

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.800 align:middle line:90%
absolutely meaningless.

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:37.360 align:middle line:84%
Because we aren't
able to have any idea,

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.070 align:middle line:84%
much less sensation,
of nothing unless it

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:44.100 align:middle line:84%
can be compared with the
sensation of something.

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:47.270 align:middle line:90%
These two things go together.

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And, therefore, I
think what is meant

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:53.670 align:middle line:84%
is that the vacuum created by
the disappearance of a being,

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:56.990 align:middle line:84%
by the disappearance
of his memory system

00:23:56.990 --> 00:24:02.630 align:middle line:84%
is simply filled by
another being who

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:06.230 align:middle line:90%
is I just as you feel you're I.

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:08.760 align:middle line:84%
The funny thing
about being I, about

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:12.290 align:middle line:84%
feeling that one is sort of
a center of the universe,

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:15.270 align:middle line:84%
is that you can only
experience this I sensation

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:16.530 align:middle line:90%
in the singular.

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:18.570 align:middle line:84%
You can't experience
being two or three

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:20.200 align:middle line:90%
I's all at the same time.

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:23.180 align:middle line:90%


00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:26.150 align:middle line:84%
Now then, it seems
to me that this idea

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:29.870 align:middle line:84%
has three very
important consequences.

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:37.030 align:middle line:84%
One is that the disappearance
of our memory in death

00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:40.890 align:middle line:84%
is not really something
to be regretted.

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:45.960 align:middle line:84%
Of course, everybody wishes to
hold forever to the memories

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:48.080 align:middle line:84%
and to the people
and the situations

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.510 align:middle line:90%
that he particularly loves.

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:54.150 align:middle line:84%
But surely, if we
think this through,

00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:57.620 align:middle line:90%
is that what we actually want?

00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:01.890 align:middle line:84%
Do we really want to have those
we love, however greatly we

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:06.680 align:middle line:84%
love them, always, and always,
and always, and always?

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:10.840 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it inconceivable that
even in a very distant future,

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:14.300 align:middle line:90%
we wouldn't get tired of it?

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And this, indeed, is
the secret to the thing.

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:22.170 align:middle line:84%
This is why the Demon of
Impermanence is benevocent.

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:24.850 align:middle line:84%
Because it is
forgetting about things

00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:26.980 align:middle line:90%
that renews their wonder.

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:29.830 align:middle line:84%
Just think, when
you opened your eyes

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:34.280 align:middle line:84%
on the world for the
first time as a child,

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:36.332 align:middle line:90%
how brilliant colors were.

00:25:36.332 --> 00:25:39.140 align:middle line:90%
What a jewel the sun was.

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:41.380 align:middle line:90%
What marvels the stars.

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:44.950 align:middle line:84%
How incredibly alive
the trees were.

00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:48.782 align:middle line:84%
That's all because they
were new to your eyes.

00:25:48.782 --> 00:25:50.240 align:middle line:84%
Or in the same way,
you know how it

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:52.710 align:middle line:84%
is, you've been reading
a mystery story.

00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And you're looking
around the house

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.816 align:middle line:84%
and want something to read,
and you pick up an old mystery

00:25:56.816 --> 00:25:57.520 align:middle line:90%
story.

00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.210 align:middle line:84%
If you read it
years and years ago,

00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:01.900 align:middle line:84%
and you've forgotten all about
the plot, it still excites you.

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:05.980 align:middle line:84%
But if you remember the
plot, it doesn't excite you.

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And so by the dispensation
of forgetting,

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:12.930 align:middle line:90%
the world is constantly renewed.

00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And we are able to see it again
and again, and to love again

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:20.170 align:middle line:84%
and again you have
people to whom

00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:24.840 align:middle line:84%
we are deeply attached
and deeply fond,

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.650 align:middle line:90%
always with renewed intensity.

00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:32.737 align:middle line:84%
And without the contrast
all having seen them before,

00:26:32.737 --> 00:26:35.830 align:middle line:84%
before, before for always,
and always, and always.

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:44.160 align:middle line:84%
Another consequence of this is a
very curious realization to me.

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.810 align:middle line:84%
Remember that
question, who would I

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:49.080 align:middle line:84%
be if my mother had
married someone else?

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:53.650 align:middle line:90%


00:26:53.650 --> 00:26:55.860 align:middle line:84%
If I were you, we
often said, one

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:59.200 align:middle line:90%
might so easily have been you.

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.700 align:middle line:84%
I might so easily have been
born in China and India.

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:03.960 align:middle line:84%
Why do I feel that
the world is centered

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:06.747 align:middle line:84%
in this place as distinct
from some other place?

00:27:06.747 --> 00:27:09.080 align:middle line:84%
You jolly well know the world
is centered where you are.

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:11.880 align:middle line:90%


00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:17.142 align:middle line:84%
And this gives one a
very strange feeling

00:27:17.142 --> 00:27:19.990 align:middle line:84%
of the idea that other
people jolly well

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:22.430 align:middle line:84%
existed in the
same sense you do.

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's name is I. That's
what you call yourself.

00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:32.720 align:middle line:84%
So there will always
be I's in the world.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:39.810 align:middle line:84%
Every I is, in a way, the same
I. We all might be anyone else,

00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:41.700 align:middle line:90%
and there is no escape.

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:44.450 align:middle line:84%
It goes on, and
on, and on, and on.

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:46.580 align:middle line:84%
So long as there is
consciousness anywhere,

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:48.730 align:middle line:90%
there is I.

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:52.830 align:middle line:84%
You then, in a way, look out
through all I's, and that

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:58.101 align:middle line:84%
perhaps is the secret of the
great virtue of compassion.
