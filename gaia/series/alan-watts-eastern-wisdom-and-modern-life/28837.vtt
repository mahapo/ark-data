00:00:27.695 --> 00:00:35.990 align:middle line:90%


00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.980 align:middle line:84%
Alan Watts is a
scholar, lecturer,

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.430 align:middle line:84%
and the author of
many widely-read books

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.030 align:middle line:84%
on comparative
philosophy and religion.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:01:05.360 align:middle line:90%


00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.882 align:middle line:84%
>>It was as a result of
looking at paintings like this

00:01:09.882 --> 00:01:14.560 align:middle line:84%
that I first became interested
in eastern philosophy.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.480 align:middle line:84%
That was many years ago,
when I was a boy only

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.200 align:middle line:90%
about 14 years old.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that
grasped me and excited me

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:32.300 align:middle line:84%
about this vision of the world
was the astonishing sympathy

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.880 align:middle line:84%
and feeling for the
world of nature.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.940 align:middle line:84%
Think, for example,
of a painting

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:46.080 align:middle line:84%
like this, which is called
"Mountain After Rain,"

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:54.630 align:middle line:84%
a painting by the Chinese
artist Gao Kegong,

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.930 align:middle line:84%
showing the mist and
clouds drifting away

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.190 align:middle line:84%
after a wet night
of pouring rain.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.830 align:middle line:90%


00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's fascinating
for us to think

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:14.920 align:middle line:84%
that pictures of this kind are
not what we would call just

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.800 align:middle line:90%
landscape paintings.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.510 align:middle line:90%
They are also icons.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.250 align:middle line:84%
That is to say, they are a
religious and philosophical

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.960 align:middle line:90%
kind of painting.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.550 align:middle line:84%
We are used, of
course, in thinking

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.200 align:middle line:84%
about of iconographic or
religious paintings of thinking

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.150 align:middle line:84%
of pictures of human
figures, of angels

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.246 align:middle line:90%
and saints and divine beings.

00:02:34.246 --> 00:02:36.930 align:middle line:84%
But when the mind of
the Chinese expresses

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.280 align:middle line:84%
its religious feeling,
it expresses it

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.600 align:middle line:90%
in the objects of nature.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.710 align:middle line:90%


00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And their feeling for nature is
in one very important respect

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.330 align:middle line:90%
strangely different from ours.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.300 align:middle line:90%


00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And that is as a
result of the sensation

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.670 align:middle line:84%
that the human
being is not someone

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.960 align:middle line:84%
who stands apart
from nature and looks

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.655 align:middle line:84%
at it from an entirely
outside position,

00:03:05.655 --> 00:03:08.630 align:middle line:84%
but the human being
has himself the feeling

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.960 align:middle line:90%
of belonging right in nature.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And this is very
startlingly illustrated

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.560 align:middle line:84%
if you look at another panting--
this one by the great Song

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.670 align:middle line:84%
Dynasty painter, Ma Yuan--
called "Poet Drinking

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.670 align:middle line:90%
by Moonlight."

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.440 align:middle line:84%
You would think it was just a
landscape painting and puzzle,

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.860 align:middle line:90%
find the poet.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.630 align:middle line:84%
But if you look very
closely in the bottom part

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.380 align:middle line:84%
of the painting, you
will see him right there,

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.550 align:middle line:84%
drinking a cup of wine, sitting
at a table, with his boy

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.310 align:middle line:90%
attendant beside him.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.110 align:middle line:84%
I suppose that's the
equivalent of what

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.190 align:middle line:84%
would be a graduate
student for a professor

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.420 align:middle line:84%
of English literature
in these days.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.950 align:middle line:84%
But that tiny man,
lost in the landscape,

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.620 align:middle line:84%
is representative and
symbolic of the whole attitude

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.410 align:middle line:84%
of the Chinese mind and
of Chinese philosophy.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.770 align:middle line:84%
To the harmony of
man and nature-- man

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.250 align:middle line:84%
not dominating nature,
but fitting into it,

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.129 align:middle line:90%
and feeding perfectly at home.

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.300 align:middle line:90%


00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.750 align:middle line:84%
But you know, our attitude
is very strangely different.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And we constantly
use a phrase-- which,

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.500 align:middle line:84%
in the ears of Chinese people,
sounds very peculiar indeed.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.200 align:middle line:84%
We speak constantly of
the conquest of nature,

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.500 align:middle line:84%
the conquest of
space, the conquest

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.650 align:middle line:90%
of mountains like Everest.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And they would say to us, well,
what's the matter with you?

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.330 align:middle line:84%
Why must you be in such
a fight all the time

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.250 align:middle line:90%
with your environment?

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.280 align:middle line:84%
Aren't you grateful to the
mountain that it itself lifted

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.210 align:middle line:84%
you up when you got
to the top of it?

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.030 align:middle line:84%
Aren't you grateful to space
that it opens itself out

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.880 align:middle line:84%
for you so that you
can travel through it?

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.460 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think all the time
of getting into a fight with it?

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.610 align:middle line:84%
But that is indeed, isn't
it, our dominant feeling--

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.160 align:middle line:84%
that we are using science
and technology, the powers

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.220 align:middle line:84%
of electricity and
steel, to carry

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.210 align:middle line:84%
on a fight with
our external world

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.110 align:middle line:84%
and beat our surroundings into
submissions with bulldozers.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's also the same with
our attitude to our own nature,

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.329 align:middle line:84%
because we've been brought
up in a religio-philosophical

00:05:26.329 --> 00:05:28.370 align:middle line:84%
tradition which has taught
us, to a great extent,

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:29.770 align:middle line:90%
to mistrust ourselves.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.905 align:middle line:84%
That is to say, it has taught
us, as reasoning and willing

00:05:32.905 --> 00:05:39.810 align:middle line:84%
beings, to mistrust our
animal and instinctual nature.

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.110 align:middle line:84%
We have inherited a doctrine
of original sin, which

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.480 align:middle line:84%
tells us not to be
too friendly, to be

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:50.380 align:middle line:84%
very cautious with
our own human nature.

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.300 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
which is all very well,

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.240 align:middle line:84%
for we have indeed
achieved marvelous things

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:02.700 align:middle line:84%
by technological interference
with and alteration of nature.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.810 align:middle line:84%
But if this thing is carried
beyond a certain point,

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.700 align:middle line:84%
it gets us into
very serious trouble

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.250 align:middle line:84%
indeed, as a result
of what I would

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.782 align:middle line:84%
call the law of
diminishing returns.

00:06:13.782 --> 00:06:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's something like
this, to illustrate it

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.680 align:middle line:90%
in a very simple way.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.392 align:middle line:84%
Supposing you start
mistrusting your own senses,

00:06:21.392 --> 00:06:22.850 align:middle line:84%
supposing you're
the sort of person

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.402 align:middle line:84%
who, when you go out for
a walk in the morning,

00:06:25.402 --> 00:06:26.610 align:middle line:90%
you're going down the market.

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And you wonder, did I
turn off the gas stove?

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And you've only gone a
few paces from your house,

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.690 align:middle line:84%
and you think you must go back
and take a look at the kitchen

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:36.341 align:middle line:84%
and see if you really
did turn it off.

00:06:36.341 --> 00:06:38.090 align:middle line:84%
So back you go, and
you open the back door

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.620 align:middle line:90%
and look in the kitchen.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.030 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you did turn it off.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.160 align:middle line:84%
So you close the back
door, and off you go again.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And then, a few
places out, you think,

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.010 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if I really
saw correctly.

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.230 align:middle line:90%
Did I look carefully enough?

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And at that point you break
down and go back again.

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:53.643 align:middle line:84%
The more careful
you're going to be,

00:06:53.643 --> 00:06:55.590 align:middle line:84%
you're never going
to get out shopping.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.989 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
be tied in a bind.

00:06:58.989 --> 00:07:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And although you may
say, well, that's only

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.654 align:middle line:84%
the sort of thing a very
stupid person indeed

00:07:02.654 --> 00:07:05.440 align:middle line:84%
would do, as a
matter of fact, this

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:09.560 align:middle line:84%
is what our culture is
beginning to carry on

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.390 align:middle line:90%
in very big dimensions.

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:18.040 align:middle line:84%
For example, we are privileged
in the United States

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.690 align:middle line:84%
to enjoy freedom in a way that
many other people in the world

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:23.106 align:middle line:90%
don't have it.

00:07:23.106 --> 00:07:27.110 align:middle line:84%
Yet at the same time, we
are very anxious to be sure

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:31.220 align:middle line:84%
that our freedom
won't be abused.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And we keep saying when
somebody does something

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.150 align:middle line:84%
that is an abuse
of freedom, there

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.000 align:middle line:90%
ought to be a law against it.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And so hundreds and
thousands of laws

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:44.070 align:middle line:84%
are put into effect
to prevent people

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:46.720 align:middle line:90%
from abusing their freedom.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And so much legislation involves
the most complicated processes

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.810 align:middle line:84%
of record keeping-- as, for
example, the records you have

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:56.440 align:middle line:84%
to send in every
April to be sure

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.654 align:middle line:84%
you didn't cheat on
your financial affairs.

00:07:58.654 --> 00:08:01.195 align:middle line:84%
Records, which have become more
and more and more complicated

00:08:01.195 --> 00:08:04.650 align:middle line:84%
so that nowadays sending in an
ordinary individual income tax

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:07.390 align:middle line:84%
return is said to be as
complicated as extracting

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:12.560 align:middle line:84%
the cube root of a
complicated number.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And the net result
of our anxiety

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:19.030 align:middle line:84%
to write down just exactly
and to the last hair

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:22.230 align:middle line:84%
so that some shyster lawyer
won't find a loophole, exactly

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:25.250 align:middle line:84%
and to the last hair what
we may and may not do.

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:28.120 align:middle line:84%
The net result of this is it's
becoming increasingly difficult

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.180 align:middle line:90%
to do anything at all.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.929 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if you want to
start a business enterprise,

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:37.130 align:middle line:84%
if you want to create,
say, a nonprofit society,

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:38.390 align:middle line:90%
you have to hire lawyers.

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:40.789 align:middle line:84%
You have to have whole
staffs of secretaries

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:43.169 align:middle line:84%
to attend to the
bookkeeping, the records,

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:45.830 align:middle line:84%
the returns that must be
made to the government.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And some of our
great universities

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:49.150 align:middle line:84%
even have vice
presidents in charge

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.200 align:middle line:84%
of relations with
the government.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.114 align:middle line:84%
The same thing comes
out, for example also,

00:08:55.114 --> 00:08:58.800 align:middle line:84%
in our animosity to nature
in the sense of wanting

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.370 align:middle line:90%
to obliterate dissonance.

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:03.310 align:middle line:84%
We want to go faster
and faster everywhere

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:06.922 align:middle line:84%
we go, and so
annihilate the span

00:09:06.922 --> 00:09:11.290 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth between ourselves
and the place we want to reach.

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:13.210 align:middle line:84%
But what is the
ultimate result of this?

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:14.260 align:middle line:90%
Just think of it.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.610 align:middle line:84%
If you're getting faster and
faster from point to point

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:20.330 align:middle line:84%
and obliterating the
distance between points,

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.190 align:middle line:90%
two things happen.

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:25.870 align:middle line:84%
In the first place,
all points that

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:31.110 align:middle line:84%
are set next to each other--
by, say, jet propulsion--

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:33.640 align:middle line:90%
tend to become the same point.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.510 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the faster
you can get from Los Angeles

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:39.420 align:middle line:84%
to Hawaii, the more
Hawaii becomes exactly

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:40.410 align:middle line:90%
like Los Angeles.

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And therefore tourists
keep asking, well,

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:43.505 align:middle line:90%
has it been spoiled yet?

00:09:43.505 --> 00:09:48.592 align:middle line:84%
And by that they mean, is
it just exactly like home?

00:09:48.592 --> 00:09:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And furthermore, if we begin
to think about our goals

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:57.590 align:middle line:84%
in life, as destinations, as
points to which we must get,

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:02.370 align:middle line:84%
it begins to cut out all that
makes the point worth having.

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:05.630 align:middle line:84%
It's like saying, well, instead
of giving you a full banana

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:09.980 align:middle line:84%
to eat, I will give you the
two precise ends of the banana.

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:14.340 align:middle line:84%
And that would not be, in any
sense, a satisfactory meal.

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:18.930 align:middle line:84%
That is what happens as we
tend to fight our environment,

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:22.795 align:middle line:84%
and to want to get rid of the
wonderful limitation of space

00:10:22.795 --> 00:10:25.650 align:middle line:90%
and distance.

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And you know, if we
carry this kind of thing

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:33.010 align:middle line:84%
to its ultimate extreme, we
get into a most extraordinary

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:35.230 align:middle line:84%
tangle, which I think I
could very well illustrate

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:36.610 align:middle line:90%
in this way.

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:40.540 align:middle line:84%
Let's go and have
a look over here

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:46.660 align:middle line:84%
at a sentence which has
been written on the board.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:52.320 align:middle line:84%
That is a sentence
which is behaving

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.650 align:middle line:84%
like we are behaving in
our mistrust of nature.

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:58.020 align:middle line:84%
That is a sentence which
fundamentally does not

00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.890 align:middle line:90%
trust itself.

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And it says of itself,
"This statement is false."

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:13.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, what do you see
funny about that?

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:16.800 align:middle line:84%
This sentence behaves in
an extremely peculiar way.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.230 align:middle line:84%
Because if it is true,
then it is not true.

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And if it's not
true, then that's

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.040 align:middle line:84%
what it says, that it
isn't true so it's true.

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.670 align:middle line:84%
So that if this statement
is true, it is false.

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And if it is false, it is
true, and so on and so on.

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:34.270 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the meaning of
the sentence is oscillating.

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:36.500 align:middle line:84%
It's shaking from true
to false, true to false,

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.640 align:middle line:90%
like an electric bell vibrating.

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And in other words,
you might say

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:45.780 align:middle line:84%
that this particular sentence
is suffering from anxiety.

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:49.270 align:middle line:84%
Or anxiety is the condition
that comes upon us when

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:52.310 align:middle line:84%
we fundamentally
mistrust ourselves,

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:55.370 align:middle line:84%
when we mistrust our own
nature, and are trying

00:11:55.370 --> 00:12:00.090 align:middle line:84%
to keep such a tight grip on
it that we start to tremble--

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:04.000 align:middle line:84%
as one's hand starts to
tremble if you become extremely

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.190 align:middle line:90%
anxious to hold it still.

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:08.440 align:middle line:90%


00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:14.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, Chinese thinking,
of which there are really

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:19.780 align:middle line:84%
two main currents-- the Taoist
current and the Confucian.

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:26.150 align:middle line:84%
Taoist, that's spelled
T-A-O-I-S-T, and Confucian.

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And both of these main
currents of Chinese thought

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:31.950 align:middle line:84%
agree on one
fundamental principle.

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And that is that
the natural world

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:38.110 align:middle line:84%
in which we live and
human nature itself

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:41.370 align:middle line:90%
must basically be trusted.

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:44.700 align:middle line:84%
They would say of a person who
can't trust his own nature,

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:49.000 align:middle line:84%
well, if you can't trust
your own nature, how can you

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.250 align:middle line:84%
trust your very
mistrusting of it?

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:54.560 align:middle line:84%
How do you know that
that's not wrong too?

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And so if you don't
trust your own nature,

00:12:56.630 --> 00:13:01.260 align:middle line:84%
you are as fundamentally
balled up as anyone can get.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:06.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's interesting to look
at the fundamental Chinese word,

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.120 align:middle line:84%
which we translate as "nature"
because it has a rather

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.960 align:middle line:84%
different meaning from
the word that we use.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:17.890 align:middle line:84%
In Chinese, "nature"
is written like this.

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:21.390 align:middle line:90%


00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:25.140 align:middle line:84%
You know that Chinese characters
are fundamentally pictures.

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And this first one is the
picture that used to be a face.

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:37.435 align:middle line:84%
And so it means
oneself, or of itself.

00:13:37.435 --> 00:13:40.480 align:middle line:90%


00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And the second
character, I don't

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:43.140 align:middle line:90%
know what this was originally.

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:44.810 align:middle line:84%
It's become now a
very abstract figure.

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:55.450 align:middle line:90%


00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:56.480 align:middle line:90%
That means soul.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:59.960 align:middle line:90%


00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:05.250 align:middle line:84%
And so the whole figure
means of itself soul.

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And we should give the
rough English equivalent

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:13.050 align:middle line:84%
of that as spontaneity-- that
which happens of itself, just

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:15.550 align:middle line:84%
in the same way, for
example, that your hair is

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:17.350 align:middle line:90%
growing by itself.

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:20.780 align:middle line:84%
Your heart is beating by itself,
so that if you feel your pulse,

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:23.080 align:middle line:84%
you get this funny
sensation of movement

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:26.040 align:middle line:84%
going on inside your
body, and you think, oh,

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:26.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm not doing that.

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:28.675 align:middle line:84%
That's something queer
going on inside me,

00:14:28.675 --> 00:14:31.200 align:middle line:90%
over which I have no control.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.370 align:middle line:84%
But when you come to think of
it, what is more fundamental,

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:36.610 align:middle line:84%
what is more
central to you, what

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:44.860 align:middle line:84%
is more the very middle of
yourself than your own heart?

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And so this idea of nature, that
which happens of itself soul,

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:53.510 align:middle line:84%
is a process which
is fundamentally not

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:57.457 align:middle line:84%
under our control, which
is happening all on its own

00:14:57.457 --> 00:14:59.540 align:middle line:84%
just as our breathing is
happening all on its own,

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:02.950 align:middle line:84%
and just as our heart beating
is happening all on its own.

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And the fundamental thought
of Taoist philosophy

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:10.870 align:middle line:84%
is that this self-soul
process has to be trusted.

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:13.670 align:middle line:84%
If you turn now to
Confucian ideas,

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:16.960 align:middle line:84%
we will find another
word that represents

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:20.590 align:middle line:90%
the basis of human nature.

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:31.060 align:middle line:84%
This word, written like this,
has a funny pronunciation.

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:34.950 align:middle line:84%
Although when we romanize
this word in English,

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:40.670 align:middle line:84%
we spell it J-E-N.
It's pronounced

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:46.530 align:middle line:84%
"ryun," sort of like rolling
an R-- or rather, saying R,

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:48.660 align:middle line:90%
but not rolling it.

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And this word is
the cardinal virtue

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:56.160 align:middle line:84%
in the whole system
of Confucian morality.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:01.580 align:middle line:84%
It's usually translated "human
heartedness," or "humanness."

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:04.020 align:middle line:84%
But when Confucius
was asked to give

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:07.880 align:middle line:84%
a precise definition
of it, he refused.

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:11.820 align:middle line:84%
He said, you have to feel
the meaning of this virtue.

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:15.450 align:middle line:84%
You must never
put it into words.

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And the wisdom of his attitude
about not defining jen

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:27.060 align:middle line:84%
is simply this--
that a human being is

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:30.740 align:middle line:84%
always greater than anything
he can say about himself,

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.710 align:middle line:84%
and anything he can
think about himself.

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:37.340 align:middle line:84%
If we formulate ideas
about our own nature,

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:40.100 align:middle line:84%
about how our own minds
and emotions work,

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:44.000 align:middle line:84%
those ideas are always
going to be quantitatively

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.630 align:middle line:84%
inferior-- that is to say,
far less complicated, far less

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:52.045 align:middle line:84%
alive, than the actual author
of the ideas themselves.

00:16:52.045 --> 00:16:54.120 align:middle line:90%
And that is us.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.120 align:middle line:84%
So there's something
about ourselves

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:59.150 align:middle line:84%
which we can never get at,
which we can never define,

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:02.467 align:middle line:84%
in just the same way that you
can't bite your own teeth.

00:17:02.467 --> 00:17:04.050 align:middle line:84%
You can't, without
to aid of a mirror,

00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:05.740 align:middle line:90%
look into your own eyes.

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:07.079 align:middle line:90%
You can't hear your own ears.

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And you can't make your own
hand catch hold of itself.

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:16.740 align:middle line:84%
So that you must,
basically, trust this.

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:21.150 align:middle line:84%
Confucius would say he would
rather trust human passions

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:23.089 align:middle line:84%
and instincts than
he would sometimes

00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:26.750 align:middle line:84%
trust human ideas
about what is right.

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:30.320 align:middle line:84%
For example, when
people go to war,

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:36.230 align:middle line:84%
they very often go to war about
who has the right ideology, who

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:38.715 align:middle line:84%
has the right of this
particular dispute,

00:17:38.715 --> 00:17:41.910 align:middle line:90%
and who has the wrong of it?

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And because there can be
no agreement, no compromise

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:49.410 align:middle line:84%
between principles
of right and wrong,

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:54.400 align:middle line:84%
ideological wars generally
tend to be vastly destructive.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:18:00.240 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, when we go to
war for simple, ordinary greed,

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:03.080 align:middle line:84%
because I'm greedy of another
people, of another nation,

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.970 align:middle line:90%
I want to carry off their goods.

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:07.920 align:middle line:90%
I want to carry off their women.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.170 align:middle line:84%
I will at least be sure,
in going to war with them,

00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:15.070 align:middle line:84%
that I don't destroy the
thing I want to possess.

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:26.870 align:middle line:84%
And so if we are then bound
to trust our own nature,

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:31.250 align:middle line:84%
this attitude of hands off, of
not interfering with oneself

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:34.150 align:middle line:84%
beyond a certain point,
is called-- again,

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:53.940 align:middle line:84%
in Laozi's Taoist
philosophy, this-- "wu wei."

00:18:53.940 --> 00:19:00.080 align:middle line:84%
This character means
no, not, or don't.

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's said to have
been originally based

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:08.380 align:middle line:84%
on a picture of bunches
of grass tied together,

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:16.130 align:middle line:84%
like this, indicating that
a certain area is taboo.

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:18.740 align:middle line:84%
You mustn't step on this
area, the ground is sacred.

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:21.620 align:middle line:84%
So "don't," "keep
off" is its meaning.

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's possible that
this was originally

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:34.150 align:middle line:84%
a drawing of a hand
over a bird, like this.

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:37.600 align:middle line:84%
So the meaning of this
is grasping a bird.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:41.166 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea is,
don't grasp the bird.

00:19:41.166 --> 00:19:44.347 align:middle line:84%
In other words, don't
clutch at what is living.

00:19:44.347 --> 00:19:46.970 align:middle line:90%


00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:50.700 align:middle line:84%
If, for instance,
you like sometimes

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.204 align:middle line:84%
little children
pick up a kitten.

00:19:52.204 --> 00:19:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And they're so eager
to hold the kitten,

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:54.480 align:middle line:90%
they squeeze it tightly.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And the kitty says, meow,
meow, and scratches the child

00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:57.860 align:middle line:90%
all over the place.

00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:59.890 align:middle line:90%
It's because he is loving it.

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:03.350 align:middle line:90%
He is grasping it too tightly.

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:10.355 align:middle line:84%
And so in the same way, we
have to allow all living things

00:20:10.355 --> 00:20:12.560 align:middle line:90%
to let go and manage themselves.

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.770 align:middle line:84%
Look, supposing
if, in drawing, I

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:19.370 align:middle line:84%
wanted to be absolutely certain
that my hand didn't go away

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:20.626 align:middle line:90%
from a line.

00:20:20.626 --> 00:20:22.230 align:middle line:90%
And oh, I began to get anxious.

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:23.354 align:middle line:90%
Is it going to go straight?

00:20:23.354 --> 00:20:25.665 align:middle line:84%
And so let's bring in
this hand to hold onto it.

00:20:25.665 --> 00:20:27.040 align:middle line:84%
Oh, let's send
this one straight.

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.830 align:middle line:84%
But now how can I be
sure my left hand's

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:29.737 align:middle line:90%
going to stay still?

00:20:29.737 --> 00:20:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the right one will
have to catch hold of it.

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:33.111 align:middle line:90%
And then we're in a total mess.

00:20:33.111 --> 00:20:38.130 align:middle line:90%


00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:45.980 align:middle line:84%
But you see, we in
the West are basically

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:52.870 align:middle line:84%
afraid that if we
trust our own nature,

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:56.460 align:middle line:90%
everything will turn into chaos.

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:59.040 align:middle line:84%
We're afraid, as it
were, not to keep

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.390 align:middle line:84%
holding a club over
our heads, to keep

00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:03.830 align:middle line:84%
watching on our instincts
and our passions

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:07.774 align:middle line:84%
and our so-called
uncivilized animal

00:21:07.774 --> 00:21:11.105 align:middle line:84%
natures, fearing that
they will go awry.

00:21:11.105 --> 00:21:14.700 align:middle line:90%


00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:21.770 align:middle line:84%
But you know, when you let
go of that grip on yourself,

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:26.350 align:middle line:84%
sometimes astounding
things happen.

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:28.652 align:middle line:90%
You get out of your own light.

00:21:28.652 --> 00:21:31.860 align:middle line:84%
You're functioning all
together in one piece.

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:34.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, after all, a
person who is basically

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:36.670 align:middle line:84%
divided against himself,
who is in inner conflict

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:39.190 align:middle line:84%
and is trying to go in
two directions at once?

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:40.100 align:middle line:90%
He can't go anywhere.

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:42.980 align:middle line:84%
He'd just have to
sit and dither.

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:47.680 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if I'm going all in
one direction, then at least

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:48.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm going.

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And even if I'm going
in the wrong way,

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.456 align:middle line:90%
I can change the direction.

00:21:52.456 --> 00:21:54.375 align:middle line:84%
But if I'm trying to
go two ways at once,

00:21:54.375 --> 00:21:55.583 align:middle line:90%
I don't get anywhere at all.

00:21:55.583 --> 00:21:58.830 align:middle line:90%


00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:02.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, artists in
the Far East have

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:07.990 align:middle line:84%
made a great deal of what they
call the controlled accident--

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:13.170 align:middle line:84%
marvelous things which happen
as surprises when an office does

00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:18.260 align:middle line:84%
not try to dominate his medium,
but let his medium itself

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:21.170 align:middle line:90%
do some of the work.

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:25.566 align:middle line:84%
Take, for example, this
cigarette jar that I have here.

00:22:25.566 --> 00:22:31.370 align:middle line:90%


00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:36.670 align:middle line:84%
You see the glaze has
just been slopped on it,

00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:39.310 align:middle line:84%
with a swift motion
of the wrist.

00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:42.850 align:middle line:84%
And do you notice, as
I turn it, that there

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:45.340 align:middle line:84%
are all sorts of
little flecks of white

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:49.235 align:middle line:84%
inside the black outline
now, and little flecks

00:22:49.235 --> 00:22:58.130 align:middle line:84%
of black, like right here,
outside the main band of black?

00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:01.400 align:middle line:84%
It's incidental things
like this which,

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.310 align:middle line:84%
to the Chinese and
Japanese mind--

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:07.240 align:middle line:84%
and increasingly to our
own way of thinking--

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:12.210 align:middle line:90%
make the real beauty of things.

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:16.030 align:middle line:84%
For instance, consider
a shell like this.

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:19.967 align:middle line:90%


00:23:19.967 --> 00:23:21.550 align:middle line:84%
Here is an object
which any one of you

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:25.040 align:middle line:84%
would pick up on the
beach if you saw it.

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:27.540 align:middle line:90%
And yet, what does it represent?

00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:30.350 align:middle line:90%


00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:33.539 align:middle line:84%
If you saw painting with
markings on like that,

00:23:33.539 --> 00:23:35.830 align:middle line:84%
you might say, well, that's
not what I call a painting.

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:38.550 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't look like anything.

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And yet, as I say,
none of you would

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:43.970 align:middle line:84%
hesitate to pick that up and
treasure it if you found it.

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:50.140 align:middle line:84%
For it too, like the jar, is
a sort of controlled accident.

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And it is the art of
trusting the medium

00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:01.000 align:middle line:84%
to express itself along with
your own contribution to it

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.790 align:middle line:90%
as an artist.

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:07.410 align:middle line:84%
When this harmonious
relationship of man/nature

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:11.609 align:middle line:84%
is brought into play, we
get marvelous little objects

00:24:11.609 --> 00:24:12.150 align:middle line:90%
of this kind.

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:15.060 align:middle line:90%


00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And so in the same
way, if we can

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:26.140 align:middle line:84%
learn to trust our own
nature, we will, I think,

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:31.140 align:middle line:84%
be profoundly surprised that
things don't go out of control

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:34.560 align:middle line:84%
at all, but on the
contrary, suddenly

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.071 align:middle line:90%
come back into control.

00:24:37.071 --> 00:24:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Take, for example, a
very familiar instance.

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:41.790 align:middle line:90%


00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:45.650 align:middle line:84%
Supposing you're learning to
ride a bicycle, some of you

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:48.610 align:middle line:84%
will have known that
when you started out

00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:51.640 align:middle line:84%
this rather difficult
art, you found yourself

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:52.860 align:middle line:90%
immediately falling over.

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And your first instinct
was to turn the wheel right

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.670 align:middle line:84%
opposite the direction in
which you were falling.

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:02.600 align:middle line:84%
And in this way, you collapse
totally on the ground.

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:05.940 align:middle line:84%
It seemed to be common
sense to turn away

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:07.851 align:middle line:84%
from the direction in
which you were falling.

00:25:07.851 --> 00:25:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And yet, the thing you
have to learn to do

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.910 align:middle line:84%
is to turn the wheel in
the direction in which you

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:12.870 align:middle line:90%
are falling.

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And in this way,
you-- zip-- suddenly

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:17.520 align:middle line:84%
come up straight again,
and you're in control.

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:20.330 align:middle line:90%


00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:22.330 align:middle line:90%
You expected to fall.

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:24.540 align:middle line:90%
You went with the fall.

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:27.440 align:middle line:90%
And you came to yourself again.

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:31.360 align:middle line:84%
In precisely the
same way, when we

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:36.010 align:middle line:84%
go with our own nature,
our own inner feelings,

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:38.960 align:middle line:90%
we come into control of them.

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.740 align:middle line:90%
We don't lose control.

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:44.490 align:middle line:84%
If we fight them, we get in
that state of balled up-ness,

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:46.730 align:middle line:84%
of anxiety, of
dither, which makes

00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:48.790 align:middle line:84%
us incapable of doing
anything at all.

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And anxiety and dither which is
comparable to the whole problem

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:59.010 align:middle line:84%
of maintaining freedom in a
world like ours, a problem

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:02.070 align:middle line:84%
that we are in danger of losing
our freedom through being

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:04.215 align:middle line:90%
overanxious to preserve it.

00:26:04.215 --> 00:26:05.870 align:middle line:84%
Or think of another
illustration,

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:10.245 align:middle line:84%
those of you who live in
the East and the Middle West

00:26:10.245 --> 00:26:14.590 align:middle line:84%
are familiar, every winter,
with the problems of icy roads.

00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:19.900 align:middle line:84%
But any good driver knows that
when you skid on an icy road,

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:23.185 align:middle line:84%
you have to turn in the
direction of your skid,

00:26:23.185 --> 00:26:26.560 align:middle line:90%
and not against your skid.

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:29.100 align:middle line:84%
That again brings
you into control.

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:32.945 align:middle line:84%
To fight the trend of things,
to fight what the Chinese call

00:26:32.945 --> 00:26:36.355 align:middle line:84%
the Tao, the T-A-O,
the way of nature,

00:26:36.355 --> 00:26:39.330 align:middle line:84%
is to come into
conflict with nature

00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:42.430 align:middle line:84%
so that you can't
do anything at all.

00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:45.440 align:middle line:84%
Or another common
example, everybody

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:49.920 align:middle line:84%
who ever used a
sailing boat knows

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.270 align:middle line:84%
that if you are
going to move, you've

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:56.030 align:middle line:84%
got to keep the
wind in your sails.

00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:57.790 align:middle line:84%
Even if you want to
go against the wind,

00:26:57.790 --> 00:27:00.460 align:middle line:84%
you would never dream of
turning the boat directly

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:03.710 align:middle line:90%
into the path of the wind.

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:07.762 align:middle line:84%
So you always have in some way
to keep the wind behind you,

00:27:07.762 --> 00:27:09.470 align:middle line:84%
but when you want to
go against the wind,

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:10.511 align:middle line:90%
you don't fight the wind.

00:27:10.511 --> 00:27:11.640 align:middle line:90%
You use the wind.

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:15.100 align:middle line:84%
You, in other words, tack
against it at an angle,

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:18.200 align:middle line:84%
so that it blows
you into itself.

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And this is the fundamental
principle of Chinese

00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:25.600 align:middle line:84%
philosophy, which underlies that
starting manifestation of it

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:28.770 align:middle line:84%
in Japanese wrestling--
called "judo"--

00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:31.995 align:middle line:84%
where you overcome the
enemy not by opposing him,

00:27:31.995 --> 00:27:36.010 align:middle line:84%
but by using his own strength
to bring about his downfall.

00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:39.985 align:middle line:84%
For this is the philosophy
of bend and survive,

00:27:39.985 --> 00:27:44.880 align:middle line:84%
of the strength of weakness,
as the willow trees under snow

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.710 align:middle line:90%
go supple and drop the snow.

00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:48.700 align:middle line:84%
But the pine, with
its tough branch,

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:53.319 align:middle line:90%
piles up the snow and cracks.

00:27:53.319 --> 00:27:56.301 align:middle line:90%
