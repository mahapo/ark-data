00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.800 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm going to show you
an ancient Chinese method

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.450 align:middle line:90%
of divination.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.570 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps, you know that
divination is really

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.480 align:middle line:90%
a kind of fortune telling.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.860 align:middle line:84%
But this particular
kind of divination

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.480 align:middle line:84%
is based on what
some people believe

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.420 align:middle line:84%
to be the very oldest of all
the Chinese classics, "The Book

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.410 align:middle line:90%
of Changes."

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.440 align:middle line:84%
I say divination is something
like fortune telling,

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.250 align:middle line:84%
but it's a little bit more
highbrow than ordinary fortune

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.980 align:middle line:90%
telling.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.770 align:middle line:84%
One wouldn't, I think,
presume to ask so hoary a book

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.880 align:middle line:84%
of wisdom as the "I Ching" what
to bet on the stock market.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.990 align:middle line:84%
Rather, one asks
questions about one's

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.130 align:middle line:84%
spiritual, psychological
state or very great

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.010 align:middle line:90%
momentous decisions of life.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.220 align:middle line:84%
The very old and unorthodox
way of consulting

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.320 align:middle line:84%
"The Book of Changes" is to use
the stalks of the yarrow plant.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.000 align:middle line:84%
A number of stalks are
taken and divided at random,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.090 align:middle line:90%
and so calculations are made.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.700 align:middle line:84%
This is a rather long and
elaborate way of doing it.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And a not so ancient,
but equally respectable

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.370 align:middle line:90%
way, is to use Chinese coins.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, the kind of coins that
have a hole through the middle,

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.520 align:middle line:84%
so that you can carry them
on a string around your neck.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.440 align:middle line:84%
So if I would ask
"The Book of Changes"

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.220 align:middle line:84%
what is the best thing for
me in my present state,

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.730 align:middle line:84%
that is the sort
of question that

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.790 align:middle line:84%
would be appropriate under
circumstances like this.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.816 align:middle line:84%
So we take the coins,
and we shake them.

00:02:04.816 --> 00:02:06.960 align:middle line:90%
And drop them.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.770 align:middle line:84%
And according to the way
they fall, heads or tails,

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.470 align:middle line:84%
we get a positive or
a negative reading.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.340 align:middle line:84%
In this particular case,
we get a negative leading.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.840 align:middle line:84%
The symbol which records
the negative reading,

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.680 align:middle line:84%
being the drawing
of a broken line.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.890 align:middle line:90%


00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.110 align:middle line:84%
That line is called a
Yin, or negative line.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.750 align:middle line:90%


00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.590 align:middle line:90%
We do it again.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And this time, the
reading is again negative.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.950 align:middle line:90%
And we record it.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.370 align:middle line:90%


00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.275 align:middle line:90%
We shake them again.

00:02:49.275 --> 00:02:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And this time the
reading is positive.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:58.380 align:middle line:84%
And we record that by an
unbroken line or a yang line,

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.790 align:middle line:84%
Y-A-N-G, representing
the positive principle.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.395 align:middle line:84%
Again, and once more
the line is negative.

00:03:05.395 --> 00:03:12.080 align:middle line:90%


00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.050 align:middle line:84%
Again, and the line
is once more negative.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.050 align:middle line:90%


00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And then a final sixth time,
and the line is positive.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:34.660 align:middle line:90%


00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:41.000 align:middle line:90%
And so we get this figure.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And in order to
know what it means,

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.180 align:middle line:84%
we have to take a look at a
very, very ancient diagram,

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.180 align:middle line:90%
which may be familiar to you.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:04:00.170 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps, you've seen this
diagram on Chinese bowls

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.190 align:middle line:84%
or jewelry sometimes,
or carving in jade.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:11.780 align:middle line:84%
This is called the bagua
or the eight trigrams.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.290 align:middle line:84%
In the center of the
design, you see this figure,

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.870 align:middle line:84%
which maybe familiar
to some of you

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.990 align:middle line:84%
as the trademark of the
Northern Pacific Railroad.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.890 align:middle line:84%
But actually, it's
meaning in China

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.810 align:middle line:84%
is the symbol all of these
two fundamental principles,

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.940 align:middle line:84%
the negative and the positive,
the yang and the yin,

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.160 align:middle line:84%
which are held to
lie at the root

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.530 align:middle line:90%
of all phenomena in the world.

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.680 align:middle line:84%
The ward yang,
which is represented

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.590 align:middle line:84%
by this comma or
fish that is white,

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.380 align:middle line:84%
means the south or bright
side of a mountain.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And then yin, Y-I-N
we Romanized that,

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.820 align:middle line:84%
means the shady or dark
side of a mountain.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And thus respectively,
they're called

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.310 align:middle line:84%
the male and the
female principles.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:02.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, you'll
obviously notice that

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.370 align:middle line:84%
with the symbolism of the light
and dark side of a mountain

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.720 align:middle line:84%
that you can't have a
mountain with only one side.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.740 align:middle line:84%
The two sides must
always go together.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.570 align:middle line:84%
And so in the same
way, the Chinese

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.700 align:middle line:84%
feel that the positive
and the negative,

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.550 align:middle line:84%
the light and the dark,
the male and the female,

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.600 align:middle line:84%
the auspicious and
inauspicious, always

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.180 align:middle line:90%
go together in human life.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.720 align:middle line:84%
Because one cannot be
distinguished without

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.770 align:middle line:90%
the other.

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.010 align:middle line:84%
In the second
chapter of his book,

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.150 align:middle line:84%
the old philosopher Laozi, whom
I have mentioned many times

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.730 align:middle line:84%
in these programs, says when
all the world recognizes beauty

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.270 align:middle line:84%
to be beautiful, there
is already ugliness.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.800 align:middle line:84%
When all the world
recognizes good to be good,

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.660 align:middle line:90%
there is already evil.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:54.440 align:middle line:84%
Thus, to be and not
to be arise mutually.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And you can say that to
be is the principal yang,

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:01.790 align:middle line:84%
and not to be the principal
yin, respectively,

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.170 align:middle line:90%
the positive and the negative.

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And now, outside
the rotating figure

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:11.480 align:middle line:84%
of the positive and
negative principles,

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.290 align:middle line:84%
you will find these
eight trigrams,

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:18.040 align:middle line:84%
trigrams meaning
symbols of three lines.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And here, you will see the
broken and unbroken lines,

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.540 align:middle line:84%
such as I drew when I was
consulting the oracle.

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.240 align:middle line:84%
The broken being
the yin lines and

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.920 align:middle line:84%
the unbroken, yang
or positive lines.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And these trigrams represent
the eight fundamental principles

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.960 align:middle line:84%
or elements which, according
to this "Book of Changes,"

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.680 align:middle line:84%
are involved in
every life situation.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.340 align:middle line:84%
For example, the one at the
top means heaven or sky.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.190 align:middle line:90%
The one below means Earth.

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:56.580 align:middle line:90%
This is the father.

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.060 align:middle line:90%
This is the mother.

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.920 align:middle line:84%
Over the side, for example,
this one means fire.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And over here, that
one, means water.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And as you will see, we
derived two of these trigrams.

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:15.950 align:middle line:84%
The point of the oracle being
that every situation in life

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:21.850 align:middle line:84%
is a combination of two of these
principles in preponderance.

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And the ones that we have here
is this one repeated twice.

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And this one has the
meaning of a mountain,

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:34.270 align:middle line:90%
a mountain over a mountain.

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:39.040 align:middle line:90%


00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are 64
possible combinations

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:44.660 align:middle line:84%
of these eight
trigrams, which makes

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.225 align:middle line:84%
the meaning of each combination
pretty difficult to remember.

00:07:47.225 --> 00:07:49.350 align:middle line:84%
So we'd better go and look
at "The Book of Changes"

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:54.000 align:middle line:84%
itself, and see what it has to
say about this particular one,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.830 align:middle line:84%
what advice the oracle
would want to give me

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:03.660 align:middle line:84%
in answer to my question
about my present situation.

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:08.040 align:middle line:84%
The mountain over the mountain
happens to be-- let's see,

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:12.170 align:middle line:90%
that's number 52.

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:15.850 align:middle line:84%
The figure of the mountain,
of course, has a symbolism.

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:19.840 align:middle line:84%
And it means the idea of
quietness or keeping still.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And so when we
have keeping still,

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:27.400 align:middle line:84%
quietness above quietness,
we get a whole emblem

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:31.990 align:middle line:90%
whose meaning is profound calm.

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:36.159 align:middle line:84%
And so the oracle
says, keeping still.

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:40.510 align:middle line:84%
Keeping his back still so that
he no longer feels his body.

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:44.630 align:middle line:84%
He goes into his courtyard,
and does not see his people.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:47.430 align:middle line:90%
No blame.

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Mountains standing
close together,

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:54.460 align:middle line:84%
the image of keeping still,
thus the superior man

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:59.650 align:middle line:84%
does not permit his thoughts
to go beyond his situation.

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:01.780 align:middle line:90%
The heart thinks constantly.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:03.860 align:middle line:90%
This cannot be changed.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:07.590 align:middle line:84%
But the movements of the heart,
that is a man's thoughts,

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:11.490 align:middle line:84%
should restrict themselves
to the immediate situation.

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:17.459 align:middle line:84%
All thinking that goes beyond
this only makes the heart sore.

00:09:17.459 --> 00:09:19.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can see that that's
pretty generalized advice.

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:22.650 align:middle line:90%


00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's appropriate, in
a way, to the question.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.420 align:middle line:84%
Because the question was
vague, and the answer is vague.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:33.510 align:middle line:84%
But the symbolism of
this answer is simply

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:37.010 align:middle line:84%
that sitting so as to
keep one's back still,

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:41.180 align:middle line:84%
so that one's back is not
noticed, is self-forgetfulness.

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And keeping one's thoughts
to the immediate situation

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:51.010 align:middle line:84%
means the practice of meditation
or calmness or quietness.

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
I'm advised to do.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.090 align:middle line:90%
It's good advice.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:58.920 align:middle line:84%
Now you may say, well, this
is a thoroughly crazy way

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.056 align:middle line:84%
of coming at
decisions, especially

00:10:01.056 --> 00:10:03.180 align:middle line:84%
if I were to ask something
more specific than this.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:05.850 align:middle line:84%
If I had asked advice
on some momentous

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:08.070 align:middle line:84%
decision I had to made,
we would naturally

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:10.630 align:middle line:84%
say from our modern
scientific point of view

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:15.930 align:middle line:84%
that flipping coins to come
to the great decisions of life

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:19.110 align:middle line:84%
is the stupidest thing
we could possibly do.

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:22.820 align:middle line:84%
After all, it neglects
for rational cogitation

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:25.820 align:middle line:90%
about our situations.

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:30.002 align:middle line:84%
We would say, well,
it takes no account

00:10:30.002 --> 00:10:31.210 align:middle line:90%
of the data in the situation.

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:33.900 align:middle line:90%


00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:37.010 align:middle line:84%
It makes no
intelligent assessment

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:39.010 align:middle line:90%
of the probabilities.

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And before we make any
important decision,

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:43.930 align:middle line:84%
we think over all
the factors involved.

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:47.010 align:middle line:84%
We balance the pros
against the cons.

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:52.190 align:middle line:84%
We balance assets against
deficit, and so on.

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:55.060 align:middle line:84%
We go into the situation
and think it out thoroughly.

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, what could be
more superstitious than relying

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:01.690 align:middle line:84%
upon some oracle
that has entirely

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:04.410 align:middle line:84%
to do with the purely chance
falling of the coins that

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:08.650 align:middle line:84%
have no relation to
the problem whatsoever?

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:10.690 align:middle line:84%
That's our contemporary
point of view

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:13.045 align:middle line:84%
about all methods of
fortune telling divination,

00:11:13.045 --> 00:11:15.030 align:middle line:90%
so on and so forth.

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:17.150 align:middle line:90%
But now look.

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:19.880 align:middle line:84%
Someone who believed
in this system,

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:24.910 align:middle line:84%
an old fashioned Chinese,
might say to us, but listen.

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:31.140 align:middle line:84%
First of all, when you estimate
the data, when you consider

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:34.800 align:middle line:84%
the facts that are involved
in any particular decision,

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.880 align:middle line:84%
how do you know exactly
what facts are involved?

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.440 align:middle line:84%
After all, you're going
to sign a contract.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.555 align:middle line:84%
And the facts you
think about that

00:11:44.555 --> 00:11:46.745 align:middle line:84%
are relevant to this
contract are the state

00:11:46.745 --> 00:11:49.370 align:middle line:84%
of your own business, the state
of the other fellow's business,

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:52.450 align:middle line:84%
the prospects, the market,
and so on and so forth.

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:55.060 align:middle line:84%
But something that you may
never have considered at all

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:58.215 align:middle line:84%
may enter into the situation
and change it utterly.

00:11:58.215 --> 00:12:00.340 align:middle line:84%
The man with whom you're
going to make the contract

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:03.720 align:middle line:84%
may slip on a banana
skin, and so hurt his head

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.590 align:middle line:84%
and become inefficient
in business.

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:08.230 align:middle line:84%
How would anyone ever think
of such an eventuality

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:12.560 align:middle line:84%
in taking a sane and rational
view of the situation?

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.290 align:middle line:84%
Or he might say
to us, how do you

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:17.860 align:middle line:84%
know when you've
got in enough data?

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:20.700 align:middle line:84%
After all, the data,
the causes, the problems

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.950 align:middle line:84%
involved in any
particular situation

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:25.580 align:middle line:90%
are virtually infinite.

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:28.680 align:middle line:84%
And as a matter fact,
you stop getting

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.390 align:middle line:84%
in data, stop
getting information

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:36.600 align:middle line:84%
as to how to solve a problem,
either when you're tired of it

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.930 align:middle line:84%
or when the time comes
to act and you haven't

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:41.320 align:middle line:90%
time to collect any more data.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And he would say,
that is just as

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:45.560 align:middle line:90%
irrational as flipping coins.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:49.110 align:middle line:84%
Because you decide when
to stop investigating

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:51.590 align:middle line:90%
in a very arbitrary way.

00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:56.270 align:middle line:84%
So are you really very
much more ahead of us?

00:12:56.270 --> 00:13:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, we could say, what
about probabilities?

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.800 align:middle line:84%
After all, we rely a
great deal on statistics

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.000 align:middle line:90%
in order to make decisions.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.940 align:middle line:84%
And he would say, again
about statistics, yes.

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:11.070 align:middle line:84%
Statistics are
all very well when

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:13.760 align:middle line:84%
you want to know what a lot
of people are going to do.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.260 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you
flip a coin, you

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.810 align:middle line:84%
know that if you flip
a coin 100 times,

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:20.700 align:middle line:84%
there is going to be
quite a probability

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:23.450 align:middle line:84%
that you will toss half of the
time heads, half of the time

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:24.400 align:middle line:90%
tails.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:27.700 align:middle line:84%
1,000 tosses, and
you will get nearer

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.270 align:middle line:90%
to an exact half and half.

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:32.865 align:middle line:84%
But each individual
toss, the chance

00:13:32.865 --> 00:13:35.770 align:middle line:84%
is 50-50 whether it
will be heads or tails.

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:39.910 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you may
have tossed 999 times.

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And you may have had
400 tails tosses.

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:47.470 align:middle line:84%
You may have had the
rest heads tosses.

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:50.150 align:middle line:84%
So the probability will
be on the thousands

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:52.110 align:middle line:84%
that it will go to
tails, because that's

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:53.860 align:middle line:90%
had the lesser number of tosses.

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:56.890 align:middle line:84%
About actually, your chance
on it coming up heads or tails

00:13:56.890 --> 00:14:00.810 align:middle line:84%
at that particular
moment is, again, 50-50.

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And the probability
really tells you nothing.

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And so in the same way with the
actuarial tables of insurance

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.170 align:middle line:84%
companies, they will
say the average lifespan

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:14.170 align:middle line:90%
of an adult male is 65 years.

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:16.340 align:middle line:84%
But on any individual
case, these tables

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:20.030 align:middle line:84%
do not tell us when
I am going to die.

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And so our Chinese
critic might say, well?

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:27.460 align:middle line:90%


00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:34.130 align:middle line:84%
So you see, I myself am of a
somewhat skeptical temperament.

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:38.240 align:middle line:84%
And I very much doubt
in fact whether this way

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:42.890 align:middle line:84%
of coming at decisions
really worked.

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:44.440 align:middle line:90%
Or let us put it this way.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.640 align:middle line:84%
We can never really
prove whether any method

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.920 align:middle line:84%
of coming to decisions
really works.

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:51.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I may make
a foolish decision.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And I call it foolish,
because as a result of it,

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:54.760 align:middle line:90%
I get killed.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:57.230 align:middle line:84%
But there's absolutely
no way of showing

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.110 align:middle line:84%
that my getting
killed at that moment

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:01.244 align:middle line:84%
didn't preserve me
from a worse fate,

00:15:01.244 --> 00:15:02.660 align:middle line:84%
from making mistakes
that involved

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:05.250 align:middle line:90%
the lives of many other people.

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:09.020 align:middle line:84%
If I so-called succeed by
making the right decision

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.710 align:middle line:84%
and I earn a! $1
million, there's

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:13.660 align:middle line:84%
no way of showing that this
isn't so bad for my character

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:16.610 align:middle line:84%
that it's the worst thing
that could possibly happen.

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:21.310 align:middle line:84%
So we never really know whether
the outcome of a decision

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:24.540 align:middle line:84%
is a failure or a success,
not in the long run.

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:27.140 align:middle line:84%
Because only the
unknown, what comes next,

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.050 align:middle line:84%
will show whether
it was good or bad.

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And the unknown stretches
infinitely into the future.

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:37.770 align:middle line:84%
But it seems to me
that the importance

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:43.450 align:middle line:84%
of this old Chinese book
of divination is two-fold.

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:45.282 align:middle line:84%
First of all, there's
a bad side to it,

00:15:45.282 --> 00:15:47.860 align:middle line:84%
a distinct disadvantage
in Chinese culture.

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:52.360 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese came so much to
rely on "The Book of Changes,"

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:55.910 align:middle line:84%
and to use its
system of symbols--

00:15:55.910 --> 00:16:00.190 align:middle line:84%
those trigrams I showed
you-- for classifying

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:03.520 align:middle line:84%
all natural phenomena,
that in the course of time,

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.660 align:middle line:90%
it became a very rigid thing.

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And it excluded the
perception of novelty.

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:12.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, the warning and the
advantage to us in that is we

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:15.570 align:middle line:84%
can do the same thing
with scientific method.

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:18.860 align:middle line:84%
There are certain
kinds of personality

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:22.320 align:middle line:84%
who become very rigid in
their scientific ideas

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:25.090 align:middle line:84%
and simply automatically
exclude certain possibilities,

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:28.740 align:middle line:84%
because they don't conform
with alleged scientific dogma.

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:33.090 align:middle line:84%
Take for example what we call
ESP or Extrasensory Perception.

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:36.120 align:middle line:84%
I rather call it extraordinary
sensory perception.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:41.170 align:middle line:84%
But still there is
good reason to believe

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:43.920 align:middle line:84%
that there is extremely
strong evidence for something

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.350 align:middle line:90%
of this kind of occurring.

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And yet, many scientific people
will ignore that evidence,

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:51.180 align:middle line:84%
because they say things like
that simply can't happen.

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:53.205 align:middle line:84%
And that is to fall
into the same rut

00:16:53.205 --> 00:16:58.260 align:middle line:84%
that the Chinese fell into when
they relied to meticulously

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.440 align:middle line:84%
upon the classification
of the world

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:04.000 align:middle line:84%
and of events found in
"The Books of Changes."

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.829 align:middle line:84%
But there's a positive
side to the picture.

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:09.490 align:middle line:84%
For this "Book of
Changes" is founded

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:15.290 align:middle line:84%
on a view life, which is
very suggestive to us which

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:17.859 align:middle line:84%
is in accord with
certain points of view

00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:22.460 align:middle line:84%
that now develop
in our own science,

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:26.470 align:middle line:84%
a way of looking at life
which sees not so much

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:30.450 align:middle line:84%
the causal relationship
between events

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:33.710 align:middle line:90%
as the pattern of events.

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:38.300 align:middle line:84%
Let me try and show
that difference.

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:43.700 align:middle line:84%
When we think of causality, we
think chiefly of the way events

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:47.930 align:middle line:90%
are determined by their past.

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:52.180 align:middle line:84%
It's as if events
were a lot of marbles.

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:54.970 align:middle line:84%
And they're thrown together, and
they knock each other around.

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:57.170 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, in
tracing the movement

00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:59.940 align:middle line:84%
of any particular marble,
we try to find out

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:02.220 align:middle line:90%
which other marbles knocked it.

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And so trace it back,
and back, and back.

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And until quite recent
times, the whole view

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:12.800 align:middle line:84%
of Western science was based
on the idea of causality,

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:17.750 align:middle line:84%
how things are influenced
by past things.

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:20.620 align:middle line:84%
But the point of view that
underlies "The Book of Changes"

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:23.270 align:middle line:84%
the Chinese never really
applied to their science.

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:25.110 align:middle line:84%
They applied it
rather to their art

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:27.750 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps their
philosophy of law.

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:30.610 align:middle line:84%
But the point of view
here is different.

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:35.090 align:middle line:84%
Instead of understanding events
by relation to past causes,

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:38.050 align:middle line:84%
it understands
events by relation

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:40.830 align:middle line:90%
to their present pattern.

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And in other words,
it comprehends them

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:47.710 align:middle line:84%
by taking a total
view instead of what

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:50.890 align:middle line:90%
we might call a linear view.

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:56.270 align:middle line:84%
If, for example, we can
find a suitable analogy

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:58.300 align:middle line:84%
for the Western way
of looking at things,

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:02.970 align:middle line:84%
we might say it is understanding
events in accordance

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:04.910 align:middle line:90%
with the order of words.

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:08.740 align:middle line:84%
For example, I can say,
"this dog has no bark,"

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:12.160 align:middle line:84%
and then, "this
tree has no bark."

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:15.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, the meaning of bark
in these two sentences

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:18.110 align:middle line:84%
is determined by what
went before them.

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:20.900 align:middle line:84%
I make sounds before
I say the sound bark.

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:24.580 align:middle line:84%
Before I say "bark," I
say, "this dog has no."

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:26.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, if I want to
know what bark means,

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:30.660 align:middle line:84%
I have to go back to what
happened in the past.

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:35.570 align:middle line:84%
But if you take the order not of
words, but what I would rather

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:39.700 align:middle line:84%
call the order of design, we get
a rather different situation.

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:43.740 align:middle line:84%
Supposing I draw
two small circles.

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:49.150 align:middle line:90%


00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And these correspond
to the two words bark.

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:57.080 align:middle line:90%
They're both the same.

00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:04.490 align:middle line:84%
But now, supposing
a design arises

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:05.670 align:middle line:90%
around those two circles.

00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:16.720 align:middle line:90%


00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And then at once, we see
that in that context,

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:25.490 align:middle line:84%
those two original circles
have quite different meaning.

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:31.140 align:middle line:84%
But you see their relationship
to their meeting all at once.

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:33.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, imagine supposing
these designs had not

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:37.010 align:middle line:84%
been drawn by a brush line
after line after line,

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:39.860 align:middle line:84%
but had appeared
altogether at once as you

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:42.080 align:middle line:84%
see the image appear
when you're developing

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:43.850 align:middle line:90%
a photographic plate.

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:45.740 align:middle line:84%
Then you would see
that the meaning

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:50.550 align:middle line:84%
of each part of the design
is relative to the rest of it

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:53.600 align:middle line:84%
as you see it now
at this moment.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And so in the same way,
the fundamental philosophy

00:20:56.540 --> 00:21:00.100 align:middle line:84%
of "The Book of Changes"
and of the Chinese idea

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:02.790 align:middle line:84%
of the relationship
between events

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:07.450 align:middle line:84%
is to understand every event
in its present context.

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:11.450 align:middle line:84%
Not understanding it so much as
we do by what went before it,

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:16.365 align:middle line:84%
but rather understanding it
in terms of what goes with it.

00:21:16.365 --> 00:21:18.970 align:middle line:84%
Thus, the idea of
"The Book of Changes"

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:22.020 align:middle line:84%
is to reveal through its
symbols the total pattern

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:25.240 align:middle line:84%
of the moment when the question
is asked on the supposition

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:26.890 align:middle line:84%
that the pattern of
this moment governs

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:29.280 align:middle line:90%
even the tossing of the coins.

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:32.460 align:middle line:84%
Now then, the
interesting comparison

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:36.720 align:middle line:84%
that arises out of this is
that because we in the West

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.590 align:middle line:84%
have tended to understand
events in accordance

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:42.710 align:middle line:84%
with the order of
words, in accordance

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:45.690 align:middle line:84%
with the order of
causality, we have

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:50.380 align:middle line:84%
evolved a conception of
nature as based on law.

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:53.010 align:middle line:84%
In other words, when we
ask for the explanation

00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:56.560 align:middle line:84%
of any natural phenomenon,
we look for that explanation

00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:02.870 align:middle line:84%
in words, in a formulation
that will describe a law.

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:05.650 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
the Chinese have not

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:09.190 align:middle line:84%
evolved the idea
of a law of nature,

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:13.550 align:middle line:84%
but something quite different,
but equally valid and equally

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:14.590 align:middle line:90%
useful.

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:16.155 align:middle line:84%
There is indeed
a word in Chinese

00:22:16.155 --> 00:22:19.920 align:middle line:84%
for law in very much
our sense of law.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:21.550 align:middle line:90%
It's a rather interesting word.

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:24.720 align:middle line:84%
Because as it was
originally written,

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.010 align:middle line:90%
it was a picture like this.

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:31.980 align:middle line:90%


00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:35.110 align:middle line:84%
That's a picture
of an iron cauldron

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:39.920 align:middle line:84%
and beside it, a
figure holding a knife.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:44.690 align:middle line:84%
This is the Chinese
word for law,

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:49.780 align:middle line:84%
T-S-E, "za," which most
corresponds to our idea of law.

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for this symbol
is that in ancient times,

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:58.260 align:middle line:84%
some of the old emperors
commanded the laws

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:01.720 align:middle line:84%
to be written on the iron
sacrificial cauldrons.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.930 align:middle line:84%
And when the people came
to offer sacrifice and put

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:05.560 align:middle line:84%
their offerings
into the cauldrons,

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:08.900 align:middle line:84%
they could read the law
written upon the cauldrons.

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:12.010 align:middle line:84%
But at the time when those
ancient emperors ordered

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:14.000 align:middle line:84%
the laws to be
written in this way,

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.750 align:middle line:84%
there were certain sage
and scholars who said, no.

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:20.430 align:middle line:84%
You shouldn't write
the laws down.

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:22.470 align:middle line:84%
Because if you
write the laws down,

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:24.900 align:middle line:84%
the people will develop
a litigious spirit.

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:28.260 align:middle line:84%
That is to say, they
will start quibbling.

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the property
of the order of nature

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:39.130 align:middle line:84%
is sometimes called,
in Chinese, not this.

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:41.700 align:middle line:84%
The expression
wu-tse-- "wu" meaning

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:46.870 align:middle line:84%
not-- is used, meaning
apparently lawless.

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:49.010 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't
really mean lawless.

00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:51.410 align:middle line:84%
For example, if
we go for a moment

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:56.430 align:middle line:84%
to Chinese ideas of
civil law, a good judge

00:23:56.430 --> 00:24:00.160 align:middle line:84%
does not base his decisions on
this kind of law, written down

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:00.900 align:middle line:90%
law.

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:04.170 align:middle line:84%
Because he knows that
no written law can

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:07.580 align:middle line:84%
apply to all the complex
multiplicity of circumstances

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:09.360 align:middle line:90%
with may arise.

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And so he bases his
decisions on what

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:16.295 align:middle line:84%
the Chinese call not
law, but justice.

00:24:16.295 --> 00:24:18.970 align:middle line:90%


00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:25.590 align:middle line:84%
This word is
pronounced "eee," "I."

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And justice, in the
sense, correspondents

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:31.430 align:middle line:90%
rather to our idea of equity.

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:35.460 align:middle line:84%
It is the sensibility for
order and reasonableness

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:38.020 align:middle line:84%
that is embodied
in an individual.

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:40.090 align:middle line:84%
He hasn't got it
clearly written down.

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:41.800 align:middle line:84%
But he is the sort
of person who is

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.810 align:middle line:84%
able to judge in any
particular circumstance

00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:48.520 align:middle line:84%
whether a certain decision
is fair or not fair.

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And they much rather
trust a man who

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:53.700 align:middle line:84%
has I in him than a man who
has a thorough knowledge

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:56.090 align:middle line:90%
of the rules.

00:24:56.090 --> 00:25:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And so we come thus
to a conception

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:05.460 align:middle line:84%
of the order of
nature that is one

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:08.370 align:middle line:84%
of the most important words
in the Chinese language.

00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And that is a word,
which originally

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:17.990 align:middle line:84%
meant the markings in
jade, the grain in wood,

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:20.130 align:middle line:90%
or the fiber in muscle.

00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:24.120 align:middle line:90%
And it's pronounced "lee."

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:30.240 align:middle line:84%
This is a character
then meaning really

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:33.520 align:middle line:84%
the basic fundamental
pattern of things.

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:36.440 align:middle line:84%
But such an image is used
as the markings in jade

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:40.490 align:middle line:84%
or the grain in wood, because
this is an extremely subtle

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:45.910 align:middle line:84%
complex pattern, a huge area of
events all happening together

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:50.870 align:middle line:84%
at once, which has to be taken
in at a glance in the same way

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:54.960 align:middle line:84%
as we take design in at a
glance, understood at a glance,

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:57.670 align:middle line:84%
and therefore is not
capable of formulation

00:25:57.670 --> 00:26:00.350 align:middle line:90%
in the order of words.

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And so, Li, meaning,
perhaps, organic pattern,

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:10.480 align:middle line:84%
is the fundamental Chinese
idea of the order of nature.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:17.560 align:middle line:84%
In other words, when
we think of beauty,

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:21.220 align:middle line:84%
we know very clearly what
is beautiful and what isn't.

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:23.990 align:middle line:84%
But it's absolutely
impossible to write down

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:27.270 align:middle line:84%
a set of laws and
rules as to how

00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:29.390 align:middle line:84%
one will create
beautiful objects.

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:32.200 align:middle line:84%
In mathematics, for example,
mathematicians often

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.960 align:middle line:84%
feel that certain equations,
certain expressions,

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.340 align:middle line:90%
are peculiarly beautiful.

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And mathematicians, because
they are meticulous people,

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:43.130 align:middle line:84%
try to think out exactly
why is this beautiful.

00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:46.070 align:middle line:84%
Could we make up
a rule for beauty?

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And yet they come
to the conclusion

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:52.150 align:middle line:84%
that if we could make up a rule,
and apply it in mathematics

00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:54.320 align:middle line:84%
and always by the
use of this rule

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.410 align:middle line:84%
get a beautiful
result, eventually

00:26:56.410 --> 00:27:00.070 align:middle line:84%
those results would cease to
impress us as being beautiful.

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:02.930 align:middle line:84%
They would become
sterile and dry.

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And so in the same way,
the order of nature,

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:11.130 align:middle line:84%
the order of justice, the order
of beauty are things which we

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:15.440 align:middle line:84%
can know in ourselves, but
we cannot write down in black

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:16.910 align:middle line:90%
and white.

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the
superior man is

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:23.980 align:middle line:84%
one who has the sensibility
for these things in himself.

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:25.803 align:middle line:90%
