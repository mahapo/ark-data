widely read books on comparative

00:00:46.386 --> 00:00:49.344 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:49.344 --> 00:01:07.120 align:middle line:90%


00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.810 align:middle line:84%
>>That is a way of demonstrating
the basic experience which

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.780 align:middle line:84%
underlies some of the major
forms of Oriental philosophy.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And actually, this
way of demonstrating

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.730 align:middle line:84%
it is taken from a kind of
Chinese and Japanese Buddhism

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.920 align:middle line:84%
called Zen, which I'm going to
be talking about quite a bit

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.220 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.220 align:middle line:84%
Because Zen is one of the
best examples of a philosophy,

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.780 align:middle line:84%
shall we call it, in which
this experience is dominant.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.210 align:middle line:84%
Zen, of course, is
a Japanese word.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:49.580 align:middle line:90%
And it's spelled Z-E-N.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.991 align:middle line:84%
And that is the Japanese way
of pronouncing the Chinese word

00:01:53.991 --> 00:01:54.490 align:middle line:90%
Ch'an.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.280 align:middle line:90%


00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And this, in turn,
is the Chinese way

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.330 align:middle line:84%
of pronouncing an Indian
Sanskrit word, Dhyana.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.889 align:middle line:90%


00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And Dhyana refers to
the kind of experience

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.940 align:middle line:84%
which has been represented
in this circle.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:27.570 align:middle line:84%
Another word for it would be
a second Sanskrit term, Sunya.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.560 align:middle line:90%


00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.500 align:middle line:84%
And the nearest we can
translation Sunya in English

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.330 align:middle line:90%
is emptiness or void.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.910 align:middle line:90%


00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And so we might say, this is
an experience of the void.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.780 align:middle line:90%


00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.672 align:middle line:84%
Before trying to explain
what this is-- and you know,

00:02:50.672 --> 00:02:52.130 align:middle line:84%
the funny thing
is, it really can't

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.300 align:middle line:84%
be explained because
it has to be felt.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.210 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a transformation
of one's basic feeling,

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.530 align:middle line:84%
one's basic
consciousness of life.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.560 align:middle line:84%
But I should mention first that
it is characteristic of Eastern

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.840 align:middle line:84%
philosophy to be based on
experience rather than ideas.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.100 align:middle line:84%
You see, philosophy
in the Western world,

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.680 align:middle line:84%
especially as it's taught in
our universities and academies,

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.310 align:middle line:90%
is mainly a matter of thinking.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.120 align:middle line:84%
It's a matter of
trying to arrive

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.860 align:middle line:84%
at certain clear, positive
ideas about the nature of man,

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.630 align:middle line:84%
the nature of the universe,
and so on and so forth.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And also, religion in the
West is somewhat similar

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.340 align:middle line:84%
because religion is
largely concerned

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.000 align:middle line:90%
with belief in certain ideas.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.970 align:middle line:84%
In these basic forms of Eastern
philosophy, on the other hand,

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.430 align:middle line:84%
such as Zen, which is
a kind of Buddhism,

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.160 align:middle line:84%
or Taoism, the basic
native philosophy of China,

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.220 align:middle line:84%
or in Vedanta, which
is the central form

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.060 align:middle line:84%
of Indian philosophy,
what is basic to

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:03.730 align:middle line:84%
them is not ideas, but a way of
experiencing, a way of feeling.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And this might be called,
as it is here, the void,

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.040 align:middle line:90%
demonstrated by this circle.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.860 align:middle line:84%
Because it is not a void
which is just emptiness.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.339 align:middle line:84%
This isn't the
idea that there are

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:22.920 align:middle line:84%
people in the backward
worlds of Asia

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:28.490 align:middle line:84%
who think that the universe
is ultimately nothing at all.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.100 align:middle line:84%
It is rather that
the void represents

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.910 align:middle line:90%
complete spiritual freedom.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.690 align:middle line:84%
Or you might say, if you
don't like the word spiritual,

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.860 align:middle line:90%
complete psychological freedom.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, I want
to try, if I can,

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.280 align:middle line:84%
to communicate to
you, to give you

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.050 align:middle line:84%
some idea of what
this experience is.

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.630 align:middle line:84%
In Japanese, in Zen,
it is called Satori.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.090 align:middle line:84%
I'll write that down,
it's an unfamiliar word.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:11.330 align:middle line:84%
S-A-T-O-R-I. And I like the
way that that's pronounced

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.430 align:middle line:90%
in southern Chinese.

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:20.930 align:middle line:90%
They pronounce it ng.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.940 align:middle line:84%
Because it's something that
happens to you suddenly.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, let me try,
if I can possibly,

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.990 align:middle line:84%
to put into some sort of
words what this experience is.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:39.120 align:middle line:84%
This experience, which so
far as they are concerned,

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.300 align:middle line:90%
is the objective of human life.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.850 align:middle line:90%


00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:49.560 align:middle line:84%
To get this is to understand
the meaning of human nature

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.910 align:middle line:90%
and destiny.

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.630 align:middle line:84%
Only because it's
a transformation

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:54.820 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, because
it's something you feel

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.520 align:middle line:84%
rather than something
you think, it

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.770 align:middle line:84%
is for this reason difficult
to put in the words.

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.390 align:middle line:84%
But it is as if you
saw quite suddenly--

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.580 align:middle line:84%
and indeed this experience
could have happened to you.

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.520 align:middle line:84%
It can come without
warning to anybody.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And so what I'm
going to be saying

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.040 align:middle line:84%
may strike a familiar
ring in some ears.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:21.890 align:middle line:84%
But it is as if quite suddenly
you became totally convinced

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.880 align:middle line:84%
that the way everything
is in this universe

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:30.950 align:middle line:84%
and at this moment
is absolutely right.

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's almost
putting it too weakly.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm not trying to talk
about a sort of Pollyanna

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.090 align:middle line:84%
feeling where we
say, well, this is

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:40.640 align:middle line:90%
the best of all possible worlds.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And everything, however
evil and however wrong,

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.280 align:middle line:84%
is going to work out
all right in the end,

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.680 align:middle line:84%
because it's a means to an
end in some master design.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying that.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:56.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying it is suddenly
feeling that everything

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:01.930 align:middle line:90%
is right the way it is now.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.440 align:middle line:84%
However appalling,
however terrible.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And you know it beyond
a shadow of doubt.

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:13.280 align:middle line:90%


00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.394 align:middle line:84%
There are two other aspects
to this experience as well.

00:07:17.394 --> 00:07:19.060 align:middle line:84%
And although you feel
them all together,

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:23.880 align:middle line:84%
we have to talk about them While
the first aspect is feeling

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:28.210 align:middle line:84%
that everything just as it is
is so right that you could say

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:32.950 align:middle line:84%
of it, this is why I'm alive,
this is what life's all about.

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:36.590 align:middle line:84%
The second is that
everything you see and feel

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.026 align:middle line:84%
seems to come to life
in an extraordinary way.

00:07:39.026 --> 00:07:40.400 align:middle line:84%
You feel the world
as you've seen

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.380 align:middle line:84%
it before will seem
almost in a dream.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.557 align:middle line:84%
But it is as if just
the ordinary things that

00:07:45.557 --> 00:07:47.890 align:middle line:84%
were confronting you, suddenly
went (WITH EMPHASIS) yah,

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:50.770 align:middle line:90%
and came alive.

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And the third aspect of it
is that you no longer feel

00:07:55.260 --> 00:08:01.140 align:middle line:84%
yourself and what you are
experiencing to be separated.

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:03.380 align:middle line:84%
Although you don't
lose the feeling

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:05.950 align:middle line:84%
of the outline of
your skin, you don't

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:10.050 align:middle line:84%
forget that I or Joe Dokes is
a possible name by which you

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:11.720 align:middle line:90%
can refer to yourself.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.250 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, it
suddenly seems to you

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:17.750 align:middle line:84%
that your skin is no longer
what divides you from the world,

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:19.830 align:middle line:90%
it's what joins you to it.

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:24.020 align:middle line:84%
What you see outside
you is also you.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:28.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, we ordinarily
restrict the idea of ego,

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:34.600 align:middle line:84%
of I-ness or of you-ness to some
sort of psychological entity

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:39.700 align:middle line:84%
or process inside us which
is in control of things.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.929 align:middle line:84%
And we identify ourselves with
a sort of controlling center.

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:45.970 align:middle line:90%


00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:49.820 align:middle line:84%
But in this experience, it is
as if that center were suddenly

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:53.940 align:middle line:84%
enlarged to include
the whole universe.

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:58.160 align:middle line:84%
You almost feel as if you were
God, except that in Eastern

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:03.290 align:middle line:84%
though, one doesn't think of God
as a kind of omnipotent person.

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:06.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are lots of
people in our asylums who say,

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:07.350 align:middle line:90%
well, I'm God.

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:09.140 align:middle line:84%
I always liked the
story of the woman

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:11.240 align:middle line:90%
who insisted that she was God.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.440 align:middle line:84%
And to humor her, someone
said, well, if you're God,

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.065 align:middle line:84%
will you please
explain how you managed

00:09:15.065 --> 00:09:17.720 align:middle line:84%
to create the
universe in six days?

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:21.200 align:middle line:90%
She said, I never talk shop.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.080 align:middle line:84%
It isn't feeling
God in that sense,

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.950 align:middle line:84%
as if you could do
anything, but it

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:31.487 align:middle line:84%
is feeling that you and
this whole world are one.

00:09:31.487 --> 00:09:34.110 align:middle line:90%


00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And that in this
experience of oneness,

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:40.500 align:middle line:84%
and the sudden coming
alive of everything,

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:43.210 align:middle line:84%
and the profound rightness--
that's the only word

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:46.550 align:middle line:84%
I can use-- the profound
rightness of each moment,

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:49.630 align:middle line:84%
of this moment, however
far it may seem to be short

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:56.090 align:middle line:84%
of one's ideals of
perfection, this is it.

00:09:56.090 --> 00:10:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And you say, having seen
this, I can die content.

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:03.335 align:middle line:90%
This is what it was all about.

00:10:03.335 --> 00:10:06.520 align:middle line:90%


00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, you might think
at the same time

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:14.300 align:middle line:84%
that an experience of this
kind is rather dangerous.

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, supposing one did
become convinced that everything

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:20.690 align:middle line:84%
just as it is is
the ideal, is right.

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:23.890 align:middle line:84%
Would this mean that you
could go out and murder

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:26.955 align:middle line:84%
some rich relative in order
to inherit their fortune?

00:10:26.955 --> 00:10:28.790 align:middle line:84%
Did it mean you can
do anything you like?

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:30.290 align:middle line:84%
You can kick your
father and mother,

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:32.730 align:middle line:84%
you can be cruel to
children, that you can steal

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:35.800 align:middle line:90%
and rob and anything?

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.910 align:middle line:90%
In a way it does mean that.

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:44.610 align:middle line:84%
But that is only to say,
isn't it, that we are free.

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:48.060 align:middle line:90%
And freedom is dangerous.

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:51.790 align:middle line:84%
But yet, freedom is
one of the things which

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:54.290 align:middle line:84%
we cherish as one of
our greatest possessions

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:57.280 align:middle line:90%
and privileges.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.910 align:middle line:84%
But if we deny
ourselves freedom,

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:05.640 align:middle line:84%
then we don't really have
the power to act morally.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.410 align:middle line:84%
Because all true moral
acts are not the acts

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:10.430 align:middle line:90%
we are bound to do.

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:12.800 align:middle line:84%
They are the acts
we are free to do.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.170 align:middle line:90%
But freedom is dangerous.

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:16.330 align:middle line:84%
The moment you teach
a child to walk,

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:17.970 align:middle line:84%
you could teach it
to kick its mother.

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:20.500 align:middle line:84%
The moment you teach
a child to use a knife

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:22.990 align:middle line:84%
to cut up its steak
with, the child

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:25.450 align:middle line:84%
can go and kill
someone with a knife.

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:26.650 align:middle line:90%
Life is risky.

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:28.680 align:middle line:90%
Life is not safe.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And so in the same way,
this experience is not safe.

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:33.590 align:middle line:84%
But on the other
hand, its content

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:40.100 align:middle line:84%
is so joyous that when
people are profoundly happy,

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.630 align:middle line:84%
they are not in
the mood, usually,

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:43.230 align:middle line:90%
to go out and slug someone.

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:46.000 align:middle line:90%


00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.760 align:middle line:84%
And so you might say,
this experience then,

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:51.820 align:middle line:84%
which is the foundation of
these great forms of Oriental

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:55.941 align:middle line:84%
philosophy, that
sounds wonderful.

00:11:55.941 --> 00:11:57.806 align:middle line:90%
And I'd like to get it.

00:11:57.806 --> 00:12:04.480 align:middle line:90%


00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:08.310 align:middle line:90%
That reminds me of a story.

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:11.580 align:middle line:84%
Once a fellow was
traveling in England.

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:14.906 align:middle line:84%
And he lost his way and wanted
to get to a certain village.

00:12:14.906 --> 00:12:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And he went to a
country yocal and said,

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:20.335 align:middle line:84%
can you tell me the way
to Little Tuddenham?

00:12:20.335 --> 00:12:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And the yocal scratched his head
and said, [WITH BRITISH ACCENT)

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:27.420 align:middle line:84%
well, sir, I do
know where that is.

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.370 align:middle line:84%
But if I were you, I
wouldn't start from here.

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:31.900 align:middle line:90%


00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:38.210 align:middle line:84%
And so in the same way, when one
asks, how do I get experience,

00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:41.670 align:middle line:84%
that's not quite
the right question.

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:46.685 align:middle line:84%
And to go out to get it is, from
the first, the wrong approach.

00:12:46.685 --> 00:12:49.190 align:middle line:90%


00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:55.140 align:middle line:84%
Because this sort of
transformation of consciousness

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:59.800 align:middle line:84%
happens to a person
only in the moment.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.880 align:middle line:84%
When you might say
they give up grasping,

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:13.440 align:middle line:84%
they start to treat life not
as something to be grabbed.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:19.440 align:middle line:84%
When the whole approach to
things is no longer clutching.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.450 align:middle line:84%
You know, it was a basic
teaching in Buddhism

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:24.690 align:middle line:84%
that the root of
all human suffering

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:26.090 align:middle line:90%
is clinging or grasping.

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:28.660 align:middle line:90%


00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:31.380 align:middle line:84%
Just in the same way
as I was suggesting

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:36.130 align:middle line:84%
on a previous program, that
you can't cling to your breath

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:37.025 align:middle line:90%
without losing it.

00:13:37.025 --> 00:13:38.860 align:middle line:84%
You have to let
go of your breath.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And for that reason,
the word that

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:44.990 align:middle line:84%
is used in Buddhism
for this experience--

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:46.880 align:middle line:84%
it's another word
familiar to you

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:54.590 align:middle line:84%
all, Nirvana, literally
means blow out.

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:55.830 align:middle line:90%
Don't hang on.

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:58.390 align:middle line:90%


00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:00.726 align:middle line:90%
Don't clutch life.

00:14:00.726 --> 00:14:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the great
problems is how on earth

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:09.410 align:middle line:84%
to get ourselves to give up
clutching, to give up clinging.

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:11.300 align:middle line:84%
But you see, if that's
something you eagerly

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:14.210 align:middle line:84%
want to do because you want to
get something good out of it,

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:17.300 align:middle line:84%
this is still a
grasping attitude.

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:23.240 align:middle line:84%
Well you know, in Zen, they
have a means of teaching people

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:26.460 align:middle line:90%
how to stop clinging.

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:31.090 align:middle line:84%
Zen, incidentally, is supposed
to have been brought from India

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:35.860 align:middle line:84%
to China around somewhere
between 400 and 500 AD

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:39.850 align:middle line:84%
by a fierce looking
gentleman Bodhidharma.

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:43.520 align:middle line:84%
you can see him in this picture
by the Japanese painter Soga

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:44.860 align:middle line:90%
Jasoku.

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.720 align:middle line:84%
He's always drawn as
a very fierce fellow

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.640 align:middle line:84%
with a twinkle in his
eye at the same time.

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.680 align:middle line:90%


00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And when Bodhidharma
came to China,

00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.650 align:middle line:84%
he didn't have very
many disciples.

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:03.460 align:middle line:84%
But there was one fellow
who sought him out,

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:06.830 align:middle line:90%
and his name was Huike.

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And Huike came to
Bodhidharma and said, sir,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.452 align:middle line:84%
I want you to accept
me as your disciple.

00:15:13.452 --> 00:15:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And Bodhidharma replied,
I have nothing to teach.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.570 align:middle line:84%
What I understand is an
experience, in other words,

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:23.280 align:middle line:90%
and I can't put it into words.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.430 align:middle line:90%
And therefore, go away.

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:26.980 align:middle line:90%
I can't teach it to you.

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:29.640 align:middle line:84%
But Huike insisted
on being taught,

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:33.700 align:middle line:84%
and he waited outside
Bodhidharma's cave in the snow.

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And if you look in
the picture by Sesshu,

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:40.680 align:middle line:84%
you can see Huike
standing out there.

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And Huike go so
persistent, and Bodhidharma

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:48.620 align:middle line:84%
so persistent in his
refusal to teach him,

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:51.580 align:middle line:84%
that at last, Huike
cut off his arm.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And handed it to Bodhidharma
saying, look, here

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.150 align:middle line:84%
is the testimony
of my sincerity.

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Please take me as
you're disciple.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:03.180 align:middle line:84%
So Bodhidharma said, all
right, what do you want?

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And Huike replied, I
have no peace of mind.

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:08.756 align:middle line:90%
Please pacify my mind.

00:16:08.756 --> 00:16:13.730 align:middle line:84%
And by mind, of course, he
meant is soul, his self.

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:17.140 align:middle line:84%
So Bodhidharma said, bring
out your mind here before me.

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:19.220 align:middle line:90%
I'll pacify it.

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:24.510 align:middle line:84%
But Huike said, when I look
for my mind, I can find it.

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:29.430 align:middle line:84%
Bodhidharma said, there,
I have pacified your mind.

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment,
Huike had his Satori.

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:36.220 align:middle line:90%


00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:38.120 align:middle line:84%
In other words, he
had the experience

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:40.470 align:middle line:90%
I've tried to describe to you.

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:44.250 align:middle line:84%
Because Bodhidharma
made him really

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:47.080 align:middle line:84%
struggle to catch
hold of himself,

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.790 align:middle line:84%
to find that separate
ego, that controlling

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:53.150 align:middle line:84%
center which all of us tend
to believe ourselves to be.

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:55.900 align:middle line:84%
But you know, when you look
for it, you can't find it.

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:59.440 align:middle line:84%
It's like, they say lunatics
sometimes sitting in an asylum

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.130 align:middle line:90%
are doing this.

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:05.160 align:middle line:90%


00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.730 align:middle line:84%
Yes, they said for
hours, perhaps,

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:08.589 align:middle line:90%
in a padded cell doing that.

00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:11.470 align:middle line:90%
But you can't catch hold of it.

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:15.119 align:middle line:84%
You know, perhaps one of
the good ways of showing you

00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:19.815 align:middle line:84%
what this means is through
the application of Zen

00:17:19.815 --> 00:17:22.400 align:middle line:90%
to Japanese fencing.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.859 align:middle line:84%
You know, Japanese
fencing, or Kendo,

00:17:25.859 --> 00:17:29.210 align:middle line:84%
which means the
way of the sword,

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:32.500 align:middle line:84%
is done with gruesome
swords like this.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And the Samurai, or
Japanese feudal soldier,

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.720 align:middle line:84%
used to practice Zen
to give them coverage.

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And they applied it
to the art of fencing.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:49.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you go to study with
a Japanese fencing master,

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:50.920 align:middle line:84%
you will not at first
be given a sword

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.170 align:middle line:90%
and be told how to use it.

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:55.490 align:middle line:84%
You will be made a kind of
janitor around the house.

00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And you will have to do
all the little chores

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.730 align:middle line:84%
like sweeping the
floors, putting away

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:05.220 align:middle line:84%
the bedding, washing up the
dishes, and so on and so forth.

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:10.020 align:middle line:84%
And while you are
doing that, the master

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:13.390 align:middle line:84%
will get hold of
a practice sword.

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:15.570 align:middle line:84%
This, you see, is
made of bamboo.

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:19.370 align:middle line:84%
It's made of about six slips of
bamboo loosely tied together,

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:22.630 align:middle line:84%
so that if you get with it,
although it may give you

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:25.730 align:middle line:84%
a pretty hard crack, at
least you don't get killed.

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And while the poor boy
who is the apprentice

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.550 align:middle line:84%
is doing the household
duty, the teacher

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:32.350 align:middle line:84%
stalks around with
one of these things

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:35.460 align:middle line:84%
and unawares, gives
him a bang on the head.

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:37.670 align:middle line:84%
And the boy is expected
to defend himself

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:39.300 align:middle line:90%
by any means at his disposal.

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:41.735 align:middle line:84%
If he's got a sauce pan in
his hand, use the sauce pan.

00:18:41.735 --> 00:18:44.990 align:middle line:84%
If he's picking up a
cushion, use the cushion.

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And everywhere, always
at unknown moments,

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:51.290 align:middle line:84%
the teacher sneaks up on him
and bangs him on the head.

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:53.030 align:middle line:84%
So after a while,
the poor fellow

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:55.695 align:middle line:84%
is going around looking this
way and looking that, expecting

00:18:55.695 --> 00:18:58.150 align:middle line:84%
at any moment the
teacher to hit him.

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And he begins in
his mind to plan

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:03.250 align:middle line:84%
how he can be ready to
meet the teacher's assault.

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:06.205 align:middle line:84%
And as he goes along a passage,
he's expecting the teacher

00:19:06.205 --> 00:19:08.512 align:middle line:84%
to come right around
the corner at the end,

00:19:08.512 --> 00:19:10.315 align:middle line:84%
and instead of that,
just as he's all

00:19:10.315 --> 00:19:13.170 align:middle line:84%
ready to defend himself,
doing, he gets hit on the head

00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:16.070 align:middle line:90%
from behind.

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:19.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, when this has been
going on for a little time,

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.250 align:middle line:84%
there are only
two possibilities.

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:25.330 align:middle line:84%
The apprentice gets a
nervous breakdown and quits,

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:26.560 align:middle line:90%
or he learns.

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:29.760 align:middle line:90%
And what does he learn?

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:34.120 align:middle line:84%
He learns that the teacher
will always outwit him.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:39.560 align:middle line:84%
That he can never be prepared
for an unexpected attack.

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:43.190 align:middle line:84%
And so he gives up trying
to control the situation.

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:45.820 align:middle line:90%
He gives up trying to prepare.

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:48.716 align:middle line:84%
In other words, he just
wanders around, just like this.

00:19:48.716 --> 00:19:50.215 align:middle line:84%
Oh, maybe it hits,
maybe it doesn't.

00:19:50.215 --> 00:19:52.820 align:middle line:84%
He gives up caring whether
he's going to get hit or not.

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment, the teacher
gives him the practice sword

00:19:56.940 --> 00:20:01.610 align:middle line:84%
and says, now you can
begin to learn fencing.

00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:07.860 align:middle line:84%
Because the importance
of this is simple.

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:14.230 align:middle line:84%
That if, say, you are faced
with a group of attackers,

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:17.630 align:middle line:84%
and you don't know where the
next attack is coming from,

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:20.799 align:middle line:84%
if you are ready to
go for this fellow,

00:20:20.799 --> 00:20:22.340 align:middle line:84%
and this one is
going to come at you,

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:24.140 align:middle line:84%
and you're all
set to go for him,

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:29.230 align:middle line:84%
you have to withdraw
from here to go here.

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:31.550 align:middle line:84%
But if you're in
a middle position,

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:35.410 align:middle line:84%
and you're not tensed in mind
in any particular direction,

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:37.790 align:middle line:84%
you're ready to go in
all directions, wherever

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:40.310 align:middle line:90%
the attack may come from.

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And so in exactly the same way,
the Zen way of teaching teaches

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:58.160 align:middle line:84%
one to see that you cannot be in
complete control of your whole

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.050 align:middle line:90%
life situation.

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:05.300 align:middle line:84%
You cannot, in other words,
fundamentally possess yourself.

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And so they set you
the problem of trying

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:09.681 align:middle line:90%
to find out who you are.

00:21:09.681 --> 00:21:12.360 align:middle line:84%
Who is the knower behind
all your experience?

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:13.960 align:middle line:90%
Who is the experiencer?

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:17.040 align:middle line:90%
Who is the ego, the eye?

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And they make you search
for it and search for it

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:20.530 align:middle line:90%
and search for it.

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:23.240 align:middle line:84%
Or you could put
this in another way.

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.820 align:middle line:84%
They ask you, and
this really amounts

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:29.820 align:middle line:84%
to the same thing, act
with total sincerity.

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:32.640 align:middle line:84%
Show me, in the Zen
way of putting it,

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.982 align:middle line:84%
who you were before your father
and mother conceived you.

00:21:35.982 --> 00:21:39.550 align:middle line:84%
In other words, show me your
real, basic, original self.

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:42.110 align:middle line:90%


00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And this means perform an
absolutely, 100% percent

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:49.940 align:middle line:90%
genuine and sincere act.

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:52.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know how it is
when you try to be sincere.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.160 align:middle line:90%
When you try to be natural.

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.260 align:middle line:84%
You know johnny well
that you're trying,

00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:00.156 align:middle line:84%
and that everything
you do is a fake.

00:22:00.156 --> 00:22:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And so in the same way, the
Zen student finds out that he

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:12.350 align:middle line:84%
cannot act 100% genuinely
with his whole being.

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:16.180 align:middle line:84%
And he gets frustrated again and
again and again as the teacher

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:21.330 align:middle line:84%
rejects every attempt he makes
to show him his real self.

00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:23.960 align:middle line:84%
Until the moment
comes when he suddenly

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:26.590 align:middle line:84%
realizes, not just as
an idea, but something

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:29.310 align:middle line:84%
that he knows in his whole body,
he knows in his very bones,

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:31.710 align:middle line:90%
that it can't be done.

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:34.280 align:middle line:84%
You cannot intentionally
be natural.

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:36.240 align:middle line:90%
And he gives up.

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And that moment of giving
up is just the same

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:41.340 align:middle line:84%
as when the student
of the sword gives up

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:44.280 align:middle line:84%
trying to prepare
to defend himself.

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And in the moment when we let go
of ourselves in that way, zup,

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:53.170 align:middle line:84%
there comes upon us this
experience of the void,

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:54.420 align:middle line:90%
of complete freedom.

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:57.940 align:middle line:84%
Or as we might say in
psychological language,

00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:00.732 align:middle line:90%
being free from blocking.

00:23:00.732 --> 00:23:07.627 align:middle line:84%
You know blocking is when
you are stalled by something.

00:23:07.627 --> 00:23:09.085 align:middle line:84%
When somebody says
something to you

00:23:09.085 --> 00:23:10.910 align:middle line:84%
that fundamental
embarrasses you.

00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:15.470 align:middle line:84%
Or when an event happens
in life which, as it were,

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:17.130 align:middle line:84%
knocks the wind
out of your sails.

00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:19.940 align:middle line:90%
You are blocked.

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And to be free from
blocking, to be

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:29.150 align:middle line:84%
free from being
stopped, being phased,

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:33.250 align:middle line:84%
is part of the
Satori experience.

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:36.960 align:middle line:84%
To be able to go straight
ahead, as it were,

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.490 align:middle line:84%
going with the stream
of life, and not

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:41.310 align:middle line:90%
trying to resist the stream.

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:44.250 align:middle line:84%
Just as, for example, if
you were actually swimming,

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:47.350 align:middle line:84%
and you got caught
in a strong current.

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:50.240 align:middle line:84%
If you try to swim against it,
you're perfectly sure to drown.

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.940 align:middle line:90%


00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:56.040 align:middle line:84%
But you have to learn
in that situation

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:58.720 align:middle line:84%
to turn around and
go with the stream.

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:00.620 align:middle line:90%
Let it carry you.

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:04.020 align:middle line:84%
And then in that moment, you
and the stream become one.

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:08.170 align:middle line:84%
The whole force of the stream
becomes one with your own body.

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And you learn after that how
to use the force of the stream

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:15.470 align:middle line:84%
to edge to the side and
get out of it in that way.

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:17.605 align:middle line:84%
This, of course, is
the philosophy of Judo,

00:24:17.605 --> 00:24:20.510 align:middle line:90%
of the gentle way.

00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:24.830 align:middle line:84%
A philosophy of self
defense in which

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:27.930 align:middle line:84%
Zen Buddhism has had
a great influence.

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:30.140 align:middle line:84%
So then, when the
moment of letting go

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:41.830 align:middle line:84%
comes, when we see that
every moment of life is it.

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:43.310 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
the object of life

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:46.930 align:middle line:84%
is no longer seen as something
to grasp after in the future,

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:50.900 align:middle line:90%
every moment is it now.

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:54.670 align:middle line:84%
Every moment, even
the most trivial,

00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:59.470 align:middle line:84%
answers the question,
what is life for?

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:06.670 align:middle line:84%
And so you see, the experience
at the basis of Zen,

00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:10.040 align:middle line:84%
and at the basis of other
types of Oriental philosophy,

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:15.180 align:middle line:84%
can be demonstrated by
ordinary, everyday life.

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:20.460 align:middle line:84%
That's why in Zen teaching,
those old masters in China

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:23.640 align:middle line:84%
didn't like to answer
questions about philosophy

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.359 align:middle line:90%
with wordy explanations.

00:25:25.359 --> 00:25:27.400 align:middle line:84%
They had quite a different
way of going about it.

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:31.250 align:middle line:84%
I remember one case
where a Confucian scholar

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:34.360 align:middle line:84%
came to a teacher and
said, please explain to me

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.437 align:middle line:90%
your secret teaching.

00:25:36.437 --> 00:25:38.020 align:middle line:84%
And the teacher
replied, well, there's

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:40.190 align:middle line:84%
a saying in your own
master Confucius, which

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:41.480 align:middle line:90%
very well puts it.

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:44.380 align:middle line:84%
When Confucius
said, my disciples,

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:47.020 align:middle line:84%
do you think I'm holding
anything back from you?

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, I'm holding
nothing back.

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:51.030 align:middle line:90%
And that was all he said.

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:53.696 align:middle line:84%
And so the Confucian scholar was
a bit perturbed and said, well,

00:25:53.696 --> 00:25:55.110 align:middle line:90%
what do you mean?

00:25:55.110 --> 00:26:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And the Zen teacher said,
well, uh, forget it.

00:26:00.170 --> 00:26:02.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to talk
about it anymore.

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:05.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, a few days later,
they were walking together

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:07.440 align:middle line:90%
in the mountains.

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And they happened to pass
a bush of wild laurel.

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And the Zen teacher turned to
the Confucian scholar and said,

00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:16.856 align:middle line:90%
do you smell it?

00:26:16.856 --> 00:26:18.510 align:middle line:90%
The scholar said, yes.

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:22.960 align:middle line:84%
You see, said the teacher, I'm
keeping nothing back from you.

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's said that
at that moment

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:28.620 align:middle line:90%
the scholar was awakened.

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:31.990 align:middle line:84%
This is the characteristic
approach of Zen,

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:36.760 align:middle line:84%
to answer questions about
abstract, vast matters

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:42.780 align:middle line:84%
of philosophy with absolutely
concrete momentary events.

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:45.750 align:middle line:84%
Because it is these
concrete momentary events

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:47.131 align:middle line:90%
that are the answer.

00:26:47.131 --> 00:26:50.270 align:middle line:84%
If they are experienced
with the mind, that

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:53.400 align:middle line:84%
is no longer clinging to
life and clinging to itself,

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:56.050 align:middle line:84%
as I said, the trivial,
the ordinary, the momentary

00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:59.180 align:middle line:90%
suddenly comes, zup, to life.

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And this, you see, this
thing that we are living now

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:05.540 align:middle line:90%
is the answer.

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And so Zen teachers have
said very strange things

00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:11.370 align:middle line:84%
when asked
philosophical questions.

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:15.100 align:middle line:84%
One of them said, the
cypress tree in the yard.

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:18.650 align:middle line:84%
Another said, three
pounds of flax.

00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:22.380 align:middle line:84%
Another said, it's windy
again this morning.

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:24.870 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they
don't say anything.

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:30.660 align:middle line:84%
There's a famous story
of a Chinese general,

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:35.520 align:middle line:84%
I think he was, who came
to one of the old masters

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:39.510 align:middle line:84%
and said to him,
what is the way?

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And in answer, the
master-- The teacher said,

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:49.470 align:middle line:90%
I don't understand.

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:54.170 align:middle line:84%
The master said, cloud in
the sky, water in the jar.

00:27:54.170 --> 00:28:00.410 align:middle line:90%
