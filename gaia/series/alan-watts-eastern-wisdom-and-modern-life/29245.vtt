00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.660 align:middle line:84%
>>One thing do I teach of
my disciples-- suffering

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:20.955 align:middle line:90%
and deliverance from suffering.

00:00:20.955 --> 00:00:23.670 align:middle line:90%


00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.630 align:middle line:84%
It was in this way that
Gautama, the Buddha,

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.250 align:middle line:84%
living in the sixth
century BC, gave

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.140 align:middle line:90%
the gist of his whole teaching.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's for this reason that
many commentators and critics

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.580 align:middle line:84%
of Buddhism have called
it a way of escape,

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.680 align:middle line:84%
because of its tremendous
concern with the problem

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.730 align:middle line:84%
of human pain as the
fundamental problem of life

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.460 align:middle line:84%
and the means of
deliverance from pain.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.770 align:middle line:84%
But I believe this is really
a very mistaken criticism,

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:05.019 align:middle line:84%
because there is nothing that
is so much the very essence

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.010 align:middle line:84%
of suffering as the fear
of suffering itself.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.415 align:middle line:84%
And if the doctrine
of the Buddha

00:01:13.415 --> 00:01:16.390 align:middle line:84%
were fundamentally
based on an obsession

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.050 align:middle line:84%
to get rid of
suffering, it would

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.340 align:middle line:84%
be a kind of self-contradictory
vicious circle.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.980 align:middle line:84%
This is very well illustrated by
another of those stories which

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.240 align:middle line:84%
I tell from time to time, where
a student came to his master

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.310 align:middle line:84%
with the question,
it is terribly hot,

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.800 align:middle line:84%
and how shall we
escape the heat?

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.420 align:middle line:84%
In other words, this
was a symbolic question

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.665 align:middle line:84%
asking about the whole problem
of the heat of suffering.

00:01:43.665 --> 00:01:47.270 align:middle line:84%
It is terribly hot, and how
should we escape the heat?

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And he answered, "Go right down
to the bottom of the furnace."

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.990 align:middle line:84%
But in the furnace,
said the student,

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.010 align:middle line:84%
how do we escape
the scorching fire?

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And the master's final
word was, "No further pains

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.860 align:middle line:90%
will harass you."

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Now you might say then that
the attitude of the Buddhist

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.520 align:middle line:84%
philosophy to suffer
is not at all one

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.650 align:middle line:84%
of turning away
from it, of solving

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.550 align:middle line:84%
the problem of suffering
by turning one's back on it

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.560 align:middle line:90%
and escaping it.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.890 align:middle line:84%
Rather, its whole attitude
is that the solution

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.260 align:middle line:84%
to the problem of human
pain, whether it be physical

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.820 align:middle line:84%
or whether it be moral,
is to go right into it.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.690 align:middle line:84%
Now in the Buddhist
doctrine, pain or suffering

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.900 align:middle line:84%
in its most general
sense is designated

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.900 align:middle line:84%
by this word,
duhkha in Sanskrit.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.770 align:middle line:90%
Duhkha is the opposite of sukha.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And if you break the
word down, duh here

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.260 align:middle line:84%
means what is disagreeable,
painful, bitter,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.230 align:middle line:90%
and kha means condition.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.100 align:middle line:90%
Su means what sweet.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.090 align:middle line:84%
So you might say
this is bitterness

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.290 align:middle line:90%
in contrast with sweetness.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And the first proposition
of the Buddhist teaching,

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.200 align:middle line:84%
what is called the first
of the four noble truths,

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.940 align:middle line:84%
is the idea that life as we
live it is fundamentally duhkha,

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.290 align:middle line:84%
fundamentally, a kind
of chronic frustration.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:32.000 align:middle line:84%
And man's effort is always to
get rid of this and go to that.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:41.140 align:middle line:84%
But the basic idea of the Buddha
was that if you have this,

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.950 align:middle line:84%
you must have this,
because these two

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.530 align:middle line:90%
contrast with each other.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.220 align:middle line:84%
You don't experience this
unless you experience this.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.290 align:middle line:84%
You don't experience this
unless you've experienced this.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.260 align:middle line:84%
So if you go after sweetness,
you cannot experience sweetness

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.485 align:middle line:84%
unless there is always as
its background the contrast

00:03:57.485 --> 00:03:59.840 align:middle line:90%
of bitterness.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the objective
of the Buddha's doctrine

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.525 align:middle line:84%
was not to get rid of pain
and put pleasure in its place,

00:04:09.525 --> 00:04:12.120 align:middle line:84%
but to go to something
else, which stands,

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.050 align:middle line:84%
as it were, transcending
these two opposites, above

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:20.000 align:middle line:84%
and beyond which in
Sanskrit is called ananda.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.550 align:middle line:84%
That word is usually
translated bliss,

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.370 align:middle line:90%
but in a rather unusual sense.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.890 align:middle line:84%
There is a poem, again from
the tradition of Chinese zen,

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.070 align:middle line:84%
which says under the
sword lifted high,

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.430 align:middle line:84%
there is hell
making you tremble.

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.170 align:middle line:90%
But go straight ahead.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.990 align:middle line:90%
And there is the land of bliss.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And so bliss here has
a very special meaning.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.930 align:middle line:84%
It isn't bliss in
contrast to agony.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And I think probably the best
way of translating the word

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.950 align:middle line:84%
ananda is to use the
English word ecstasy.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.830 align:middle line:84%
Now then our problem
is simply this.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.960 align:middle line:84%
How is it that through a
profound going into suffering,

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.640 align:middle line:84%
that is to say a profound
acceptance of it,

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.066 align:middle line:84%
there can come out of
it some sort of bliss.

00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:18.760 align:middle line:84%
This is the problem
we have to understand.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.000 align:middle line:84%
A great deal of the doctrine
of primitive Buddhism

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.860 align:middle line:84%
as we have it recorded from
the Buddha's own teachings

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.940 align:middle line:84%
is concerned with
close attentiveness

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.820 align:middle line:84%
to one's inner
feelings and states

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.850 align:middle line:84%
of mind, a careful
watching of them

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.890 align:middle line:84%
to find out what
they really are.

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.690 align:middle line:84%
And supposing then
you're afraid.

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.990 align:middle line:90%
What happens to you?

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.860 align:middle line:84%
Many people when
asked this question

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.720 align:middle line:90%
seem strangely unaware.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.960 align:middle line:84%
Their thoughts are concentrated
on the particular imagination

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.584 align:middle line:90%
of the feared event happening.

00:05:51.584 --> 00:05:53.500 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
person is afraid of having

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.180 align:middle line:84%
a certain sickness,
disease, and he

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.200 align:middle line:84%
keeps thinking of what it might
be like to have that disease.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.070 align:middle line:84%
But supposing we switch
our attention from that

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.650 align:middle line:84%
and concentrate for a moment
on what it simply feels

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:08.350 align:middle line:90%
like to be afraid.

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:11.940 align:middle line:84%
We find, don't we, that we get
a kind of creepy feeling up

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.650 align:middle line:90%
the spine.

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.060 align:middle line:84%
We get a sort of sinking
or hollow feeling

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.910 align:middle line:84%
in the pit of the stomach,
and a clammy sensation

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.417 align:middle line:90%
in the palms of our hands.

00:06:21.417 --> 00:06:23.750 align:middle line:84%
Now as a matter of fact,
that's not really very painful,

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.380 align:middle line:90%
and is it?

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.430 align:middle line:84%
That's all that's
the matter with you.

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's the worst that life
can do to you at that moment.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.160 align:middle line:84%
Furthermore, notice
something else.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.990 align:middle line:84%
That thing you have
what you call fear,

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.330 align:middle line:84%
you have also precisely
the same sensations

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.350 align:middle line:84%
that you have in a totally
opposite situation, when

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:51.290 align:middle line:84%
you have what we call shudders
or thrills of delight.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.590 align:middle line:84%
They are the same shudders,
the same trembles,

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.300 align:middle line:84%
sometimes even the same
creepy feeling up the spine,

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.970 align:middle line:84%
the same sinking feeling
in the pit of the stomach,

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.310 align:middle line:84%
that a very profound positive
emotional experience can

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:09.890 align:middle line:84%
excite, so that we find
that our feelings depend

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:11.550 align:middle line:84%
for their evaluation
as to whether they

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:14.220 align:middle line:84%
be positive or
negative, very much

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:19.020 align:middle line:84%
as to the context
in which they occur.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:22.570 align:middle line:84%
For example, say a father
is playing with his boy,

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:27.780 align:middle line:84%
and he gives him a
slap on the behind.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.720 align:middle line:84%
The boy looks around and if
he sees an angry expression

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.300 align:middle line:84%
on his father's
face, he feels hurt.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.577 align:middle line:90%
It was painful.

00:07:33.577 --> 00:07:35.410 align:middle line:84%
But if he sees his
father as laughing at him

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:40.300 align:middle line:84%
and was just teasing him,
it doesn't hurt him at all.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:44.230 align:middle line:84%
And so it is with
all our sensations.

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.670 align:middle line:84%
The way they impress us
positively or negatively,

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:49.900 align:middle line:84%
as good or bad, depends
to a very large extent

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.260 align:middle line:84%
on the context in
which they are set.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Take for example
in a poem like this

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:57.420 align:middle line:84%
by the humorous
poet, Thomas Foote.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:00.890 align:middle line:84%
The poem says, "They
went and told the sexton,

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:03.680 align:middle line:90%
and the sexton tolled the bell."

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.990 align:middle line:84%
Now there's the same sound,
told, in either the case.

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:07.670 align:middle line:84%
But its meaning is
completely different

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:10.550 align:middle line:84%
because of the context
in which it occurs.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:12.720 align:middle line:84%
if the second line had
said, "And the sexton

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.550 align:middle line:84%
told the minister,"
then it would

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:17.140 align:middle line:84%
have had the same
meaning in both lines.

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And just as words
change their meaning

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:20.810 align:middle line:84%
in accordance with
their context,

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:25.990 align:middle line:84%
so the meaning of what we
experience alters contextually.

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And so it is this then, that
close awareness of our feelings

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:31.600 align:middle line:90%
reveals.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.620 align:middle line:84%
In the same way, we can say
we weep when we are sad.

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:39.470 align:middle line:84%
But we also weep for joy/ There
are tears of joy and tears

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:40.230 align:middle line:90%
of sorrow.

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:44.400 align:middle line:84%
Exactly the same tears, exactly
the same physical sensation,

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.220 align:middle line:84%
but what a difference
the context makes.

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the
idea of the Buddha

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:54.140 align:middle line:84%
was to become delivered from
suffering, not by running away

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:57.940 align:middle line:84%
from it, but from looking at the
actual concrete reality of what

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:01.790 align:middle line:84%
we feel and forgetting
the context.

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:05.300 align:middle line:84%
Now of course, this is obviously
something quite possible

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.980 align:middle line:84%
in the milder
forms of suffering.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:12.790 align:middle line:84%
But what happens when
suffering becomes really acute.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:16.750 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps, as an
illustration of this,

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:23.540 align:middle line:84%
I might turn to a very
extraordinary work of art.

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:30.850 align:middle line:84%
It is a sculpture of
Saint Teresa by Bernini.

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:35.630 align:middle line:84%
Look at that face
and try and decide

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:40.700 align:middle line:84%
what feeling that
face is expressing.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.640 align:middle line:90%
Is it agony?

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Is it a rapture of delight,
which would, as we say,

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:50.700 align:middle line:90%
cause one almost to swoon?

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:51.355 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:09:51.355 --> 00:09:53.960 align:middle line:90%


00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:58.680 align:middle line:84%
Actually, if you look back
and see the whole scene,

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.190 align:middle line:84%
you will see that the
saint is confronted

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:07.780 align:middle line:84%
by an angel who is piercing
her with a dart, the dart

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:11.250 align:middle line:90%
representing the divine love.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And so the figure represents
Saint Teresa in ecstasy,

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:25.240 align:middle line:84%
in profound joy, profound
delight at the state,

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.160 align:middle line:84%
the inner feeling of her
union with the godhead.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.330 align:middle line:90%


00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And this is exactly what is
meant by ananda, ecstasy,

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.220 align:middle line:84%
for pleasure and pain in
their most intense forms,

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:44.063 align:middle line:84%
both producing that
we could call ecstasy.

00:10:44.063 --> 00:10:48.067 align:middle line:84%
A very striking illustration
this has been given recently.

00:10:48.067 --> 00:10:49.650 align:middle line:84%
Some of you may have
heard of the work

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:53.870 align:middle line:84%
of a British obstetrician by the
name of Grantly Dick-Read who

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:57.250 align:middle line:84%
has many students among
obstetricians in this country.

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:59.980 align:middle line:84%
For as you know, the
pains of childbirth

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:01.610 align:middle line:84%
can be some of
the severest pains

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:04.880 align:middle line:90%
that a human being can undergo.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And the point of
Dr. Read's work has

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:09.560 align:middle line:84%
been to show that if
you change a woman's

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:13.870 align:middle line:84%
attitude to the experience of
childbirth, if in other words

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:16.950 align:middle line:84%
you stop calling
these feelings pain

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:19.980 align:middle line:84%
and instead you
call them tensions,

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:24.690 align:middle line:84%
and if before childbirth
you train her to relax,

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:26.970 align:middle line:84%
to let go of herself,
and as it were,

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:30.480 align:middle line:84%
cooperate with the tensions
that she's experiencing,

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.600 align:middle line:84%
the whole character of
childbirth can be changed.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And many women
who have undergone

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:42.150 align:middle line:84%
this pre-birth
training say afterwards

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:44.550 align:middle line:84%
that what they
might have expected

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:47.980 align:middle line:84%
to be an extremely unpleasant
experience turned out

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:54.070 align:middle line:84%
to be a profoundly moving
experience, even a joyous one.

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course it's pretty
clear that we could do something

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.020 align:middle line:84%
like that when the context
of a painful experience

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:05.780 align:middle line:84%
is very positive, as
it is with childbirth.

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:08.650 align:middle line:84%
After all, this is
a creative event.

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:11.160 align:middle line:84%
But wouldn't it be a
very different matter

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.220 align:middle line:84%
in the case of the
pains of death.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:15.500 align:middle line:84%
Would it be possible,
for example,

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:20.190 align:middle line:84%
to look upon the pains of
death as natural tensions,

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:23.860 align:middle line:84%
and so have an entirely
different attitude.

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.512 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why not.

00:12:25.512 --> 00:12:30.400 align:middle line:90%
After all, we fear death.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.860 align:middle line:84%
We have a negative attitude
to death, largely because

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:36.390 align:middle line:90%
of social conditioning.

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:40.180 align:middle line:90%
It's what we've been taught.

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:42.970 align:middle line:84%
For example, just to
give another illustration

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:45.520 align:middle line:84%
and then get back to
the subject of death,

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:47.970 align:middle line:84%
the idea of being
sick, I mean vomiting,

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:51.830 align:middle line:84%
is something which most of
us regard as disgusting.

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:54.660 align:middle line:90%
But is it actually disgusting?

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:58.020 align:middle line:84%
Don't we revolt with
the feeling of disgust

00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:59.920 align:middle line:84%
from it, because when
we were little children

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:04.040 align:middle line:84%
and we were sick and we threw
up, our mamas went blah.

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And we caught from them
the emotional attitude

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.570 align:middle line:84%
toward that kind
of experience so

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:13.680 align:middle line:84%
that it reverberates and
echoes with us ever afterwards.

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.390 align:middle line:90%


00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:19.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's rather
the same with death,

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:25.076 align:middle line:84%
because death is,
after all, beneficent.

00:13:25.076 --> 00:13:29.180 align:middle line:84%
If we never die, not only would
our world become hopelessly

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:31.640 align:middle line:84%
overpopulated, not
only might we become

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:35.680 align:middle line:84%
utterly bored with century
after century after century

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.700 align:middle line:84%
of experience
without intermission,

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:43.110 align:middle line:84%
we might crave death after
the first 500 years of life.

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:44.880 align:middle line:84%
And never to be able
to have it would

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:51.120 align:middle line:84%
be like the torture of a
chronic and fantastic insomnia.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.940 align:middle line:84%
So if death is fundamentally
merciful, if it is natural,

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:57.040 align:middle line:84%
if it is something
that is just as

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:00.210 align:middle line:84%
much an integral part of being
a human being as having a head

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:03.280 align:middle line:84%
or having hands,
then would it not

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.350 align:middle line:84%
be possible to have a
changed attitude to death

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:10.350 align:middle line:84%
in any community or society,
so that in due course,

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:14.030 align:middle line:84%
people could begin to look
upon the pain attending

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:16.240 align:middle line:84%
death in the same
way as they could

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:19.800 align:middle line:84%
be taught to look upon
the pain attending birth.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.520 align:middle line:90%


00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.860 align:middle line:84%
Now there's another
aspect of the problem,

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:29.090 align:middle line:84%
and that is that a great
deal of our negative attitude

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:32.730 align:middle line:84%
to the experience of pain,
and acute physical pain I'm

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:37.770 align:middle line:84%
speak of now, is connected
with a certain culturally

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:40.770 align:middle line:84%
conditioned
unwillingness to react

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:43.980 align:middle line:90%
to pain in the natural way.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:47.000 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we
are afraid of giving

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.400 align:middle line:84%
into suffering in the way
that our own physical organism

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.850 align:middle line:90%
suggests to us.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:54.840 align:middle line:90%
We are afraid of crying.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.180 align:middle line:90%
We're afraid of screaming.

00:14:56.180 --> 00:15:02.380 align:middle line:84%
We're afraid of going into those
very undignified motions which

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:06.410 align:middle line:84%
constitute the human
beings' reaction in pain.

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:08.050 align:middle line:84%
Even though, as I
just pointed out,

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:11.760 align:middle line:84%
we sometimes have the very same
reactions in acute pleasure.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:15.100 align:middle line:84%
But we are fundamentally
ashamed of pain,

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:19.760 align:middle line:84%
because we are taught that
giving in to pain, weeping

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:23.070 align:middle line:84%
or something like that,
is unmanly, sissy,

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:25.370 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Now it's a very
dangerous doctrine,

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:29.950 align:middle line:84%
that a human being
should always be

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:33.260 align:middle line:84%
rigid in conditions
of suffering.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:37.440 align:middle line:84%
I often like to quote a passage
from that Chinese philosopher,

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:43.570 align:middle line:84%
Lao Tzu, L-A-O T-Z-U, which
says, "Man at his birth

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:45.760 align:middle line:90%
is supple and tender.

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.810 align:middle line:90%
In death, he is rigid and hard.

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:51.575 align:middle line:84%
Bounce when they are
young, are pliant and soft.

00:15:51.575 --> 00:15:55.070 align:middle line:84%
But when dead, they
are brittle and dry."

00:15:55.070 --> 00:16:00.830 align:middle line:84%
Thus tenderness and softness
are the companions of life.

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:06.310 align:middle line:84%
But rigidity and hardness
are the companions of death.

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:11.670 align:middle line:84%
In other words, there
is strength in weakness.

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:14.280 align:middle line:90%
Consider a cat.

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:17.672 align:middle line:84%
When a cat drops off a
tree, what does the cat do?

00:16:17.672 --> 00:16:18.380 align:middle line:90%
Does it go rigid?

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:20.254 align:middle line:84%
Does it say, I'm going
to be a real tough guy

00:16:20.254 --> 00:16:22.280 align:middle line:84%
and beat the ground
without flinching?

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.430 align:middle line:84%
Does the cat stick out
its feet like this?

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:25.330 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:27.160 align:middle line:84%
Because if it did,
when it hit the ground,

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.310 align:middle line:84%
it would be just a
broken bag of bones.

00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:32.340 align:middle line:84%
When the cat's in
midair, it relaxes.

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:33.220 align:middle line:90%
It goes with it.

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:34.420 align:middle line:90%
It becomes weak.

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:38.554 align:middle line:84%
And so it hits the ground
with a soft, heavy thud,

00:16:38.554 --> 00:16:39.220 align:middle line:90%
and is unharmed.

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:41.850 align:middle line:90%


00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:46.440 align:middle line:90%
Think also of water.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:52.140 align:middle line:84%
Water was one of the basic
symbols of Lao Tzu's philosphy,

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:55.250 align:middle line:90%
to be like water.

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:58.850 align:middle line:84%
Nothing in the world is softer
or more yielding than water.

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:01.560 align:middle line:84%
And yet at the
same time, nothing

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:04.349 align:middle line:84%
is like water for
overcoming and wearing away

00:17:04.349 --> 00:17:08.190 align:middle line:84%
things which are
hard, like rocks.

00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And thus, if you put
a knife into water

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:12.975 align:middle line:84%
and you try to cut
it, what happens?

00:17:12.975 --> 00:17:16.619 align:middle line:84%
The water gives
completely to the knife.

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:19.810 align:middle line:84%
The water closes up
wherever the knife went.

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And although you strike
at it as hard as you like,

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:25.490 align:middle line:90%
you could never create a wound.

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:28.410 align:middle line:84%
So it is, you see,
because of its softness

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:35.800 align:middle line:84%
that the water triumphs over
the hardness of the knife.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.990 align:middle line:84%
So then it's the same
with human beings.

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:42.380 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, we
are so brought up

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:45.670 align:middle line:84%
to mistrust our natural
feeling reactions

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:49.000 align:middle line:90%
to certain experiences.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.680 align:middle line:84%
We are conditioned to believe
that we will suffer less,

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:57.260 align:middle line:84%
that we will somehow
triumph over pain,

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:01.080 align:middle line:90%
if we hold our feelings rigid.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:11.600 align:middle line:84%
But you know, our reactions to
pain are in a way therapeutic.

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:15.210 align:middle line:84%
They're healing,
just like fever.

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:17.900 align:middle line:84%
When we have poisons
in our blood,

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:20.410 align:middle line:84%
the natural defense
mechanisms of the body

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:23.030 align:middle line:84%
send up our temperature,
and in this way,

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:25.650 align:middle line:90%
boil out the invading bugs.

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:28.170 align:middle line:84%
Now it used to be thought
that when people had fevers,

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:29.320 align:middle line:90%
this was the disease.

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.370 align:middle line:84%
The fever itself
was the disease.

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And so once upon a
time, doctors used

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.010 align:middle line:84%
to give medicine to
take away the fever.

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:37.890 align:middle line:84%
But by taking away the
fever, they very often

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:41.780 align:middle line:84%
killed the patient, because they
took away the defensive action

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:43.885 align:middle line:84%
of the body to drive
out the disease.

00:18:43.885 --> 00:18:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And so in just the same
way, if one refuses

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:54.450 align:middle line:84%
to react in the way of nature
to invasions of pain, so too,

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:58.230 align:middle line:84%
one may shatter the body
beyond what it can stand.

00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:59.620 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing, you know.

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:02.590 align:middle line:84%
No bridge will stand
up unless it has give.

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:05.450 align:middle line:84%
If a steel suspension
bridge is built so firmly

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:08.270 align:middle line:84%
that it doesn't
sway in the wind,

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:09.870 align:middle line:84%
that bridge will
come crashing down

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:12.510 align:middle line:84%
on the first gale is
just because there's

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:15.480 align:middle line:84%
give in it that the
bridge is strong.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.590 align:middle line:84%
Take a great building
like the Empire State.

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:20.740 align:middle line:84%
The Empire State also
has a sway in it.

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And if it didn't
have that sway, it

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:27.260 align:middle line:84%
would be a very insecure
structure indeed.

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:33.400 align:middle line:84%
So then, when we
are willing to react

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:38.100 align:middle line:84%
to pain as our own
natural feelings suggest,

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:43.310 align:middle line:84%
if we are willing to scream, if
we are willing to weep, if we

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:45.860 align:middle line:84%
are willing to wriggle and
writhe as pain suggests

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:49.330 align:middle line:84%
to us to do, a very
strange thing happens.

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:52.560 align:middle line:84%
The very willingness
to react in that way

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:56.310 align:middle line:84%
often makes it quite
unnecessary to do so.

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:58.260 align:middle line:84%
Now you may say, I'm
just talking big.

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And the only way I
can prove what I say

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.410 align:middle line:84%
is the next time you have a
toothache, the next time you

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:07.980 align:middle line:84%
have any serious pain, see
what happens if you do this.

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:11.470 align:middle line:84%
If you, as it were,
go along with the pain

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:16.750 align:middle line:84%
and don't try to fight
it, yield, become weak,

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:21.250 align:middle line:84%
and you will discover
the strength in weakness.

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:24.150 align:middle line:84%
So then you see,
this is not really

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:27.590 align:middle line:90%
an escapist philosophy at all.

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:29.990 align:middle line:84%
It is most definitely
a philosophy

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:36.580 align:middle line:84%
of keeping in mind
the actual reality

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:39.210 align:middle line:84%
of the situation in
which you find yourself.

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:41.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what could be
more realistic than this, what

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:47.280 align:middle line:84%
could be more fundamentally
facing the hard facts of life.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:52.780 align:middle line:84%
One keeps his attention on
the actual concrete fact

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:56.640 align:middle line:84%
that is happening as
distinct from our socially

00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:02.330 align:middle line:84%
conditioned and inculcated
ideas and attitudes about it.

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And this is really
facing reality 100%.

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And so there come out of
this two basic results.

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:19.110 align:middle line:84%
The first is that when
we don't resist pain,

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:23.020 align:middle line:84%
we don't set up a vicious
circle in connection with it.

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:26.400 align:middle line:90%
Take the pain of fear again.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:29.700 align:middle line:84%
Supposing you are a situation
where the doctor has told you

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:31.674 align:middle line:90%
you have to have an operation.

00:21:31.674 --> 00:21:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And of course if
you're going to undergo

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:37.280 align:middle line:84%
this operation in the best
way, you need to be rested.

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:39.230 align:middle line:84%
You need to have
plenty of sleep.

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:42.210 align:middle line:84%
You need to be
strong, and so on.

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:45.090 align:middle line:90%
Well, fine advice, isn't it?

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:47.000 align:middle line:84%
Because the moment
you know you've

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.760 align:middle line:84%
got to have an operation, you're
liable to get a bit frightened.

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And then you know you
ought not to be frightened.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.131 align:middle line:84%
You ought not to stay awake
at night to worry about it.

00:21:55.131 --> 00:21:56.470 align:middle line:90%
You need sleep.

00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:59.550 align:middle line:84%
Then you get afraid, you
see, because they're afraid.

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:01.100 align:middle line:84%
You're afraid that
your fear is going

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:03.680 align:middle line:84%
to lead to insomnia
and debility.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And so you're afraid
of being afraid.

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And then because you see that
you are afraid of being afraid,

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:12.690 align:middle line:84%
you are afraid because you are
afraid because you are afraid.

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:15.050 align:middle line:84%
So that worry is always
a vicious circle,

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:17.060 align:middle line:84%
in which you are worrying,
because you worry,

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:19.620 align:middle line:84%
because you worry,
because you worry.

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And this, as it were,
builds up a whole chain

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:25.756 align:middle line:84%
of reactions, which makes
the pain or the fear

00:22:25.756 --> 00:22:28.090 align:middle line:90%
worse and worse and worse.

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:32.040 align:middle line:84%
So then, if at any point in
this link, we can as it were,

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:35.170 align:middle line:84%
be willing, be
willing to be worried.

00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And then you don't worry
about being worried.

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:39.790 align:middle line:90%
Be willing to be afraid.

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:43.090 align:middle line:84%
Then you don't have to be
afraid of being afraid.

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:46.820 align:middle line:84%
And so this, in other words,
diminishes the total amount

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:52.370 align:middle line:84%
of pain because it doesn't
allow the painful situation

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:55.930 align:middle line:84%
to build itself up
and up and up and up.

00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:59.544 align:middle line:84%
In the same way, if somebody
stuck a hook into you,

00:22:59.544 --> 00:23:01.210 align:middle line:84%
and you pull away
from it, well the hook

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:02.640 align:middle line:90%
goes more deeply into you.

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.665 align:middle line:84%
But if you are caught
like a fish on a hook

00:23:04.665 --> 00:23:09.220 align:middle line:84%
and you go with the hook, this
reduces the amount of tension.

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And this works backwards
all the way down the line.

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:16.630 align:middle line:84%
Now there's also
a second result.

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And that is that that when
our mind, our consciousness,

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:25.250 align:middle line:84%
our attention, is
fully focused on

00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:28.740 align:middle line:84%
what is, on the actual
situation, as I said,

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:32.565 align:middle line:84%
we are free from various
thoughts about it

00:23:32.565 --> 00:23:36.690 align:middle line:84%
and associations with it
that bring up a context which

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:40.210 align:middle line:90%
makes the experience painful.

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:43.890 align:middle line:84%
So you might say that this is
an attitude of taking things

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:46.880 align:middle line:90%
as they come, one of time.

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:54.410 align:middle line:84%
For example, many of you who
are not blessed with dishwashers

00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:57.460 align:middle line:84%
have to wash many
dishes day after day.

00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And when you've been married
as a woman for, oh, 10 or 11

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:07.230 align:middle line:84%
years, one day you
are sitting there

00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:11.500 align:middle line:84%
at the sink, utterly
weary of the whole thing.

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:14.536 align:middle line:84%
And in you mind's eye
comes the immense pile

00:24:14.536 --> 00:24:16.160 align:middle line:84%
of dishes which you've
had to watch day

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:19.110 align:middle line:84%
after day in the past They
are, in your mind's eye,

00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:23.860 align:middle line:84%
standing up, piled forever and
ever on the draining board.

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:26.595 align:middle line:84%
And also in your mind's eye is
that enormous pile of dishes

00:24:26.595 --> 00:24:28.595 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to have
to wash in the future.

00:24:28.595 --> 00:24:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And you think, my life
is that of a mere drudge,

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:33.515 align:middle line:84%
washing dishes, washing
dishes, washing dishes.

00:24:33.515 --> 00:24:35.800 align:middle line:90%
And there's no end to it.

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:40.190 align:middle line:84%
But if you were realistic,
you would see this.

00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:44.630 align:middle line:84%
You have only one dish to
wash in your life, this one.

00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:46.490 align:middle line:84%
You can only wash
one dish at a time.

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's the only one
you have to deal with.

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:53.880 align:middle line:84%
It's the same as
climbing a mountain.

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:57.370 align:middle line:84%
If you start to think as you
climb, oh what a lot of steps

00:24:57.370 --> 00:25:02.340 align:middle line:84%
to take, then the task
becomes utterly impressive.

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Or if, for example, you make
a New Year's resolution,

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:07.380 align:middle line:84%
and you say, well I'm
going to go on the wagon.

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:10.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to drink
anymore this new year.

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And if you say,
this whole year, I

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:14.310 align:middle line:84%
will not touch
another drop of drink.

00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:16.506 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course the old
devil immediately brings

00:25:16.506 --> 00:25:21.550 align:middle line:84%
to your mind 365 days of not
drinking anything, anything

00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:22.190 align:middle line:90%
alcoholic.

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:25.000 align:middle line:90%
And that's overwhelming.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.060 align:middle line:90%
Don't tempt the devil that way.

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:31.140 align:middle line:84%
One conquers the problem
by not drinking this one,

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:33.720 align:middle line:84%
and saying nothing
about the next.

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:35.980 align:middle line:84%
So with the climbing
of the mountain,

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:40.900 align:middle line:84%
taking each step as if it were
the only step to be taken,

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:43.570 align:middle line:84%
and so in the
situation then where

00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:47.140 align:middle line:84%
there is the experience of
agony, whether it be physical

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:52.870 align:middle line:84%
or whether it be moral,
the way out is in a way,

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:56.120 align:middle line:84%
suffering that agony
as if this were

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:58.140 align:middle line:84%
the only thing in
the whole world

00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:03.020 align:middle line:84%
to be done by going right down
to the bottom of the furnace.

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:05.770 align:middle line:90%
No further pains will harass me.

00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:09.825 align:middle line:84%
It was also so, isn't it
in "Dante's Divine Comedy,"

00:26:09.825 --> 00:26:13.100 align:middle line:84%
when Dante and Virgil
find their way out of hell

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:17.290 align:middle line:84%
by going down to the
very center of hell.

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:21.610 align:middle line:84%
I like to illustrate this with
another of those zen stories.

00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:23.910 align:middle line:84%
There was a monk who got news
that his mother had died.

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:25.557 align:middle line:90%
And he was weeping.

00:26:25.557 --> 00:26:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And another Buddhist
monk said to him,

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:28.640 align:middle line:84%
you ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:32.170 align:middle line:84%
You, a monk, still showing
worldly attachments by weeping.

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:33.200 align:middle line:90%
He said, don't be silly.

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:36.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm weeping because
I want to weep.

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:38.400 align:middle line:90%
