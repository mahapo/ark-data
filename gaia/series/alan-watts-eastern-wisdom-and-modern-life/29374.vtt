Alan Watts is a

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.836 align:middle line:84%
and the author of
many widely read books

00:00:43.836 --> 00:00:46.495 align:middle line:84%
on comparative
philosophy and religion.

00:00:46.495 --> 00:00:59.910 align:middle line:90%


00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.470 align:middle line:84%
>>This is not the figure
of a strange pagan god.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:12.270 align:middle line:84%
It is the figure of a man,
an awakened man-- of Buddha.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And I expect you
may have wondered

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.610 align:middle line:84%
why almost all figures of
Buddha or of many other Eastern

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:25.080 align:middle line:84%
sages that you see
are seated like this.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.370 align:middle line:84%
This figure of Buddha is in
the posture of meditation.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And the way in
which he is seated

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.640 align:middle line:84%
and the whole cast of his
features and of his expression

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.150 align:middle line:84%
symbolize a certain
attitude to life,

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.910 align:middle line:84%
a certain way of
looking at things

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.060 align:middle line:84%
which in Indian and
Chinese philosophy

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.010 align:middle line:84%
is considered
essential to sanity.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:57.550 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps I can give you some idea
of the meaning of this attitude

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.910 align:middle line:84%
by demonstrating it with a
Chinese character, a word which

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.570 align:middle line:84%
represents this whole
attitude to life.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.680 align:middle line:84%
Most of you probably know
that Chinese characters

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.120 align:middle line:90%
are originally picture writing.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.850 align:middle line:90%


00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And in this
particular character,

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.880 align:middle line:84%
this half of the character
is said, originally,

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.380 align:middle line:84%
to have represented some
water bird, perhaps a stork

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.790 align:middle line:90%
or a heron.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And this other part
of the character

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.622 align:middle line:84%
is, first of all, a sign
meaning the human eye.

00:02:39.622 --> 00:02:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And then you put legs on
it-- the activity of the eye.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.020 align:middle line:90%
And that means seeing.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And the whole character
is pronounced kuan.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And it means a certain kind
of observation, a certain way

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.290 align:middle line:84%
of looking at things
which might be typified

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.390 align:middle line:84%
by the image of a heron standing
at the edge of the water

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.280 align:middle line:84%
as in this painting which is by
the great Japanese artist Kano

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.840 align:middle line:90%
Motonobu.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.010 align:middle line:84%
There is the heron standing
quietly and serenely,

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.520 align:middle line:90%
watching the water.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.550 align:middle line:90%


00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And so the whole meaning
of this attitude to life

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.440 align:middle line:84%
is what is summed up
in the entire Eastern

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.120 align:middle line:84%
idea of meditation typified
in these Buddha figures.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And I want to try today to
explain to you something

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.960 align:middle line:84%
of the meaning of
this attitude to life.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.850 align:middle line:90%


00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:04.880 align:middle line:84%
For fundamentally, meditation
is not so much an exercise

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.080 align:middle line:84%
as it is a certain way of
using one's mind or one's

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:14.360 align:middle line:84%
consciousness because normally
most human beings, when

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.950 align:middle line:84%
they use their eyes or
their ears, are constantly

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.826 align:middle line:84%
and chronically straining
to see and to hear.

00:04:22.826 --> 00:04:24.200 align:middle line:84%
And when you come
to think of it,

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:31.420 align:middle line:84%
that's very odd because our
eyes don't work by effort.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.320 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to go
out and get the light.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.882 align:middle line:90%
The light comes to them.

00:04:35.882 --> 00:04:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And in the same way,
sound becomes to our ears.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And even the sense of touch
comes to our fingertips.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.640 align:middle line:84%
We don't, for example,
have to press a thing hard.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.170 align:middle line:84%
If I went in the dark and
tried to fumble and feel

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.410 align:middle line:84%
what this is, I don't have
to press very hard to feel it

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.170 align:middle line:84%
because the sensation,
simply, of the hard object

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.600 align:middle line:84%
comes to the nerve
ends in my skin.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And so it's strange,
isn't it, that we

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:08.160 align:middle line:84%
have acquired the habit of a
constant and chronic effort

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.510 align:middle line:84%
to see clearly and
to hear clearly.

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.850 align:middle line:84%
I think part of it
comes from school.

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.580 align:middle line:84%
When children are listening
to a teacher in class,

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.436 align:middle line:84%
they are always fidgeting
or doing something like this

00:05:18.436 --> 00:05:20.820 align:middle line:84%
and looking around and
twisting and jiggling.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And the teachers
says, pay attention!

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And the children immediately,
to ingratiate the teacher,

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.142 align:middle line:84%
are able to sort of ham or act
what paying attention is like.

00:05:30.142 --> 00:05:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And paying attention,
of course, is

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.580 align:middle line:84%
staring at the
teacher like that.

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.750 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I'm very interested
in what you say.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, to get
that concentration clear,

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.970 align:middle line:84%
they curl up their legs
around the legs of a chair

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.029 align:middle line:84%
and go into all these
strained attitudes

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:46.570 align:middle line:84%
so that the teacher
knows they really

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.830 align:middle line:90%
are trying very hard to attend.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And it is through such
conditioning like that,

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.010 align:middle line:84%
through being
taught that we must

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.160 align:middle line:84%
try to see and try
to hear in order

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.000 align:middle line:84%
to have clear sight
and clear hearing

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.930 align:middle line:84%
that we learn constantly to
strain our senses in their use.

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:09.850 align:middle line:84%
But as a matter of
fact, this impedes

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:11.860 align:middle line:84%
the clarity of our
senses because if you

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.220 align:middle line:84%
will try staring hard at
the book in front of you

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.390 align:middle line:84%
or staring very hard
at the TV screen

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.120 align:middle line:84%
you're looking at
right now, you will

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.030 align:middle line:90%
find that it becomes fuzzy.

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.024 align:middle line:84%
Also, in the same way, if you
are trying to listen, say,

00:06:25.024 --> 00:06:27.440 align:middle line:84%
to a telephone conversation
while the children are running

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.260 align:middle line:84%
all over the house
and screaming,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.162 align:middle line:84%
if you try to listen
to the telephone,

00:06:31.162 --> 00:06:32.620 align:middle line:84%
you'll get very
angry, and you will

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.780 align:middle line:84%
have to stop to yell at the
children to make them be quiet.

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.570 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
if you just let

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:39.630 align:middle line:84%
the sound come to
your ears, you'll

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:43.580 align:middle line:84%
have no difficulty
at all in hearing.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.390 align:middle line:84%
So you remember then
that heron I showed you.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:50.430 align:middle line:84%
When that heron was
watching the fish,

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:52.150 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't sort of
going like this.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.210 align:middle line:90%
It's all over the place.

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:54.751 align:middle line:84%
We want to fish
here, fish here-- no.

00:06:54.751 --> 00:06:58.160 align:middle line:90%
Heron is this-- quiet like this.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And as it were, the
whole area of vision

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:04.670 align:middle line:84%
is simply coming to
the heron's eyes.

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:06.905 align:middle line:84%
And the moment it sees
a ripple in the water,

00:07:06.905 --> 00:07:08.520 align:middle line:90%
it darts down and gets the fish.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.730 align:middle line:90%


00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:19.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't think it's only
that we have been taught

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.750 align:middle line:84%
by teachers and
parents and so on

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:28.360 align:middle line:84%
to try to see and
try to hear clearly.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.410 align:middle line:84%
There are other
factors in the problem.

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:35.750 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is that while
we are seeing and hearing,

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:39.600 align:middle line:84%
we are trying to make sense of
our world by thinking about it.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And the act of thinking also
introduces an element of strain

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.280 align:middle line:90%
into the use of our minds.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think the reason
for this is perhaps

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:58.130 align:middle line:84%
you will remember how I showed
you on a previous program

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:02.620 align:middle line:90%
that thought is linear.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:06.360 align:middle line:84%
You know, it goes one
word after another.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.150 align:middle line:90%
It's strung out in a line.

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:11.685 align:middle line:84%
We think-- thought, thought,
thought, thought, thought,

00:08:11.685 --> 00:08:14.740 align:middle line:84%
thought-- in a line like
this, one after another.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:21.120 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, when we see, we see
to what is going on entirely.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.190 align:middle line:90%
We take in a volume when we see.

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:24.610 align:middle line:90%
We take in a great area.

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:29.430 align:middle line:84%
Nature is a volume rather than
something strung out in a line.

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:32.659 align:middle line:84%
But when we think, we get
one thought after another.

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And so the process of
thought is much slower

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:41.915 align:middle line:84%
than the process of seeing
and using our consciousness

00:08:41.915 --> 00:08:44.520 align:middle line:90%
or our mind as a whole.

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And this then requires
a certain effort

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:51.025 align:middle line:84%
to make thought keep up
with what we are seeing

00:08:51.025 --> 00:08:53.940 align:middle line:90%
or what we are hearing.

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:59.020 align:middle line:84%
Also, you see, thought
works by abstraction.

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:00.460 align:middle line:90%
What do I mean by "abstraction"?

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, a lot of Chinese
characters are abstractions.

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.795 align:middle line:84%
If we take, for example, the
Chinese character for man.

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:09.230 align:middle line:90%
It is written this way.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:12.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, that was originally
the head and legs

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:15.822 align:middle line:90%
of a human figure.

00:09:15.822 --> 00:09:17.280 align:middle line:84%
Something you know,
like this, when

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.570 align:middle line:84%
we draw an abstract
figure of a man,

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:22.470 align:middle line:90%
everybody knows that's a man.

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:27.040 align:middle line:84%
But as a matter of fact, it
cuts out a great deal of man.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.790 align:middle line:84%
This figure cuts
out all the details

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:35.290 align:middle line:84%
and gives us a simple image
which we can grasp all at once.

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And we have to do that
in order to think,

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:43.250 align:middle line:84%
so that we can use a series
of very simple images

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:45.110 align:middle line:90%
or grasps of the world.

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:47.070 align:middle line:90%
And these are abstractions.

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And it is fundamentally in terms
of abstractions that we think.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, thought, as
I said, is slower

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:02.190 align:middle line:84%
because it goes in a line,
thought after thought.

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:05.790 align:middle line:90%
And also, thought is abstract.

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:09.180 align:middle line:84%
That is to say, it
lacks the full living

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:13.410 align:middle line:84%
quality of real life just
as this figure here is just

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:16.630 align:middle line:84%
a sort of skeleton,
ball on top of sticks.

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:18.510 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it
lacks the vitality,

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:22.510 align:middle line:90%
the "aliveness" of a real man.

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:27.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, the more we tend to
live in a world of thought,

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:31.850 align:middle line:84%
the more we tend to live
in an abstract world that

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:34.850 align:middle line:84%
is removed from and
has a gap between it

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:37.810 align:middle line:90%
and the real world of nature.

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:40.210 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of
this, we tend to live

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:42.520 align:middle line:84%
in a world that
is, in some ways,

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:48.030 align:middle line:84%
unsatisfying, lacking
in vitality and life.

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And also, people tend
to think all the time.

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:58.430 align:middle line:84%
This becomes for every
civilized community,

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:01.110 align:middle line:84%
every civilized person
a sort of habit,

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:04.840 align:middle line:84%
which is like constantly
talking to yourself.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, when you meet
me here on the TV screen,

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:10.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm always talking,
or almost always.

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:13.740 align:middle line:84%
But I assure you, I
am not always talking.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm often silent
because, after all, we

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.130 align:middle line:84%
have to be silent
some of the time,

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:20.410 align:middle line:84%
don't we, in order to hear
what other people have

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:24.550 align:middle line:84%
to say, and therefore, to
have something to talk about.

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:27.020 align:middle line:84%
In just the same
way, our minds have

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:30.370 align:middle line:84%
to be silent some of the time if
we are really to have anything

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:32.916 align:middle line:90%
to think about except thoughts.

00:11:32.916 --> 00:11:35.740 align:middle line:84%
You know, there is
a popular proverb

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:37.300 align:middle line:84%
which says that
"talking to yourself

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:39.690 align:middle line:90%
is the first sign of madness."

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:43.650 align:middle line:84%
And there's some truth in this
because constant thinking,

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:45.970 align:middle line:84%
as distinct from
simply experiencing

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:49.960 align:middle line:84%
through our senses, constant
thinking about our experiences,

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:53.340 align:middle line:84%
coding our experiences
into words, into signs,

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:57.920 align:middle line:84%
into the symbols of thought
is a buzz that goes on day in

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:01.850 align:middle line:84%
and day out inside our heads
except when we are sleeping.

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And as a result
of that, we begin

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:08.320 align:middle line:84%
to live in a world increasingly
divorced from reality.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And that is why in those
oriental cultures in India

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.810 align:middle line:84%
and China and
Japan, it has always

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:17.530 align:middle line:84%
been considered important
for everybody to spend some

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:20.830 align:middle line:84%
of his time-- by no means all
of his time, but some of it--

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:25.960 align:middle line:84%
not thinking but simply in the
attitude which was represented

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.720 align:middle line:84%
by that Chinese
character which I drew

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:32.590 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning, pronounced
"kuan" or quiet observation.

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:35.280 align:middle line:90%


00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.200 align:middle line:84%
Remember this point,
it's important.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:41.280 align:middle line:84%
This is not saying that thinking
is a disturbance, is a thing

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.030 align:middle line:90%
that human beings shouldn't do.

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:47.440 align:middle line:84%
On the contrary, it's a highly
important acquisition of man.

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.010 align:middle line:84%
But thinking is of
no real value to us

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:53.260 align:middle line:84%
unless we also can
practice nonthinking,

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.350 align:middle line:84%
unless we can have
our minds silent

00:12:56.350 --> 00:13:00.580 align:middle line:84%
and make immediate contact
with the real world as distinct

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:05.270 align:middle line:84%
from the world of
pure abstraction.

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:10.034 align:middle line:84%
And so this leads to a very
common practice in Asia

00:13:10.034 --> 00:13:13.690 align:middle line:84%
among Hindus, among Buddhists,
among Taoists called

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:15.270 align:middle line:90%
meditation.

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And I want to try and show
you something about it.

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:23.900 align:middle line:84%
By sitting in the
posture of meditation

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:31.210 align:middle line:84%
which is commonly used and is
done approximately like this.

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:35.940 align:middle line:90%
One sits upon a firm cushion.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.700 align:middle line:84%
Usually, a big city
telephone directory

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:42.060 align:middle line:90%
is about the right thickness.

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And ordinarily, among
Oriental peoples,

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:48.850 align:middle line:84%
they sit in what is called Lotus
Posture or Half-Lotus Posture

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:53.830 align:middle line:84%
as I'm sitting now, which means
that the right foot is lifted

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:56.649 align:middle line:90%
up onto the left thigh.

00:13:56.649 --> 00:13:58.190 align:middle line:84%
You will find, of
course, that that's

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:00.620 align:middle line:84%
an extraordinarily
uncomfortable position

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:02.060 align:middle line:90%
if you're not used to it.

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:04.720 align:middle line:84%
But one of the reasons
for sitting that way

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:09.240 align:middle line:84%
is that it locks
your legs together,

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:12.850 align:middle line:84%
so that you don't usually fall
over if you should go to sleep.

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And also, that this
position gives you

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:20.890 align:middle line:84%
a sense of being very, very
firmly rooted to the ground.

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And then the hands
are laid like this.

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And one then turns attention
to letting oneself breathe.

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:36.775 align:middle line:84%
You don't do breathing exercises
taking deep inhalations

00:14:36.775 --> 00:14:39.070 align:middle line:90%
and exhalations.

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:42.920 align:middle line:84%
You simply let your breath
come as it wants to.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:46.840 align:middle line:84%
But you, if anything,
let the out-breath--

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:51.465 align:middle line:84%
you know, the breath that goes
with the sigh of relief-- whew.

00:14:51.465 --> 00:14:55.190 align:middle line:84%
You let that be the emphasized
breath rather than the

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:57.890 align:middle line:90%
in breath.

00:14:57.890 --> 00:14:59.430 align:middle line:90%
You don't close your eyes.

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:03.280 align:middle line:84%
You usually drop them a little
on the floor in front of you

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:07.120 align:middle line:84%
because the object is not
to cut out all the things

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.490 align:middle line:84%
that you might be
experiencing through your eyes

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:12.010 align:middle line:84%
and through your ears,
through your nose

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:15.480 align:middle line:90%
and your nerve ends on the skin.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:22.050 align:middle line:84%
The object is simply to
let one's mind alone,

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:26.230 align:middle line:84%
to experience but not
to try to catch hold

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:32.886 align:middle line:84%
of one's experience in
thoughts-- simply, to think.

00:15:32.886 --> 00:15:34.010 align:middle line:90%
No, I wouldn't say "think."

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:36.630 align:middle line:84%
That's a word we use
very ambiguously.

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:41.510 align:middle line:84%
When I use the word "think,"
I mean talk to yourself

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:44.580 align:middle line:84%
or bring a lot of images before
your mind, which have nothing

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:47.720 align:middle line:84%
to do with what's
right in front of you.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:52.990 align:middle line:84%
So the function of this
exercise, this posture

00:15:52.990 --> 00:16:00.260 align:middle line:84%
is to let the whole world come
to you without interfering

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:04.540 align:middle line:84%
with it in any way--
just sitting like that.

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:07.199 align:middle line:84%
You may say, well, that's
a great waste of time.

00:16:07.199 --> 00:16:09.240 align:middle line:84%
There are all sorts of
interesting things in life

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:09.760 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:15.490 align:middle line:84%
Why just spend
some hours sitting?

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And the reason, though,
as I tried to explain,

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:20.890 align:middle line:84%
is that it is
through this that one

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:25.580 align:middle line:84%
comes to have a contact
no longer with the world

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:29.400 align:middle line:84%
of abstractions, no longer
with the world of thought

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.305 align:middle line:84%
but with the world
that actually is.

00:16:31.305 --> 00:16:33.840 align:middle line:90%


00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:38.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, as you do
this, you'll begin

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:42.190 align:middle line:84%
to notice a rather
curious change

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:46.760 align:middle line:90%
in your general feeling of life.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:50.010 align:middle line:84%
You'll notice that
there ceases to be

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:55.530 align:middle line:84%
what I would call an
interruption or an interval

00:16:55.530 --> 00:17:01.290 align:middle line:84%
between your experience
and yourself.

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:06.290 align:middle line:84%
You see, in our ordinary
way of using our minds,

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:11.890 align:middle line:84%
the chronic sense of
strain, the chronic attempt

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:16.470 align:middle line:84%
to think about and make
sense of what we are feeling

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:19.980 align:middle line:90%
is what we call our ego.

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:23.010 align:middle line:84%
If you say, "I experienced
my own existence.

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:27.430 align:middle line:84%
I am aware constantly
of a knower behind I'm

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:31.560 align:middle line:84%
receiving all that
is known," then you

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:35.165 align:middle line:84%
get this chronic sensation
of there being an I,

00:17:35.165 --> 00:17:38.730 align:middle line:84%
a self who has all
these experiences.

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And that I or self is
what we call the ego.

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And this chronic
sense of strain, you

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:57.280 align:middle line:84%
might call it our
psychological blocking

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:59.820 align:middle line:90%
against our experience.

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:08.140 align:middle line:84%
The thing that seems to divide
us from an external world,

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:09.395 align:middle line:90%
from the whole universe.

00:18:09.395 --> 00:18:11.970 align:middle line:90%


00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:16.530 align:middle line:84%
But when, in this way, the
interval begins to diminish,

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:20.680 align:middle line:84%
we begin to
experience our world.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.090 align:middle line:84%
As ourselves, there
is no interval,

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:25.960 align:middle line:84%
there is no interruption between
the knower and the known.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:29.650 align:middle line:84%
Just as when we are completely
absorbed listening to music

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:34.120 align:middle line:84%
or dancing to music, we are
not aware of our separation

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:34.810 align:middle line:90%
from it.

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:37.860 align:middle line:90%
We go right with it.

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And so in the same way, when
the mind responds instantly

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:47.390 align:middle line:84%
to what the senses
bring, it seems almost as

00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:50.630 align:middle line:84%
if the mind and
what it experiences

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:52.390 align:middle line:90%
were one and the same.

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:54.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, in a way, of course,
this is actually true.

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:56.750 align:middle line:84%
We can understand
this theoretically,

00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:59.660 align:middle line:84%
but we don't ordinarily
really feel it.

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:04.230 align:middle line:84%
For example, you
know the old saying,

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:07.300 align:middle line:84%
"If a tree falls in a forest
with nobody listening to it,

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:11.330 align:middle line:90%
will there be any noise?"

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:16.040 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you know the limericks
in which this problem is posed.

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:20.900 align:middle line:84%
"There was a young man who said,
God, I find it exceedingly odd

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:24.520 align:middle line:84%
that a tree as a
tree simply ceases

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.800 align:middle line:84%
to be when there's no
one around in the quad."

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And the answer was, "Young
man, your astonishment's odd.

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.880 align:middle line:90%
I am always around in the quad.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.980 align:middle line:84%
So the tree as a
tree never ceases

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:38.990 align:middle line:84%
to be since observed by,
yours faithfully, God."

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:41.890 align:middle line:84%
But this is a great
philosophical puzzle

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:44.380 align:middle line:90%
for the Western world.

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:48.910 align:middle line:84%
Does what we know depend
on there being a knower?

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:51.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, in a way,
obviously, it does

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:55.190 align:middle line:84%
because when a tree
falls in the forest,

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:58.570 align:middle line:84%
it certainly makes
vibrations in the air.

00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:00.760 align:middle line:84%
But those vibrations
in the air do not

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:06.240 align:middle line:84%
become noise unless
they vibrate an eardrum.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:09.580 align:middle line:84%
So in the same way,
the light from the sun

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:15.080 align:middle line:84%
does not become light unless
it falls on an eye, an eyeball.

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And two, we could say
the external world

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.900 align:middle line:90%
is full of hard things.

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:26.520 align:middle line:84%
But nothing is hard
except in relation

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:29.590 align:middle line:84%
to the soft surface
of the human skin.

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:33.975 align:middle line:84%
Nothing is heavy except in
relation to human muscles.

00:20:33.975 --> 00:20:36.640 align:middle line:90%


00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:40.630 align:middle line:84%
So if there is not
a human organism,

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:42.840 align:middle line:84%
the world does not
appear to us at all

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:45.140 align:middle line:84%
as having any of
the characteristics

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:47.540 align:middle line:84%
which we attach to
an external world.

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:50.740 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we could
say the sun is light

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:53.190 align:middle line:90%
but only because of eyes.

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:58.340 align:middle line:84%
Rocks are hard but only
because of soft fingers.

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:01.830 align:middle line:84%
Falling rocks are
noisy but only because

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:04.470 align:middle line:90%
of sensitive human ears.

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:09.810 align:middle line:84%
We cannot form any idea at all
of what the world would be like

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:12.460 align:middle line:90%
without an observing mind.

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:18.290 align:middle line:84%
Even such things as
duration, the span of time

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:21.590 align:middle line:84%
depend upon the human
mind to appreciate them.

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:26.470 align:middle line:84%
Space depends on a human
mind to observe the world

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:28.170 align:middle line:84%
from a particular
position, and so

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:31.480 align:middle line:84%
know that there are things
which are distant from it.

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.030 align:middle line:84%
Without this mind,
there could not

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:37.440 align:middle line:84%
be any world that we could think
about or conceive or imagine

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.250 align:middle line:90%
in any way whatsoever.

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And so this shows,
in a very clear way,

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:46.990 align:middle line:84%
that our mind and the
external world go together.

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:49.930 align:middle line:84%
They are inseparable
differences.

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:53.440 align:middle line:84%
You remember in a recent program
how I tried to illustrate

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:57.440 align:middle line:84%
the idea of inseparable
differences by taking a coin

00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:02.530 align:middle line:84%
or an object here, like a cigar,
which has two distinct ends,

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:04.942 align:middle line:84%
but you cannot
separate those ends.

00:22:04.942 --> 00:22:05.900 align:middle line:90%
This is very important.

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:10.890 align:middle line:84%
It's worth repeating because
it's quite fundamental.

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:12.840 align:middle line:84%
If I would want to
take one of these ends

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:16.860 align:middle line:84%
off and break the thing
and throw it away,

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:18.350 align:middle line:90%
it would still have another end.

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:20.030 align:middle line:84%
There would still
be two ends there.

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:22.130 align:middle line:84%
I could never get
rid of the situation

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:24.300 align:middle line:90%
of it having two ends.

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:27.250 align:middle line:84%
So you see that, although
the two ends are different,

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:28.840 align:middle line:90%
there is just one object.

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.915 align:middle line:84%
And so in the same
way, although there

00:22:30.915 --> 00:22:35.320 align:middle line:84%
is a difference in a way between
the knower and the known,

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:41.060 align:middle line:84%
between man and the world,
nevertheless, these two

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:42.586 align:middle line:90%
go together.

00:22:42.586 --> 00:22:44.210 align:middle line:84%
And they are
fundamentally inseparable.

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:47.110 align:middle line:90%


00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, when
our consciousness

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:56.930 align:middle line:84%
is responding instantly, without
any interval or interruption,

00:22:56.930 --> 00:23:01.040 align:middle line:84%
without any, shall we say,
stopping to think about it,

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:08.220 align:middle line:84%
then we have a situation
in which we are actually

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:11.800 align:middle line:84%
realizing, we are
actually feeling

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.900 align:middle line:84%
the true physical
relationship which

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:19.010 align:middle line:84%
exists between man
and his environment.

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:25.410 align:middle line:84%
And this we could call the
experience of oneness or unity

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:31.230 align:middle line:84%
with the universe which is
the function of meditation.

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:41.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think it's not difficult
to see some very obvious values

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:51.090 align:middle line:84%
from this because, well,
if we live entirely

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:57.290 align:middle line:84%
in a world of thought, all the
things that we pursue in life

00:23:57.290 --> 00:24:02.240 align:middle line:84%
tend, in a way, to become
arid and unsatisfactory

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:06.300 align:middle line:84%
because we are living
in an abstract world.

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:09.050 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
nobody in his senses

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:12.970 align:middle line:84%
is going to eat a menu
instead of dinner.

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:18.040 align:middle line:84%
Nobody in his senses
is going to try and get

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:22.440 align:middle line:84%
a satisfactory diet
of dollar bills.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And yet, you see,
dollar bills and menus

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:28.610 align:middle line:84%
stand in the same
relation, on the one hand,

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:31.360 align:middle line:84%
to wealth; on the
other hand, to dinner.

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:35.670 align:middle line:84%
The same relation in which
thought stands to reality.

00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:37.800 align:middle line:90%
They represent it.

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:40.340 align:middle line:84%
They symbolize
reality, but they are

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:42.590 align:middle line:84%
in no sense
substitutions for it.

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:45.010 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you can do a
great deal of things

00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:46.940 align:middle line:84%
if you have a lot
of dollar bills.

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:49.640 align:middle line:84%
But unless you exchange
those dollar bills

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:53.040 align:middle line:84%
into real concrete worth,
they are of no value to you.

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.780 align:middle line:90%


00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:59.410 align:middle line:84%
And so in the same
way, if we try

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:03.120 align:middle line:84%
to live in the world
of pure thought,

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:06.810 align:middle line:84%
we begin to feel a strange,
unsatisfactory quality

00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:07.567 align:middle line:90%
to the world.

00:25:07.567 --> 00:25:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And this living in
pure thought is not

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:13.050 align:middle line:84%
something that is only done by
professors and intellectuals

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:15.880 align:middle line:90%
and thinking people.

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.830 align:middle line:84%
Perfectly ordinary
people often live

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:19.420 align:middle line:90%
in the world of pure thought.

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:22.160 align:middle line:84%
As for example, when
we pursue certain goals

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:25.850 align:middle line:84%
in life, when we say "I
want to be successful,"

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:28.190 align:middle line:84%
"I want to be happy,"
these are only

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:32.290 align:middle line:84%
abstractions because supposing
you become enormously wealthy

00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:36.000 align:middle line:84%
and you're able to afford
three cars and six houses,

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.140 align:middle line:84%
you can't drive in
three cars at once.

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:41.800 align:middle line:84%
You can't live in
six houses at once.

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:46.600 align:middle line:84%
You have a symbol which we
call prestige of your status.

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:49.450 align:middle line:90%
But that is an abstract symbol.

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:51.480 align:middle line:90%
You can't eat prestige.

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:54.530 align:middle line:90%
You can't eat success.

00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:59.760 align:middle line:84%
And so to overcome that
kind of beguilement

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:04.300 align:middle line:84%
by the fantasies of
thought, not thinking

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:07.880 align:middle line:84%
is an important
adjunct to thought.

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:13.510 align:middle line:84%
To be able every so often
to cease the hubbub going

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:20.230 align:middle line:84%
on inside one's head and to
let talking to oneself stop

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:23.940 align:middle line:84%
and come to stillness,
you needn't, of course,

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:26.200 align:middle line:84%
sit in a meditation
posture like this to do it.

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:30.920 align:middle line:84%
This is simply the way it's
done by Buddhists and Hindus.

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:31.690 align:middle line:90%
You can walk.

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:33.730 align:middle line:90%
You can sit in the ordinary way.

00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:36.275 align:middle line:84%
You could lie in the
bathtub and do it.

00:26:36.275 --> 00:26:39.110 align:middle line:84%
You can lie in your back
in bed before you get up

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:41.010 align:middle line:90%
in the morning to do it.

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:44.270 align:middle line:84%
Just let your mind
alone and stop

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:47.630 align:middle line:84%
trying to make
sense of the world,

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:51.260 align:middle line:84%
so that there is
really something

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:53.925 align:middle line:84%
to think about other
than thought itself.

00:26:53.925 --> 00:26:56.832 align:middle line:84%
It's like if we wrote books
about nothing but books.

00:26:56.832 --> 00:26:59.040 align:middle line:84%
This is, I'm afraid, what
a great deal of scholarship

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:01.910 align:middle line:84%
is-- books about
books about books.

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:06.010 align:middle line:84%
So in this way,
through meditation

00:27:06.010 --> 00:27:09.190 align:middle line:84%
we come to that kind
of profound peace

00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:12.870 align:middle line:84%
which is exhibited in the
faces of the Buddhists.

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:15.350 align:middle line:84%
I remember
particularly some words

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:21.780 align:middle line:84%
by Lafcadio Hearn in which he
gives a marvelous description

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:26.810 align:middle line:84%
of the whole attitude which
these faces represent.

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:29.900 align:middle line:84%
"Each eidolon shaped
by human faith

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:33.210 align:middle line:84%
remains the shell of a
truth eternally divine;

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:37.130 align:middle line:84%
and even the shell itself
may hold a ghostly power.

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:39.990 align:middle line:84%
The soft serenity, the
passionless tenderness

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:44.170 align:middle line:84%
of these Buddha faces might
yet give peace of soul

00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:48.730 align:middle line:84%
to a West weary of creeds
transformed into conventions,

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:52.460 align:middle line:84%
eager for the coming of
another teacher to proclaim,

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:56.090 align:middle line:84%
I have the same feeling for
the high as for the low,

00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:58.900 align:middle line:84%
for the moral as
for the immoral,

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:01.610 align:middle line:84%
for the depraved as
for the virtuous,

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:05.650 align:middle line:84%
for those holding sectarian
views and false opinions

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:11.110 align:middle line:84%
as for those whose beliefs
are good and true."
