00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.870 align:middle line:10%
>>Hello, this is
Michael Tellinger.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.910 align:middle line:10%
And we continue our exploration
of ancient civilizations,

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.460 align:middle line:10%
origins of humankind,
advanced technology,

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.740 align:middle line:10%
the obsession with gold, and
other fascinating subjects

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.740 align:middle line:10%
that point us in a very
clear direction for humanity

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:31.870 align:middle line:10%
into the future.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.810 align:middle line:84%
We've explored the
millions of stone circles

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.890 align:middle line:84%
and ancient structures
in Southern Africa.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.220 align:middle line:84%
But Southern Africa
is not the only place

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.790 align:middle line:84%
that is filled with ancient
civilizations or evidence

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.060 align:middle line:84%
of ancient civilizations
at stone ruins.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.190 align:middle line:84%
We find stone ruins and
structures all over the world.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.980 align:middle line:84%
It's actually phenomenal
when you open your eyes,

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.905 align:middle line:84%
and you start looking around
how much ancient stuff there is.

00:01:00.905 --> 00:01:03.620 align:middle line:90%
It truly boggles the mind.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.220 align:middle line:84%
There are literally thousands of
pyramids that cover the world.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.920 align:middle line:84%
There aren't just
the Giza pyramids

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.550 align:middle line:90%
and the Mexican pyramids.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.530 align:middle line:84%
There are pyramids
all over the world,

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.550 align:middle line:84%
but we're just
not aware of them.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.860 align:middle line:84%
The stone circles that we find
in Jordan are spectacular.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.430 align:middle line:84%
There are thousands of
these circular structures

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.150 align:middle line:84%
that in many ways
resemble the stone

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.750 align:middle line:90%
circles of Southern Africa.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And I suspect that their
activity and the reason

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.070 align:middle line:90%
for building was very similar.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And as we all find, with
all ancient structures,

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.590 align:middle line:84%
the reason for the construction
was always the same.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.660 align:middle line:90%
This is the Ural Mountains.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.310 align:middle line:90%
And we carry on to Iran.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.460 align:middle line:84%
Iran is filled with ancient
civilizations and ruins

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.500 align:middle line:90%
that we don't even know about.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.260 align:middle line:84%
Because very little knowledge of
Iran is available in the West.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And very little archaeological
exploration is going on there.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.180 align:middle line:84%
So we really have to look in
the vaults of ancient knowledge

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.259 align:middle line:84%
and information to find this
body of knowledge that's

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.310 align:middle line:90%
been hidden from us.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.620 align:middle line:84%
I suppose, it seems
like it's been hidden

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.750 align:middle line:90%
from us for so many years now.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.080 align:middle line:84%
In Israel, there are examples
of circular structures,

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.260 align:middle line:90%
and in Iraq.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.320 align:middle line:84%
Iraq is just littered
with ancient ruins

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.710 align:middle line:90%
that truly boggles the mind.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.560 align:middle line:84%
But it was only when I started
exploring the stone circles

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.730 align:middle line:84%
in Southern Africa
that we started

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.690 align:middle line:84%
to find some critical indicators
as to the technology that

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.260 align:middle line:84%
was behind the stone circles
and what their true reason was

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.370 align:middle line:90%
for being constructed.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.900 align:middle line:84%
Very soon after I started
walking through and exploring

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.810 align:middle line:84%
the thousands of
stone structures

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.530 align:middle line:84%
that I walked through
myself, I started

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.440 align:middle line:84%
collecting these mysterious
cone shaped tools.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.080 align:middle line:84%
Little did I know that
the cone shaped tools

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.900 align:middle line:84%
were actually going to be
the one item that led me

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.430 align:middle line:84%
to a critical discovery
about breaking

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.480 align:middle line:84%
through the understanding
of ancient technology

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.760 align:middle line:84%
that leads us into wrapping
our heads around what we can do

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.250 align:middle line:84%
with this knowledge and how this
technology can be used today.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.360 align:middle line:84%
So I started exploring
the stone circles

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.230 align:middle line:90%
and the cone shaped tools.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And as I walked through the
thousands of stone circles

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.790 align:middle line:84%
myself, I also
started to realize

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.990 align:middle line:84%
that a new body of information
was released to humanity.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And this was information to
do with saser technology, as

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.640 align:middle line:90%
opposed to laser technology.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.790 align:middle line:84%
Now laser stands
for light amplified

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.620 align:middle line:84%
by stimulated emission of
radiation, quite a mouthful.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.590 align:middle line:84%
It's basically coherent light
that's shot as a laser beam

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.450 align:middle line:84%
through a prism or a
crystal that focuses

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.620 align:middle line:90%
the light into a coherent beam.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, saser technology was only
exposed to humanity in 2009,

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.600 align:middle line:84%
at the same time that I was
picking up the cone shaped

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.800 align:middle line:84%
tools and exploring
the stone structures

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.435 align:middle line:84%
and realizing that they were
not what we thought they were.

00:04:11.435 --> 00:04:14.840 align:middle line:84%
They were not dwellings
for people, nor animals.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.269 align:middle line:84%
So saser technology,
this is taking sound.

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.149 align:middle line:84%
So saser stands
for sound amplified

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:24.310 align:middle line:84%
by stimulated
emission of radiation.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's really about
taking sound and turning it

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.070 align:middle line:84%
into a coherent beam of
sound that works as a laser

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.810 align:middle line:90%
beam or a saser beam.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And the scientists got
very excited about this.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And obviously the
first thing they

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.350 align:middle line:84%
talk about is applying this in
the military, weaponing saser

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.610 align:middle line:84%
technology, as we
can expect would

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.580 align:middle line:84%
happen at government
level and military level.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.982 align:middle line:10%
But this goes back
much further in time,

00:04:49.982 --> 00:04:51.690 align:middle line:10%
because we realize
that the ancients were

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.340 align:middle line:10%
using this technology long,
long before we rediscovered it.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.770 align:middle line:10%
And this is really when I also
discovered Ed Leedskalnin, who

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.770 align:middle line:10%
at the southern tip of
Florida in the 1920s

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.140 align:middle line:10%
built a spectacular structure
known as Coral Castle.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.200 align:middle line:84%
He built this for
his sweetheart, who

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.480 align:middle line:84%
he was trying to woo
to the United States

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.640 align:middle line:90%
to join him from Latvia.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.960 align:middle line:90%
Unfortunately, she never came.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.480 align:middle line:84%
But what Ed Leedskalnin
did manage to do

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.970 align:middle line:84%
is use mysterious technology
and mysterious tools

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.600 align:middle line:84%
to singlehandedly
build something,

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.060 align:middle line:84%
which would be impossible
for one human being to build,

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.030 align:middle line:84%
a giant, about one
hectare property that's

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.970 align:middle line:84%
filled with giant
blocks of coral cut

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.070 align:middle line:84%
to perfection and precision,
blocks that weigh up

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.470 align:middle line:84%
to 10 tons and
possibly more, that

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.800 align:middle line:84%
were arranged into a
variety of structures

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.580 align:middle line:84%
and geometrical
patterns and shapes.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And the famous swinging door,
when it broke in the 80s,

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.390 align:middle line:84%
the best engineers
in Florida have not

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.310 align:middle line:84%
been able to put it
back together again,

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.050 align:middle line:84%
so it works as well as
it did before it broke.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.460 align:middle line:84%
So one day, Ed
Leedskalnin was apparently

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:10.190 align:middle line:84%
seen moving and levitating
these giant coral stones holding

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.620 align:middle line:90%
ice cream cones in his hands.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, to any researcher,
if you stumbled

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.616 align:middle line:84%
upon this kind of
information, most researchers

00:06:17.616 --> 00:06:18.990 align:middle line:84%
would just laugh
it off and think

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.340 align:middle line:84%
it was just some
nonsensical story that

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.030 align:middle line:84%
was being spread by some
schoolboys that apparently

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.590 align:middle line:90%
saw Ed Leedskalnin do this.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, fortunately
for me, I'd already

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.930 align:middle line:84%
been collecting
cone shaped tools

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:33.850 align:middle line:90%
from around the stone circles.

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And when I heard that magic
word, ice cream cones,

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.420 align:middle line:84%
I immediately knew that this
was something very special.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I called it
the ice cream cone phenomenon.

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:46.970 align:middle line:90%
And this is now stuck.

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:51.320 align:middle line:84%
So what we've got here is
ancient technology, cone shaped

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.230 align:middle line:84%
tools, Ed Leedskalnin
using ice cream cones

00:06:55.230 --> 00:07:00.000 align:middle line:84%
or cone shaped tools to
levitate his giant blocks.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we
start understanding

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:07.810 align:middle line:84%
how we can use saser
technology, sound laser beams,

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:10.470 align:middle line:90%
to create levitational effects.

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:12.600 align:middle line:90%
Well what is a saser beam?

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:17.970 align:middle line:84%
A saser beam is coherent sound
that's basically been propelled

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.830 align:middle line:90%
beyond the speed of light.

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:21.670 align:middle line:90%
And this is spectacular.

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:25.470 align:middle line:84%
When you look at a light
laser, a laser beam,

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:27.040 align:middle line:90%
you can see a laser beam.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.450 align:middle line:84%
So everybody can
understand that.

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:30.960 align:middle line:84%
If you are manipulating
things with a laser beam,

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.200 align:middle line:90%
everybody can understand it.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.910 align:middle line:84%
Because we can perceive
it with our eyes.

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:36.120 align:middle line:84%
But if you're using
saser technology,

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.240 align:middle line:90%
you can't see the sound beams.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:42.450 align:middle line:84%
So to anyone that sees
somebody else use saser tools,

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:43.860 align:middle line:90%
it'll look like magic.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what happens here.

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:49.470 align:middle line:84%
So we find cone shaped
technology and cone shaped

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:49.970 align:middle line:90%
tools.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:51.470 align:middle line:84%
When you start
looking, you start

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:54.340 align:middle line:84%
finding it all over the
world through pretty much

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:55.500 align:middle line:90%
all of human history.

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.800 align:middle line:84%
Cone shaped tools in Egypt
were completely ignored.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And Egyptologists just
scratch their heads.

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:03.660 align:middle line:84%
They've got no idea what these
cone shaped tools in Egypt

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:04.810 align:middle line:90%
are all about.

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:06.780 align:middle line:84%
Furthermore, in
Egypt as well, we

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:10.920 align:middle line:84%
find funerary cones that are
inscribed with a message that

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.870 align:middle line:90%
says true of voice.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:15.100 align:middle line:90%
Voice is to do with sound.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.730 align:middle line:84%
So there's some very
interesting things

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.530 align:middle line:84%
that they were obviously doing
with these funerary cones

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:20.430 align:middle line:90%
in Egypt.

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:23.230 align:middle line:84%
We find Native
American medicine men

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.710 align:middle line:84%
in the kivas, the
underground kivas, which

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:28.140 align:middle line:90%
were sound resonating chambers.

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:31.610 align:middle line:84%
They would hit cone
shaped tools together

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:34.789 align:middle line:84%
and use cone shaped
tools to generate sounds

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:36.600 align:middle line:90%
from ringing stones.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.850 align:middle line:84%
This is a phenomenal
bit of information

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:42.299 align:middle line:84%
that was disclosed to me
by a Native American woman

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:43.580 align:middle line:90%
in Sedona.

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:47.270 align:middle line:84%
In Great Zimbabwe, we've
got a giant cone shape tool,

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:49.700 align:middle line:90%
a giant cone, facing the sky.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.620 align:middle line:84%
The tip of it has
been broken off.

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:54.540 align:middle line:84%
Because when they first
discovered Great Zimbabwe,

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:57.270 align:middle line:84%
the so-called
explorers in the 1800s,

00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:00.460 align:middle line:84%
they ripped into this
giant conical tower,

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.171 align:middle line:84%
thinking it was
filled with gold.

00:09:02.171 --> 00:09:03.920 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, they
were wrong, because it

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:07.020 align:middle line:84%
had nothing to do with
being a container or a silo

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:10.620 align:middle line:84%
of some sort, storaging,
or storing materials.

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:14.120 align:middle line:84%
So it's a giant cone
shaped tool facing the sky.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.250 align:middle line:84%
So there were some
very interesting

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:19.990 align:middle line:84%
and mysterious activities going
on inside Great Zimbabwe ruins

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:21.050 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:23.740 align:middle line:84%
In Australia, we find
cone shaped tools.

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:25.850 align:middle line:84%
I was given this
cone shaped tool

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:31.470 align:middle line:84%
by an Australian collector in
2014 to add to the collection.

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And you find this just
keeps going on and on.

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:40.430 align:middle line:84%
We find ancient cultures that
still practice this custom

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:41.240 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.040 align:middle line:84%
During certain ceremonies
and inaugurations,

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.080 align:middle line:84%
they use these
strange elongated cone

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:51.280 align:middle line:84%
shaped golden hats in the
process, in the ceremony.

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.850 align:middle line:84%
What were they doing with
these cone shaped tools?

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:56.240 align:middle line:84%
Were they bringing
in information, sound

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:59.430 align:middle line:84%
and frequency, into the
minds and their heads

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:03.140 align:middle line:84%
through the pineal gland of the
recipient of this inaugurative

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:04.550 align:middle line:90%
of process?

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:07.110 align:middle line:84%
This is all that we
need to think about

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:10.010 align:middle line:84%
as we think about cone
shaped tools and history.

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:14.030 align:middle line:84%
Why do wizards and witches
wear cone shaped hats?

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And the plot starts to
thicken the more you

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:20.040 align:middle line:84%
wrap your head around these
cone shaped tools in history

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.120 align:middle line:90%
and in modern times.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:26.100 align:middle line:84%
And why are wizards
wands cone shaped?

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And if not only the wand,
but at the end of the wand

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:32.550 align:middle line:84%
you'd find a crystal that's
got a conical point that

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:35.450 align:middle line:84%
would be obviously used
for something for casting

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:40.890 align:middle line:84%
spells, or shooting a laser
beam, or shooting a saser beam.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:44.770 align:middle line:84%
Remember, our voices carry
infinite amount of energy.

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:46.540 align:middle line:90%
We can create infinitely.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:49.900 align:middle line:84%
We've already looked at how
the infinite number of shapes

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:52.260 align:middle line:84%
and physical
manifestations that happen

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.590 align:middle line:84%
as we speak, every sound we
utter, every sound we create.

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:58.240 align:middle line:84%
We've seen it through
the study of looking

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.180 align:middle line:84%
at the CymaScope that
shows us the actual effect

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:05.340 align:middle line:84%
as we speak of the human voice,
that we have infinite potential

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:08.320 align:middle line:84%
to create and manifest
through sound.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:12.310 align:middle line:84%
So I suspect that this is what
wizards and witches were doing

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:16.280 align:middle line:84%
when using their wands, speaking
words and manifesting it,

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:19.920 align:middle line:84%
and propelling the sound
somehow through their wands,

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.120 align:middle line:84%
through the cone shaped
tools that propel the sound.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.090 align:middle line:84%
What happens with the
cone shaped tools,

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:26.970 align:middle line:84%
if I just expand on
this a little bit,

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:29.260 align:middle line:90%
the sound goes into the cone.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:30.540 align:middle line:90%
It starts to speed up.

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:33.390 align:middle line:84%
It spirals, creates
a spiral effect,

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:35.160 align:middle line:84%
and the sound
speeds up, speeds up

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:40.150 align:middle line:84%
until it hits saser
or hyper sound speeds.

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:41.990 align:middle line:84%
At which point, it
shoots out the tip

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:44.020 align:middle line:90%
like a laser beam would.

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And we have a vortex field,
a saser vortex field.

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:50.480 align:middle line:84%
What happens around
vortex fields?

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.330 align:middle line:84%
This is a well studied
phenomenon already

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.600 align:middle line:90%
in the '30s and '40s in Russia.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.650 align:middle line:84%
A lot has been
written about this.

00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:00.920 align:middle line:84%
Vortex fields distort
gravity around them.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:04.770 align:middle line:84%
And here we have an answer
as to how cone shaped

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:09.060 align:middle line:84%
tools were used for levitation
devices, for casting spells,

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:13.710 align:middle line:84%
as saser beams, to cut metal,
to crush stone, and do pretty

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:15.630 align:middle line:90%
much anything you can imagine.

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:18.720 align:middle line:84%
Once you can focus a
specific sound frequency

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.780 align:middle line:84%
through a cone
shaped tool and you

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:23.110 align:middle line:84%
can manipulate it to
get whatever frequency

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:25.750 align:middle line:84%
you want-- because
clearly whoever

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:28.510 align:middle line:84%
designed this technology
knew what they were doing.

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:31.610 align:middle line:84%
So just like we can create
different laser beams that

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:34.130 align:middle line:84%
can either be a
pointer that's benign,

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:36.040 align:middle line:84%
or you can create
a laser beam that

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.370 align:middle line:84%
cuts metal in a
split second, you

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:40.620 align:middle line:84%
can have different
intensity saser

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:44.110 align:middle line:84%
beams that do different things
and have different effects.

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:48.330 align:middle line:84%
So you can direct a laser
or a saser beam at a stone,

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:51.600 align:middle line:84%
for example, expose it to
a prime resonance frequency

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.430 align:middle line:84%
of that stone, and
soften it to the point

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:57.890 align:middle line:84%
where you can mold it and
manipulate without raising

00:12:57.890 --> 00:12:59.880 align:middle line:90%
the temperature.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And these are the
things that we find

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.100 align:middle line:84%
from studying the
ancient technology

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:05.830 align:middle line:84%
and the ancient
civilizations that

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:07.810 align:middle line:84%
become very evident
these guys knew

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:09.840 align:middle line:84%
a lot more about
the laws of nature

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:13.640 align:middle line:84%
and how to manipulate this
nature for their own benefit.

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:14.900 align:middle line:90%
And that continues.

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:19.270 align:middle line:84%
This Mayan deity seen holding
two cone shaped tools,

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:21.910 align:middle line:84%
obviously doing
something very important.

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And another Mayan deity holding
cone shaped tools in his hands.

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And it always seems to
be two cone shaped tools.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.360 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it interesting?

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.730 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to go back to
this Mayan deity here.

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:35.150 align:middle line:84%
Because if you look
at the symbolism

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:39.830 align:middle line:84%
on this little statue,
you see the spirals

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:42.850 align:middle line:84%
around his head and the
spirals on top of his head,

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:44.440 align:middle line:84%
clearly indicating
to us that we're

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.900 align:middle line:84%
dealing with resonance,
and spiral, and vortex

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:50.500 align:middle line:84%
energy, energy, sound,
resonance, and frequency.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.410 align:middle line:84%
It's all encoded in these
images and these symbols

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:54.650 align:middle line:90%
from ancient times.

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:57.870 align:middle line:84%
And it continues in this
little golden statue.

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:00.450 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting that
both these Mayan statues

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:02.560 align:middle line:90%
happen to be made out of gold.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And here in the famous
Sumerian clay tablet relief,

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:09.800 align:middle line:84%
it is one of those
little cylinders

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.260 align:middle line:84%
that you push into
clay, and it brings out

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.350 align:middle line:90%
this little image in clay.

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:17.340 align:middle line:84%
And here we have the
creation of Adam,

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:20.160 align:middle line:84%
a famous depiction of
the creation of Adamu,

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.480 align:middle line:90%
the first human being.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And look what this guy in
the middle on this image

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.060 align:middle line:84%
is holding in his hand,
another cone shaped tool

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:29.810 align:middle line:84%
during the process of
the creation of Adamu.

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And then we encounter
these strange winged beings

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:38.930 align:middle line:84%
and bird shaped winged beings
that use cone shaped tools.

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And in this instance, they
even look like pine cones,

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:46.432 align:middle line:84%
as possibly also referring
to the pineal gland.

00:14:46.432 --> 00:14:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
evidence about this that's

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:52.060 align:middle line:84%
been shared by people like David
Wilcock and other researchers

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:54.760 align:middle line:84%
out there that have already
given us a lot of information

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:55.260 align:middle line:90%
about this.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.230 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not going dwell
on this for too long.

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:00.750 align:middle line:84%
But it's critical to
recognize the connection

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:02.790 align:middle line:84%
between these cone
shaped tools and all

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:06.430 align:middle line:84%
these other ancient cone
shaped tools in human history.

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:10.130 align:middle line:84%
These pine cones that are
held by these individuals

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:14.030 align:middle line:84%
were seemingly used in the
manipulation of the human race.

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:15.920 align:middle line:84%
Some are controlling
or manipulating

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:20.560 align:middle line:84%
the pineal gland, and also
the tree of life, or our DNA,

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:24.050 align:middle line:84%
manipulating it with
saser beam technology.

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:30.860 align:middle line:84%
Now remember, if Luc Montagnier
can generate DNA with sound

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:34.390 align:middle line:84%
in a test tube in a laboratory
with limited knowledge

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:38.620 align:middle line:84%
of this technology, imagine
what advanced beings

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:41.990 align:middle line:84%
with a full understanding
of this saser and resonance

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:44.870 align:middle line:84%
technology, what these
individuals can do,

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:49.690 align:middle line:84%
how they can manipulate and do
things to our internal organs,

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:52.770 align:middle line:84%
manipulate our pineal
gland and our DNA

00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:55.210 align:middle line:84%
in ways that we
can't understand yet.

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:57.840 align:middle line:84%
But we're getting
closer to it every day.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.820 align:middle line:84%
So it seems like
these winged and bird

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:03.930 align:middle line:84%
headed beings were manipulating
our DNA and our pineal gland.

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:06.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's also
important to recognize

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:10.750 align:middle line:84%
that the all seeing eye of Horus
is a well recognized symbol

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:14.270 align:middle line:84%
throughout all of human history,
and Egyptology specifically.

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And the all seeing
eye of Horus by now

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:19.990 align:middle line:84%
is well recognized to
represent the pineal gland.

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:23.550 align:middle line:84%
So it seems that
this pineal gland

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:26.790 align:middle line:84%
was a very important
organ in our body that

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:31.700 align:middle line:84%
had to be manipulated, that had
to be severed from our ability

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:32.870 align:middle line:90%
to use it.

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And this was, I believe,
part of the plan and the plot

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:39.290 align:middle line:84%
to create a species
with amnesia.

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:42.350 align:middle line:84%
Because the pineal
gland is a receiver,

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:45.440 align:middle line:84%
a frequency receiver,
is the third eye.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:48.870 align:middle line:84%
It has rods and cones just
like the retina in our eyes

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:50.170 align:middle line:90%
has rods and cones.

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:53.580 align:middle line:84%
It receives information,
and frequencies, and sound,

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:54.690 align:middle line:90%
and resonance.

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And it should allow us to
communicate telepathically.

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:01.790 align:middle line:84%
It should allow us all
the benefits of ESP.

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:05.180 align:middle line:84%
It should connect us to all
the knowledge and information

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:08.250 align:middle line:84%
in the resonance field and
the morphogenetic field.

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And yet somehow we've lost
the ability to do that.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And I suspect that the
manipulation of the human race

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:17.829 align:middle line:84%
goes back to this
particular time

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:21.980 align:middle line:84%
in human history when the
manipulation and the creation

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:24.710 align:middle line:84%
of a species with
amnesia really began,

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:29.000 align:middle line:84%
where they had to turn humans
into dumbed down obedient

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:29.910 align:middle line:90%
slaves.

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:33.480 align:middle line:84%
So they would follow the
instructions and the orders

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.570 align:middle line:84%
of the gods, or
these winged beings

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:37.470 align:middle line:90%
that came down from the sky.

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:41.350 align:middle line:84%
So the same way that
they were manipulating us

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:43.630 align:middle line:84%
in ancient times with
sound and frequency

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:48.720 align:middle line:84%
using saser technology,
using cone shaped tools,

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.860 align:middle line:90%
and nothing has changed today.

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:54.100 align:middle line:10%
We're still being manipulated
by sound, and frequency,

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:58.390 align:middle line:10%
and resonance through
TV, radio, cell phones.

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:02.290 align:middle line:10%
Anything that's electronic
and that emits frequencies

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:05.590 align:middle line:10%
and radio signals, cell
phone towers, Wi-Fi,

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:08.950 align:middle line:10%
everything around us is
affecting us in some way.

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And I suspect it's
maliciously intended

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:16.590 align:middle line:84%
to do us harm and act
as a tool of control.

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:20.280 align:middle line:10%
These symbols become-- that are
very well known to all of us

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:24.050 align:middle line:10%
around the world, the all seeing
eye of Horus in the CBS logo.

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And in the NBC logo, you've
got these six cone shaped tools

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:31.350 align:middle line:84%
facing the center
of the logo, which

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:35.460 align:middle line:84%
is the same logo as you find on
the wrist of this bird headed

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:36.180 align:middle line:90%
being.

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:38.490 align:middle line:84%
He has this-- looks
like a wristwatch

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:42.280 align:middle line:84%
with 12 cone shaped tools
that are facing the center.

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And in the NBC logo,
we have half of that,

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:49.250 align:middle line:84%
depicting that they know exactly
what they're talking about.

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And these logos are
very deeply encoded

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:54.610 align:middle line:84%
with this ancient
esoteric knowledge.

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And the cone shaped tool
mystery carries on these.

00:18:57.310 --> 00:19:01.060 align:middle line:84%
These cone shaped tools actually
provide the scientific evidence

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:04.220 align:middle line:84%
that we're looking for, that
they were indeed working

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:09.410 align:middle line:84%
as some sort of a saser tool
technological device that

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:11.200 align:middle line:90%
would focus the beams.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:15.440 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I say this is
because these particular tools

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:19.480 align:middle line:84%
are inscribed with
Sumerian or cuneiform text,

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.520 align:middle line:84%
as you can see
from these images.

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.610 align:middle line:90%
And this text has been decoded.

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And it says-- it talks
about that these tools were

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:30.770 align:middle line:84%
used in the construction
of the Sumerian temples.

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:32.860 align:middle line:84%
One of them actually
specifically

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:37.340 align:middle line:84%
talks about the construction
of the Temple of Inanna.

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:41.140 align:middle line:84%
So now, we have
cone shaped tools

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:45.220 align:middle line:84%
in all over human history, in
ancient mines and technology,

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:49.990 align:middle line:84%
Ed Leedskalnin levitating
giant coral stones,

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:52.970 align:middle line:84%
weighing several tons
with cone shaped tools.

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And now we have
cone shaped tools

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:57.580 align:middle line:84%
that tell us about
the construction

00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:01.460 align:middle line:84%
of the Temple of Inanna
out of giant stone blocks.

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:05.350 align:middle line:84%
I think we have enough
evidence to conclude that these

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:07.650 align:middle line:90%
were very important tools.

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And they use sound that
was the driving force

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:15.980 align:middle line:84%
to create the saser technology,
the vortex fields that

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:19.360 align:middle line:84%
then allow us to
levitate whatever

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.200 align:middle line:90%
objects we want to levitate.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's just the
beginning of it.

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:26.720 align:middle line:84%
It allows us to do all
kinds of other things.

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:31.240 align:middle line:84%
And this all kinds of other
stuff comes to us in nature.

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:34.070 align:middle line:84%
Some people refer to
this as biomimicry.

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And there's no better
example is biomimicry

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:40.790 align:middle line:84%
using cone shaped tools
by ancient architects

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:43.580 align:middle line:84%
and engineers, no
greater example

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:47.320 align:middle line:84%
that we find in the
example of a dragonfly.

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:49.780 align:middle line:84%
This is just the most
beautiful discovery

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:52.630 align:middle line:84%
that I've made in
recent months actually.

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:55.250 align:middle line:84%
When you look at a
dragonfly, first of all,

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:57.540 align:middle line:84%
we have to realize that
a dragonfly doesn't

00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.990 align:middle line:90%
flap its wings like birds do.

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:02.860 align:middle line:90%
A dragonfly vibrates its wings.

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:03.920 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't flap them.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:07.380 align:middle line:84%
It vibrates them and
creates sound frequencies.

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:10.260 align:middle line:84%
It creates resonance
fields and frequencies

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:14.340 align:middle line:84%
that then get shut in to
the wings of the dragonfly.

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:19.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, the wings are not filled
with arteries and veins

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:22.140 align:middle line:90%
as may seem to the naked eye.

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:25.560 align:middle line:84%
When you look closely at
the wings of a dragonfly,

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:28.450 align:middle line:84%
those things that
look like arteries

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:33.220 align:middle line:84%
are actually hollow tubes,
tubes that cross each other

00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:35.090 align:middle line:90%
and fill the whole wing.

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:40.790 align:middle line:84%
That resonance of the vibration
of the dragonfly wings

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:43.100 align:middle line:84%
makes its way into
these hollow tubes,

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:45.460 align:middle line:84%
and they resonate
throughout the hollow tubes.

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And guess what you
find scattered right

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:53.420 align:middle line:84%
across the bottom and throughout
all the sides of the wings

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:57.650 align:middle line:84%
of a dragonfly, are
these tiny little cones

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:02.330 align:middle line:84%
that make their way
pointing in all directions,

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:04.160 align:middle line:84%
coming out of
these hollow tubes.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:09.010 align:middle line:84%
So what we seem to have
here is the frequencies

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:12.300 align:middle line:84%
created by the dragonfly
vibrating as wings.

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:15.010 align:middle line:84%
The resonance field go
into these hollow tubes,

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:17.020 align:middle line:84%
shoot it through
these little cones.

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:18.830 align:middle line:90%
They create saser beams.

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And saser technology
create vortex fields

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:24.240 align:middle line:84%
and create a whole
distortion gravity

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:27.250 align:middle line:84%
field, in which the dragon-fly
finds itself and can

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:30.980 align:middle line:84%
move around freely in its
own gravity free area.

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:34.870 align:middle line:10%
This technology was used
by Viktor Grebennikov when

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:38.010 align:middle line:10%
he developed his levitation
device with insects'

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:39.760 align:middle line:10%
wings or bugs' wings.

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.750 align:middle line:84%
If you share this information
with someone that does not

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:46.340 align:middle line:84%
have the knowledge of these
cone shaped tools, and saser

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.200 align:middle line:84%
or technology,
and vortex fields,

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.950 align:middle line:84%
and distortion of gravity--
if you tell someone

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:53.650 align:middle line:84%
that, oh, this guy over
here built a levitation

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:55.970 align:middle line:84%
device with bugs' wings,
it sounds ludicrous.

00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:57.670 align:middle line:90%
It sounds laughable.

00:22:57.670 --> 00:22:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, poor
Viktor Grebennikov

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.900 align:middle line:84%
was laughed at when
he first shared

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:06.240 align:middle line:84%
this device and this
development with the world.

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:09.920 align:middle line:84%
However, so much research has
been done on this individual

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.140 align:middle line:90%
and on his device.

00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:12.930 align:middle line:90%
It really exists.

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:14.350 align:middle line:90%
It really works.

00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:15.770 align:middle line:90%
It really did work.

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And Viktor Grebennikov
just simply understood

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:21.850 align:middle line:84%
the technology behind
the wings of bugs

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:24.190 align:middle line:90%
and how bugs fly around.

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And by generating a frequency,
what he did basically

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:32.900 align:middle line:84%
is cover the bottom of his
device with these bugs' wings.

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:38.230 align:middle line:84%
And by creating a frequency and
feeding it into the bugs' wings

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:40.430 align:middle line:84%
that are filled with
these hollow tubes

00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:44.810 align:middle line:84%
and these tiny little cones that
then create the vortex fields,

00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:48.140 align:middle line:84%
and the saser beams,
and the gravity

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:51.890 align:middle line:84%
distortion, by vibrating that
and being able to control

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:54.430 align:middle line:84%
the sound vibrations
going in there,

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:58.420 align:middle line:84%
he was able to get his
device to lift and levitate.

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And he claims that he could make
this move faster than the speed

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:03.370 align:middle line:90%
of sound.

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:05.670 align:middle line:90%
And this is spectacular.

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:09.550 align:middle line:84%
It just shows us how studying
ancient civilizations

00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:12.990 align:middle line:84%
and the technology they used,
sound and resonance, that

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:17.460 align:middle line:84%
goes back to the creation of all
things, everything in creation

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:19.050 align:middle line:84%
comes out of sound
and resonance.

00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:21.280 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the most
beautiful examples how

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:25.510 align:middle line:84%
we can use the understanding
of sound and resonance

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:27.290 align:middle line:90%
in modern technology today.

00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:30.510 align:middle line:84%
If you think we've stopped
and we've run out of ideas,

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:32.200 align:middle line:90%
you'd be mistaken.

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:36.540 align:middle line:84%
Remember that the pineal
gland, this resonance

00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:38.850 align:middle line:84%
and sound frequency
receiver that

00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:44.170 align:middle line:84%
should allow us to have ESP
ability, the pineal gland

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:49.590 align:middle line:84%
is connected by the optic nerve
to our eyes and to the retina.

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:52.360 align:middle line:84%
Now what is at the
back of the retina?

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:54.330 align:middle line:90%
Rods and cones.

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And if we can channel our
thoughts, our ideas, our words,

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:02.860 align:middle line:84%
our sounds, and the frequencies
via the pineal gland

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:05.100 align:middle line:84%
through the optic
nerve, into the retina,

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:08.040 align:middle line:84%
and into the cones in
the backs of our eyes,

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:09.280 align:middle line:90%
guess what we can do?

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:12.830 align:middle line:84%
What we should all be able to
do is what this man here did.

00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:16.160 align:middle line:84%
We should all have
supernatural abilities simply

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.380 align:middle line:90%
using our eyes.

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:19.660 align:middle line:84%
Now once you start
combining the light

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:22.620 align:middle line:84%
from your eyes and the
sound from your mouth,

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:24.880 align:middle line:90%
guess what you have just done?

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:28.820 align:middle line:84%
You have become a co-creator
just like the source

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:30.020 align:middle line:90%
of all creation.

00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:34.720 align:middle line:84%
When God said let there be
light, the sound and the light

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:38.280 align:middle line:84%
combines and activates
the quantum soup

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.500 align:middle line:84%
of infinite possibility
and brings forth

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:43.270 align:middle line:90%
everything in creation.

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:45.430 align:middle line:84%
The sound of our
voice, the light

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:48.370 align:middle line:84%
of our eyes through
the codes in our retina

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:53.490 align:middle line:84%
turns us into creators of
anything we want to create.

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And it is this that we've
been prevented from knowing

00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:00.370 align:middle line:84%
and from achieving
as the human race

00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:02.310 align:middle line:84%
by those that have
been manipulating us

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:04.050 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years.

00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:07.420 align:middle line:84%
So we've got sound and
resonance going back

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:10.150 align:middle line:84%
to the origins of
everything in creation.

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:13.410 align:middle line:84%
We have sound and resonance
that should give us

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:15.560 align:middle line:90%
superhuman ability.

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:18.630 align:middle line:84%
We have millions of
ancient stone structures

00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:20.370 align:middle line:90%
at the southern tip of Africa.

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:25.990 align:middle line:84%
We have ancient structures and
ancient megalithic structures

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:29.050 align:middle line:84%
that cover the planet,
thousands, if not millions

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:32.490 align:middle line:84%
of stone structures that
cover the planet in ways

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:34.670 align:middle line:90%
that we can't even imagine.

00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:37.690 align:middle line:84%
What do we do with all this
knowledge and information?

00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:40.720 align:middle line:84%
Is there a site
in Southern Africa

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:45.690 align:middle line:84%
that is the flagship among
millions of stone circles

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:49.910 align:middle line:84%
and can point us in a
direction even more specific?

00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:51.070 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:54.130 align:middle line:84%
And that site is
called Adam's Calendar,

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:56.960 align:middle line:90%
also Annunaki installation.

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:59.750 align:middle line:84%
All the indicators are
that this particular site

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:03.782 align:middle line:84%
was created and established
by the Sumerian Enki,

00:27:03.782 --> 00:27:05.680 align:middle line:84%
a lot of information
that I will share

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.910 align:middle line:90%
with you in the next episode.

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:09.850 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for watching.

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:14.177 align:middle line:90%
