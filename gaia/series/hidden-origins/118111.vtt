00:00:05.489 --> 00:00:12.990 align:middle line:10%
[THEME MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.510 align:middle line:10%
>>Hello.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.100 align:middle line:10%
This is Michael Tellinger.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.750 align:middle line:10%
And we continue our exploration
into the ancient past,

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.470 align:middle line:10%
the murky origins of humankind
and our species on this planet

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.100 align:middle line:10%
to see what we can learn
from ancient civilizations

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.240 align:middle line:10%
and the wisdom of
the ancients that

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.780 align:middle line:10%
can benefit us into
the future of humanity

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.830 align:middle line:10%
on this planet of ours.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.140 align:middle line:84%
The last episode, we ended off
with exposing the more than 10

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.460 align:middle line:84%
million mysterious stone
structures scattered

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.940 align:middle line:90%
throughout Southern Africa.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.930 align:middle line:84%
And that is clearly
a very large number

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.150 align:middle line:84%
of stone structures and a
very definite indication

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.790 align:middle line:84%
that we're dealing with
a vanished civilization

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.190 align:middle line:90%
that we know very little about.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.270 align:middle line:84%
The big question is,
what happened to them,

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.780 align:middle line:84%
and why are so few of these
structures visible today?

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.490 align:middle line:84%
It's obvious that
something happened

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.610 align:middle line:84%
that stopped the
civilization from doing

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.790 align:middle line:90%
whatever it is they were doing.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And we find the evidence of
this in the Sumerian texts.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.030 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.770 align:middle line:84%
When we asked the
question, what happened,

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.320 align:middle line:84%
normally as usual we
find the Sumerian texts

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.510 align:middle line:90%
and the ancient civilizations.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.440 align:middle line:84%
And the ancient texts and give
us clear indications of what

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.110 align:middle line:90%
happened in the past.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.210 align:middle line:84%
These are two examples
of what we refer to

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.340 align:middle line:90%
as the Sumerian Kings Lists.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.070 align:middle line:84%
Number of these Kings
Lists have been found.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.670 align:middle line:84%
These two of particular
interest because they

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.870 align:middle line:84%
were found at different
places at different times.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And yet, they contain
exactly the same information.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.900 align:middle line:84%
The one, the larger
one obviously

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.180 align:middle line:84%
contains more information
than the smaller one.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.750 align:middle line:84%
But yet they contain-- the core
of the information is the same.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And they basically tell us
about a long period of time

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.620 align:middle line:84%
that spans more
than 220,000 years

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.530 align:middle line:84%
and cites a number of kings,
the same kings by name

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.130 align:middle line:84%
and by region that
ruled the world.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.470 align:middle line:84%
It also tells us
that these kings

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.460 align:middle line:84%
were appointed by the
gods in a statement that

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.130 align:middle line:84%
says that kinship was
lowered to Earth from heaven,

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.780 align:middle line:84%
or after kingship
descended from heaven.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.880 align:middle line:84%
And so we realize that this
is most likely the beginning

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.340 align:middle line:84%
of the royal bloodlines
on planet Earth,

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.360 align:middle line:84%
when some of the humans
were chosen by the gods

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.810 align:middle line:84%
to rule over the
rest of humanity.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very critical
point in our human history

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.700 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to come back
to when we start analyzing

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.860 align:middle line:84%
the origins of money and
the control of the planet

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.980 align:middle line:84%
through the system, the
monetary system that

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.150 align:middle line:90%
has enslaved all of us today.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.740 align:middle line:84%
What we find fascinating is that
this information is not only

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.570 align:middle line:84%
about the kings that ruled the
world that were given advanced

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.270 align:middle line:84%
technology and advanced
weapons with which they could

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.920 align:middle line:90%
smite and control the humans.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.430 align:middle line:84%
They were given knowledge
of alchemy and sorcery

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.720 align:middle line:84%
and wizardry and all
kinds of other things

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.540 align:middle line:84%
that we could not possibly
even imagine today.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.660 align:middle line:84%
Because clearly they had to
take control of the humanity.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.690 align:middle line:84%
One of the key things
that we read in these two

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.630 align:middle line:84%
particular tablets is at
the end of it, it says,

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.680 align:middle line:90%
"And then the flood swept over."

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
this is what happened

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.610 align:middle line:84%
to this vanished civilization
at the southern tip of Africa.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And if a picture can
tell a thousand words,

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.900 align:middle line:84%
then we can see from some
of these aerial photographs

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.920 align:middle line:84%
that a vast majority of
this vanished civilization

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.690 align:middle line:84%
in Southern Africa is covered
by large amounts of sediment

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.810 align:middle line:90%
and sea sand.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.070 align:middle line:84%
In front of Adam's
calendar, for example,

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.610 align:middle line:84%
in the Barberton Valley, we
have up to about 30 meters

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.390 align:middle line:90%
of sea sand sediment.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.880 align:middle line:84%
We have found sea shells
and fossilized fish

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.990 align:middle line:84%
on tops of mountains inside
of the stone circle walls that

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:09.820 align:middle line:84%
indicates that a large amount
of seawater and sea life

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.840 align:middle line:84%
came across and somehow
at some stage covered

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.370 align:middle line:84%
this whole part of the southern
part of Southern Africa.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And this brings us to
the Sumerian connection.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And we discover that
there is, as there

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.180 align:middle line:84%
is with most parts
of this planet,

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.520 align:middle line:84%
a very clear and
distinct connection

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.770 align:middle line:84%
between the Sumerian
civilization,

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.150 align:middle line:84%
the Sumerian tablets, and
the civilizations of Southern

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.980 align:middle line:90%
Africa.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And this is well encoded in
the ancient knowledge keepers

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.530 align:middle line:84%
and kept by the ancient
knowledge keepers of Southern

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.370 align:middle line:84%
Africa, like Baba Credo
Mutwa, for example,

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.400 align:middle line:84%
who speaks volumes about the
Anunnaki and the Sumerians

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.190 align:middle line:84%
and the influence
of the Sumerian

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.700 align:middle line:84%
and the Sumerian culture on
the people of Southern Africa

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.460 align:middle line:84%
and the interconnectedness
of these civilizations on top

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.400 align:middle line:90%
of each other.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we meet the
Anunna gods, or the Anunnaki,

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.800 align:middle line:84%
as the Sumerian
texts refer to them.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.560 align:middle line:84%
And we meet Anu,
Enlil, and Enki,

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.270 align:middle line:84%
what could be described as
the Sumerian holy trinity.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And we got to ask
ourselves, well,

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.640 align:middle line:84%
what is all this activity
in Southern Africa about?

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And as always, as
we've mentioned before,

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.530 align:middle line:90%
it's always about the gold.

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.360 align:middle line:84%
We cannot separate our
origins and our history from

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.130 align:middle line:90%
our obsession with gold.

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.450 align:middle line:84%
But I have to point
out at this point

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.010 align:middle line:84%
that whenever the explorers
from Europe-- or should

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:35.000 align:middle line:84%
we call them the conquerors,
not necessarily explorers,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.677 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes I refer to them
as the thugs from Europe,

00:05:37.677 --> 00:05:39.510 align:middle line:84%
because that's really
what they were doing--

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.160 align:middle line:84%
just invading the
rest of the world

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.310 align:middle line:90%
and claiming it as their own.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.810 align:middle line:84%
When they started invading the
free world about 500 years ago,

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:52.240 align:middle line:84%
the one strange phenomenon that
they found, the native people

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.070 align:middle line:90%
that they invaded had no money.

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:57.700 align:middle line:90%
They had no jails.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And they had a completely
different belief system

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.810 align:middle line:84%
from what they
explored or what they

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.230 align:middle line:90%
were introduced to in Europe.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.070 align:middle line:84%
What they found was a
huge amount of gold.

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.670 align:middle line:84%
All these ancient cultures
seemed to have a lot of gold.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.370 align:middle line:10%
But they always told them that
the gold doesn't belong to us.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.620 align:middle line:10%
The gold belongs to the gods.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.910 align:middle line:10%
And therefore, we realize
that the Anunnaki were

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:24.130 align:middle line:10%
in charge of this vast gold
mining empire on planet Earth

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:27.200 align:middle line:10%
and the gold always
belonged to them.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.370 align:middle line:84%
Remember that the old money in
ancient times was never gold.

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.290 align:middle line:84%
Gold coins were just minted
for special occasions.

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.730 align:middle line:84%
Money in ancient times
was always silver, or more

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:40.940 align:middle line:84%
often than not silver, in
between other ways of trading

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.530 align:middle line:90%
and exchanging things.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.510 align:middle line:84%
So the gold always
belonged to the gods

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.690 align:middle line:84%
and only on special occasions
would they mint golden coins.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's from that obsession
for the gold by the gods

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.080 align:middle line:90%
that we inherit our obsession.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.640 align:middle line:84%
Because humans were never
allowed to have the gold.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.950 align:middle line:84%
So when we landed
a piece of gold

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:02.880 align:middle line:84%
or when we were granted or given
a piece of gold by the gods,

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.750 align:middle line:84%
it became a very prized
position and something

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.750 align:middle line:84%
that everyone would
be envious about.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And we would hang
it around our necks

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.760 align:middle line:84%
and wear it as jewelry
and ornamental kind

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.760 align:middle line:84%
of things that would be
envied by everyone else.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is where our
obsession with gold comes from,

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.940 align:middle line:84%
most likely from this
period in human history.

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.090 align:middle line:84%
So the ancient history
of Southern Africa

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:26.800 align:middle line:90%
is all about the gold.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.140 align:middle line:84%
But there is a
more recent history

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.170 align:middle line:90%
that we can explore as well.

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:34.960 align:middle line:84%
We read in the Sumerian
tablets that the Anunnaki

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.770 align:middle line:84%
explored the gold in this
place called the Abzu.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
specific translation

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.020 align:middle line:84%
that we get from
Zecharia Sitchin.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.640 align:middle line:84%
Now remember that Zecharia
Sitchin didn't know anything

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:49.720 align:middle line:84%
about the large number of
stone ruins in Southern Africa.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.370 align:middle line:84%
He extracted most
of his information

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:54.050 align:middle line:90%
from the Sumerian texts.

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:57.820 align:middle line:84%
So what we present
here in this series

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:01.760 align:middle line:84%
is a lot of physical evidence
for much of Zecharia Sitchin's

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:06.910 align:middle line:84%
research and his lifelong
study of the Sumerian texts.

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:09.090 align:middle line:84%
What we find in this
particular translation

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:12.010 align:middle line:84%
is quite staggering, because
it tells us about the Abzu

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:14.400 align:middle line:90%
as being the place of gold.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.430 align:middle line:84%
It says, "Where the landmass,
the shape of a heart

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:20.640 align:middle line:84%
was given, in the
lower part thereof,

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:24.800 align:middle line:84%
golden veins from Earth's
innards were abundant.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:30.100 align:middle line:84%
Abzu, of gold the birthplace,
Ea to the region the name gave,"

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.840 align:middle line:84%
Ea being Enki, the
same individual.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And so we move on to what we
can call the golden surprise.

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:42.929 align:middle line:84%
Because what we'll find-- and
this is a very important thing

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:46.660 align:middle line:84%
for us to digest--
the Anunnaki were not

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:51.120 align:middle line:84%
interested in the shiny,
metallic form of gold.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.730 align:middle line:84%
This is where our
obsession comes from.

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:56.640 align:middle line:84%
But the Anunnaki
and the gods were

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.110 align:middle line:84%
interested in the
white powder of gold,

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:01.660 align:middle line:90%
or the monatomic form of gold.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:04.830 align:middle line:84%
Much research is
being done pretty much

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:06.960 align:middle line:84%
in hidden laboratories
around the world.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.210 align:middle line:84%
But the secret
government projects

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:12.810 align:middle line:84%
and the secret
research laboratories

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:13.900 align:middle line:90%
know a lot about this.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:17.740 align:middle line:84%
But one individual
in Phoenix, Arizona

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:20.830 align:middle line:84%
by the name of David Hudson
did some phenomenal research

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:23.580 align:middle line:84%
with this thing called
the white powder of gold.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And he's one of
the few civilians

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.280 align:middle line:84%
that really knows what's
going on with this substance.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.450 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about
monatomic gold--

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:33.670 align:middle line:84%
because this is ultimately
what the Anunnaki obsessed

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:37.030 align:middle line:84%
with-- gold in its
monatomic form, sometimes

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:41.430 align:middle line:84%
referred to as ORME-- Orbitally
Rearranged Monatomic Elements,

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:43.520 align:middle line:90%
as David Hudson called it.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:47.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you take a
golden atom, which is Au1,

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:53.440 align:middle line:84%
so it means that the golden atom
as an orbit on the outside that

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.090 align:middle line:90%
has only got one electron in it.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:57.960 align:middle line:84%
So to complete the bond,
it needs another electron.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.960 align:middle line:84%
So what it does,
it binds to itself.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:04.320 align:middle line:90%
So a golden atom is always Au2.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.710 align:middle line:90%
So it's a stable golden atom.

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:11.490 align:middle line:84%
But if you prevent the golden
atom from binding to itself,

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:14.590 align:middle line:84%
it remains in a
white, fluffy form.

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And it remains in a white,
fluffy powderous state that

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:20.840 align:middle line:90%
has no metallic properties.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.540 align:middle line:90%
It defies gravity.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:25.710 align:middle line:84%
It does very strange
things that defies

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:27.740 align:middle line:84%
pretty much everything
we understand

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:29.930 align:middle line:90%
in the laws of physics today.

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:32.400 align:middle line:90%
It levitates.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.180 align:middle line:84%
Some of the things that
David Hudson shared with me

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:38.050 align:middle line:84%
in the many discussions that
I had with him was that while

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:42.340 align:middle line:84%
they were doing the research in
the MIT laboratories for about

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:46.000 align:middle line:84%
two or three years, and
none of this was documented,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.920 align:middle line:84%
because remember that mainstream
scientific laboratories will

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.920 align:middle line:84%
not publish papers or document
anything or make anything

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.840 align:middle line:84%
public that they cannot
explain scientifically.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:00.810 align:middle line:84%
So because they couldn't explain
any of this bizarre activity,

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:04.050 align:middle line:84%
behavior of monatomic
gold-- couldn't explain it

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.940 align:middle line:84%
scientifically-- none of
this has ever been published.

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:09.780 align:middle line:84%
What you find is
that when they had

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:12.860 align:middle line:84%
this pile of white,
fluffy powder

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:20.820 align:middle line:84%
inside an inert tube of gas--
or in a tube of inert gas,

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:24.640 align:middle line:84%
should I say-- and it was on a
little pan that they put this.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.770 align:middle line:84%
When he brought his
hand up underneath it,

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:31.690 align:middle line:84%
the pile of white powder
started to lift up and levitate,

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:34.860 align:middle line:84%
which suggests that we have
monatomic elements in our body.

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And it was reacting to
the monatomic elements

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:39.520 align:middle line:90%
being brought up.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:44.280 align:middle line:84%
Like bringing a magnet negative
to negative, it repels it.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.570 align:middle line:84%
So this is what
seems to be happening

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:51.360 align:middle line:84%
is that when we find
this monatomic substance,

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:56.140 align:middle line:84%
we can manipulate it with
the energy in our own bodies.

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.020 align:middle line:84%
For me, one of the
most important things

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:03.360 align:middle line:84%
that David Hudson found is that
between 700 and 800 degrees

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:08.490 align:middle line:84%
Celsius, this pile of white,
fluffy powder vanished

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:10.020 align:middle line:90%
from sight.

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.480 align:middle line:84%
This was a spectacular
achievement.

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:17.230 align:middle line:84%
Because at one stage I thought
it just became invisible.

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:19.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, we've already
spoken about the fact

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:22.550 align:middle line:84%
that sound and resonance
can make things invisible.

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:26.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, 700 degrees of
Celsius is just a frequency.

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:31.340 align:middle line:84%
It's a resonance at a
very specific vibration.

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:35.450 align:middle line:84%
So at that specific resonance,
the white, fluffy powder

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:36.350 align:middle line:90%
disappears.

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:38.640 align:middle line:84%
They thought that it just
disappeared from sight.

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:42.730 align:middle line:84%
So they wiped the pan
clear, cleaned it,

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:45.930 align:middle line:84%
thinking that maybe they
just disrupted or disturb it.

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:48.630 align:middle line:84%
When they started bringing
the temperature down,

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:51.030 align:middle line:84%
the pile of fluffy
powder reemerged

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:52.790 align:middle line:90%
where it disappeared from.

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:57.480 align:middle line:84%
What this tells us that between
700 and 800 degrees Celsius,

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:01.940 align:middle line:84%
monatomic gold goes into
a different dimension.

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And this is critical information
to why the Anunnaki were

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:10.720 align:middle line:84%
obsessed with monatomic and
not the shiny, metallic gold

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.540 align:middle line:84%
that most of us
are obsessed with

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:14.630 align:middle line:84%
and that drives
the global markets.

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And remember, this
is why we've had

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:22.510 align:middle line:84%
such a long and inextricable
history with gold becoming

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.520 align:middle line:84%
the major driving force of our
economy in the world today.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:28.380 align:middle line:84%
There are over 600
African mythologies

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:31.660 align:middle line:84%
that talk about the sky
gods coming down to Earth

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:33.610 align:middle line:90%
and doing a variety of things.

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:36.920 align:middle line:84%
The Zulu African tradition is
a specifically interesting one,

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.910 align:middle line:84%
because it comes
from Southern Africa.

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And they refer to the
sky gods as the Abelungu,

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:43.430 align:middle line:90%
who came down from the sky.

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:45.220 align:middle line:90%
And what did these Abelungu do?

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:47.060 align:middle line:90%
They created the humans.

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:48.070 align:middle line:90%
To do what?

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:51.620 align:middle line:84%
To be the slaves in the
gold mines for the Anunnaki.

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:53.210 align:middle line:90%
For the gods.

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:56.700 align:middle line:84%
Zulu, the word Zulu,
means "people of the sky."

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:59.560 align:middle line:84%
Very vaguely-- it's got a
far more deeper and more

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:00.650 align:middle line:90%
mysterious meaning.

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:06.110 align:middle line:84%
But for a lack of going into
deep, philosophical debates

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:09.670 align:middle line:84%
out the true meaning of the
word, let's stick to Zulu

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:11.450 align:middle line:90%
means "people of the sky."

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:16.470 align:middle line:84%
Abelungu means "pale sky gods,"
people that came from the sky.

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And there is a word for the
Sumerian god Enki in Zulu.

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:24.820 align:middle line:84%
He's known as Enkai, the
creator of the human race.

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:27.320 align:middle line:90%
Solomon is known as Shelumi.

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And Abantu, or the Abantu
people of Southern Africa,

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:36.240 align:middle line:84%
are referred to by Baba Credo
Mutwa as the children of Antu,

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.520 align:middle line:90%
as in Ab-Antu.

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:42.020 align:middle line:84%
As we often do in English, the
original people of Australia

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:47.520 align:middle line:84%
are called ab-original people,
to negate their origins

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:48.930 align:middle line:90%
and who they truly are.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And Baba Credo Mutwa says
that the children of Antu

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:54.290 align:middle line:90%
are the Abantu people.

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And they were called Abantu to
negate the fact that they are

00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.210 align:middle line:90%
actually the children of Antu.

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:00.490 align:middle line:90%
Well, who's Antu?

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:04.990 align:middle line:84%
Antu was the wife of Anu, the
supreme Sumerian commander that

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:08.660 align:middle line:84%
came to Earth, whose
sons Enlil and Enki took

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.090 align:middle line:90%
control of our planet.

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:13.340 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of very deep,
mysterious African knowledge

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.860 align:middle line:84%
and philosophy
that can be shared.

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And I suggest that
you look into this

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:20.000 align:middle line:84%
and possibly look
into some of my books,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.560 align:middle line:84%
where I expand more detail
into this particular part

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:25.630 align:middle line:90%
of human history.

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:28.220 align:middle line:84%
So let's go into some
more examples of more

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:29.870 align:middle line:90%
recent gold money activity.

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:34.420 align:middle line:84%
Because we cannot escape
this thing of mining gold

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:35.820 align:middle line:90%
in Southern Africa.

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:38.430 align:middle line:84%
In the late 1400s,
I mentioned already

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:41.230 align:middle line:84%
that the Portuguese came
around the Cape of Good Hope

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:42.600 align:middle line:90%
or the Cape of Storms.

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And they come onshore and
they meet the native people

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:49.410 align:middle line:90%
and they find many stone ruins.

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And some of them
are spectacular,

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:53.290 align:middle line:84%
like this image here
of Great Zimbabwe,

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:57.260 align:middle line:84%
where the walls are six meters
wide and 10 meters high.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:01.030 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, a very strong
fortress for ancient cultures

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:02.670 align:middle line:90%
and ancient civilizations.

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:06.000 align:middle line:10%
When they asked the local
people, whose land is this,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.720 align:middle line:10%
they were told that this is
the "Terra Dos Macomates."

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:13.270 align:middle line:10%
This is, in Portuguese it
means, "the land of the Makomati

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:14.140 align:middle line:10%
people."

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:17.380 align:middle line:10%
Well, we go to ask ourselves,
who are the Makomati people?

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:20.800 align:middle line:10%
And the Makomati people
are Dravidian gold miners

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:25.760 align:middle line:10%
that go back thousands of years,
mining gold, trading with gold,

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.020 align:middle line:10%
and doing business
between Southern

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:29.840 align:middle line:10%
Africa and southern India.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.970 align:middle line:84%
The Dravidians come from the
southern part of India and Sri

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:38.370 align:middle line:84%
Lanka and they're well known
for their activities and trading

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:40.790 align:middle line:84%
with gold for
thousands of years.

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:44.710 align:middle line:84%
From 700 AD, we
have amazing stories

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:47.920 align:middle line:84%
from the island of Zanzibar,
how Zanzibar was already

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:52.850 align:middle line:84%
doing business with the port of
Sofala, doing business in gold,

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:53.980 align:middle line:90%
trading in gold.

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, where is the
port of Sofala?

00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:57.690 align:middle line:84%
If you don't know
where Zanzibar is,

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:01.790 align:middle line:84%
Zanzibar is right between--
it's a little island which also

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:05.690 align:middle line:84%
has the terrible
history of slavery where

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:09.960 align:middle line:84%
slaves were exported from Africa
into the rest of the world.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:14.550 align:middle line:84%
But Zanzibar was a trading
post with the port of Sofala.

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:17.339 align:middle line:84%
Now, the port of Sofala
is further down south

00:17:17.339 --> 00:17:18.900 align:middle line:90%
on the coast of Mozambique.

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:22.599 align:middle line:84%
And it's a well-known port
that did a lot of trade

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:24.069 align:middle line:90%
into the rest of the world.

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:27.869 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize how important
this part of Southern Africa

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:28.560 align:middle line:90%
was.

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:31.560 align:middle line:84%
The Phoenicians did trade
there, and pretty much

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:35.580 align:middle line:84%
all of the known world was
trading with Southern Africa

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:37.410 align:middle line:90%
from the port of Sofala.

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:39.800 align:middle line:84%
In the 11th century,
Ahmad Al Biruni

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.780 align:middle line:84%
describes the
prosperous gold exports

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:44.470 align:middle line:90%
from the port of Sofala.

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:46.350 align:middle line:90%
And so we move on.

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And the gold was apparently
a month's journey

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:51.140 align:middle line:90%
inland from the port of Sofala.

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:53.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, what happens when
you go a month's journey

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:55.660 align:middle line:90%
inland from the port of Sofala?

00:17:55.660 --> 00:18:00.730 align:middle line:84%
Remember, Sofala is just south
of the modern day town of Beira

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:02.390 align:middle line:90%
on the coast of Mozambique.

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:04.350 align:middle line:84%
If you go just south
of that and you

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:08.170 align:middle line:84%
go inland, travel on foot
and on horseback for a month

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:10.150 align:middle line:84%
through treacherous
country with lions

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:12.280 align:middle line:84%
and other animals who want
to eat you-- remember,

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.550 align:middle line:84%
this is a different
time in human history.

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:18.950 align:middle line:84%
There were no roads or
highways or train tracks

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:20.240 align:middle line:90%
that'll take you there.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:24.520 align:middle line:84%
So a month tracking inland,
where do you get to?

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.250 align:middle line:90%
You get to Masvingo in Zimbabwe.

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:29.980 align:middle line:10%
And that's where you find
Great Zimbabwe ruins.

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And this is a spectacular bit
of discovery-- Great Zimbabwe,

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.070 align:middle line:90%
or the house of stone.

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:40.170 align:middle line:84%
Great Zimbabwe itself has
far more mysterious meanings

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:41.940 align:middle line:90%
than just house of stone.

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:46.510 align:middle line:84%
Because encoded in the word
"Zimbabwe," is zimbawe,

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:49.800 align:middle line:84%
zimba, simba, the lion,
the roar of the lion,

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:54.450 align:middle line:84%
is connected to sound, sound
and resonance and the ability

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:56.670 align:middle line:84%
to control sound
and resonance that

00:18:56.670 --> 00:19:01.230 align:middle line:84%
is related to the roar of a lion
and the manipulation of sound.

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:05.520 align:middle line:84%
There's so much ancient mystery
encoded in all of this stuff

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.130 align:middle line:84%
that it could keep us busy
for the rest of our lives,

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:12.000 align:middle line:84%
trying to figure out how this
mysterious stuff is encoded

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:18.180 align:middle line:84%
in our stories, the ancient
history that's been handed down

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:20.960 align:middle line:84%
from civilization
to civilization,

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:24.450 align:middle line:84%
and in the language
that we use today,

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:27.760 align:middle line:84%
in the words and the structure
of our sentences that we use.

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:31.290 align:middle line:84%
All of this stuff is deeply
encoded in everything

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:32.340 align:middle line:90%
we do today.

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:34.470 align:middle line:84%
When we get to Great
Zimbabwe, we also

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:38.270 align:middle line:84%
meet the Monomotapa kingdom,
the great golden kings

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:39.610 align:middle line:90%
that were never defeated.

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And these were the ancient
southern African kings.

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And actually, the
Monomotapa kingdom

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:49.850 align:middle line:84%
stretched right across Southern
Africa into central Africa

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:53.340 align:middle line:84%
and into Zambia and
Kenya and Tanzania.

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:57.860 align:middle line:84%
And it was a huge kingdom that
lasted for hundreds of years.

00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And these were the
guys that are providing

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:04.940 align:middle line:84%
the gold for the trade as it
came to the port of Sofala.

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:08.240 align:middle line:84%
It's fascinating that the
Monomotapa kingdom is also

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:12.680 align:middle line:84%
connected further south,
southwest of Great Zimbabwe.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:15.060 align:middle line:84%
About 400 kilometers,
right on the border

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:18.700 align:middle line:84%
of modern day Botswana,
South Africa, and Zimbabwe,

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:23.490 align:middle line:84%
we find the famous
ruins of Mapungubwe,

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:27.830 align:middle line:84%
where there's now a big museum
and the so-called ancestors

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:30.590 align:middle line:90%
of the Great Zimbabwe ruins.

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:34.080 align:middle line:84%
I find that a very
strange coincidence,

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.130 align:middle line:84%
because there's not
much of that suggests

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:37.790 align:middle line:90%
that in terms of ruins.

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And we find that there's
a much older civilization

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:44.720 align:middle line:84%
that we find at Great
Zimbabwe than at Mapungupwe.

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:49.060 align:middle line:84%
However, there is a connection
to the Dravidian gold miners,

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:52.425 align:middle line:84%
or the Makumati people and
some of these golden artifacts

00:20:52.425 --> 00:20:57.010 align:middle line:84%
that were found in the
'30s, 1930s, specifically

00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:58.350 align:middle line:90%
the golden rhino.

00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why I suggest
that this is connected

00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:04.620 align:middle line:84%
to the Dravidians, because
the golden rhino discovered

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:07.320 align:middle line:90%
at Mapungupwe only has one horn.

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:10.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, African rhinos
have two horns.

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.670 align:middle line:84%
One-horned rhinos
come from India.

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And this suggests that the
Dravidians were active there.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And this may most likely
be some of their handiwork

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:23.170 align:middle line:84%
as they were trading
and dealing in gold.

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:27.670 align:middle line:84%
So let's get back to the work in
the Abzu and the Sumerian texts

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:30.660 align:middle line:84%
that talk about this place
called the Abzu where

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:32.840 align:middle line:90%
all the gold came from.

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:35.890 align:middle line:84%
There's some spectacular
Sumerian translations

00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:37.730 align:middle line:84%
that we get from
Zecharia Sitchin.

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Now remember, he did not
know about any of this

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:43.250 align:middle line:84%
when he was writing
this stuff down.

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:46.500 align:middle line:84%
So what we're doing here is
providing the physical evidence

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.030 align:middle line:90%
for much of his work.

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:51.710 align:middle line:84%
This translation is
absolutely staggering.

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:54.770 align:middle line:84%
It says, "In the
Abzu, Enki plans

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:58.290 align:middle line:84%
was conceiving where to
build his house, where

00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:02.920 align:middle line:84%
for heroes dwellings to prepare,
where the bowels of the earth

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:06.370 align:middle line:90%
to enter," to mine the gold.

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:10.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, is there a ruin or
an ancient stone structure

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:15.760 align:middle line:84%
that could possibly be seen as
Enki's home or Enki's abode?

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And I suggest that Great
Zimbabwe is exactly that place.

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:23.340 align:middle line:84%
I grew up on the gold
mines in South Africa.

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's fascinating,
because it's probably there

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:31.850 align:middle line:84%
that I discovered the fact that
we could live without money.

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:33.350 align:middle line:84%
Because living on
the gold mines,

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:35.530 align:middle line:84%
everything's provided
to you for free.

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:38.855 align:middle line:84%
As long as you work in the gold
mines, everything is for free.

00:22:38.855 --> 00:22:40.009 align:middle line:90%
Your house is for free.

00:22:40.009 --> 00:22:40.800 align:middle line:90%
Your water is free.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.395 align:middle line:90%
Your electricity is free.

00:22:42.395 --> 00:22:43.500 align:middle line:90%
Your car is free.

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.090 align:middle line:90%
Your petrol is free.

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:47.110 align:middle line:90%
Your garden service is free.

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:50.380 align:middle line:84%
All the sporting facilities
are laid on for free.

00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:53.160 align:middle line:84%
Five star sporting facilities
that you can imagine,

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:53.910 align:middle line:90%
and so it goes.

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:57.850 align:middle line:84%
As long as you work in the
mine, all the stuff is for free.

00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And the mine manager always
lives in the big white house

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:01.940 align:middle line:90%
on the hill.

00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:04.840 align:middle line:84%
So whenever you get to one of
these mining towns in South

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:07.460 align:middle line:84%
Africa, and you want to
find the mine manager,

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:10.480 align:middle line:84%
just look around you and see the
big white house on the highest

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:14.230 align:middle line:84%
hill, and that's inevitably
the mine manager's house.

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And I suggest that
Great Zimbabwe is this.

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:24.050 align:middle line:84%
Since Enki was the founder of
this vast gold mining empire

00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:27.350 align:middle line:84%
and Great Zimbabwe is by
far the most impressive

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:30.570 align:middle line:84%
of all the ancient ruins and
structures in Southern Africa,

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:34.030 align:middle line:84%
I suggest that maybe this
is the mine manager's house,

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:36.160 align:middle line:90%
big white house on the hill.

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:39.250 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot more to
be said about Great Zimbabwe

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:41.310 align:middle line:84%
that we may get
to in this series.

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:44.840 align:middle line:84%
So this is what Enki's house
would look like from the air.

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:47.060 align:middle line:84%
And you see that
very quickly, it

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:49.850 align:middle line:84%
resembles the millions
of stone structures

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:53.220 align:middle line:84%
and the stone circles
in Southern Africa.

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:57.130 align:middle line:84%
Some of the most mysterious
objects found at Great Zimbabwe

00:23:57.130 --> 00:24:01.060 align:middle line:84%
were discovered and
described by Theodore Bent

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:04.520 align:middle line:84%
in the late 1800s
and very early 1900s.

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And these were the
mysterious stone birds

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.880 align:middle line:84%
that can be linked to gold
mining in Egypt and gold mining

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:14.450 align:middle line:84%
activity by the Anunnaki
in Southern Africa.

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:16.260 align:middle line:84%
These stone birds
are fascinating.

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:17.780 align:middle line:90%
They're very basic shapes.

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:20.320 align:middle line:84%
They're known as
birds on pedestals.

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And some of the most basic
ones is just an elongated stone

00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:27.550 align:middle line:84%
that's got a wing
carved into it and then

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:29.520 align:middle line:84%
little eye at the
top of the stone.

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:34.460 align:middle line:84%
And normally, the stone
has got a rounded side

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:37.240 align:middle line:84%
that suggests that it's the
head of the bird looking up

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:43.240 align:middle line:84%
at the sky with wing underneath,
like in this particular image

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.280 align:middle line:90%
on the right hand side.

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:45.820 align:middle line:84%
That's a very good
example of that.

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:49.750 align:middle line:84%
What we find is that these birds
were most likely the guardians

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:51.150 align:middle line:90%
of the gold miners.

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I say this
is because Theodore Bent,

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:57.530 align:middle line:84%
in his discoveries in
his exploration in Egypt

00:24:57.530 --> 00:25:00.010 align:middle line:84%
before he came to
Southern Africa,

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:03.380 align:middle line:84%
he explored many gold mines
and ancient mines in Egypt.

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And he found at the
entrances to the mines,

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:10.390 align:middle line:84%
carved out in the rock, were
these birds on pedestals,

00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:11.880 align:middle line:90%
something like this.

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And then they became famous
statues and sculptures

00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:16.330 align:middle line:90%
throughout Egypt.

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:20.170 align:middle line:84%
But he found these carvings
of birds on pedestals

00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:23.220 align:middle line:84%
into the entrances of
these gold mines in Egypt.

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And when he discovered these
stone birds on pedestals

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:30.860 align:middle line:84%
at Great Zimbabwe, I
put two and two together

00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:33.380 align:middle line:84%
and realized that we're
most likely dealing

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:37.630 align:middle line:84%
with the original prototypes
in very old and ancient gold

00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:41.440 align:middle line:84%
mines of Southern Africa, the
Anunnaki gold mining empire.

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And these birds
on pedestals, they

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:47.610 align:middle line:84%
were created as little
mascots to protect

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:49.840 align:middle line:84%
the gold miners in
these ancient mines

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:52.650 align:middle line:84%
and look up for
protection to the gods.

00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:55.330 align:middle line:84%
Because they were known
as gods that could fly,

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:57.800 align:middle line:84%
the winged beings or the
feathered serpent that

00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:59.320 align:middle line:90%
came down from the sky.

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:02.990 align:middle line:84%
So they were depicted as winged
beings or birdlike beings.

00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And they would bring
protection for the gold miners

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:07.950 align:middle line:90%
in these ancient gold mines.

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:12.450 align:middle line:84%
I found many similar
bird-shaped stones

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:14.900 align:middle line:84%
in the stone ruins of
Southern Africa, which

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:19.000 align:middle line:84%
makes me think that
the Zimbabwe birds are

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.100 align:middle line:84%
a much later version of these
very basic birdlike shapes,

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:27.030 align:middle line:84%
which is a broad base
and a narrow head

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:29.310 align:middle line:84%
and a neck that
leads up to the head

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:32.270 align:middle line:84%
and looks up for protection
from the gods in the sky.

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, these birds
become giant monoliths

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:38.290 align:middle line:84%
and giant standing stones
that have been carved out

00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:42.230 align:middle line:84%
into the shapes of birds in a
much larger fashion than just

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:44.490 align:middle line:90%
smaller statues.

00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:48.410 align:middle line:10%
And this brings us to more
Sumerian texts and translations

00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:52.030 align:middle line:10%
and references to the
gold mining empire

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:55.220 align:middle line:10%
of Anunnaki and Enki,
who established this

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:57.560 align:middle line:10%
in the Abzu or Southern Africa.

00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.860 align:middle line:10%
Here is a fascinating
translation.

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:03.760 align:middle line:10%
And this refers to possibly
Enki's house and Enki's mines

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:06.650 align:middle line:10%
and the technology
he used to create

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:09.980 align:middle line:10%
these gold mines and the
tunnels and the mine shafts.

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:14.680 align:middle line:10%
It says, "The earth splitter
Enki there established,

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:17.550 align:middle line:10%
therewith in the
Earth a gash to make.

00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:20.250 align:middle line:10%
By way of tunnels,
Earth's innards

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:24.270 align:middle line:10%
to reach, the golden
veins to uncover."

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:26.410 align:middle line:84%
It's very obvious what
we're reading here.

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And it clearly refers to
mining gold on a large scale.

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:32.580 align:middle line:84%
But the Anunnaki
we're not getting

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:35.800 align:middle line:84%
enough gold out of the
ground, and they needed help.

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:37.410 align:middle line:90%
So what did they do?

00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:39.270 align:middle line:90%
They decided to clone a species.

00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And Enki was the main architect
and the main scientist

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:47.280 align:middle line:84%
behind this together
with what seems

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:52.440 align:middle line:84%
to be his sister and his son
and Ninhursag and Ningishzidda,

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:56.080 align:middle line:84%
and some other scientists around
them, these Anunnaki, very,

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:57.780 align:middle line:90%
very smart individuals.

00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And if we have time
in this series,

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:03.210 align:middle line:84%
we'll explore more about
who the Anunnaki really are

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:06.570 align:middle line:84%
and the fact that they are
very, very powerful beings.

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:10.360 align:middle line:84%
They're not just a bunch of
guys that can fly around space

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:12.090 align:middle line:90%
and go from planet to planet.

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:14.340 align:middle line:84%
These individuals
are far more powerful

00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:17.250 align:middle line:84%
than meets the eye and
that what we can imagine.

00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:19.640 align:middle line:84%
Here is a translation
once again and then

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:22.880 align:middle line:84%
we find in Sitchin's work
referring to this gold mining

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:27.110 align:middle line:84%
activity and the creation
of Adam and Adamu

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:28.990 align:middle line:90%
in Southern Africa.

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:32.140 align:middle line:84%
"Let us create a Lulu,
a primitive worker,

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:34.360 align:middle line:90%
the hardship work to take over.

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:38.550 align:middle line:84%
Let the being, the toil of the
Anunnaki carry on his back."

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And it continues,
where they decide

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:45.100 align:middle line:84%
to create the Adam, or the
first being as a slave.

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:47.700 align:middle line:84%
"A primitive worker
shall be created.

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:49.835 align:middle line:90%
Our command will he understand.

00:28:49.835 --> 00:28:53.360 align:middle line:84%
Our tools he will handle to
the Anunnaki and the Abzu,

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.020 align:middle line:90%
relief shall come."

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:58.510 align:middle line:84%
Over and over again,
we hear about the Abzu,

00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:01.320 align:middle line:84%
the gold mining, and a
primitive worker that

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:03.740 align:middle line:84%
needs to be brought
into existence to help

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:07.090 align:middle line:84%
the Anunnaki get more
gold out of the ground.

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:10.200 align:middle line:84%
So what kind of
tools and technology

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:13.300 align:middle line:90%
did Enki and the Anunnaki use?

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:16.750 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get to
those in the next episode.

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:18.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm Michael Tellinger.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.010 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for watching.

00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:24.307 align:middle line:90%
