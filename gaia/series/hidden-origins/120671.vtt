00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.728 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:07.728 --> 00:00:12.720 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.520 align:middle line:90%
>>Hello.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.060 align:middle line:10%
This is Michael Tellinger.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.080 align:middle line:10%
And our journey of
discovery continues

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.370 align:middle line:10%
as we find ways to
provide solutions

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.700 align:middle line:10%
for this crazy, insane
world we find ourselves in.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.250 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about Ubuntu
and contributionism,

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.830 align:middle line:84%
a whole new social structure
that provides us with a utopian

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.490 align:middle line:84%
world, a world we've all dreamt
of at some stage or another.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.260 align:middle line:84%
We left off, in
the last episode,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.340 align:middle line:84%
talking about banks
and central banks,

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.000 align:middle line:84%
where money comes
from, how money

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.280 align:middle line:84%
is created by the global
banking elite, how

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.060 align:middle line:84%
it's used against us as
a tool of enslavement.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.350 align:middle line:10%
We've discussed how a people's
bank can liberate us virtually

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.080 align:middle line:10%
overnight from the stranglehold
of private, central banks.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.460 align:middle line:10%
And now we move
on, just exposing

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.440 align:middle line:10%
some of the additional
darker sides

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.250 align:middle line:10%
and the control methodology
that's been used over millennia

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.140 align:middle line:10%
and specifically the last
few hundred years, where

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.980 align:middle line:10%
this draconian
control of humanity

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.480 align:middle line:10%
has just become worse and worse.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.170 align:middle line:84%
Once again, I'd
like to remind you,

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.910 align:middle line:84%
this is just a foundation and
a revision of this information

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.860 align:middle line:84%
to allow us the platform or give
us the platform from which we

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.540 align:middle line:84%
launch the solutions,
and how easy

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.250 align:middle line:84%
it is to go from this
enslavement system

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.060 align:middle line:84%
to the liberation system called
Ubuntu and contributionism.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.250 align:middle line:84%
Remember that the central
banks control our governments.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.730 align:middle line:84%
It does not work the
other way around.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.650 align:middle line:84%
Governments have no say or
control over central banks.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.590 align:middle line:84%
They operate outside
of the system, outside

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:43.530 align:middle line:90%
of the legal system.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.520 align:middle line:90%
They're an entity on their own.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.260 align:middle line:90%
They are untouchable.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.660 align:middle line:84%
You cannot take
the Fed to court.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.800 align:middle line:84%
It's not gonna happen,
never gonna happen.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.960 align:middle line:84%
I tried to take the
South African Reserve

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.700 align:middle line:84%
Bank to the Supreme Court
and to the Constitutional

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.500 align:middle line:90%
Court in South Africa.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.460 align:middle line:84%
The Constitutional
Court threw it out,

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.440 align:middle line:84%
saying I had no
prospect of success.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.240 align:middle line:84%
How could they
possibly know that I

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.479 align:middle line:90%
had no prospect of success?

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.110 align:middle line:84%
So some of these things
that I share with you

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.830 align:middle line:84%
comes from my own journey of
discovery and my own experience

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.650 align:middle line:84%
going to the Supreme
Court of Johannesburg

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.830 align:middle line:84%
and then attempting to
go to the Constitutional

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Court against the
banks to expose

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.810 align:middle line:90%
their crimes against humanity.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.690 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, I was not
successful, because guess

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.020 align:middle line:84%
what, they don't only
control the governments,

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.410 align:middle line:84%
but they also control
the judiciary.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.710 align:middle line:84%
They control the judges,
they control the judiciary.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And the banking families
control the entire system.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.370 align:middle line:84%
They plan and
control the economy.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.280 align:middle line:84%
They dictate the economic
policies to our governments.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.010 align:middle line:84%
When the minister of
finance stands up every year

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.270 align:middle line:84%
and he reads the budget,
the annual budget speech,

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.380 align:middle line:84%
it's not his budget
speech, it's a speech

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.780 align:middle line:84%
that's been prepared for
him by the central bank.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And their plan of
action, and how

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.480 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
manipulate and control

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.180 align:middle line:90%
the people of the country.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.870 align:middle line:84%
So this is how the system
has been structured.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.530 align:middle line:84%
Most of us are acutely
unaware of this.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.690 align:middle line:84%
So hopefully, this
will start giving you,

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.310 align:middle line:84%
if you're new to this, a deeper
foundation and understanding

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.740 align:middle line:84%
how corrupt the system
is, how corrupt it's

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.200 align:middle line:90%
been for a long time.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.610 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that these
central banking families do

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.250 align:middle line:84%
is they test the market
every now and then.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.390 align:middle line:84%
And two of the great examples
of testing the market

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.140 align:middle line:84%
to see how people
would respond, see

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.540 align:middle line:84%
what people will do if they
pull something really nasty.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And they choose little places
like Cyprus and Iceland.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.970 align:middle line:84%
These are two great
examples of how

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.020 align:middle line:84%
they've manipulated
the money system

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.930 align:middle line:90%
and tested what would happen.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.980 align:middle line:84%
In 2013, Cyprus was a great
experiment, where they simply

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.160 align:middle line:84%
shut down everybody's
bank account,

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.500 align:middle line:90%
and they kept everybody's money.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, think
about what this is.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.680 align:middle line:90%
This is a crime of the century.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.060 align:middle line:84%
These bankers have simply
stolen everybody's money.

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.950 align:middle line:84%
I know of an individual that had
11 million pounds in his bank

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.280 align:middle line:90%
account in Cyprus.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.150 align:middle line:90%
When he woke up, he had nothing.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.010 align:middle line:84%
Nobody was prosecuted,
nobody went to court,

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.450 align:middle line:84%
no banker ever
saw any jail time.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.290 align:middle line:84%
They committed a
crime of the century

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.250 align:middle line:90%
and got away with it scot-free?

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.740 align:middle line:90%
How is this possible?

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.640 align:middle line:84%
This is a clear indication
that the bankers

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.400 align:middle line:90%
operate above the law.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.800 align:middle line:84%
They will never,
ever see justice,

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.860 align:middle line:84%
because they create the
systems that dishes out

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.790 align:middle line:84%
the justice, the unlawful
justice that is imposed on us,

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.300 align:middle line:84%
the living, breathing
human beings.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.770 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the legal
system, it's got nothing

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:41.855 align:middle line:90%
to do with human rights.

00:04:41.855 --> 00:04:44.522 align:middle line:84%
It's got nothing to
do with natural law.

00:04:44.522 --> 00:04:47.700 align:middle line:84%
It's got everything to do
with juristic principle.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And their legal system
has been imposed on us.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.600 align:middle line:90%
It is an inhumane system.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.440 align:middle line:84%
Millions and millions
of pages of acts,

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.580 align:middle line:84%
and laws, and policies
have got nothing

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.090 align:middle line:90%
to do with human rights.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.350 align:middle line:84%
Remember that corporations
have more rights than living,

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:04.540 align:middle line:90%
breathing human beings.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.050 align:middle line:84%
This is a harsh realization
that we need to undo as well.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.020 align:middle line:84%
And the good thing
is-- the good news

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.810 align:middle line:90%
is we are doing it already.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.020 align:middle line:84%
I want to remind you that
our journey of emancipation,

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.810 align:middle line:84%
our journey to liberty from
this draconian enslavement money

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.640 align:middle line:90%
system has already begun.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.460 align:middle line:90%
We already are on this journey.

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.950 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
start this journey.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.210 align:middle line:84%
Many of us have been on this
journey for a long, long time.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And more people are joining
this journey on a daily basis.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And it is a journey
of 1,000 miles.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.170 align:middle line:90%
It begins with a first step.

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.980 align:middle line:84%
We have started this
journey a long time ago.

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.990 align:middle line:84%
So join this journey and see
how quickly we can get ourselves

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.530 align:middle line:90%
out of the slavery system.

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:50.320 align:middle line:84%
Education is one of the
most important cornerstones

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.770 align:middle line:84%
of the control system
and the money system.

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.480 align:middle line:84%
Remember, who provides
the textbooks?

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.290 align:middle line:90%
Who sets the syllabus?

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:04.070 align:middle line:84%
Who pays the research that then
gets put into the textbook that

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.120 align:middle line:84%
then gets given to the students
at school and at university?

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.830 align:middle line:84%
All of this comes from
research facilities,

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.740 align:middle line:84%
from institutions that
are funded by the bankers.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.810 align:middle line:84%
Money controls the
education system.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.870 align:middle line:84%
The current education
system we have

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:20.360 align:middle line:84%
was maliciously and
meticulously put together

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.730 align:middle line:84%
by the Carnegie and the
Rockefeller families

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.200 align:middle line:90%
more than 150 years ago.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.280 align:middle line:84%
They started putting
this together already.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, from about 120 years ago,
they've been planning this.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And we are now the apex of
their planned, imposed education

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:35.610 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.400 align:middle line:84%
It's an indoctrination,
manipulation, dumbing down

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.600 align:middle line:84%
system, a slavery prison
system for young minds.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.070 align:middle line:10%
It's got nothing to do with
teaching us valuable knowledge,

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:50.570 align:middle line:10%
and information, and skills for
life that'll benefit humanity.

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.296 align:middle line:10%
It's all about a
tool of manipulation.

00:06:53.296 --> 00:06:56.430 align:middle line:10%
It destroys our ability
to think for ourselves.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:00.250 align:middle line:10%
And it's also a great place to
hide knowledge and information.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.590 align:middle line:10%
Remember, all the discoveries
made by great minds

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.730 align:middle line:10%
and inventors-- if
these discoveries

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:07.990 align:middle line:10%
are made by people
at university,

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.120 align:middle line:10%
that information belongs
to the university.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.970 align:middle line:84%
You can't take it out and
release it to the world.

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the cures for
disease, great inventions

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.360 align:middle line:84%
in science and technology,
free energy, free electricity,

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.050 align:middle line:84%
alternative transportation
systems, cars

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:25.160 align:middle line:84%
that run on water, or air,
or old magnetic fields,

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.850 align:middle line:84%
all these discoveries that
are being made at universities

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:28.780 align:middle line:90%
are kept there.

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.800 align:middle line:84%
They're never shared
with the world.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.756 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
corporations do.

00:07:33.756 --> 00:07:37.140 align:middle line:84%
They close their information,
they shut it down,

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.820 align:middle line:84%
compartmentalize
it, and they hide it

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.620 align:middle line:90%
from the rest of the world.

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:44.690 align:middle line:90%
This is the world of capitalism.

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:48.180 align:middle line:84%
This is the world of competition
and the corporate structure.

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.300 align:middle line:84%
We are going to turn
that around by making

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:54.160 align:middle line:84%
a world of collaboration,
and sharing, and cooperation,

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.480 align:middle line:84%
where these discoveries,
this knowledge,

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.240 align:middle line:84%
and these breakthroughs
are shared

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.530 align:middle line:84%
with everybody in the
world, because it's not

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:02.600 align:middle line:90%
about the money.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.430 align:middle line:84%
It's about the
prosperity of humanity.

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:08.350 align:middle line:84%
The main objective of our
current education system

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:11.330 align:middle line:84%
is to create a future
obedient labor force.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:12.130 align:middle line:90%
Think about this.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.300 align:middle line:84%
When you come out of
school, what can you do?

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:15.530 align:middle line:90%
We know nothing.

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:18.585 align:middle line:84%
We are ignorant,
little, young adults

00:08:18.585 --> 00:08:21.990 align:middle line:84%
that have spent 12 years of
our lives being brainwashed

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:23.400 align:middle line:90%
and manipulated.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And all it is-- all
we leave school with

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:27.790 align:middle line:84%
is a piece of paper,
a certificate, just

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:29.180 align:middle line:90%
like our birth certificate.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.170 align:middle line:90%
It takes control of us.

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And with a certificate,
what do we do?

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.760 align:middle line:90%
We go looking for a job.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.110 align:middle line:84%
Once again, we get back
to the slavery system.

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:40.460 align:middle line:90%
A job is a slave.

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.000 align:middle line:84%
And we somehow
believe that we're

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.420 align:middle line:84%
entitled to a job, because we
got this fancy piece of paper

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:46.480 align:middle line:90%
in our hand.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.950 align:middle line:84%
So that's what this is
all about is creating

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:51.820 align:middle line:84%
a future obedient labor
force that keeps the money

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.660 align:middle line:90%
system rolling and growing.

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.370 align:middle line:90%


00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:59.110 align:middle line:84%
In a controlled
money system where

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:01.680 align:middle line:84%
you keep enslaving
more and more people,

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.980 align:middle line:84%
you have to keep expanding
the money system.

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.440 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, it suffocates itself.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.430 align:middle line:90%
It cannot continue.

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:09.512 align:middle line:90%
So it constantly has to expand.

00:09:09.512 --> 00:09:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we
have this thing called

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.110 align:middle line:90%
inflation and growth.

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:16.080 align:middle line:84%
This is all part of the
manipulative structure

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.320 align:middle line:90%
of the private central banks.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.610 align:middle line:84%
Remember that all our
countries are corporations.

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:23.410 align:middle line:84%
Just like you get a certificate
when you leave university

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:26.960 align:middle line:84%
and when you leave school, guess
what happens when you are born?

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.650 align:middle line:84%
Your parents are given
a birth certificate.

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:30.850 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:33.680 align:middle line:84%
A birth certificate
means that you

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.070 align:middle line:90%
are the property of something.

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:36.960 align:middle line:84%
You're the property
of your government,

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:40.210 align:middle line:84%
you're a property of somebody
that's taking control of you.

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:42.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, who is it that's
taken control of us,

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.080 align:middle line:84%
of our babies when
they are born?

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.020 align:middle line:84%
They get given these
pieces of paper that

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.770 align:middle line:90%
make them belong to someone.

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:50.460 align:middle line:90%
Who do we belong to?

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.750 align:middle line:84%
We belong to our governments
that are corporations.

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:55.670 align:middle line:90%
And this is a big aha moment.

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:59.380 align:middle line:84%
All of our countries around
the world are corporations.

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:04.570 align:middle line:84%
One of the great examples is if
you go on to the US Securities

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:08.990 align:middle line:84%
and Exchange, you'll see a
list of all the corporations

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:10.260 align:middle line:90%
that are listed there.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And you'll start seeing
the names of countries,

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:15.650 align:middle line:84%
the names of states, and
provinces, and cities.

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:19.280 align:middle line:84%
Everything in our lives and our
reality has been incorporated.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.500 align:middle line:90%
And this is why.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:24.530 align:middle line:84%
We, as living, breathing
human beings, have no rights.

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:26.960 align:middle line:84%
All the rights belong
to the corporations

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.330 align:middle line:90%
that use us as their slaves.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:34.070 align:middle line:84%
Our birth certificates are being
traded on global stock markets.

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:36.330 align:middle line:90%
We are not even aware of this.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And we, as living,
breathing human beings,

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:43.240 align:middle line:84%
have to identify ourselves
with identification documents,

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.300 align:middle line:84%
with passports, and
driver's licenses

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:50.920 align:middle line:84%
when we are the actual
blood, and sweat, and tears,

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.540 align:middle line:84%
and the energy, and the body
that makes up the living,

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:54.660 align:middle line:90%
breathing human being.

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:57.690 align:middle line:84%
We have to produce an
identification document that

00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:59.380 align:middle line:90%
says, I am who I am.

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:01.480 align:middle line:90%
Can you see how insane this is?

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is the slavery system
that's been imposed on us.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.740 align:middle line:84%
But now that the cat
is out of the bag,

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.640 align:middle line:84%
now that we know what's
going on, we can change this.

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.330 align:middle line:84%
And we are changing
it as we speak.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:15.675 align:middle line:84%
Here's an example of another
registry for corporations,

00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:16.990 align:middle line:90%
Dun & Bradstreet.

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And here, I found the
registration for Cape Town.

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:22.619 align:middle line:84%
The city of Cape Town also
trading under other names.

00:11:22.619 --> 00:11:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And when you start
doing your own research,

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:27.040 align:middle line:84%
you'll see how corrupt
this entire system is.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.860 align:middle line:90%
It is quite spectacular.

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.690 align:middle line:84%
In the Constitution
of South Africa,

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:33.890 align:middle line:84%
the famous constitution
that was drafted

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:36.440 align:middle line:84%
after the release of
Nelson Mandela from prison,

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:40.460 align:middle line:84%
and of which most South Africans
are very, very proud of,

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:42.970 align:middle line:84%
the deception is
in the preamble.

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And I use this because it's
such a spectacular example

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:49.300 align:middle line:84%
of the deception that is written
into the first statement,

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:52.760 align:middle line:84%
the first opening phrase
of our very so-called

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.470 align:middle line:90%
progressive constitution.

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And it draws the distinction
between a place called

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:01.750 align:middle line:84%
South Africa and the Republic
of South Africa, which

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:03.410 align:middle line:90%
are two different things.

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:06.960 align:middle line:84%
The Republic of South Africa
is a corporation traded

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.740 align:middle line:90%
on the global stock markets.

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:11.260 align:middle line:84%
South Africa is
the land occupied

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.240 align:middle line:84%
by the people who live in the
land called South Africa who

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.980 align:middle line:90%
think this is their country.

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:17.870 align:middle line:84%
However, they're
controlled by the Republic,

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:19.254 align:middle line:90%
which is the corporation.

00:12:19.254 --> 00:12:20.670 align:middle line:10%
So if you look at
the Constitution

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:23.990 align:middle line:10%
of South Africa as an
example, what does it say?

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:26.600 align:middle line:10%
It says the Constitution
of the Republic

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:30.230 align:middle line:10%
of South Africa, not the
Constitution of South Africa.

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:32.940 align:middle line:10%
So it is a constitution
of a corporation.

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:35.750 align:middle line:84%
So as we read the preamble
to the Constitution of South

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:38.240 align:middle line:84%
Africa, we see how
they twist the words,

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.710 align:middle line:84%
how they lie, and
catch us, and trap us

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:43.140 align:middle line:84%
with their lies and
slight twists of words,

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:46.020 align:middle line:84%
because it's a constitution of
the Republic of South Africa.

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:48.130 align:middle line:90%
And it says to us the following.

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:51.560 align:middle line:10%
"We, the people of South
Africa, recognize the injustices

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:52.580 align:middle line:10%
of our past.

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:55.310 align:middle line:10%
We honor those who suffered
for justice and freedom

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:56.110 align:middle line:10%
in our land."

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And see, they trap us with
all this emotional BS for us

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:02.410 align:middle line:84%
to believe, oh, yes, of course,
we've all suffered and gone

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:03.210 align:middle line:90%
through all this.

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And now finally, we have freedom
and liberty, which is not

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.840 align:middle line:90%
the case, as you know by now.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.350 align:middle line:10%
"We respect those who
have worked, and built,

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:13.720 align:middle line:10%
and developed our
country, and believe

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:17.060 align:middle line:10%
that South Africa belongs to
all those who live in it."

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.950 align:middle line:84%
It tells us that we
believe, we think

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:21.720 align:middle line:90%
that the country belongs to us.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:22.930 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't.

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:24.800 align:middle line:90%
It belongs to the republic.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.320 align:middle line:84%
It belongs to the
corporation called

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.920 align:middle line:84%
The Republic of South
Africa and those who own it,

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:33.570 align:middle line:84%
which are the bankers that run
the South African Reserve Bank.

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And so the lies and
deceptions go on.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.440 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at the
needs of the people.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.130 align:middle line:90%
What do people need?

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:45.870 align:middle line:84%
We need love, we need water,
food, shelter, tables, chairs,

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:49.020 align:middle line:84%
cameras, studios,
musical instruments.

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:52.390 align:middle line:84%
We need gardens,
we need trees, we

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:57.130 align:middle line:84%
need anything you can imagine--
tables, chairs, forks, knives,

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:59.660 align:middle line:84%
clothes, whatever
we need to make

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:02.380 align:middle line:84%
our lives beautiful
and enjoyable.

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:03.980 align:middle line:90%
We don't need money.

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:07.270 align:middle line:84%
Money does not make the world
go around, as we've been told.

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:09.240 align:middle line:90%
Money has nothing to do with it.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.260 align:middle line:90%
People make the world go round.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:12.730 align:middle line:90%
Money does nothing.

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:14.120 align:middle line:90%
People do everything.

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.640 align:middle line:90%
We plant the seeds.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.010 align:middle line:90%
We grow the food.

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:18.880 align:middle line:90%
We develop the technology.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.380 align:middle line:90%
We are capable of infinite love.

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:25.230 align:middle line:84%
We paint and develop the
most beautiful works of art.

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:26.680 align:middle line:90%
Money does nothing.

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:31.380 align:middle line:84%
It keeps getting in the way of
people fulfilling their lives'

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:34.410 align:middle line:84%
dreams, doing what
they born with,

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:37.100 align:middle line:84%
expressing their
God-given talents

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:39.330 align:middle line:84%
and their gifts with
which we are born.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:42.290 align:middle line:84%
Money keeps getting in
the way and preventing us

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:45.810 align:middle line:84%
from achieving what we'd
like to achieve in our lives.

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:49.310 align:middle line:84%
So what are we going
to do about this?

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:51.930 align:middle line:10%
Before we get there, I'd like
to tell you a little story

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:54.020 align:middle line:10%
about the magic $100 bill.

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:55.820 align:middle line:10%
I love this story
because it just

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:59.957 align:middle line:10%
shows us how completely insane
this concept of money is.

00:14:59.957 --> 00:15:01.415 align:middle line:84%
So there's this
traveling salesman,

00:15:01.415 --> 00:15:04.120 align:middle line:90%
and he comes into a little town.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And he goes to the hotel, and he
walks up to the hotel manager.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And he says, hi,
I'm in town, and I

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.810 align:middle line:84%
need to get a room
for the weekend,

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:15.054 align:middle line:84%
but I'm very particular
about the place I stay.

00:15:15.054 --> 00:15:16.470 align:middle line:84%
So can I have a
look at your room?

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:19.000 align:middle line:84%
The hotel manager
says, of course, just

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.780 align:middle line:84%
need $100 here as a
deposit, and here's the key.

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:24.380 align:middle line:84%
Go upstairs, take your
time, check the room out.

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:27.000 align:middle line:84%
So the traveling
salesman goes upstairs.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.665 align:middle line:84%
He disappears to check the
room out, at which point

00:15:30.665 --> 00:15:33.360 align:middle line:84%
the hotel manager
picks up the $100 bill.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.180 align:middle line:84%
And he notices the
butcher across the road,

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:38.870 align:middle line:84%
and he says, oh, I owed
John from the butcher

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:42.470 align:middle line:84%
$100 for last week's catering
for the function we had here.

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:44.290 align:middle line:84%
So he goes across the
road, and he says,

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:46.060 align:middle line:84%
hi, John, here's the
$100 that I owe you

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:48.910 align:middle line:84%
for the function for the meat
you supplied us last week.

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:50.270 align:middle line:90%
And John says, thanks very much.

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And he puts the money down next
to the till, at which point

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:55.810 align:middle line:84%
the plumber walks
into the butchery

00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:57.310 align:middle line:90%
to buy his meat supply.

00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And he says, hi,
John, how's it going?

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And the butcher looks
up, and he says,

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:02.145 align:middle line:90%
hey, Bill, how's it going, man?

00:16:02.145 --> 00:16:03.937 align:middle line:84%
Oh, by the way, I
owe you some money

00:16:03.937 --> 00:16:06.020 align:middle line:84%
for fixing the plumbing
and the freezer last week.

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:07.760 align:middle line:90%
So how much do I owe you?

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:08.540 align:middle line:84%
And the guy said,
well, you owe me $100.

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:09.990 align:middle line:84%
He said, well,
here we go, here's

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:12.640 align:middle line:84%
$100 for thanks for doing the
plumbing for us last week.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.306 align:middle line:84%
You really saved me,
because it would've

00:16:14.306 --> 00:16:17.000 align:middle line:84%
been a big disaster if the
pipes had burst and flooded

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:17.897 align:middle line:90%
my whole freezer.

00:16:17.897 --> 00:16:19.480 align:middle line:84%
So the plumber says,
thanks very much.

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.729 align:middle line:84%
He puts the money in his
pocket, and he gets his meat,

00:16:21.729 --> 00:16:23.140 align:middle line:90%
and he drives down the road.

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:26.430 align:middle line:84%
He pulls into the garage to
fill the car with petrol.

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:28.462 align:middle line:84%
And he sees the garage
owner comes out.

00:16:28.462 --> 00:16:29.920 align:middle line:84%
He says, hey, how's
it going, Bill?

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:30.500 align:middle line:90%
How you doing?

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:31.710 align:middle line:90%
He says, fine, excellent.

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And the garage
owner says to Bill,

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:35.260 align:middle line:84%
do you have the money
you owe me for fixing

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:36.755 align:middle line:90%
your fender last week?

00:16:36.755 --> 00:16:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And the guys says, of
course, I'm sorry, man.

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:39.500 align:middle line:90%
Sorry I forgot.

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:40.300 align:middle line:90%
Here it is.

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.620 align:middle line:84%
He gives the garage
owner the $100,

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:44.110 align:middle line:90%
and he says, thanks very much.

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:46.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm really glad that you
had the money on you.

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And the garage owner--
what was his name?

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:52.050 align:middle line:84%
Peter goes down the
road, jumps in his car,

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:55.030 align:middle line:84%
and he drives his car down
the road, wherever he's going,

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:56.760 align:middle line:84%
and he sees Sally,
the prostitute,

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.510 align:middle line:90%
walk down the sidewalk.

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And he says, hey,
Sally, how's it going?

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And Sally says, hey,
Peter, how are you?

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And Sally says, by the way,
have you got the $100 you owe me

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:06.550 align:middle line:90%
for last week's service?

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:08.819 align:middle line:84%
And Peter says, oh,
yes, Sally, of course.

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:09.760 align:middle line:90%
I had a great time.

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:10.860 align:middle line:90%
Here's $100.

00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:13.109 align:middle line:84%
And Sally is very happy,
puts the money in her pocket,

00:17:13.109 --> 00:17:15.190 align:middle line:84%
and she's walking
down the sidewalk when

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:17.500 align:middle line:84%
she walks past the
hotel, at which point

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:20.579 align:middle line:84%
she realizes that she owes
the hotel money for the room

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:22.490 align:middle line:84%
that she rented
the previous week.

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:25.450 align:middle line:84%
She walks into the hotel
lobby up to the front desk,

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:29.180 align:middle line:84%
and there's the hotel
manager standing there.

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And she says, hi, here's the
money I owe you for last week's

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:32.860 align:middle line:90%
rental for the room.

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And the hotel manager says,
thanks very much, Sally.

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:36.650 align:middle line:90%
Lovely to see you.

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And he takes the $100,
and he puts it down

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:42.380 align:middle line:84%
on the counter, at which point
the traveling salesman comes

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:45.640 align:middle line:84%
down from upstairs holding
the keys to the room

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:47.220 align:middle line:90%
that he'd just inspected.

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And he says to the hotel
manager, thanks very much,

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:52.600 align:middle line:84%
I've checked the room out,
it's not really my style,

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:53.870 align:middle line:90%
so I think I'll be moving on.

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:58.870 align:middle line:84%
He hands over the keys, he takes
his $100 bill, and he leaves.

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:00.780 align:middle line:90%
What has just happened?

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:03.460 align:middle line:84%
Can you see the insanity
of this thing called

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:07.540 align:middle line:84%
money-- pieces of paper that
we shuffle around for services

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:11.160 align:middle line:84%
that we've performed that we can
actually do without shuffling

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.220 align:middle line:90%
these pieces of paper?

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:14.640 align:middle line:90%
So what is actually possible?

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:17.340 align:middle line:84%
If you speed this
process up infinitely,

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:23.170 align:middle line:84%
it means that we can pay all
the debts of the world with one

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:24.500 align:middle line:90%
$100 bill.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:27.640 align:middle line:84%
If we speed this up
infinitely, this $100 bill

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.660 align:middle line:84%
can go around so quickly that
we pay off everybody's debts,

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.890 align:middle line:84%
and we realize how completely
insane and nonsensical

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:36.290 align:middle line:90%
this concept of money is.

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:37.570 align:middle line:90%
Think about this.

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:41.480 align:middle line:84%
Every day, 7 and 1/2
billion people wake up,

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:43.320 align:middle line:90%
and we do something.

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.910 align:middle line:90%
We do so much.

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:47.220 align:middle line:84%
We create, we
build, we transport,

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:49.760 align:middle line:84%
we carry, we invent,
we grow things,

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.180 align:middle line:84%
we dream, we paint,
we sculpt, or we

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:57.720 align:middle line:84%
sing, we spin, we cook,
we dance, we make love.

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:01.990 align:middle line:84%
We are capable of an
infinite number of things.

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:06.460 align:middle line:84%
And yet, at the end of that day,
most of us cannot afford what

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:10.390 align:middle line:84%
it is that we just
did that specific day.

00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
we realize how we've

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:16.210 align:middle line:84%
been completely enslaved by
corporations and governments,

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:20.190 align:middle line:84%
because most of what we do we
do for corporations, companies,

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:21.240 align:middle line:90%
and governments.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have access to
what it is that we've just done.

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:29.470 align:middle line:84%
That is completely an insane
concept, an insane idea,

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:32.280 align:middle line:84%
an insane situation
of somehow, we've

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:35.990 align:middle line:84%
allowed ourselves to be trapped
in, to be suckered into.

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:38.540 align:middle line:84%
But now we know that
this is what's going on,

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:40.750 align:middle line:84%
and we can get
ourselves out of this.

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:43.530 align:middle line:84%
We can start doing all
of this for ourselves,

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:45.770 align:middle line:90%
for our communities.

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is exactly
what the Ubuntu

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:50.500 align:middle line:84%
and contributionism philosophy
is all about-- starting

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:54.220 align:middle line:84%
to do all the things that we are
capable of as living, breathing

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:56.410 align:middle line:90%
human beings for ourselves.

00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:59.230 align:middle line:84%
Stop doing it for
corporations or others that

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:02.560 align:middle line:84%
have enslaved us to do this
because they've got money.

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:05.190 align:middle line:84%
Once we start doing this
for ourselves and not

00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:07.360 align:middle line:84%
for governments or
corporations, we'll

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.820 align:middle line:84%
see how quickly we
can create abundance,

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:12.800 align:middle line:84%
because we start doing it
together cooperatively,

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:16.930 align:middle line:84%
in collaboration for the
benefit of human beings and not

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:18.100 align:middle line:90%
corporations.

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And everything
changes overnight.

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:24.810 align:middle line:84%
Remember, it is not the love
of money, as many people argue.

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And you will find if you start
talking to people about this,

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:30.110 align:middle line:84%
when you start bringing
this up in conversation

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:31.990 align:middle line:84%
around the dinner
table, which, I guess,

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:35.130 align:middle line:84%
many people do, a lot of people
confront you and they'd say,

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:36.500 align:middle line:90%
oh, it's just the love of money.

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:39.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, money is not evil,
money is not the problem,

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:40.670 align:middle line:90%
it's our love of money.

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:42.460 align:middle line:90%
They are all wrong.

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:45.670 align:middle line:84%
It's not the love of money,
it's the presence of money

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:47.620 align:middle line:90%
that causes all these problems.

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:49.730 align:middle line:84%
Money is the tool
of enslavement.

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:54.030 align:middle line:84%
Money causes all the dark,
horrible things in our lives.

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:56.750 align:middle line:84%
It causes people to
do things and behave

00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:59.200 align:middle line:84%
in ways that they
would never behave

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.010 align:middle line:90%
if it wasn't for the money.

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:02.560 align:middle line:90%
So please keep this in mind.

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.580 align:middle line:90%
It's not the love of money.

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:06.940 align:middle line:84%
It's purely the
presence of money

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:11.120 align:middle line:84%
that causes all this horrible
stuff that we face in our lives

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.160 align:middle line:90%
on a daily basis.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:17.190 align:middle line:10%
The only way out of this is
to simply remove the money.

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:20.170 align:middle line:10%
Now that we know that
it is the money that

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:22.700 align:middle line:10%
is used as a tool
of enslavement,

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:26.880 align:middle line:10%
there's only one way
out-- remove the money.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And this is the most
liberating thought

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:33.910 align:middle line:84%
that I must admit I've had in
the last 20 years of my life.

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:36.690 align:middle line:84%
When you start thinking
about a world without money

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:40.310 align:middle line:84%
and how everything changes,
how it doesn't make things more

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:43.060 align:middle line:84%
difficult, it
actually liberates us

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:46.900 align:middle line:84%
from the enslavement, when
we've gone through this process,

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:49.710 align:middle line:84%
we all realize that this
is the only way out.

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:52.630 align:middle line:84%
This is the way we get
rid of the control system.

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:58.265 align:middle line:84%
As long as we have any form of
trade, or exchange, or barter,

00:21:58.265 --> 00:22:02.540 align:middle line:84%
we will constantly be enslaved,
because any form of exchange,

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:06.100 align:middle line:84%
or bartering, or trading
is open to abuse.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And there will always
be people that'll

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:10.870 align:middle line:84%
find a way to abuse
others by taking

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:14.490 align:middle line:84%
control of that tool of
exchange, or bartering.

00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And this is why
we have to get rid

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:21.620 align:middle line:84%
of any form or any tool that
could be related to money.

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:24.290 align:middle line:84%
The moment you say, we're
going to remove money

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:27.930 align:middle line:84%
from the system, something
interesting happens.

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And the questions
start coming up,

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:33.269 align:middle line:84%
because people go into
this, like, panic attack,

00:22:33.269 --> 00:22:35.310 align:middle line:84%
because they think removing
money from the system

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:36.922 align:middle line:84%
means that we're not
going to have any money,

00:22:36.922 --> 00:22:39.047 align:middle line:84%
and we're not going to be
able to buy stuff, right?

00:22:39.047 --> 00:22:42.800 align:middle line:84%
So they think a world without
money means living in poverty.

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:43.600 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.230 align:middle line:84%
A world without
money means that we

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:47.850 align:middle line:84%
are capable of doing
everything we want to do,

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:51.570 align:middle line:84%
so that we have so much of the
stuff that we don't need money.

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:54.150 align:middle line:84%
And we have an infinite
number of things,

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:55.840 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
we are capable of.

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:59.670 align:middle line:84%
We have abundance beyond
our wildest imagination.

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:02.550 align:middle line:84%
But what's happened
over the last 11 years,

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:06.170 align:middle line:84%
when I first started talking
about a world without money,

00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:10.420 align:middle line:84%
I've started receiving emails
from people all over the world.

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And the fascinating
thing is that

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:14.600 align:middle line:84%
out of millions of
problems that we

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:18.510 align:middle line:84%
face in a world with money and
a capitalist-driven democratic

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:22.890 align:middle line:84%
society, we think is so perfect,
in a world driven by money,

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:25.590 align:middle line:84%
there are millions of problems
that our governments are

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:28.040 align:middle line:84%
seemingly incapable
of solving with all

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.100 align:middle line:84%
the money in the world,
all these problems

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:32.470 align:middle line:90%
we face on a daily basis.

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:36.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, isn't it ironic that,
after 11 years of promoting

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:39.560 align:middle line:84%
a concept of a
world without money,

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:43.800 align:middle line:84%
the same 13 frequently
asked questions come up.

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Already, this tells us
that when we remove money,

00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:49.650 align:middle line:90%
all our problems disappear.

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And people keep coming
up with only 13 problems.

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.180 align:middle line:84%
This is what I've
filtered it down to,

00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:58.109 align:middle line:84%
because there are
obviously variety of things

00:23:58.109 --> 00:23:59.150 align:middle line:90%
that people come up with.

00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:02.160 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, many of
them are just varieties

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:04.850 align:middle line:90%
on the same problem, right?

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:09.240 align:middle line:84%
So 13 problems that we have to
solve in a world without money

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:10.570 align:middle line:90%
to live in paradise.

00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:13.910 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a good
prospect for success.

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:15.500 align:middle line:84%
Removing money
from the system we

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:18.570 align:middle line:84%
find ourselves in seems
to be an insurmountable

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:21.820 align:middle line:84%
and something that we're never
going to be able to achieve.

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:23.480 align:middle line:90%
Well, you'd be wrong.

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
we start realizing

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:29.930 align:middle line:84%
how simple the transition from a
money-driven, capitalist system

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:34.120 align:middle line:84%
is, how simple it is to move
from a society driven by money,

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:37.590 align:middle line:84%
and control, and capitalism
to a society driven by people

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:39.240 align:middle line:90%
and their passion for life.

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.204 align:middle line:84%
The transitional
phase is so easy.

00:24:41.204 --> 00:24:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And we're going
to go through this

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:45.310 align:middle line:84%
and unpack this process
in the next episode.

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:47.700 align:middle line:84%
But before we end
here today, I'd

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:50.750 align:middle line:84%
like to remind you that moving
into a world without money,

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:53.490 align:middle line:84%
where we create abundance,
where we work together

00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:55.242 align:middle line:84%
in cooperation
and collaboration,

00:24:55.242 --> 00:24:58.910 align:middle line:84%
where we support each other like
the cells in our body support

00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:02.810 align:middle line:84%
each other, even if we
diversify into different groups,

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:05.680 align:middle line:84%
we still support each other,
because we are working together

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:08.690 align:middle line:84%
for the greatest benefit of all
the people in our communities,

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:12.050 align:middle line:84%
where we treat our
communities as the extension

00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:14.390 align:middle line:84%
of our families, where
we don't fear anybody,

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:16.890 align:middle line:84%
because there's no
reason to fear anybody.

00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:20.590 align:middle line:84%
This is all moving into a
higher state of consciousness.

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:24.230 align:middle line:84%
So we have to realize
that to move away

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:29.180 align:middle line:84%
from this divided society that's
driven by fear and separation,

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:33.010 align:middle line:84%
and a society that's been
manipulated and controlled

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:35.730 align:middle line:84%
through the
divide-and-conquer principle,

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:40.650 align:middle line:84%
to move away from that is, in
essence, moving into a higher

00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:42.500 align:middle line:84%
state of consciousness
and to embrace

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:46.600 align:middle line:84%
a simple principle of
cooperation and collaboration.

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:50.300 align:middle line:84%
The moment you remove money from
the system, everything changes.

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:53.450 align:middle line:84%
Our whole reality takes on
a whole new perspective.

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:56.390 align:middle line:84%
All the negative
and dark aspects

00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:59.890 align:middle line:84%
of our lives and our society
change for the better.

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:05.290 align:middle line:84%
No crime, no envy, no
gluttony, no greed, no hording,

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:08.430 align:middle line:84%
no hierarchy, and
especially no hunger.

00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:12.230 align:middle line:84%
No obstacles to any kind of
progress, because it's always

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:14.550 align:middle line:84%
the money that
creates the hurdle

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:18.260 align:middle line:84%
and is the obstacle to
progress in all of our lives.

00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:22.810 align:middle line:84%
Remember that bankers are the
people that tell us what we can

00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:24.360 align:middle line:90%
and cannot do.

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:27.580 align:middle line:84%
We go to banks to take
loans to start something

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:29.890 align:middle line:84%
we'd like to do, whether
you want to start a dance

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:34.660 align:middle line:84%
studio, or a music studio, or
if you want to build a bridge,

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:38.560 align:middle line:84%
or improve your home, or
whatever it is we want to do.

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:42.160 align:middle line:84%
Most of us need to go
to banks to borrow money

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:45.240 align:middle line:84%
to achieve and do things
to improve our lives.

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.910 align:middle line:84%
So ultimately, bankers become
the people in our lives

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:51.530 align:middle line:84%
that give us permission to
do what we'd like to do.

00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:53.625 align:middle line:84%
Well, that changes
overnight the moment

00:26:53.625 --> 00:26:56.090 align:middle line:84%
we remove money from the
system and everything

00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:57.430 align:middle line:90%
becomes possible.

00:26:57.430 --> 00:27:01.090 align:middle line:84%
How are we going to go from
this money-driven society

00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:03.830 align:middle line:84%
and transition into a
world without money,

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:06.280 align:middle line:84%
and abundance and
prosperity for all

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:09.230 align:middle line:84%
we'll discuss in
the next episode.

00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:14.510 align:middle line:90%
