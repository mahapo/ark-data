[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.881 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.881 --> 00:00:13.380 align:middle line:90%
>>Hello.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.810 align:middle line:10%
This is Michael Tellinger.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:16.750 align:middle line:10%
And our journey of
discovery continues

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.890 align:middle line:10%
where we talk about Ubuntu
and contributionism,

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.840 align:middle line:10%
when we learn knowledge
from ancient civilizations

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.080 align:middle line:10%
that we can put to
use for humanity

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.890 align:middle line:10%
and our future, that
utopian, beautiful future

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.360 align:middle line:10%
that most of us have
imagined for ourselves

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.920 align:middle line:10%
and for our children and for the
future of this entire planet.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And we look at the
Hollywood messages encoded,

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.930 align:middle line:84%
the subliminal messages encoded
into some of the biggest

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.500 align:middle line:84%
movies made in Hollywood, the
so-called blockbuster movies,

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.410 align:middle line:84%
busting the block of
our consciousness.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And the first,
most obvious movie

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.980 align:middle line:84%
that we need to look at,
because we've already measured,

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.420 align:middle line:84%
we've determined that there
is this invisible matrix

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.730 align:middle line:84%
around the earth, this energy
grid that is being kept up,

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.400 align:middle line:84%
most likely with our own energy
source, with our own sound

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.420 align:middle line:84%
and energy from human
beings, as the movie

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.560 align:middle line:84%
"The Matrix" tells
us very clearly.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And now that we know that
there's this binary code energy

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.080 align:middle line:90%
field around our planet.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.560 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at the encoded
subliminal messages--

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.190 align:middle line:84%
not that subliminal, actually--
very much in your face, when

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.280 align:middle line:84%
Morpheus explains to Neo
what the Matrix is all about.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.590 align:middle line:84%
>>Let me tell you
why you're here.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.640 align:middle line:84%
You're here because
you know something.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.030 align:middle line:84%
What you know, you can't
explain, but you feel it.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.830 align:middle line:84%
You've felt it your
entire life, that there's

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.150 align:middle line:90%
something wrong with the world.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.960 align:middle line:84%
You don't know what
it is, but it's

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.340 align:middle line:84%
there like a splinter in
your mind, driving you mad.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.320 align:middle line:84%
It is this feeling that
has brought you to me.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.770 align:middle line:90%


00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.030 align:middle line:84%
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.725 align:middle line:90%
>>The Matrix?

00:01:55.725 --> 00:01:59.140 align:middle line:90%


00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.510 align:middle line:84%
>>Do you want to
know what it is?

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.750 align:middle line:90%


00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.840 align:middle line:90%
The Matrix is everywhere.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.580 align:middle line:84%
It is all around us, even
now in this very room.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.060 align:middle line:84%
You can see it when you
look out your window

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.740 align:middle line:84%
or when you turn
on your television.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:24.010 align:middle line:84%
You can feel it when you go to
work, when you go to church,

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.160 align:middle line:90%
when you pay your taxes.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.300 align:middle line:84%
It is the world that has
been pulled over your eyes

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.290 align:middle line:90%
to blind you from the truth.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.760 align:middle line:84%
>>All right, so here
we have the Matrix.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.640 align:middle line:90%
The Matrix is a system.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And can you see how most of us
are so inured, so hopelessly

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.390 align:middle line:84%
dependent on the system that
we are prepared to defend it?

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.650 align:middle line:84%
You realize that
most of us, those

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.020 align:middle line:84%
that are unconscious, those
have not yet woken up,

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.840 align:middle line:84%
those have not
become enlightened,

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.280 align:middle line:84%
those that don't yet know
enough information, are there.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And we're on a daily basis
protecting the system that

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.000 align:middle line:90%
is enslaving us.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.410 align:middle line:84%
This is what we need
to get out of people.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.440 align:middle line:84%
This is part of the very
critical enlightenment process

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.860 align:middle line:90%
that we have to go through.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.130 align:middle line:84%
So this is where you also see
spirituality and consciousness

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.570 align:middle line:84%
meeting with science
and knowledge

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:16.970 align:middle line:90%
of ancient civilizations.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And we find a
wonderful crossroads

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.530 align:middle line:84%
and a transitional phase
that we go through,

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.360 align:middle line:84%
this spectacular moment of
release of fear and frustration

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.980 align:middle line:84%
and anxiety and anger when
we find our own moment

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:32.715 align:middle line:90%
of enlightenment.

00:03:32.715 --> 00:03:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And what I tell you,
what I have found,

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.370 align:middle line:84%
is that every single one of
us has their critical moment,

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.740 align:middle line:84%
has their trigger point,
every single one of us,

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.120 align:middle line:84%
no matter how poor
or how rich you are.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.690 align:middle line:84%
There is something that'll
be your trigger that

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.930 align:middle line:84%
will make you go looking
for more information.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.290 align:middle line:84%
So if those around you that
are still not waking up,

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.600 align:middle line:84%
you feel not
enlightened, don't worry.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.370 align:middle line:90%
Don't stress about it too much.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:59.160 align:middle line:90%
Don't force it.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.680 align:middle line:84%
Don't push them,
because when you

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.250 align:middle line:84%
push people, when you try to
give them too much information

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.380 align:middle line:84%
too soon, people go back
into the logger mentality.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.340 align:middle line:84%
They get scared and
they get fearful

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.500 align:middle line:84%
and they don't want hear--
I don't want to hear,

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.410 align:middle line:90%
don't want to see.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:12.810 align:middle line:90%
So let's not do that.

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.720 align:middle line:84%
Let's be gentle when we share
this information with those

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.950 align:middle line:84%
around us that are not
yet fully aware or awake

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.350 align:middle line:84%
and that might be scared
and frightened by this.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.650 align:middle line:84%
So what else does Morpheus
tell Neo about the system?

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.980 align:middle line:84%
He tells him that it's a slavery
system, that Neo is a slave.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.395 align:middle line:90%
Let's have a look at this.

00:04:32.395 --> 00:04:33.135 align:middle line:90%
>>What truth?

00:04:33.135 --> 00:04:38.120 align:middle line:90%


00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.170 align:middle line:90%
>>That you are a slave, Neo.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.840 align:middle line:84%
Like everyone else, you
were born into bondage,

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.060 align:middle line:84%
born into a prison that
you cannot smell or taste

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.260 align:middle line:84%
or touch-- a prison
for your mind.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:58.400 align:middle line:90%


00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, no one can
be told what the Matrix is.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.950 align:middle line:90%


00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.160 align:middle line:90%
You have to see it for yourself.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.840 align:middle line:84%
>>One of the greatest examples
in the Hollywood blockbuster

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.720 align:middle line:84%
movie exposing the
control and the elite

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.740 align:middle line:84%
and those behind the
manipulation of humanity,

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.290 align:middle line:84%
manipulation of the money and
the gold is "The Wizard of Oz."

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:28.040 align:middle line:84%
When Frank L. Baum first
wrote this, the book in 1900,

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.080 align:middle line:90%
he was the son of an oil baron.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.180 align:middle line:84%
And he clearly was
privy to information

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.040 align:middle line:84%
that most children at his
time were not privy to.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And he decided to spill
the beans, if you want to.

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And he encoded all this
beautiful information,

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.270 align:middle line:84%
amazing information,
into his famous book

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.720 align:middle line:84%
that has been made several times
into Hollywood blockbusters.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.570 align:middle line:84%
So let's explore what
"The Wizard of Oz"

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.110 align:middle line:90%
is actually telling us.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, the wizard-- remember
wizards cast spells

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:03.360 align:middle line:84%
with branches of the Hollywood
tree, the wood of a holly tree.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.350 align:middle line:84%
So already there's an
interesting connection.

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.190 align:middle line:84%
The Wizard of Oz--
well, what is Oz?

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.760 align:middle line:84%
Oz stands for ounces,
ounces of gold.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.610 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we dealing with
those wizards in society

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.020 align:middle line:90%
that control gold.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And it is the yellow brick
road that leads in a spiral

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.240 align:middle line:90%
to the wonderful wizard.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.730 align:middle line:84%
So it is the road paved with
gold, paved with bars of gold,

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.800 align:middle line:84%
that leads to the
Wizard, who controls

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.990 align:middle line:84%
the answers and the
gold of the world.

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.690 align:middle line:90%
They control the world.

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.490 align:middle line:84%
This is what the
movie is telling us.

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And in the movie, we find
several interesting characters.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.920 align:middle line:10%
Well, the four main characters
or the five main characters

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:43.980 align:middle line:10%
is the Scarecrow, the
Tin Man, and Dorothy,

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.430 align:middle line:10%
who is the only living,
breathing human being.

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.210 align:middle line:10%
And we find the Lion and
then the little dog Toto.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.180 align:middle line:84%
Let's have a quick look
what messages these five

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.960 align:middle line:84%
characters give us, or
what is encoded in these.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.330 align:middle line:10%
First of all, Dorothy
is-- in the original book

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.720 align:middle line:10%
Dorothy wears silver slippers.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And she's the only living,
breathing human being.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.080 align:middle line:84%
So there's a little bit of
deception going on in the movie

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.970 align:middle line:90%
from the book.

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:13.200 align:middle line:84%
But the silver slippers
tell us that human beings

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.910 align:middle line:90%
were given silver to work with.

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:16.370 align:middle line:90%
Silver was always the currency.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.830 align:middle line:84%
Gold never belonged
to the people.

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:20.970 align:middle line:84%
Remember in previous
episodes, we

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:23.590 align:middle line:84%
said that the gold always
belongs to the gods.

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:26.520 align:middle line:84%
And somebody was in charge
of the gold for the gods.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's the wizards
of Oz on this planet that

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:35.520 align:middle line:84%
were imposed or
selected by the gods

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.010 align:middle line:90%
to take control over humanity.

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:39.720 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk about
that in much more detail

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.480 align:middle line:84%
down the line-- those that
were appointed by the gods

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.410 align:middle line:84%
to take control over
humanity and to control

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:47.490 align:middle line:90%
the gold for the gods.

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:49.560 align:middle line:84%
Humans were allowed
to use silver.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.940 align:middle line:84%
And therein, we have
an interesting expose

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:55.960 align:middle line:84%
about humans and Dorothy
having silver slippers

00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:00.220 align:middle line:84%
and she is taking
the yellow brick road

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:03.440 align:middle line:84%
to the castle and the
palace of the wizard who

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.930 align:middle line:90%
controls the gold.

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:08.260 align:middle line:84%
The other characters are
the famous Scarecrow.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:09.920 align:middle line:90%
Well, what is a scarecrow?

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.230 align:middle line:90%
A scarecrow is made of straw.

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:17.820 align:middle line:84%
That represents a strawman, a
legal fiction, a citizenship,

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:21.940 align:middle line:84%
a person, the fact that the
straw man was not the human

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.620 align:middle line:90%
but he wanted to be human.

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:27.360 align:middle line:84%
He desperately
wanted to be human.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And he laments for being
recognized as being alive.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And I can't remember
if it was at the heart

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.020 align:middle line:84%
that he was after, if it was
a brain that he was after.

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.970 align:middle line:84%
But one of the two
characters was either

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:40.150 align:middle line:90%
after a brain or a heart.

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:42.659 align:middle line:84%
That just shows you what
they wanted is to be human

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:45.060 align:middle line:84%
and not being reduced
down to pieces

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:47.470 align:middle line:90%
of paper or legal fictions.

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:51.370 align:middle line:84%
So the straw man represents
our legal fiction and our straw

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:52.340 align:middle line:90%
man.

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:57.150 align:middle line:84%
The next is the T-I-N, the Tin
Man, the Tax Identification

00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Number, showing us how we are
controlled as living, breathing

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:03.730 align:middle line:84%
human beings, and how
the T-I-N is encoded,

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:07.780 align:middle line:84%
the Tin Man is encoded into the
story that is woven beautifully

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.650 align:middle line:90%
about the control of humanity.

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:12.170 align:middle line:84%
The Lion, the roar of
the lion, the beast

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:13.700 align:middle line:90%
that controls humanity.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.550 align:middle line:84%
But actually the
lion is a coward.

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:18.660 align:middle line:84%
When he gets exposed, he
is a coward and he hides.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:20.680 align:middle line:90%
But he hides behind the roar.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.060 align:middle line:84%
That's what this
lion represents.

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:25.490 align:middle line:84%
So the encoded messages
in this are spectacular.

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:27.440 align:middle line:84%
And when they find
the wizard, they

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:31.580 align:middle line:84%
see the big wizard
hiding behind a screen.

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:34.770 align:middle line:84%
But when the dog, Toto,
goes around and sees

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:36.240 align:middle line:90%
it's just a human being.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.400 align:middle line:90%
It's not a monster.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.570 align:middle line:90%
It's not a big wizard.

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:39.860 align:middle line:90%
It's not a scary guy.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.160 align:middle line:84%
It's just a guy
pretending to be scary

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:46.630 align:middle line:84%
and controlling, with bells and
whistles and smoke and mirrors.

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:49.450 align:middle line:84%
And they expose the
wizard for being a fraud.

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:51.150 align:middle line:90%
And this is exactly what it is.

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And Toto, incidentally, if you
haven't figured that out yet,

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.510 align:middle line:84%
Toto is the Latin word for
"totality," "in total,"

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:59.710 align:middle line:84%
exposing the wizard
totally that he's a fraud.

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:03.416 align:middle line:84%
And so we realize that
the movie "Wizard of Oz"

00:10:03.416 --> 00:10:06.640 align:middle line:84%
exposes the fact that
those who control the gold

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:10.110 align:middle line:84%
are controlling the world
with bells and whistles

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.500 align:middle line:90%
and smoke and mirrors.

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:14.520 align:middle line:84%
They are running the show
through controlling the gold

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.760 align:middle line:90%
and it's all a big scam.

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And we have not figured out
that they don't have the power,

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.480 align:middle line:84%
that their roar is not so
powerful and not so scary,

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:24.930 align:middle line:90%
because they can be exposed.

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:28.710 align:middle line:84%
Remember we are
the 99.99%, those

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:32.390 align:middle line:84%
that control this planet,
who have for some reason

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:35.260 align:middle line:84%
taken control and
maintained control

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:39.210 align:middle line:84%
and lied and
oppressed and tortured

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:43.650 align:middle line:84%
and killed for the sake of
their control have been exposed.

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we refer
to as the global elite.

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:49.770 align:middle line:84%
How and where they come
from is an interesting story

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:51.400 align:middle line:90%
that we're going to touch upon.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.930 align:middle line:84%
And that takes us to
this thing called money.

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:58.100 align:middle line:84%
All of this is all
about the money.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.990 align:middle line:84%
If we can't deal with
the issue of money,

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:04.020 align:middle line:84%
we will never deal with
the problem on this planet.

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very
important thing.

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:09.960 align:middle line:84%
Some people constantly try
and find an excuse for money.

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.260 align:middle line:84%
They say things like,
money is just an energy.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.220 align:middle line:84%
Money is just a
tool of exchange.

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:15.130 align:middle line:90%
Money is just that.

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's the love of money,
not the money itself-- wrong.

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:21.430 align:middle line:84%
All of those sentiments are
completely and utterly wrong.

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find that it
is all about the money.

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:27.590 align:middle line:84%
It is not the money
itself that matters,

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:29.870 align:middle line:84%
because the money
really has no value.

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:32.620 align:middle line:84%
It is a tool of enslavement
that's been imposed on humanity

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:34.800 align:middle line:90%
and controlled by the wizard.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.376 align:middle line:84%
The wizard who
controls it is those

00:11:36.376 --> 00:11:39.280 align:middle line:84%
who have the exclusive
right to create and print

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:42.070 align:middle line:84%
the money for our governments
and for the planet.

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:45.740 align:middle line:84%
Those are using the money
as a tool of control.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:49.070 align:middle line:84%
They can create as much money
as they can on a daily basis.

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:51.750 align:middle line:84%
These individuals,
these royal bloodlines,

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:54.750 align:middle line:84%
these banking families
can create as much money

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:55.680 align:middle line:90%
as they want.

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:57.120 align:middle line:90%
It's not about the money.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.920 align:middle line:84%
It's about using the money
as a tool of control.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.690 align:middle line:84%
The wizard of Oz-- that's
what this is all about.

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:07.290 align:middle line:84%
So we have to deal with
the money issue, people.

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's for this reason
that I call this the money

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:12.580 align:middle line:90%
thing has become a holy cow.

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:14.357 align:middle line:90%
Because you can attack Jews.

00:12:14.357 --> 00:12:15.440 align:middle line:90%
You can attack Christians.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.530 align:middle line:84%
You can attack Muslims,
Hindus, Buddhists.

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:18.429 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:12:18.429 --> 00:12:20.720 align:middle line:84%
You'll probably have some
friends that will support you

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.040 align:middle line:90%
in your arguments.

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:26.160 align:middle line:84%
But the moment you attack money,
people literally go crazy.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.174 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen this over an
11-year period of talking

00:12:29.174 --> 00:12:30.340 align:middle line:90%
about a world without money.

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:33.390 align:middle line:84%
The moment you say this to
people, some people almost

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:34.820 align:middle line:90%
physically go into convulsions.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:36.931 align:middle line:84%
They go, what do you mean,
a world without money?

00:12:36.931 --> 00:12:38.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, how are we
going to do things?

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:39.880 align:middle line:90%
How are we going to buy stuff?

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.860 align:middle line:84%
Without money, they'll
be no progress.

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:44.600 align:middle line:84%
There's no incentive for
anyone to do anything.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.700 align:middle line:84%
Can you see how dumbed
down and manipulated

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.790 align:middle line:84%
we've become over
thousands of years,

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:55.350 align:middle line:84%
of this slow, methodical
infiltration of this nonsense

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:57.200 align:middle line:90%
into our lives?

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.820 align:middle line:90%
This is what's become of us.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:01.410 align:middle line:84%
We believe that we cannot
survive without money.

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:05.170 align:middle line:84%
This is why we have to
deal with the money issue.

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:09.350 align:middle line:84%
Until we've dealt with the money
and how it controls every crack

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:12.070 align:middle line:84%
and crevice of our
existence, we'll

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:15.950 align:middle line:84%
never get out of the matrix
and enslavement system

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:17.630 align:middle line:90%
that is being imposed on us.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:21.810 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest lies and
the most devious and dangerous

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:25.700 align:middle line:84%
sugar-coated poison pill that
has been imposed on humanity

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:30.180 align:middle line:84%
is capitalism-- capitalism and
this thing called democracy

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:33.530 align:middle line:90%
and the idea of competition.

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:35.200 align:middle line:84%
Competition is the
most evil thing

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.690 align:middle line:84%
that's ever been told
to us, from the earliest

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:40.530 align:middle line:84%
time that we grow up and
we start going to school.

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:42.512 align:middle line:84%
We get exposed to the
concept of competition.

00:13:42.512 --> 00:13:43.970 align:middle line:84%
You have to compete
against others.

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:45.340 align:middle line:84%
You have to be
top of your class.

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:47.298 align:middle line:84%
You have to be the best
this and the best that.

00:13:47.298 --> 00:13:50.095 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't get to the
top, how you're going to-- it's

00:13:50.095 --> 00:13:52.345 align:middle line:84%
always this competition to
get to the top of the pile.

00:13:52.345 --> 00:13:55.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, what happens when you
get to the top of the pile?

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.700 align:middle line:84%
Somebody else is going to try
and knock you off the top.

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:00.500 align:middle line:84%
So clearly, this thing
called competition,

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:03.200 align:middle line:90%
it is not a win-win situation.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.060 align:middle line:84%
If it's not good for
everyone, it's no good at all.

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.120 align:middle line:84%
Competition is the
antithesis of that.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And democracy is this
falsified, nonsensical system

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.100 align:middle line:84%
that's been shoved down
our throats to say, oh,

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:17.980 align:middle line:90%
we live in democracy.

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:19.660 align:middle line:84%
That's not democratic,
and so forth.

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:23.000 align:middle line:84%
Democracy was built on
the backs of slaves.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.460 align:middle line:84%
Democracy is just
a bullying tactic.

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:27.970 align:middle line:90%
There's 49 of us and 51 of them.

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And because it's
51 of them, they're

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:32.820 align:middle line:84%
going to have it their
way and screw the 49%.

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:34.280 align:middle line:90%
That is not a solution.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:37.050 align:middle line:84%
That creates more division
and a bigger problem.

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:40.980 align:middle line:84%
So please understand, the
democracy is part of the lie

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:43.030 align:middle line:90%
and the conspiracy against us.

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:46.510 align:middle line:84%
Capitalism, the use of
money to drive democracy,

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:50.730 align:middle line:84%
to feed and set up this whole
structure of competition that

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:52.990 align:middle line:84%
creates a corporate
hierarchy or structure,

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:56.180 align:middle line:84%
that leads to
compartmentalization,

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:59.720 align:middle line:84%
the hiding of information,
the hiding of knowledge

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.660 align:middle line:84%
and discovery for the
benefit of corporations

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:06.780 align:middle line:84%
at the detriment of everyone
else on this planet.

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:09.160 align:middle line:84%
So it is for the
benefit of the few

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.640 align:middle line:84%
at the cost and
expense of the many.

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.960 align:middle line:90%
That's what competition does.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.550 align:middle line:90%
It is a control system.

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:17.890 align:middle line:84%
Through competition,
we achieve nothing

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:20.280 align:middle line:84%
except control
over our resources,

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:23.850 align:middle line:84%
control over everything we
do, control over our lives,

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:27.410 align:middle line:84%
control over what we think,
control of what we may say,

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:28.770 align:middle line:90%
where we may go.

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:31.420 align:middle line:90%
That's what competition does.

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:35.420 align:middle line:84%
It is a system that
leads to scarcity.

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.610 align:middle line:90%
That's what competition does.

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:41.270 align:middle line:84%
Because everything we
do, everything we create,

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:44.280 align:middle line:84%
everything we build,
everything we invent

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.540 align:middle line:90%
gets controlled by corporations.

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:49.920 align:middle line:84%
They'd use it for their benefit
against living, breathing

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.270 align:middle line:90%
human beings.

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:54.620 align:middle line:84%
They keep scarcity
as the main driving

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:58.640 align:middle line:84%
force to keep the
corporate structure alive.

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.010 align:middle line:90%
So what do we do with this?

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:02.560 align:middle line:90%
We need to change this around.

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's this tiny
little flip of the mind.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:10.180 align:middle line:84%
All we have to do is change
the concept of competition

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:14.680 align:middle line:84%
into cooperation and
collaboration, and everything

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.040 align:middle line:90%
changes.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:19.750 align:middle line:84%
We go from a world of scarcity
to living in a world where we

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:23.460 align:middle line:84%
create so much abundance, we
cannot imagine that in this

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:26.970 align:middle line:84%
world and our lives
as we live today,

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:30.800 align:middle line:84%
in this world controlled by
capitalism and controlled

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:34.610 align:middle line:84%
by scarcity and
controlled by competition.

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:37.540 align:middle line:84%
The whole competition
aspect is just unbelievable.

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:40.570 align:middle line:84%
I just need to come back
to that a little bit.

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And I was told by a
sports psychologist

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:46.120 align:middle line:84%
recently at a workshop
here in the United States

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:49.100 align:middle line:84%
that competition has
actually led to a big problem

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:52.460 align:middle line:84%
within the sports industry,
where some of the teams that

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:56.230 align:middle line:84%
have got stars that rise
above the rest of the team

00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:59.180 align:middle line:84%
are starting to do worse
than teams that work together

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:00.504 align:middle line:90%
cohesively.

00:17:00.504 --> 00:17:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And this has become
a big problem,

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.660 align:middle line:84%
to try and keep
everybody to cooperate,

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:08.430 align:middle line:84%
to collaborate as a team and
not have individual stars that

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:11.050 align:middle line:84%
think they are special and
they're better than everybody

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:12.849 align:middle line:90%
else in the team.

00:17:12.849 --> 00:17:17.210 align:middle line:84%
So even in a competitive
area like sport,

00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:19.770 align:middle line:84%
you realize that competition
in the sense that

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:22.130 align:middle line:84%
is imposed on us in the
capitalist and money-driven

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:24.960 align:middle line:84%
society, that that
system doesn't work even

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.140 align:middle line:84%
in the sport, where you've
go to work together.

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:30.550 align:middle line:84%
You've got to work
collaboratively as one unit.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And this is really a
beautiful stepping stone

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:37.420 align:middle line:84%
to understand that
only out of unity

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.370 align:middle line:84%
can you create
infinite diversity.

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:41.116 align:middle line:90%
Now, what does that what mean?

00:17:41.116 --> 00:17:43.410 align:middle line:90%
What do I mean by this?

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:45.540 align:middle line:84%
Remember that
everything in creation

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:48.320 align:middle line:84%
comes out of a primordial
source of resonance,

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:52.200 align:middle line:84%
the creative force, the creative
source of sound and resonance

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.270 align:middle line:84%
that brought
everything to creation.

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:56.800 align:middle line:84%
So out of that one
source of unity

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:59.990 align:middle line:84%
do you get an infinite
number of resonant, harmonic

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:03.730 align:middle line:84%
resonant fractals that
have given us this thing

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:06.240 align:middle line:84%
we call the universe
and everything in it.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:09.740 align:middle line:84%
So only out of unity
can you create all

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:11.840 align:middle line:90%
have infinite diversity.

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:15.660 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have unity
to start off with,

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:18.910 align:middle line:84%
you cannot ever possibly imagine
that you can create abundance

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:20.440 align:middle line:90%
or infinite diversity.

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:23.290 align:middle line:84%
It'll be chaos and
conflict and destruction,

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:26.760 align:middle line:84%
because you have dissonant
energies, dissonant resonances

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.460 align:middle line:84%
that destroy each other,
energy waves that destroy

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:30.990 align:middle line:90%
the energy that created it.

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:32.960 align:middle line:84%
So this is once you
understand resonance--

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.840 align:middle line:84%
and we've dealt with in great
detail in previous episodes--

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:38.110 align:middle line:84%
once we understand the
concept of resonance,

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:41.210 align:middle line:84%
it is a lot easier to
understand what this means.

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:45.140 align:middle line:84%
Only out of unity can you attain
and achieve infinite diversity.

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And this is what the philosophy
of Ubuntu and contributionism

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.480 align:middle line:90%
is all about.

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:53.790 align:middle line:84%
It's all about creating
infinite diversity.

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:56.380 align:middle line:84%
Anything we imagine
or we set our hearts

00:18:56.380 --> 00:19:01.550 align:middle line:84%
on, we can create if we work out
of unity, a unified community.

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:03.560 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like
to suggest is we

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:07.240 align:middle line:84%
start looking at our
communities like our bodies.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.640 align:middle line:84%
This is a beautiful example
of, only out of unity

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.460 align:middle line:90%
can you get infinite diversity.

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:17.200 align:middle line:84%
In our bodies, we have trillions
of cells that work together.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.430 align:middle line:84%
Each and every
cell in our body is

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:22.670 align:middle line:84%
critically important to the
makeup of the whole community

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:26.330 align:middle line:90%
of cells that we call our body.

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And even when some
of these cells

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:30.590 align:middle line:84%
become more specialized,
like becoming

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:32.580 align:middle line:84%
the brain cells
or the liver cells

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:34.710 align:middle line:84%
or the heart cells
or the skin cells,

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:37.110 align:middle line:84%
they don't compete
against each other.

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:40.440 align:middle line:84%
They don't try and get
oneupmanship over the other.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:43.950 align:middle line:84%
They work together for
the greatest benefit

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:46.230 align:middle line:84%
of the whole body,
the whole community

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:48.800 align:middle line:90%
of cells that makes up the body.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.400 align:middle line:84%
So in this is a
great example for us,

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.470 align:middle line:84%
how we can look at
our communities,

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:57.980 align:middle line:84%
treat our communities like
the extension of our bodies.

00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:00.370 align:middle line:84%
Millions of people
working together

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:02.700 align:middle line:84%
for the benefit of
the whole community,

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.350 align:middle line:84%
using their own skills,
their specialized

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:08.520 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is, whether you're
a heart cell or a brain cell.

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.300 align:middle line:84%
Whether you're a
carpenter or a scientist

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:14.590 align:middle line:84%
or a teacher or a shoemaker,
you contribute and perform

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:17.010 align:middle line:84%
a very important
task that benefits

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:18.710 align:middle line:90%
everyone in your community.

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we're going to
deal with in much more detail

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:25.430 align:middle line:84%
as we unpack the simple
philosophy of Ubuntu

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:29.070 align:middle line:84%
and contributionism, a whole
new social structure that

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:33.630 align:middle line:84%
creates abundance beyond
our wildest imagination.

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:37.650 align:middle line:84%
When you wake up in the
morning and you go down

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:41.980 align:middle line:84%
to the kitchen for breakfast
and you're reading your paper

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:45.120 align:middle line:84%
or doing what you normally do
and your daughter comes down

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.450 align:middle line:90%
and she opens the fridge.

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:50.890 align:middle line:84%
She takes out the orange juice
and makes some toast and cheese

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:52.230 align:middle line:90%
and joins you for breakfast.

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And your son comes
and joins you and he

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.430 align:middle line:84%
has some coffee and
some Rice Krispies

00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:59.120 align:middle line:84%
or whatever the hell your son
likes to eat for breakfast.

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And your wife comes
down and she makes

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.930 align:middle line:84%
some scrambled
eggs and some bacon

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:04.990 align:middle line:84%
and whatever your wife
eats for breakfast.

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And you're all sitting as a
happy family, having breakfast.

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.360 align:middle line:84%
At which point to you turn
to your wife and say, honey,

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:11.109 align:middle line:90%
what did you have?

00:21:11.109 --> 00:21:12.030 align:middle line:90%
Was it bacon and eggs?

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:13.600 align:middle line:90%
That's going to be five bucks.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And you turn to your
daughter and say, listen,

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:17.380 align:middle line:84%
for that orange
juice and the toast

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:19.880 align:middle line:84%
and the cheese, that's going
to be another six bucks to you.

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:21.630 align:middle line:90%
And son, what did you have?

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:22.880 align:middle line:90%
Corn Flakes or whatever?

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.460 align:middle line:90%
That's going to be $3.50.

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:26.800 align:middle line:90%
We don't do that, do we?

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.330 align:middle line:90%
We work together as a unit.

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:30.280 align:middle line:90%
We work together as a family.

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:34.050 align:middle line:84%
We work together for the benefit
of everyone in our family.

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:37.750 align:middle line:84%
So why is it that we change
when we leave our homes?

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:39.520 align:middle line:84%
When you go to the
pub on a Friday night

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.722 align:middle line:84%
and you're having a beer and
you meet some interesting people

00:21:42.722 --> 00:21:44.930 align:middle line:84%
and you invite them over
for a barbecue at your house

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:47.100 align:middle line:84%
on Sunday, and they
come to your house

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:51.530 align:middle line:84%
and you have the
meat on the barbecue.

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And you say, how's
it going, John?

00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:54.050 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to my house.

00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:55.490 align:middle line:90%
And there's a fridge.

00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:57.110 align:middle line:84%
The beer's over
there in the fridge.

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:58.290 align:middle line:90%
And come and join us.

00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And you're barbecuing, or as
we call in South Africa brining

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:02.860 align:middle line:90%
the meat.

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And you have a fun time,
drinking beer, having

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:07.605 align:middle line:84%
a great time, swimming--
whatever-- at which point

00:22:07.605 --> 00:22:09.730 align:middle line:84%
do you turn to your friend
and say, oh, by the way,

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:11.730 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be $100
for the afternoon.

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:13.360 align:middle line:90%
We don't do that, do we?

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:16.610 align:middle line:84%
You invited a complete
stranger into your home.

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:21.710 align:middle line:84%
You shared your time, your
energy, your food, your drinks

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:23.700 align:middle line:90%
with a complete stranger.

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:25.940 align:middle line:90%
We are creatures of sharing.

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:27.480 align:middle line:90%
We want to share.

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:30.340 align:middle line:84%
We want to embrace
and include others.

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:32.210 align:middle line:90%
We love to give.

00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:37.580 align:middle line:84%
We are by nature beings
of love and sharing.

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:38.880 align:middle line:90%
And then something happens.

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:42.240 align:middle line:84%
Monday morning comes,
we get into our cars,

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:45.560 align:middle line:84%
we put in our suits,
we hit the highway,

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:48.020 align:middle line:90%
and we become little monsters.

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:50.730 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, we have
no time for anyone.

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:53.320 align:middle line:84%
Get out of my way, and the
road rage gets in our way

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.705 align:middle line:90%
and we change completely.

00:22:55.705 --> 00:22:57.199 align:middle line:90%
Or, it's all about the money.

00:22:57.199 --> 00:22:58.240 align:middle line:90%
I don't have enough time.

00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.252 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, can't see you.

00:22:59.252 --> 00:23:00.210 align:middle line:90%
Don't have enough time.

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:02.420 align:middle line:84%
It's all about the
money, chasing the buck.

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And we go from these
beautiful, embracing,

00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:08.590 align:middle line:84%
loving beings on the weekend
to these little monsters that

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:11.480 align:middle line:84%
are just chasing money,
trying to survive.

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.920 align:middle line:84%
No wonder we're psychotic
and sick, because we

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.660 align:middle line:90%
live these split lives.

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:19.450 align:middle line:84%
We have completely
split personalities.

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And this is what's
being done to humanity

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:23.690 align:middle line:90%
over a long, long time.

00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:28.670 align:middle line:84%
We've been divided,
manipulated, compartmentalized,

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:30.600 align:middle line:90%
separated from each other.

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And this has all being done
through this thing called

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:36.790 align:middle line:84%
corporations, the hierarchical
structure, capitalism,

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:38.140 align:middle line:90%
and competition.

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:39.870 align:middle line:84%
This is what we
have to overcome.

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:42.040 align:middle line:84%
And we overcome this
very, very simply

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:47.200 align:middle line:84%
by changing competition into
cooperation and collaboration.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.070 align:middle line:84%
These are the
fundamental principles

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:51.250 align:middle line:90%
of Ubuntu and contributionism.

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:55.360 align:middle line:84%
So when we get to this point,
we realize that we are not born

00:23:55.360 --> 00:24:00.110 align:middle line:84%
free on this planet, that we
cannot move around freely.

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:02.470 align:middle line:84%
We cannot live
where we choose to.

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:03.990 align:middle line:90%
And some people say, I'm free.

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:04.860 align:middle line:90%
I've got free will.

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:06.119 align:middle line:90%
I can do what I want.

00:24:06.119 --> 00:24:07.910 align:middle line:84%
People are completely
misguided about this.

00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:11.270 align:middle line:84%
Just because you can get in your
car and drive down to Florida

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:14.300 align:middle line:84%
or drive to LA from New
OK it means you're free.

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:15.030 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no.

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:18.370 align:middle line:84%
These are some choices--
choices and options

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:20.920 align:middle line:84%
that we've been
given on a platter.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:21.587 align:middle line:90%
You're not free.

00:24:21.587 --> 00:24:23.294 align:middle line:84%
You're completely and
utterly controlled.

00:24:23.294 --> 00:24:25.610 align:middle line:10%
Try and leave the United
States without a passport

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:26.650 align:middle line:10%
and see what happens.

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:30.130 align:middle line:10%
Try and move to Australia
and you see what happens.

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:31.370 align:middle line:10%
We cannot move freely.

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:34.420 align:middle line:10%
We cannot cross borders without
pieces of paper that have

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:37.350 align:middle line:10%
to identify living,
breathing human beings.

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:39.760 align:middle line:10%
And you realize that
the absolute control

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.760 align:middle line:10%
system has been imposed on us.

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:44.110 align:middle line:10%
We need passports
and work permits.

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:46.230 align:middle line:10%
We have to follow rules.

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:49.960 align:middle line:84%
How many of us signed an
agreement with our government

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:52.950 align:middle line:84%
when we were born that we
will abide by the rules

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:56.490 align:middle line:84%
and the laws imposed
on us at birth?

00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:58.100 align:middle line:90%
Not a single one of us.

00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And yet, at a specific
point in our lives,

00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:03.820 align:middle line:84%
suddenly these rules
get imposed on us.

00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't abide by
these rules, we get arrested.

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:10.610 align:middle line:84%
We become unwanted
elements in society

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:13.490 align:middle line:84%
and we become
enemies of the state.

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:17.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, I didn't agree
to any of these rules

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:18.550 align:middle line:84%
and these laws
they imposed on me.

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:20.630 align:middle line:90%
So what does that mean?

00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:22.950 align:middle line:84%
That means that we are
completely enslaved.

00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:24.220 align:middle line:90%
We have to use money.

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:26.340 align:middle line:90%
We have to work to earn money.

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:29.430 align:middle line:84%
If we don't work to earn
money, or if we don't start

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:32.970 align:middle line:84%
our own busyness
to earn this money,

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:35.660 align:middle line:90%
we can't exist in this society.

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And we become
enemies of the state.

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:42.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, I wasn't born to
live this kind of life.

00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:46.180 align:middle line:84%
This is not what I hoped my
life would turn out to be.

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that nobody was
born to live this kind of life.

00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:52.820 align:middle line:90%


00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:56.640 align:middle line:84%
Over 10 years, nearly 11 years
of sharing this philosophy

00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:00.070 align:middle line:84%
with thousands and thousands
of people around the world,

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:03.300 align:middle line:84%
not once have I
found one person that

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:06.890 align:middle line:84%
believes or says they're
happy with their life,

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:08.890 align:middle line:84%
with the way their
life has turned out,

00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:11.340 align:middle line:84%
with the way the world
is going, with what

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:13.980 align:middle line:90%
the government is doing.

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:17.060 align:middle line:84%
And at this stage, we realize
that the government is not

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:22.120 align:middle line:84%
our friend, that they are
powers and elite structures that

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:25.010 align:middle line:84%
are imposed themselves
on every single one of us

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:27.430 align:middle line:90%
and turned us into their slave.

00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:30.930 align:middle line:84%
This is the slavery system that
we've been born in-- completely

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:35.260 align:middle line:84%
and utterly run by
money, enslaved by money.

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is when
it becomes really,

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:41.370 align:middle line:84%
really important to internalize
this important statement made

00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:47.220 align:middle line:84%
by the famous Austrian poet
and philosopher Wolfgang Goethe

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:52.330 align:middle line:84%
when he said, "None are more
enslaved than those who falsely

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:53.850 align:middle line:90%
believe they are free."

00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:57.660 align:middle line:84%
The emphasis is on "falsely
believe they are free."

00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.320 align:middle line:90%
Many of us believe we are free.

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:02.940 align:middle line:84%
We think we are free, because
we have options and choices that

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:06.320 align:middle line:84%
are presented to us,
which are not freedom.

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And we confuse freedom with
what is being presented

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:15.020 align:middle line:84%
to us as enslaved
and caged freedom,

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:17.140 align:middle line:84%
with a few options
here and there.

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:20.080 align:middle line:84%
Our lives and our
societies have become

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:24.080 align:middle line:84%
driven by brands,
corporations, careers,

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:26.810 align:middle line:90%
and this thing called jobs.

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:30.290 align:middle line:84%
A job is nothing
more than a slave.

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:34.130 align:middle line:84%
You're in a slave system
while you have a job.

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:37.780 align:middle line:84%
When the company that gave
you a job no longer needs you,

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:38.810 align:middle line:90%
what happens?

00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:40.120 align:middle line:90%
They kick you out.

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:41.720 align:middle line:90%
You're back on the street.

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:44.910 align:middle line:84%
So a job is not a
solution for the problem.

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:47.970 align:middle line:84%
A job is just a
temporary relief to make

00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:51.040 align:middle line:84%
you believe you're free, to
give you the tools and the toys

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:54.170 align:middle line:84%
and the bells and whistles that
you think give you this freedom

00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:56.830 align:middle line:84%
to buy stuff with and
buy your happiness.

00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:59.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, very soon when
you lose your job,

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:04.020 align:middle line:84%
and millions of us have gone
through this-- so have I--

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:08.095 align:middle line:84%
when we lose our jobs, suddenly
our world collapses and we go

00:28:08.095 --> 00:28:10.620 align:middle line:84%
out looking for another job
because we cannot survive

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:11.870 align:middle line:90%
without a job.

00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:14.420 align:middle line:90%
So a job means slave.

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:16.640 align:middle line:84%
Every time you hear
a politician say,

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:19.970 align:middle line:84%
we going to create a million
more jobs, all they're

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:23.200 align:middle line:84%
telling you is we're going to
create a million more slaves.

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.520 align:middle line:84%
So please read
between the lines when

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:28.470 align:middle line:84%
politicians talk about
creating jobs and stimulating

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:29.480 align:middle line:90%
the economy.

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:32.730 align:middle line:84%
All these are words of
deception, lying to us,

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:37.660 align:middle line:84%
deceiving us, taking us down a
path of more enslavement, more

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:40.600 align:middle line:90%
creation of slavery systems.

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:42.110 align:middle line:90%
We don't want jobs.

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:43.780 align:middle line:84%
We don't want a
stronger economy.

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:46.040 align:middle line:84%
The world "economy" is
based on economizing,

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.390 align:middle line:90%
working with scarcity.

00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:48.680 align:middle line:90%
We don't want to economize.

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.880 align:middle line:84%
We want to live in a
world of abundance,

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:54.020 align:middle line:84%
where everything is available
in infinite number of amounts,

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:55.920 align:middle line:84%
in infinite amounts,
because that's

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:58.670 align:middle line:84%
what we are capable of as
living, breathing human beings.

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:00.430 align:middle line:90%
We can create infinitely.

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:03.990 align:middle line:84%
One apple tree does not
grow one more apple tree.

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:07.100 align:middle line:84%
One apple tree seeds
thousands of apple trees.

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:09.760 align:middle line:84%
This is what we are
capable of and much more

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:12.040 align:middle line:84%
as living, breathing
human beings.

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:15.080 align:middle line:84%
So what are we going to do
about this thing called jobs?

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:18.410 align:middle line:84%
How do we get ourselves
out of the job mentality

00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:23.140 align:middle line:84%
and into a system of abundance,
from scarcity to abundance?

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:25.930 align:middle line:84%
Ubuntu and contributionism
provides us

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:29.890 align:middle line:84%
with a very simple and
eloquent transitional phase.

00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:33.000 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to see this as
new, liberating information.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.170 align:middle line:84%
Please don't read
or look at the dark

00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:37.230 align:middle line:90%
and the depressing information.

00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:39.440 align:middle line:84%
Let's use the dark and
depressing information

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:42.630 align:middle line:84%
to liberate us from this
enslavement and the slavery

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:44.630 align:middle line:84%
matrix that we
find ourselves in.

00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:45.930 align:middle line:90%
And we have the solutions.

00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:50.750 align:middle line:84%
They are simple and eloquent and
applicable very, very quickly.

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:52.420 align:middle line:84%
Just because it's
never been done

00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:54.950 align:middle line:84%
before doesn't mean it's not
possible and doesn't mean

00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:56.680 align:middle line:90%
it's going to take a long time.

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:59.650 align:middle line:84%
I believe that to transition
into a world of Ubuntu

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:02.490 align:middle line:84%
and contributionism,
a world of abundance

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:04.740 align:middle line:84%
can happen in the
blink of an eye.

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:07.220 align:middle line:84%
It is a revolution
of consciousness.

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:08.940 align:middle line:90%
No more bloody revolutions.

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:11.370 align:middle line:90%
The time for that has long gone.

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:13.160 align:middle line:84%
Remember that with
the Ubuntu movement

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:15.080 align:middle line:84%
and the philosophy
of contributionism,

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:17.360 align:middle line:90%
we aren't opposing anybody.

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:19.020 align:middle line:90%
We're not confronting anybody.

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:20.800 align:middle line:90%
We don't want to fight anybody.

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:22.640 align:middle line:90%
We want to create a new system.

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And we are creating
a new system.

00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:27.990 align:middle line:84%
The good news is, we take
the system as being created,

00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:30.050 align:middle line:84%
use it for the
benefit of humanity,

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:33.940 align:middle line:84%
and turn it around from a
negative, entangled, matrix

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:37.700 align:middle line:84%
slavery system into a system
that empowers and liberates

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:38.320 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.099 align:middle line:84%
And this can happen
very quickly.

00:30:40.099 --> 00:30:41.640 align:middle line:84%
And over the next
few episodes, we're

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:45.450 align:middle line:84%
going to unpack how to achieve
this state of abundance

00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:48.980 align:middle line:84%
and freedom for all of us
from the slavery system.

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:50.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm Michael Tellinger.

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:52.210 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for watching.
