00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.480 align:middle line:84%
>>Hello, and welcome to the
fourth episode of the Ubuntu

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.940 align:middle line:84%
Contributionism workshop,
with our amazing studio

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.632 align:middle line:84%
guests that came a long
way to participate in this.

00:00:21.632 --> 00:00:23.590 align:middle line:10%
And thank you very much,
again, for being here,

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.520 align:middle line:10%
and sharing as far as Alaska
and all over the United States,

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.320 align:middle line:10%
and some locals.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.980 align:middle line:10%
So we continue this
journey of discovery

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.620 align:middle line:10%
and sharing some of the dark
and depressing history, which

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.570 align:middle line:10%
leads us to the
enlightening solutions.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.530 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to just remind
you, don't get too depressed

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.330 align:middle line:90%
about this.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.130 align:middle line:84%
Remember, I brought
this up earlier.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.720 align:middle line:84%
Some of this information can
really get dark and depressing.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.990 align:middle line:90%
But don't see it like that.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.420 align:middle line:84%
See it as enlightening
information that gives us

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.710 align:middle line:84%
the platform from
which we can launch

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.880 align:middle line:84%
this whole new alternative
system for the world.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.580 align:middle line:10%
So let's pick up where we left
off in the previous episode

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.940 align:middle line:10%
to remind ourselves
about this global banking

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.670 align:middle line:10%
industry, the fact
that it's really

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.630 align:middle line:10%
a legalized crime syndicate
that operates above the low.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.640 align:middle line:84%
And one of the best examples,
how they operate above the law,

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.140 align:middle line:90%
is little tests.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.060 align:middle line:90%
And this is what I discovered.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.950 align:middle line:84%
If you remember, the Cyprus
financial crisis in 2013,

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.630 align:middle line:84%
when they closed all
the banks in Cyprus,

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.120 align:middle line:84%
kept everybody's money,
and got away with it.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.390 align:middle line:90%
Unbelievable.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.300 align:middle line:84%
I've just recently had my bank
account closed, as I mentioned,

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.092 align:middle line:84%
and they just kept
all the money.

00:01:41.092 --> 00:01:43.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm still trying to figure
out what to do about that.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.740 align:middle line:84%
But in Cyprus, it
was a lot worse.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.820 align:middle line:84%
They shut down all the
banks, all the bank accounts,

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.540 align:middle line:90%
kept everybody's money.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.940 align:middle line:84%
I have a friend in
Cape Town whose friend

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.770 align:middle line:84%
had 11 million pounds in
his Cyprus bank account.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.050 align:middle line:90%
He woke up, he had zilch.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.600 align:middle line:84%
Now this just shows you how
these bankers-- banksters,

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.550 align:middle line:84%
because that's really what they
are-- operate above the law.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.789 align:middle line:84%
They stole everybody's money,
raided people's bank accounts.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.000 align:middle line:84%
No repercussions, no criminal
charges, no investigations,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.950 align:middle line:84%
no one ever saw the inside
of a courtroom or inside

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.330 align:middle line:90%
of a jailhouse.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.190 align:middle line:90%
They simply got away with it.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And I suspect that
was just a test.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.270 align:middle line:84%
It was to see what would
happen if they did this.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.070 align:middle line:90%
What would the people do?

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And they discovered that
the people did nothing.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.090 align:middle line:84%
They jumped up and
down, they got angry,

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.490 align:middle line:84%
they protested, and in
the end, they did nothing.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.940 align:middle line:84%
Because ultimately, there's
very little we can do

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.020 align:middle line:90%
against this kind of control.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.220 align:middle line:84%
It is an absolute control, as
we've already gone through.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.530 align:middle line:84%
It has infiltrated every crack
and crevice of our existence,

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:48.940 align:middle line:90%
of our lives.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.620 align:middle line:84%
There's so little
resistance that we can pose,

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.220 align:middle line:84%
because every door
is shut down to us.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.100 align:middle line:84%
You can't take it to court, you
can't take it to your mayor.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.140 align:middle line:84%
You can't-- there's
very little we can do.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.040 align:middle line:90%
So let's move on.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.740 align:middle line:10%
And just a bit of
lighthearted relief

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.070 align:middle line:10%
to tell us how
ridiculous the system is,

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.680 align:middle line:10%
we just create worthless
electronic money out

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.890 align:middle line:10%
of nothing.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.540 align:middle line:10%
Then we lend it out and
charge interest on it.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.170 align:middle line:10%
Then we make them give us
their houses and real wealth

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.260 align:middle line:10%
when they can't pay it back.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.500 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly what happens.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.740 align:middle line:84%
So to remind ourselves
that the money controls

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.500 align:middle line:84%
the legal system, the
courts and the judges,

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.250 align:middle line:84%
and how this impact on
us is quite spectacular.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.390 align:middle line:10%
Because every week, every
month, every year, new laws

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.150 align:middle line:10%
are made by our governments.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.190 align:middle line:10%
And we don't necessarily
agree with these laws.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.580 align:middle line:10%
They don't come to us and
ask us, is it OK with you

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.680 align:middle line:10%
that we implement these
new laws and these new acts

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.570 align:middle line:10%
and these new bills?

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.850 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:50.683 align:middle line:90%
They just pass them.

00:03:50.683 --> 00:03:53.217 align:middle line:84%
Before we know it, there are
all these new regulations.

00:03:53.217 --> 00:03:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, you're in
trouble because you didn't

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.550 align:middle line:90%
know about this regulation.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.340 align:middle line:90%
Isn't this all ass about face?

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, aren't we supposed to
be the people that are telling

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.630 align:middle line:90%
our servants what to do?

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.980 align:middle line:84%
And the politicians are
opposed to be our servants.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
you realize that it's

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.030 align:middle line:90%
completely out of control.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.670 align:middle line:84%
The politicians have
taken us all hostage.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.310 align:middle line:84%
The governments have taken
us hostage, those in control.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.029 align:middle line:84%
And they've turned
us into their slaves.

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:21.700 align:middle line:84%
In South Africa, they use
the Government Gazette

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.850 align:middle line:90%
to publish the new laws.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.820 align:middle line:84%
Nobody reads the
Government Gazette.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure where they
publish these laws and bills

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.270 align:middle line:84%
in the USA, but every country's
got their own legal publication

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.960 align:middle line:90%
where they publish these things.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.195 align:middle line:84%
And then if you don't
protest against it,

00:04:37.195 --> 00:04:38.570 align:middle line:84%
if you don't raise
any objection,

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.177 align:middle line:84%
then suddenly it goes
into law, and that's it.

00:04:41.177 --> 00:04:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And this is how they
get away with it.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.610 align:middle line:10%
So our laws protect
the corporations.

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.070 align:middle line:90%
They do not serve the people.

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.440 align:middle line:90%
We've discussed this already.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.860 align:middle line:84%
Corporations have more
rights than living, breathing

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.090 align:middle line:90%
human beings.

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.890 align:middle line:84%
So what we realize is that we
need a whole new legal system

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.260 align:middle line:84%
written by the people, for the
people, that serves the people.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.830 align:middle line:10%
And this is where
we're moving away

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.960 align:middle line:10%
from the corporate structures,
the centralized government

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.680 align:middle line:10%
structures, bringing back the
control into our communities

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.037 align:middle line:10%
where people govern themselves
in their own communities.

00:05:12.037 --> 00:05:13.620 align:middle line:84%
Because that's where
our lives happen.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:14.911 align:middle line:90%
They happen in our communities.

00:05:14.911 --> 00:05:18.160 align:middle line:84%
They don't happen at Capitol
Hill or in Washington.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.680 align:middle line:90%
They happen in our communities.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
we should control

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.200 align:middle line:84%
our lives and our own
day-to-day activities.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.640 align:middle line:84%
Not in some ivory tower that
you cannot reach for permission

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.875 align:middle line:84%
if you can plant daisies in
your front garden, right?

00:05:32.875 --> 00:05:34.800 align:middle line:84%
Because that's how
silly things get.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.950 align:middle line:84%
You know, some places,
apparently, you

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.020 align:middle line:90%
can't capture rainwater.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.160 align:middle line:84%
It's now illegal to
capture rainwater.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.970 align:middle line:90%
You can't grow your own food.

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.790 align:middle line:84%
You can't grow food on the
sidewalks and pavement.

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:47.776 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:05:47.776 --> 00:05:50.390 align:middle line:84%
So we can't grow our
own food, so they're

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.080 align:middle line:84%
forcing us to buy
food from corporations

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.540 align:middle line:84%
and centralized places that
provide us with poisoned food

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.880 align:middle line:90%
and GMO food?

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.570 align:middle line:90%
This is how crazy it's becoming.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.220 align:middle line:84%
The more you look at the
restrictions and the control,

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.650 align:middle line:90%
the more insane it becomes.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.240 align:middle line:84%
And you realize that it's
almost reached the stage

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.110 align:middle line:90%
of being absolute control.

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have so little
maneuvering room,

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.532 align:middle line:84%
if we don't do
something about it now,

00:06:17.532 --> 00:06:19.490 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be very
difficult to do something

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.724 align:middle line:90%
about it tomorrow.

00:06:20.724 --> 00:06:22.890 align:middle line:84%
So the good thing is we're
doing something about it.

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.100 align:middle line:84%
We're here right now,
putting this energy

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.710 align:middle line:84%
into the morphogenetic field,
affecting the fabric of reality

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:34.430 align:middle line:84%
and everywhere by simply talking
about it and thinking about it.

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:39.720 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to remind you,
the one thing that most of us

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.030 align:middle line:84%
have forgotten, and we
keep reminding everyone,

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:46.190 align:middle line:84%
with especially the Ubuntu
party on the political front

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.290 align:middle line:84%
that we have appointed our
leaders to be our servants, not

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:52.570 align:middle line:90%
to be our slave masters.

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.610 align:middle line:84%
To do the best for
us, the people.

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:56.230 align:middle line:10%
To serve the people.

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.650 align:middle line:10%
But unfortunately,
this has not happened.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.670 align:middle line:10%
The government is not
serving the people.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:03.270 align:middle line:10%
They never have, for as
long as we can go back.

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.630 align:middle line:10%
They're serving themselves
and the corporations

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.470 align:middle line:10%
that fund the government.

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:10.050 align:middle line:84%
They've turned the
people into their slaves.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:12.200 align:middle line:84%
The government and
the large corporations

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.662 align:middle line:84%
have simply stolen the
country from its people.

00:07:14.662 --> 00:07:17.120 align:middle line:84%
Most of us are told that the
country belongs to the people.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.600 align:middle line:84%
The country belongs
to its people.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.149 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's another lie.

00:07:20.149 --> 00:07:21.690 align:middle line:84%
There's no evidence
of that anywhere.

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:22.780 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing we can do.

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.650 align:middle line:90%
We can't do this, can't do that.

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:26.600 align:middle line:84%
The land doesn't
even belong to us.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.320 align:middle line:84%
If you don't pay
your rates in taxes,

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.480 align:middle line:84%
the land gets taken
away from you.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.380 align:middle line:90%
What kind of nonsense is that?

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.680 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:40.380 align:middle line:84%
You see the absolute control,
how it's been imposed on us.

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:43.070 align:middle line:84%
So the country has been
stolen from its people,

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:46.370 align:middle line:84%
and corporations
own our countries.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Like we said, they have more
rights than any single living,

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:50.980 align:middle line:90%
breathing human being.

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.040 align:middle line:84%
Remember that our
countries are corporations,

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.500 align:middle line:84%
and this is a big
shock to the system.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.770 align:middle line:84%
Everything has
being incorporated.

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:02.200 align:middle line:84%
Our constitutions are not
written for the people.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.460 align:middle line:84%
They're written for
the corporations

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.100 align:middle line:90%
known as our countries.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.570 align:middle line:84%
One of the best
examples of this is

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:11.940 align:middle line:84%
you get this on the US
Securities and Exchange.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:15.660 align:middle line:84%
And here's an example that
shows various large corporations

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.950 align:middle line:84%
like Anglo American
and Larson Brothers,

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:24.230 align:middle line:84%
Lehman Brothers, and then the
government of the Republic

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:28.010 align:middle line:84%
of South Africa, and then the
Republic of South Africa being

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:29.350 align:middle line:90%
registered as a corporation.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:31.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm just showing you
this as an example.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.580 align:middle line:84%
You can go and do this
search for yourself,

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.669 align:middle line:84%
go into the Securities
Exchange, and you

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:39.039 align:middle line:84%
can find all the governments and
all the countries of the world

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:40.700 align:middle line:90%
registered as corporations.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:44.250 align:middle line:84%
All countries, all states,
all provinces, all counties,

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:46.680 align:middle line:90%
all cities, all prisons.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.250 align:middle line:84%
Everything has
been incorporated.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:51.390 align:middle line:84%
Our roads have been sold
to private corporations.

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:54.190 align:middle line:84%
Haven't you noticed more toll
gates popping up everywhere

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:57.970 align:middle line:84%
suddenly on roads that we were
driving on freely 10 years ago,

00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:58.770 align:middle line:90%
20 years ago?

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:01.430 align:middle line:84%
All the roads were free
for us to drive on.

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:05.175 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, you can't drive anyway
without paying toll road taxes,

00:09:05.175 --> 00:09:08.580 align:middle line:84%
or having easy passes
in the United States

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.900 align:middle line:84%
to be able to drive
on the highways.

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.110 align:middle line:90%
It's insane.

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:14.160 align:middle line:84%
But luckily, there
are great examples

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.070 align:middle line:90%
how this can also unite people.

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:18.240 align:middle line:84%
In Johannesburg,
for example, we've

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.160 align:middle line:84%
got this easy pass system
that they've imposed on us.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.330 align:middle line:84%
They spent billions
of rands that we

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:26.480 align:middle line:84%
have to pay for to implement
these toll gates everywhere,

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.320 align:middle line:90%
these electronic toll gates.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:32.160 align:middle line:84%
But the people have just
completely rejected this.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.890 align:middle line:90%
They have not subscribed to it.

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:35.410 align:middle line:90%
They did not register.

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And everywhere you drive,
it says, register and pay

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.694 align:middle line:90%
toll fees.

00:09:38.694 --> 00:09:41.110 align:middle line:84%
So it's telling you that if
you register, you have to pay.

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:43.130 align:middle line:84%
If you don't register,
you don't have to pay,

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.000 align:middle line:84%
because it's a
private corporation.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.500 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the toll
gate companies

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.990 align:middle line:90%
are private corporations.

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And companies, act
in corporate law,

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:53.937 align:middle line:84%
cannot hold you responsible
unless you have a contract.

00:09:53.937 --> 00:09:55.770 align:middle line:84%
So these are all the
things that we learned.

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:58.760 align:middle line:84%
So I know that in Johannesburg,
in the greater Johannesburg

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.620 align:middle line:84%
area where they've imposed
this unlawful taxation

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:05.246 align:middle line:84%
on the people, I think
they've got less than 5%

00:10:05.246 --> 00:10:07.120 align:middle line:84%
of people that are
actually signed up for it.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.300 align:middle line:84%
The rest of the people
are simply ignoring it.

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's the beginning of
a revolution of consciousness

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:13.250 align:middle line:90%
saying, sorry.

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:14.050 align:middle line:90%
We've had enough.

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:16.270 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to put
up with this anymore.

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:20.920 align:middle line:10%
So just to give you some
more examples of countries

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:25.450 align:middle line:10%
and states and provinces
registered as corporations,

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:26.900 align:middle line:10%
a quick look here.

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:32.180 align:middle line:10%
In Jamaica, Hungary,
Israel, Italy,

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.700 align:middle line:10%
the government of
Jamaica, Japan.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:35.500 align:middle line:90%
It goes on.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:36.300 align:middle line:90%
Korea.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:39.940 align:middle line:84%
Oh, that's Korea
Development Bank.

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:44.960 align:middle line:84%
Province of Ontario, Republic
of Panama, Republic of Peru,

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.080 align:middle line:84%
Province of British
Columbia, and so it goes.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.030 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't stop.

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:51.230 align:middle line:90%
These are just a few examples.

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:54.970 align:middle line:10%
And then more examples here
of how cities in South Africa,

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:57.160 align:middle line:10%
for example, here's
the city of Cape Town,

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:01.560 align:middle line:10%
registered on the Dun
& Bradstreet registry

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:05.180 align:middle line:10%
that registers and gives these
Dun numbers to these companies

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:06.190 align:middle line:10%
and corporations.

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:08.750 align:middle line:10%
The city of Cape
Town also traded

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:10.520 align:middle line:10%
as Cape Town municipality.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.570 align:middle line:90%
Traded.

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:15.340 align:middle line:84%
Means these are traded on the
stock exchanges, all right?

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.970 align:middle line:84%
Just like our birth
certificates, remember?

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:19.440 align:middle line:90%
All of this.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:23.004 align:middle line:84%
Every time a baby is born, it
gets issued with a certificate.

00:11:23.004 --> 00:11:24.170 align:middle line:90%
Well, what is a certificate?

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:26.950 align:middle line:84%
It means there's a
component of ownership.

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:29.150 align:middle line:84%
Somebody owns you if
you have a certificate.

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:30.760 align:middle line:84%
That certificate is
owned by somebody,

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.420 align:middle line:84%
and it's owned by
our governments,

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:36.060 align:middle line:84%
and our governments use these
certificates to trade on stock

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.980 align:middle line:90%
markets around the world.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.800 align:middle line:84%
And this is all
sinister kind of stuff

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.680 align:middle line:84%
that boggles people's minds
when they discover this, right?

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:48.180 align:middle line:84%
So this is why every couple of
years, we have a census, right?

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:51.230 align:middle line:84%
Countries have a census to
determine how many people live

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:52.030 align:middle line:90%
in the country.

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And then they tell
us it's to know

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.250 align:middle line:90%
how much services to provide.

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's got nothing
to do with services.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:11:59.660 align:middle line:84%
It's to know how
many people there

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:03.810 align:middle line:84%
are, to know how much stock they
have to trade with on the stock

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:05.050 align:middle line:90%
markets or the world.

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:06.730 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:07.940 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is.

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:10.850 align:middle line:84%
Lies and deception
around every corner.

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And this is these Dun numbers
for the USA government

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.745 align:middle line:84%
corporations, Dun &
Bradstreet registrations.

00:12:16.745 --> 00:12:19.000 align:middle line:84%
I have more of these
in the Ubuntu book

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.460 align:middle line:90%
that you can look at.

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:22.835 align:middle line:84%
But you can go do your
own research on this.

00:12:22.835 --> 00:12:24.880 align:middle line:90%
It's quite an interesting thing.

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.480 align:middle line:84%
You can get quite hooked
on this when you start

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.480 align:middle line:90%
realizing what's going on.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And one of the critical
things that you find

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.750 align:middle line:84%
is that our constitutions are
not written for the people.

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:39.460 align:middle line:84%
They're written for
the corporations.

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And the South
African constitution

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.080 align:middle line:84%
is a really great
example, because it's

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:47.520 align:middle line:84%
a relatively new
constitution, written in 1996

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.330 align:middle line:84%
after our first sort
of free elections

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:54.530 align:middle line:84%
after Nelson Mandela's release
and that whole deception, once

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:58.520 align:middle line:84%
again, that was created where
the old one regime was replaced

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:00.010 align:middle line:90%
by another regime.

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And very few people realize that
when Nelson Mandela actually

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:06.810 align:middle line:84%
came into power, that's when
the country was completely

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:09.440 align:middle line:84%
lock, stock, and barrel,
sold to the Rothschilds.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.070 align:middle line:84%
But that's not a popular
thing to say, all right?

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:15.945 align:middle line:84%
So this is a very
important realization.

00:13:15.945 --> 00:13:18.020 align:middle line:84%
Our constitution is
a beautiful example

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:21.110 align:middle line:84%
of how they use
words to deceive us.

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:25.100 align:middle line:84%
For example, South
Africa as a country

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:27.860 align:middle line:84%
is a land mass at the
southern tip of Africa.

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:31.560 align:middle line:84%
That's where people live in
South Africa, on the land.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.370 align:middle line:84%
The Republic of South
Africa has got nothing

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:37.120 align:middle line:84%
to do with the land
of South Africa.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:41.060 align:middle line:84%
It is a corporation called The
Republic of South Africa that

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:45.260 align:middle line:84%
has imposed itself on the
people of South Africa,

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:46.880 align:middle line:90%
and just taken control.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:50.690 align:middle line:84%
So when we read,
it's the constitution

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:53.320 align:middle line:90%
of the Republic of South Africa.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.390 align:middle line:90%
It tells us.

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:57.690 align:middle line:84%
It is not the constitution
of a land and its people.

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:00.390 align:middle line:84%
It's the constitution
of a corporation called

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:02.155 align:middle line:90%
the Republic of South Africa.

00:14:02.155 --> 00:14:03.530 align:middle line:84%
I've just showed
you the evidence

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:04.905 align:middle line:84%
that the Republic
of South Africa

00:14:04.905 --> 00:14:07.110 align:middle line:90%
is registered as a corporation.

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:10.180 align:middle line:84%
So here it is the constitution
of the corporation.

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And then in the preamble,
the first paragraph,

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:18.690 align:middle line:84%
they tell us once again, using
words, deception and words.

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:22.200 align:middle line:84%
They say, they first hook us
in with the emotional preamble,

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.000 align:middle line:90%
yeah, yeah.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.669 align:middle line:84%
You know, the blood and all
the suffering, and so forth.

00:14:26.669 --> 00:14:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And that hooks people
in emotionally.

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And then they unleash
the lies upon us.

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:33.610 align:middle line:10%
So "we, the people
of South Africa,

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:36.770 align:middle line:10%
recognize the
injustice of our past.

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:39.990 align:middle line:10%
We honor those who suffered
for justice and freedom

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:42.660 align:middle line:10%
in our land; respect
those who have worked

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:45.100 align:middle line:10%
to build and develop
bought country;

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:49.960 align:middle line:10%
and believe that South Africa
belongs to all who live in it."

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:53.380 align:middle line:84%
We believe, we think that
the country, the land

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:55.180 align:middle line:90%
belongs to those who live in it.

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:58.720 align:middle line:84%
We don't know that it
does, because it doesn't.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:14:59.520 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:01.900 align:middle line:90%
Therein lies the deception.

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:02.700 align:middle line:90%
It's unbelievable.

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:04.800 align:middle line:84%
In the first three
or four lines,

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.910 align:middle line:90%
they actually tell us the lie.

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:08.470 align:middle line:90%
They expose the lie to us.

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:10.000 align:middle line:90%
And then they carry on.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.330 align:middle line:84%
Then they keep mixing the
two words, South Africa

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:15.300 align:middle line:84%
and the Republic
of South Africa.

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And people read it thinking
that it's the same thing,

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:19.740 align:middle line:90%
but it's not the same thing.

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And this applies to every
country of the world.

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:25.420 align:middle line:84%
It's the land and
the corporation

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:28.900 align:middle line:84%
that's imposed itself on
the land and its people.

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:33.280 align:middle line:84%
So in 2013, based on this, the
Ubuntu party and myself-- well,

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:38.730 align:middle line:84%
me-- issued an official
document to the president

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:41.440 align:middle line:84%
of South Africa,
and we delivered it

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:45.460 align:middle line:84%
as a lawful document
through the state attorney.

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And we demanded a
response in 21 days.

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, obviously, we
didn't get a response.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.980 align:middle line:84%
But at least we've
set a precedent here,

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:54.890 align:middle line:84%
and we've launched
something into reality.

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And we asked a number of
questions based on the fact

00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:00.620 align:middle line:84%
that this corporation called
The Republic of South Africa

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:01.730 align:middle line:90%
is in existence.

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:04.496 align:middle line:10%
So the questions
were, who authorized

00:16:04.496 --> 00:16:05.870 align:middle line:10%
that the Republic
of South Africa

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:08.650 align:middle line:10%
was to be registered
as such and why?

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:12.840 align:middle line:90%
I think it's a fair question.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.660 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:16.780 align:middle line:10%
Who is the CEO of
this corporation?

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:20.080 align:middle line:10%
Because corporations have
CEOs and presidents, right?

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.720 align:middle line:10%
Who is the accounting officer,
and what financial statements

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.000 align:middle line:10%
does this accounting
officer produce?

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.800 align:middle line:10%
What are the assets
of this corporation?

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.420 align:middle line:10%
Well, you already know
what the assets are.

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:31.930 align:middle line:10%
Are these assets traded
by this corporation?

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:34.010 align:middle line:10%
If so, how and where
are they traded?

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:37.030 align:middle line:10%
And who is accountable
for trading these assets?

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:39.980 align:middle line:84%
Who all the shareholders of the
corporation, and how are they

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:41.100 align:middle line:90%
appointed?

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.340 align:middle line:84%
What is the relationship
of the people

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:45.630 align:middle line:84%
of South Africa to
this corporation

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:47.790 align:middle line:84%
called The Republic
of South Africa?

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:50.260 align:middle line:84%
Is there any agreement
between the people

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.230 align:middle line:84%
and/or citizens of South
Africa and the Republic

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:54.070 align:middle line:90%
of South Africa?

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And if so, where are
those agreements,

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.580 align:middle line:90%
and when were they entered into?

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:00.950 align:middle line:84%
Do the people of South
Africa have any obligation

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:02.590 align:middle line:90%
to this corporation?

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:04.329 align:middle line:84%
And if so, do they
have the right

00:17:04.329 --> 00:17:06.869 align:middle line:90%
to renounce such obligation?

00:17:06.869 --> 00:17:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And herein, we start to
raise the understanding

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:12.650 align:middle line:84%
and the concept of our
sovereignty, of the fact

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:15.270 align:middle line:84%
that we are sovereign
beings living on this land,

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:18.020 align:middle line:84%
and this corporation has
imposed its rights on us.

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And that we have
a right to say, I

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:22.650 align:middle line:84%
don't want to have anything to
do with this corporation called

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:24.109 align:middle line:90%
the Republic of South Africa.

00:17:24.109 --> 00:17:26.180 align:middle line:84%
I never subscribed to
it, and therefore, you

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:29.420 align:middle line:84%
don't have any rights or
can't impose your laws on me.

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:32.760 align:middle line:84%
If you don't work for
McDonald's, McDonald's has

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.630 align:middle line:84%
no right to impose their
laws on you, right?

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:37.900 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't work
or choose to work

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:40.120 align:middle line:84%
for the corporation called
the Republic of South

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:43.080 align:middle line:84%
Africa or any other
United States corporation,

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:44.880 align:middle line:84%
they can't impose
their laws on you.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
sovereign movement

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:50.830 align:middle line:84%
in the world that started
to make a lot of noise.

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:55.045 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately, I think we're
barking against the wind here,

00:17:55.045 --> 00:17:58.313 align:middle line:84%
or it's something that
takes a lot of effort

00:17:58.313 --> 00:18:01.130 align:middle line:84%
and an energy to try
and impose that will.

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:03.060 align:middle line:84%
There's a much easier
way out of this,

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:04.870 align:middle line:90%
just creating a new alternative.

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:06.500 align:middle line:90%
Don't oppose the system.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.940 align:middle line:84%
This is opposing the system,
trying to push it back and get

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:11.049 align:middle line:90%
your own back against it.

00:18:11.049 --> 00:18:12.090 align:middle line:90%
We don't need to do that.

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:14.330 align:middle line:84%
We're just going to
bypass it elegantly

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:15.460 align:middle line:90%
with very little effort.

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see how
we're going to do that.

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:20.460 align:middle line:90%
And then the questions continue.

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And the next point
was, since our bill

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:26.190 align:middle line:84%
of rights and our constitution,
as well as the United Nations

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:28.660 align:middle line:84%
Declaration of Human
Rights strictly forbids

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:31.880 align:middle line:84%
any form of slavery
or forced servitude,

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.450 align:middle line:84%
what rights do the people
who live in the land referred

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:37.300 align:middle line:84%
to as South Africa
have to cut all

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:39.820 align:middle line:84%
their ties and
any responsibility

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:43.520 align:middle line:84%
to this corporation that they
did not know even existed?

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:48.710 align:middle line:84%
And this is really critical
information about our ability

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:51.730 align:middle line:84%
to become sovereign
beings and break away

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:55.050 align:middle line:84%
from this enslavement posed
on us by a corporation

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:57.360 align:middle line:90%
that we didn't subscribe to.

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.870 align:middle line:84%
We didn't sign an agreement
with any of these corporations,

00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:01.730 align:middle line:84%
no matter what
country you live in.

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, what
is the relationship

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:07.310 align:middle line:84%
between this corporation called
the Republic of South Africa

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:10.440 align:middle line:84%
and the government of the
Republic of South Africa?

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:12.980 align:middle line:84%
As you saw on those
registration of corporations,

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:16.720 align:middle line:84%
the government is a
separate corporation.

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.020 align:middle line:90%
So it's incredible.

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:22.500 align:middle line:84%
It's just this whole huge global
hierarchical corporate Ponzi

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:27.950 align:middle line:84%
scheme that is being created
to benefit the banking

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:31.340 align:middle line:84%
cartels and the banking
empire that controls

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:32.980 align:middle line:90%
all these corporations.

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:36.380 align:middle line:84%
So now you start to get an
idea of how and why this

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:39.206 align:middle line:90%
was brought into existence.

00:19:39.206 --> 00:19:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
we start seeing

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:42.970 align:middle line:84%
the connection between
what Thomas Jefferson had

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:46.990 align:middle line:84%
to say about the private banks
versus the people's banks

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:47.969 align:middle line:90%
or the state banks.

00:19:47.969 --> 00:19:49.010 align:middle line:90%
So what's the difference?

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And some of the references
already earlier as well

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:54.870 align:middle line:84%
as to what Germany
was doing, that they

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:57.110 align:middle line:90%
were creating their own wealth.

00:19:57.110 --> 00:20:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And the attack on
the United States

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:03.860 align:middle line:84%
when they didn't want to
capitulate on the private bank,

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:07.220 align:middle line:84%
and they would become a
nation rich and independent.

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:10.330 align:middle line:84%
So you realize that that's
exactly-- that's the fear.

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:14.770 align:middle line:84%
If a country decides to shut
down the central private bank,

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:16.790 align:middle line:90%
it becomes prosperous.

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:18.920 align:middle line:84%
They actually tell us
in those news reports

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.660 align:middle line:84%
that the country will become
prosperous beyond belief.

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:24.030 align:middle line:84%
And all the smart
people in the world

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:26.420 align:middle line:84%
will all go to this country,
because it'll be prosperous.

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:29.580 align:middle line:84%
It won't be under the control
of the private central banks.

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:31.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what this is all about.

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:37.960 align:middle line:84%
So what we did with the South
African elections in 2014

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:42.260 align:middle line:84%
was we are promoting the
whole concept of shutting down

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:46.005 align:middle line:84%
the South African Reserve
Bank, prosecuting the directors

00:20:46.005 --> 00:20:49.070 align:middle line:84%
and their shareholders for
crimes against the people,

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:52.530 align:middle line:84%
and replacing them with a
people's bank that issues money

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:56.520 align:middle line:84%
for the people, by
the people, tax-free,

00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:00.350 align:middle line:84%
interest-free, free of any
levees or duties or anything

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:04.140 align:middle line:84%
like that, with no inflation,
where money is created

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:08.380 align:middle line:84%
by the people, for the people,
by government of the people,

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:11.540 align:middle line:84%
and that money is used and
made available to everyone

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:16.120 align:middle line:84%
and anyone that is involved
in any kind of development,

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:21.600 align:middle line:84%
community projects, or
building up of the country.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.490 align:middle line:90%
And that's as simple as it is.

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's what that
money should do.

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:27.290 align:middle line:90%
It is not the final solution.

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:29.090 align:middle line:90%
Is not the final destination.

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:32.570 align:middle line:84%
But it's the first
release of the pressure

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:35.780 align:middle line:84%
and the release of the
misery of millions of people,

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:38.700 align:middle line:84%
that suddenly, you can
move from the city--

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:40.550 align:middle line:84%
and we spoke about
this earlier, right?

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:42.840 align:middle line:84%
Remember, I said
that the solution

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.990 align:middle line:84%
that the Ubuntu movement
and Contributionism presents

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:48.500 align:middle line:84%
is so simple that
with immediate effect,

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:52.520 align:middle line:84%
people can leave the cities
and get away from the slavery

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.260 align:middle line:84%
that they find
themselves, being trapped

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:57.650 align:middle line:84%
in these metropolitan areas,
having no way to escape.

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:00.210 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't go to a
small town or a small village

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:02.550 align:middle line:84%
expecting to get a job
there, because there

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:04.720 align:middle line:90%
are no jobs for people there.

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:07.550 align:middle line:84%
But the moment we
have a people's bank,

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:09.240 align:middle line:90%
everything changes.

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.240 align:middle line:84%
No matter what little
town or village

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:14.660 align:middle line:84%
you choose to go to, if you
want to start an arts and crafts

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:18.510 align:middle line:84%
studio, the funds will be
provided by the people's bank.

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:21.090 align:middle line:84%
If you want to start a
horse breeding thing,

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:23.850 align:middle line:84%
the funds will be provided
by the people's bank.

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:26.460 align:middle line:84%
If you want to start an
engineering company that

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:28.010 align:middle line:84%
builds bridges
for the community,

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:31.300 align:middle line:84%
the money will be provided
by the people's bank.

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:35.760 align:middle line:84%
The people's bank is there to
provide the means for people

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.420 align:middle line:90%
to create abundance.

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:41.030 align:middle line:84%
Because the moment you
provide the public works

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:43.410 align:middle line:84%
and the community
projects, that brings

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:46.460 align:middle line:84%
the expertise of the
people, and then the people

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:50.420 align:middle line:84%
share from the profits
of those activities

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:52.491 align:middle line:90%
that they participate in.

00:22:52.491 --> 00:22:54.240 align:middle line:84%
The people's bank is
not going to give you

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:57.370 align:middle line:84%
a loan for $1 million so
you can go buy a Ferrari.

00:22:57.370 --> 00:22:59.420 align:middle line:84%
It's not what the
people's bank does.

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:04.670 align:middle line:84%
It's there to provide the
means to create abundance

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:07.830 align:middle line:84%
for the communities, from which
the people in those communities

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:08.680 align:middle line:90%
then benefit.

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:11.820 align:middle line:84%
So the people's implementation
of a people's bank

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:15.400 align:middle line:84%
is an immediate solution
for the problem we have.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And the Rothschilds
have no access.

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:20.680 align:middle line:84%
They cannot control it
unless they wage a war,

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.100 align:middle line:90%
which they have in the past.

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.440 align:middle line:90%
But those days are over now.

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And once the people know
that we're going this,

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:29.300 align:middle line:84%
then they're going to prevent
them from waging a war.

00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:31.920 align:middle line:84%
Remember, they've used
the army, the police,

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:36.140 align:middle line:84%
the security forces to enforce
their laws upon the people.

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:39.150 align:middle line:84%
So the security forces
are imposing the laws,

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:40.950 align:middle line:84%
believing this is the
laws of the country,

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:43.600 align:middle line:84%
not realizing it's the laws
of a corporation controlled

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.390 align:middle line:90%
by the banking families.

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:49.110 align:middle line:84%
So once this information
is shared with everybody,

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:53.149 align:middle line:84%
and the police and the people in
the military are aware of this,

00:23:53.149 --> 00:23:55.440 align:middle line:84%
they're not going to shoot
at their mothers and fathers

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:57.230 align:middle line:84%
and brothers and
sisters because they're

00:23:57.230 --> 00:24:00.860 align:middle line:84%
creating community projects,
and the bankers don't like that.

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:04.240 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to
stand there and do harm

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:07.740 align:middle line:84%
to their relatives and
their friends and neighbors.

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:10.210 align:middle line:84%
But they first need
to be aware of this.

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And right now, very few
of them are aware of it.

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.310 align:middle line:84%
This is part of the
process of information,

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:17.350 align:middle line:84%
sharing knowledge,
and getting everybody

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:20.660 align:middle line:84%
on the same page and level
of enlightenment and unity

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:21.960 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:25.320 align:middle line:84%
So this is why the people's
bank is such a critical step

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:26.120 align:middle line:90%
forward.

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:28.790 align:middle line:84%
As I said, it's not
the final destination,

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:32.090 align:middle line:84%
but it is the first
necessary step.

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And this brings us to
the education system.

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:40.340 align:middle line:84%
Because we are all
equally poisoned

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:45.940 align:middle line:84%
and manipulated and brainwashed
by 12 years of schooling.

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:49.220 align:middle line:84%
When we take children away
for the most important 12

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:52.630 align:middle line:84%
years of their life-- or most
of us do 12 years of school,

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:57.890 align:middle line:84%
some of us do less-- and we
destroy our children's minds.

00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:01.130 align:middle line:84%
We destroy their capacity
to think for themselves.

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And we create-- turn our
children into ourselves.

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:09.010 align:middle line:84%
So we've got to recognize
that the education system is

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:12.550 align:middle line:84%
the breeding ground
for people like us

00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:15.296 align:middle line:84%
who are ignorant of what's
really been going on,

00:25:15.296 --> 00:25:16.420 align:middle line:90%
and we've got to stop that.

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:18.660 align:middle line:84%
We've got to change the
entire education system.

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:22.662 align:middle line:84%
So let's first have a look at
what the education system is.

00:25:22.662 --> 00:25:27.840 align:middle line:84%
It is a spectacular tool of
manipulation, beyond what we

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.540 align:middle line:90%
could have ever comprehended.

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:33.190 align:middle line:84%
It's first of all developed and
funded by the banking families.

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:36.010 align:middle line:84%
The current education
system is not

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:38.100 align:middle line:84%
a system that teaches
us skills for life.

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:39.730 align:middle line:84%
It's got nothing
to do with that.

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:43.150 align:middle line:84%
It was crafted and manipulated
by the banking families

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:45.170 align:middle line:90%
over the last 200 years.

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:49.540 align:middle line:84%
It is now in its apex,
in its highest form.

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:51.540 align:middle line:84%
They really got us
where they wanted us.

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:53.950 align:middle line:84%
They control the
content of the textbooks

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:56.050 align:middle line:90%
and the transfer of information.

00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:58.700 align:middle line:90%
They plan the curriculum.

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:01.400 align:middle line:84%
If you, as a teacher, don't
teach what's in the textbook,

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:02.882 align:middle line:90%
you get fired.

00:26:02.882 --> 00:26:03.840 align:middle line:90%
It's as simple as that.

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:05.980 align:middle line:84%
You can't just come and teach
what you think is important

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:07.710 align:middle line:84%
or what would you want
to teach in class.

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:09.370 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no, no, no.

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:11.010 align:middle line:90%
That's bad, bad teacher.

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:11.997 align:middle line:90%
Can't do that.

00:26:11.997 --> 00:26:13.830 align:middle line:84%
You've got to teach
what's in the textbooks,

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:15.490 align:middle line:90%
even though you know it's wrong.

00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:17.130 align:middle line:84%
Or you may know or
think it's wrong.

00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:18.930 align:middle line:90%
You've got to teach that.

00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:21.122 align:middle line:84%
What kind of education
is that, right?

00:26:21.122 --> 00:26:22.580 align:middle line:84%
What kind of
education is that when

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:25.540 align:middle line:84%
you sit in a classroom,
regurgitating

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:27.630 align:middle line:84%
junk from a textbook,
and you actually don't

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:30.280 align:middle line:90%
know how to do any of that?

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.110 align:middle line:90%
That's not really education.

00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:34.800 align:middle line:84%
That's not learning or teaching
our children skills for life,

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:35.600 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:40.250 align:middle line:84%
So it's got nothing to do with
learning skills for life that

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:43.370 align:middle line:84%
turn our children into
critical contributors

00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:46.050 align:middle line:84%
towards their communities
with real skills.

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:49.820 align:middle line:84%
Knowing how to bake bread or
build bridges or whatever.

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:51.020 align:middle line:90%
None of that.

00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:53.830 align:middle line:84%
We know how to regurgitate
stuff from textbooks.

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:58.250 align:middle line:84%
We expose our children into
stressful situations of exams

00:26:58.250 --> 00:26:59.450 align:middle line:90%
from the earliest of age.

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:02.670 align:middle line:90%
Exams, passing or failing.

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:03.660 align:middle line:90%
Passing or failing.

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:04.970 align:middle line:90%
How could you fail?

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:05.770 align:middle line:90%
You're alive.

00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:07.394 align:middle line:84%
You're a living,
breathing human being.

00:27:07.394 --> 00:27:08.870 align:middle line:90%
You've already succeeded.

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:10.800 align:middle line:90%
How could you fail at anything?

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:11.600 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:16.000 align:middle line:84%
So we get given these ideas of
failing through the education

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.260 align:middle line:90%
system if you don't pass a test

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And they force us
to learn things

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:23.620 align:middle line:84%
that are completely
inconsequential,

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:25.820 align:middle line:84%
have absolutely no
benefit to us as living,

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:27.080 align:middle line:90%
breathing human beings.

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we spend
so many years of our lives.

00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:32.100 align:middle line:84%
Our schools are
indoctrination camps

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.910 align:middle line:84%
to brainwash our children,
to follow orders,

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:36.820 align:middle line:90%
and two bow to authority.

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:39.090 align:middle line:84%
Just look at these
photographs of these schools.

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:42.740 align:middle line:84%
Does that look like a really
good learning environment?

00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:44.992 align:middle line:90%
They look like prisons.

00:27:44.992 --> 00:27:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's what most
schools have become.

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:50.140 align:middle line:84%
Prisons for our children,
prisons for our minds.

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:54.620 align:middle line:10%
Here's a great example
comparing schools to prisons.

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:56.740 align:middle line:10%
It's just brilliant.

00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:58.110 align:middle line:10%
So what happens?

00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:02.070 align:middle line:84%
What does our education
system produce?

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:05.840 align:middle line:84%
It produces young people
with certificates.

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:08.720 align:middle line:90%
Wow, isn't that impressive?

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:12.180 align:middle line:84%
A certificate means that there's
a component of ownership,

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:15.030 align:middle line:84%
because somebody owns you
or has some claim to you

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:17.060 align:middle line:84%
or your knowledge
or your abilities,

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:18.910 align:middle line:90%
or what you can and cannot do.

00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:21.780 align:middle line:84%
People looking for jobs
with those certificates.

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:22.670 align:middle line:90%
Jobs do what?

00:28:22.670 --> 00:28:24.540 align:middle line:90%
Jobs pay money.

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:27.890 align:middle line:10%
So the corporations own us
through our certificates

00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:29.990 align:middle line:10%
willing to work for money.

00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:34.550 align:middle line:84%
It's just a training ground to
create a future labor force.

00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:37.990 align:middle line:84%
That's all it is, to keep
the money thing alive.

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:41.830 align:middle line:84%
Today, our students come out
of school, and especially

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:43.450 align:middle line:90%
out of university.

00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:44.990 align:middle line:84%
Most of the students,
first of all,

00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:46.651 align:middle line:90%
are not going to get a job.

00:28:46.651 --> 00:28:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, they're
going to spend

00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:49.700 align:middle line:84%
the rest of their
lives paying off

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:54.200 align:middle line:84%
those debts that their parents
took out for them to go and get

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:57.060 align:middle line:90%
this education.

00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:00.574 align:middle line:84%
And this is how they've
enslaved our young minds

00:29:00.574 --> 00:29:01.740 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of their lives.

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:04.010 align:middle line:84%
It's spectacular how
they've structured

00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:05.640 align:middle line:90%
this enslavement system.

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:09.020 align:middle line:84%
So the other critical thing
about the education system,

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:10.940 align:middle line:84%
it's a perfect tool
of manipulation,

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:12.130 align:middle line:90%
as we said already.

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:14.260 align:middle line:84%
Destroys our ability
to think for ourselves

00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:17.880 align:middle line:84%
because of the total
brainwashing indoctrination.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:21.520 align:middle line:84%
But critically, it's a brilliant
place to hide knowledge.

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:22.970 align:middle line:90%
Now how can I say this?

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:27.800 align:middle line:84%
It's because if you as a teacher
or a professor or a lecturer

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.720 align:middle line:84%
at a university
make a discovery,

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:32.280 align:middle line:84%
or in your research groups,
you discover something,

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:34.750 align:middle line:84%
you cannot release that
knowledge and information.

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:37.030 align:middle line:84%
That belongs to the school
or to the university.

00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:39.980 align:middle line:90%
It is not your discovery.

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:43.116 align:middle line:84%
And they will throw you
in jail if you do that.

00:29:43.116 --> 00:29:44.740 align:middle line:84%
And they will take
back that knowledge.

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:47.290 align:middle line:84%
They'll recall it,
and they will hide it.

00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:49.240 align:middle line:90%
So all great discoveries.

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:52.570 align:middle line:84%
Just very recently, I
found a music professor

00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:54.930 align:middle line:84%
at Skidmore University
or Skidmore College

00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:57.910 align:middle line:84%
here in the USA that
found a cure for cancer

00:29:57.910 --> 00:29:59.250 align:middle line:90%
with sound frequencies.

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:02.200 align:middle line:84%
He did a TED Talk
on this in 2011.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.890 align:middle line:84%
He showed how--
on video, he shows

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:07.800 align:middle line:84%
how the sound frequencies
between 100,000

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:12.440 align:middle line:84%
hertz and 300,000 hertz destroy
cancer cells, blows them up

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:14.120 align:middle line:90%
inside your body.

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:15.230 align:middle line:90%
Nothing has happened.

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:16.890 align:middle line:84%
That information
has been hidden.

00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:18.100 align:middle line:90%
It's gone.

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:20.960 align:middle line:84%
You'd expect by now that the
pharmaceutical companies would

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:25.420 align:middle line:84%
be giving us cures for
cancer, and nothing.

00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:28.860 align:middle line:84%
So he thought at that stage that
his discovery would be heralded

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:32.950 align:middle line:84%
and he'd be praised for
what he's discovered.

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:37.090 align:middle line:84%
As quickly as he shared that,
it was shut down and removed

00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:38.460 align:middle line:90%
from the knowledge pool.

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And this is what happens
with universities

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:42.160 align:middle line:90%
and these places of education.

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:45.100 align:middle line:84%
They become the
bastions of dogma,

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:47.280 align:middle line:84%
not sharing knowledge
and information.

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:50.670 align:middle line:84%
So the main objective
of our education system

00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:54.330 align:middle line:84%
is to create a future
obedient labor force.

00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And now we understand
what Pink Floyd

00:30:57.390 --> 00:31:00.130 align:middle line:84%
were trying to tell
us all those years ago

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:02.760 align:middle line:84%
when they said "we don't
need your education,

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:06.900 align:middle line:84%
we don't need your
mind control."

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And even before they told
us this from their 1972,

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:14.620 align:middle line:84%
I think, album, "Dark
Side of the Moon,"

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:17.000 align:middle line:84%
they already told
us about money.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:17.830 align:middle line:90%
It's a crime.

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:19.530 align:middle line:90%
One of their big hits.

00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:22.580 align:middle line:84%
What I find fascinating is that
those kids, those guys of Pink

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:24.230 align:middle line:84%
Floyd, they were
25 years old when

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:25.730 align:middle line:84%
they wrote all that
stuff, when they

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:28.790 align:middle line:90%
released their historic album.

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:31.730 align:middle line:84%
25 years old when they're
writing those songs.

00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:35.160 align:middle line:84%
That kind of information, that
must be channeled information.

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:38.350 align:middle line:84%
You can't just come up
with that at that age,

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:42.800 align:middle line:84%
and be so profound in
sharing that information.

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:47.640 align:middle line:84%
And once again, Hollywood
tells us what we must do.

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:49.790 align:middle line:84%
We've got to change
the education system.

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:54.330 align:middle line:84%
We've got to stop this
destruction of our young minds.

00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:58.178 align:middle line:10%
"You must unlearn what you
have learned," says Yoda.

00:31:58.178 --> 00:31:59.174 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGH]

00:31:59.174 --> 00:32:00.170 align:middle line:90%


00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:02.710 align:middle line:84%
Boy, does this become
relevant, doesn't it,

00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:04.990 align:middle line:84%
when you start putting
it into context?

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:09.350 align:middle line:84%
So the whole Ubuntu philosophy
is making people realize this.

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:13.220 align:middle line:84%
It's not just-- we can't
pussyfoot around the subject.

00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:14.680 align:middle line:90%
We have to shut it down.

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:17.840 align:middle line:84%
My appeal to anyone, if
you live in a country

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:21.190 align:middle line:84%
that you can still take
your children out of school,

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:22.800 align:middle line:90%
home school your children.

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:27.180 align:middle line:84%
Use home schooling as
the excuse if you can.

00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:30.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm even suggesting that we
take it further than that.

00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:32.030 align:middle line:84%
Home school your
children in your own way,

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:35.857 align:middle line:84%
not in the prescribed
agenda that they give you

00:32:35.857 --> 00:32:36.690 align:middle line:90%
with home schooling.

00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:39.390 align:middle line:84%
But use the home schooling
as a way, a loophole

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:41.310 align:middle line:84%
to pull your children
out of school

00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:43.740 align:middle line:84%
so they don't go into
those concentration camps

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:45.300 align:middle line:90%
and destroy their minds.

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:48.510 align:middle line:90%
So it is all about unschooling.

00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:49.890 align:middle line:90%
Complete unschooling.

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:53.370 align:middle line:84%
You'll find when you
don't expose children

00:32:53.370 --> 00:32:55.730 align:middle line:84%
to any form of that
kind of education

00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:59.570 align:middle line:84%
that we've been exposed to,
they grew up very differently.

00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:01.980 align:middle line:90%
They think very differently.

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:04.340 align:middle line:90%
They reason very differently.

00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And they become very
different adults

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.640 align:middle line:84%
that are far more
balanced and integrated

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:14.320 align:middle line:90%
into a more balanced society.

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:19.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we need to do,
is create a future generation

00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:23.640 align:middle line:84%
of well-balanced people that
come out of our children today.

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:25.870 align:middle line:84%
So take your children
out of school.

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:27.660 align:middle line:90%
Unschool them.

00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:30.030 align:middle line:84%
Schools are for fish,
not for children.

00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:32.706 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:32.706 --> 00:33:33.465 align:middle line:90%


00:33:33.465 --> 00:33:34.265 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that great?

00:33:34.265 --> 00:33:35.490 align:middle line:90%
It's so obvious.

00:33:35.490 --> 00:33:38.480 align:middle line:90%


00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And that brings us to
the needs of the people.

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:44.170 align:middle line:90%
What do people need?

00:33:44.170 --> 00:33:47.500 align:middle line:84%
The one thing that we
don't need is money.

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:51.209 align:middle line:84%
Because we are told all
our lives that money makes

00:33:51.209 --> 00:33:52.750 align:middle line:84%
the world go round,
or without money,

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:53.833 align:middle line:90%
there'd be nothing, right?

00:33:53.833 --> 00:33:55.950 align:middle line:84%
It's the whole
capitalist argument.

00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:58.580 align:middle line:84%
Competition, money
drives the world.

00:33:58.580 --> 00:33:59.890 align:middle line:90%
Money makes the world go round.

00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:01.400 align:middle line:90%
And we grow up into the system.

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:04.180 align:middle line:84%
We believe it because
it's repeated so often.

00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And remember that this is also
enforced by the music industry.

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:11.690 align:middle line:84%
If you think about how the
music industry has been hijacked

00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:13.830 align:middle line:84%
by the elite, and
they're shoving down

00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:17.992 align:middle line:84%
children's throats, it's all
about money and bling and sex,

00:34:17.992 --> 00:34:21.520 align:middle line:84%
and just this complete
disgusting opulence,

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:22.889 align:middle line:90%
and just money.

00:34:22.889 --> 00:34:25.440 align:middle line:90%
And it's just unbelievable.

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:28.489 align:middle line:84%
So all of us are told that
money makes the world go round.

00:34:28.489 --> 00:34:31.760 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the world,
it's going around very well

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.107 align:middle line:90%
on its own, right?

00:34:33.107 --> 00:34:34.540 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:36.770 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't need money
to make it go around.

00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:39.315 align:middle line:90%
So it's a very simple argument.

00:34:39.315 --> 00:34:40.920 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:44.368 align:middle line:84%
To show anybody the picture
of the planet and say, look.

00:34:44.368 --> 00:34:45.909 align:middle line:84%
There's no money to
be seen anywhere.

00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:47.284 align:middle line:84%
It's going around
just perfectly.

00:34:47.284 --> 00:34:49.659 align:middle line:84%
It's been going around
for billions of years.

00:34:49.659 --> 00:34:52.030 align:middle line:84%
We don't need money
to make it go around.

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:55.480 align:middle line:90%
Stop promoting those lies.

00:34:55.480 --> 00:35:01.780 align:middle line:84%
So remember that money does
nothing, people do everything.

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:05.760 align:middle line:84%
We grow the food, we plant the
seeds, we build the bridges

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:07.630 align:middle line:90%
and develop the technology.

00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:09.550 align:middle line:90%
We are capable of infinite love.

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:13.300 align:middle line:84%
We can create the most
beautiful works of art.

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:14.930 align:middle line:90%
Money does nothing.

00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:19.240 align:middle line:84%
Money just gets in the way
of what we try to create.

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:21.640 align:middle line:90%
It constantly trips us up.

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:24.270 align:middle line:84%
It prevents us from
realizing our dreams.

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:26.970 align:middle line:84%
It prevents us from
achieving our goals

00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:29.800 align:middle line:90%
and living lives of abundance.

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.590 align:middle line:84%
Money does not make
the world go round.

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:32.590 align:middle line:90%
People do.

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:34.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the Ubuntu
movement is all about.

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:36.520 align:middle line:90%
It's about the people.

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:39.630 align:middle line:84%
Many of the other movements
that are doing amazing work

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:42.710 align:middle line:84%
are sometimes more
focused on the technology

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:44.430 align:middle line:90%
or other kinds of solutions.

00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:47.210 align:middle line:84%
The whole Ubuntu philosophy
is about people first,

00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:49.410 align:middle line:90%
because people do everything.

00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And this is why
we can't prescribe

00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:56.030 align:middle line:84%
how communities should live,
or what they should be doing,

00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:58.220 align:middle line:84%
or what technology
they should be using,

00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:00.970 align:middle line:84%
because the communities
will decide themselves

00:36:00.970 --> 00:36:02.900 align:middle line:84%
what technology they
want, because they'll

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:05.190 align:middle line:84%
have the absolute
freedom to develop

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:07.030 align:middle line:90%
the highest form of technology.

00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:09.677 align:middle line:84%
And they can choose how
they use their technology,

00:36:09.677 --> 00:36:11.260 align:middle line:84%
but they can only
do that when they've

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:14.199 align:middle line:84%
taken control of
their own community,

00:36:14.199 --> 00:36:16.490 align:middle line:84%
and when they're not controlled
by a central government

00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:18.850 align:middle line:84%
or some municipality
that's marching

00:36:18.850 --> 00:36:21.110 align:middle line:84%
to the beat of the
drum of the bankers.

00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And this is how we
take it back, and start

00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:26.600 align:middle line:84%
taking our communities
away from the control.

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:29.220 align:middle line:90%
So remember, money does nothing.

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:30.840 align:middle line:90%
People do everything.

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:34.390 align:middle line:84%
The Ubuntu Contributionism
system is all about the people,

00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:36.080 align:middle line:90%
putting people first.

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:37.810 align:middle line:90%
Everything comes after that.

00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:41.070 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to share with you a
wonderful story that really

00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:43.170 align:middle line:84%
shows how insane
the idea of money

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:47.280 align:middle line:84%
is, in this Babylonian
magic money slavery system,

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:52.220 align:middle line:84%
how one $100 bill or a $1
bill could actually pay off

00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:56.330 align:middle line:84%
the entire debt of the world
if we could make it go around

00:36:56.330 --> 00:36:59.510 align:middle line:84%
at infinite sort of
lightning speed, right?

00:36:59.510 --> 00:37:01.940 align:middle line:84%
It's about the
traveling salesman.

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:04.966 align:middle line:84%
A traveling salesman
arrives in a little town.

00:37:04.966 --> 00:37:07.070 align:middle line:90%
He pulls up at the hotel.

00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:09.710 align:middle line:84%
He walks up to the hotel
manager and says, hi.

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:11.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm here for the weekend
to a little conference,

00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:14.190 align:middle line:84%
and I'd love to just
check out your rooms.

00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:16.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm very particular about
the rooms in hotels,

00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:19.830 align:middle line:84%
so do you mind if I go
upstairs and look at your room?

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And the hotel
manager says, sure.

00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:22.390 align:middle line:90%
Here's the key.

00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:24.070 align:middle line:84%
But please just
leave a deposit here.

00:37:24.070 --> 00:37:25.400 align:middle line:90%
And it's $100.

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:27.580 align:middle line:84%
Just leave a $100
bill here and go.

00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:28.380 align:middle line:90%
Here's the key.

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:30.200 align:middle line:90%
Take as much time as you want.

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.640 align:middle line:84%
So the traveling
salesman does upstairs,

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:34.332 align:middle line:90%
disappears into the room.

00:37:34.332 --> 00:37:36.540 align:middle line:84%
When the hotel manager
suddenly looks across the road

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:39.170 align:middle line:84%
and sees the butcher, and it
reminds him, oh, the butcher.

00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:43.180 align:middle line:84%
$100 for the feast we had here
last week, the event we had.

00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:45.340 align:middle line:84%
So he goes across the
road and says, hey, John.

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:47.450 align:middle line:84%
I owe you the $100
bucks for the meat

00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:49.680 align:middle line:84%
that you sent us for
the event last week.

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:50.480 align:middle line:90%
Thanks very much.

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:52.280 align:middle line:84%
The butcher says,
oh, thanks so much.

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:53.970 align:middle line:84%
He takes the $100
bill and he puts it

00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:57.240 align:middle line:84%
in the till, at which
point the plumber walks in.

00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And the butcher says,
hey, how's it going, Bill?

00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:02.370 align:middle line:84%
Oh, by the way, here's
the $100 I owe you

00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:05.530 align:middle line:84%
for fixing the plumbing in
my freezer last weekend.

00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:06.330 align:middle line:90%
Thanks very much.

00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:08.496 align:middle line:84%
You really saved me, because
there would have really

00:38:08.496 --> 00:38:11.110 align:middle line:84%
been a big mess if you didn't
come and fix that plumbing.

00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:13.026 align:middle line:84%
And the plumber says,
oh, thank you very much.

00:38:13.026 --> 00:38:14.510 align:middle line:90%
He puts the $100 in his pocket.

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:16.330 align:middle line:84%
He gets his meat
and he drives off.

00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:17.580 align:middle line:90%
And he drives past the garage.

00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:20.060 align:middle line:84%
He pulls in to fill
up with petrol.

00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:23.350 align:middle line:84%
When he sees the garage owner,
the garage owner says, hey,

00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:24.320 align:middle line:90%
how's it going?

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:26.180 align:middle line:84%
By the way, have you
got that $100 bucks

00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:28.311 align:middle line:84%
for fixing your
fender last week?

00:38:28.311 --> 00:38:29.560 align:middle line:90%
And the guy says, yeah, sorry.

00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:30.393 align:middle line:90%
I forgot about that.

00:38:30.393 --> 00:38:32.670 align:middle line:84%
He pulls out $100, gives
it to the garage owner.

00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:35.030 align:middle line:84%
The garage owner says,
thanks very much.

00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:37.220 align:middle line:84%
He gets in his car,
drives down to the bottle

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:39.230 align:middle line:84%
store to get some
booze for the weekend

00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:41.420 align:middle line:84%
when he sees Sally,
the prostitute,

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:42.660 align:middle line:90%
walking down the street.

00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:43.660 align:middle line:90%
And he says, hey, Sally.

00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:44.280 align:middle line:90%
How's it going?

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:45.250 align:middle line:90%
And Sally says, great.

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:48.200 align:middle line:90%
How are you doing James?

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And James says, so
what are you doing?

00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:53.592 align:middle line:84%
She says, oh, just going down
to get some stuff, you know?

00:38:53.592 --> 00:38:55.800 align:middle line:84%
And she says, by the way,
have you got the $100 bucks

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:56.841 align:middle line:90%
you owe me for last week?

00:38:56.841 --> 00:38:58.594 align:middle line:84%
And he says, oh,
I'm sorry, I forgot.

00:38:58.594 --> 00:38:59.760 align:middle line:90%
He pulls out the $100 bucks.

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:00.930 align:middle line:90%
He gives it to Sally.

00:39:00.930 --> 00:39:02.490 align:middle line:90%
Sally says, thanks very much.

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:03.370 align:middle line:90%
He drives off.

00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:06.170 align:middle line:84%
Sally keeps walking
down the sidewalk when

00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:08.910 align:middle line:84%
she walks past the hotel,
when she suddenly remembers

00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:11.420 align:middle line:84%
that the owes the hotel $100
bucks for arranging the room

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:12.700 align:middle line:90%
last week.

00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:15.427 align:middle line:84%
She walks into the hotel and
says to the hotel manager, oh,

00:39:15.427 --> 00:39:17.760 align:middle line:84%
thanks very much for letting
me have the room last week.

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:18.676 align:middle line:90%
Here's the $100 bucks.

00:39:18.676 --> 00:39:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And puts it down on the desk
in front of the hotel manager,

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:22.980 align:middle line:90%
and she leaves.

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:25.390 align:middle line:84%
At which point, the
traveling salesman

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:27.970 align:middle line:84%
comes down from
upstairs and says,

00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:30.320 align:middle line:84%
thanks very much for letting
me look at your room.

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:31.480 align:middle line:90%
It's not really my style.

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:32.280 align:middle line:90%
Here's your key.

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:34.465 align:middle line:90%
Can I have my $100 back?

00:39:34.465 --> 00:39:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And the hotel
manager looks down.

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:36.640 align:middle line:90%
He says, oh.

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:38.020 align:middle line:90%
There's your $100.

00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:40.160 align:middle line:84%
He gives it back to
the traveling salesman,

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:42.270 align:middle line:90%
who takes it and disappears.

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:44.160 align:middle line:90%
What has just happened?

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:45.780 align:middle line:90%
Magic, right?

00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:49.850 align:middle line:84%
Babylonian magic
money slavery system.

00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:52.660 align:middle line:84%
$100 bill went around,
paid everybody in town.

00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:56.050 align:middle line:84%
We could carry that story
on forever, you realize.

00:39:56.050 --> 00:39:58.605 align:middle line:84%
Everybody uses the same $100
bill to pay everybody else,

00:39:58.605 --> 00:39:59.980 align:middle line:84%
and it comes back
to the guy that

00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:03.100 align:middle line:84%
issued it in the first
place, who gets it back.

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:05.090 align:middle line:90%
Everybody feels happy.

00:40:05.090 --> 00:40:08.950 align:middle line:84%
And nothing has
actually happened.

00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:12.770 align:middle line:84%
It's just amazing how
this thing has just

00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:16.450 align:middle line:84%
imbued itself into our
psyche and what we do,

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:18.860 align:middle line:90%
day in and day out.

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:22.890 align:middle line:10%
And for me, even the most
spectacular realization

00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:28.150 align:middle line:10%
is that every day, seven and
a half billion people wake up

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:30.110 align:middle line:10%
and we do something.

00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:34.850 align:middle line:10%
We build, we transport, we
carry, we create, we invent,

00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:38.350 align:middle line:10%
we grow things, we dream,
we paint, we sculpt,

00:40:38.350 --> 00:40:41.240 align:middle line:10%
we sing, we spin,
we cook, we dance,

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:44.710 align:middle line:10%
we do an infinite number
of things every day.

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:46.970 align:middle line:90%
Seven and a half billion people.

00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And yet at the end of that day,
most of us cannot afford what

00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:56.890 align:middle line:84%
it is that we created,
or we built, or we grew,

00:40:56.890 --> 00:40:59.870 align:middle line:90%
or we painted, or we cooked.

00:40:59.870 --> 00:41:03.000 align:middle line:84%
We can't get it, because
we don't have enough money

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.760 align:middle line:90%
to get it.

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:06.930 align:middle line:90%
That is insanity.

00:41:06.930 --> 00:41:11.510 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that any
country can be in debt

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:14.910 align:middle line:84%
to any bank or
any outside entity

00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:18.210 align:middle line:84%
is an insanity when
we are the people that

00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:20.750 align:middle line:84%
make up those
countries and we create

00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:23.530 align:middle line:90%
an infinite amount every day.

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:27.450 align:middle line:84%
The stuff and the abundance that
we create even as it is today

00:41:27.450 --> 00:41:31.600 align:middle line:84%
is staggering, and yet
we can't get to it.

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:34.720 align:middle line:84%
Think about the
millions and millions

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:40.280 align:middle line:84%
of shops and stores filled with
shelves with stock and stuff

00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:41.980 align:middle line:90%
that's sitting there.

00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Sitting there where it could be
spread and given to the people,

00:41:46.830 --> 00:41:47.960 align:middle line:90%
shared with the people.

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:49.250 align:middle line:90%
People made it.

00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:52.180 align:middle line:84%
People made all the stuff
that is in these shops,

00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:53.210 align:middle line:90%
and yet we can't get it.

00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:56.150 align:middle line:84%
It's sitting on the shelves,
waiting for somebody to buy,

00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:57.820 align:middle line:90%
but you first need the money.

00:41:57.820 --> 00:41:59.390 align:middle line:90%
This is the insanity.

00:41:59.390 --> 00:42:01.650 align:middle line:84%
So seven and a half
billion people every day

00:42:01.650 --> 00:42:06.170 align:middle line:84%
create this abundance for
corporations, for governments,

00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:09.000 align:middle line:90%
for municipalities.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.940 align:middle line:84%
We are not doing
it for ourselves.

00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And in a nutshell,
that's exactly what

00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:18.130 align:middle line:84%
we propose with the Ubuntu
movement as a solution

00:42:18.130 --> 00:42:20.770 align:middle line:90%
and a path to prosperity.

00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:23.150 align:middle line:84%
So let's stop doing it
for the governments.

00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:25.490 align:middle line:84%
Let's stop doing it
for the municipalities.

00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:28.330 align:middle line:84%
Let's stop doing what we
do for any other authority.

00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:30.860 align:middle line:84%
Let's start doing
it for ourselves.

00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:32.520 align:middle line:84%
But we can only do
this for ourselves

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:34.790 align:middle line:84%
if we have united
communities that we

00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:37.110 align:middle line:90%
agree to do this for ourselves.

00:42:37.110 --> 00:42:40.660 align:middle line:84%
We can't do this in large,
sprawling metropolitan cities

00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:43.420 align:middle line:84%
where people live divided
and in fear of each other,

00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:46.340 align:middle line:84%
instead of living united,
respecting and supporting

00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:47.230 align:middle line:90%
each other.

00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:49.610 align:middle line:84%
That can happen in
small communities.

00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:52.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is why the Ubuntu
philosophy and plan of action

00:42:52.690 --> 00:42:56.320 align:middle line:84%
really starts in the small
towns and small communities

00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:59.540 align:middle line:84%
where you can get people
to unite and start working

00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:01.910 align:middle line:84%
together in cooperation
and collaboration

00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:03.540 align:middle line:90%
rather than in competition.

00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And start this very simple
180-degree turnaround

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:11.360 align:middle line:84%
in the philosophy, to create
abundance by working together.

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:15.150 align:middle line:84%
One of the things people say
is that it's not money itself.

00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:18.080 align:middle line:84%
It's the love of money that
causes all the problem.

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:20.650 align:middle line:90%
Well, that is not true.

00:43:20.650 --> 00:43:24.000 align:middle line:84%
It's the pure presence of money
that causes all the problems.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.890 align:middle line:84%
It's the presence of money
that creates the love for money

00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:30.440 align:middle line:84%
and the addiction to money
and the use of money.

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:33.100 align:middle line:84%
Without the money, there'd
be no love for money,

00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:34.760 align:middle line:90%
and we don't need money.

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:38.210 align:middle line:84%
So that's like the
argument, often people say,

00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:40.420 align:middle line:90%
oh, money is not so bad.

00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:43.500 align:middle line:84%
Money is just energy, and it's
just a form of energy exchange.

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:44.300 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:45.510 align:middle line:90%
It's another lie.

00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:46.940 align:middle line:90%
Money has no energy.

00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:50.190 align:middle line:84%
It's a synthetically
created tool of enslavement.

00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:52.870 align:middle line:84%
Its primary
function, its primary

00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:54.860 align:middle line:84%
and its only reason
for existence

00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:56.500 align:middle line:90%
is to enslave humanity.

00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:58.620 align:middle line:90%
Do not make any excuses for it.

00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:01.080 align:middle line:84%
By saying that money is
just a form of energy,

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:02.610 align:middle line:90%
we are making excuses for it.

00:44:02.610 --> 00:44:04.027 align:middle line:90%
We give it energy.

00:44:04.027 --> 00:44:06.360 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we go into a store
and we say, how much do you

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:07.950 align:middle line:90%
charge for that?

00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:08.750 align:middle line:90%
Charge.

00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:09.720 align:middle line:90%
You charge money.

00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:10.680 align:middle line:90%
You charge something.

00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:11.790 align:middle line:90%
We give it energy.

00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:14.160 align:middle line:84%
We even use it in
the language we use,

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:15.660 align:middle line:90%
and we don't even know this.

00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:17.870 align:middle line:84%
We don't recognize
what we're doing.

00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:19.500 align:middle line:90%
Money has no value.

00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:21.400 align:middle line:90%
It has no place in our lives.

00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:24.740 align:middle line:84%
It needs to be removed
from our reality.

00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:27.770 align:middle line:84%
It's the only way we
can change the system

00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:30.510 align:middle line:90%
and escape its effect.

00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:32.420 align:middle line:90%
So it's not the love of money.

00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:37.040 align:middle line:84%
It's the presence of money
that causes all the problems.

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:38.470 align:middle line:90%
So what do we do?

00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:39.980 align:middle line:90%
There's only one solution.

00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:41.800 align:middle line:90%
Only one thing we can do.

00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And by now, you all
know what we need to do.

00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:49.310 align:middle line:90%
Remove the money.

00:44:49.310 --> 00:44:51.170 align:middle line:90%
It's very simple.

00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:54.220 align:middle line:90%
It's a very simple concept.

00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:58.030 align:middle line:84%
But the moment you say to
people, remove the money,

00:44:58.030 --> 00:45:00.280 align:middle line:84%
you can sometimes
actually see, they almost

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:03.810 align:middle line:90%
go into a little convulsion.

00:45:03.810 --> 00:45:05.900 align:middle line:90%
And the fear sets in, right?

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:07.200 align:middle line:90%
And I've seen this now.

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:09.870 align:middle line:84%
Like I mentioned earlier,
since that first time

00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:14.830 align:middle line:84%
that I went in 2005, and I gave
my first presentation to 12

00:45:14.830 --> 00:45:19.510 align:middle line:84%
people at a private dinner
party in Johannesburg

00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:23.320 align:middle line:84%
to a bunch of macho people
filled with pride and ego,

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:25.610 align:middle line:84%
suggesting that we can
remove money from the system,

00:45:25.610 --> 00:45:27.430 align:middle line:90%
and I nearly got beaten up.

00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:30.020 align:middle line:84%
You see, their eyes
start rolling back.

00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:32.160 align:middle line:84%
It's like they go
into a seizure.

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And they have no idea how you
can even make such a statement.

00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:40.520 align:middle line:84%
And this is when the
13 most frequently

00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:43.560 align:middle line:90%
asked questions pop up, right?

00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And by reading these questions,
I'm reading your mind.

00:45:47.710 --> 00:45:50.300 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that you're
thinking what you're reading.

00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:53.260 align:middle line:90%


00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we're going
to discuss in the next episode.

00:45:57.110 --> 00:45:58.960 align:middle line:84%
We've come to the
end of this one.

00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And what I can tell you
about these questions,

00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:04.864 align:middle line:84%
right now you may be
thinking, wow, OK.

00:46:04.864 --> 00:46:06.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, how are we
going to do this?

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:07.270 align:middle line:90%
How are we going to do that?

00:46:07.270 --> 00:46:09.300 align:middle line:84%
Right now, you may struggle
with some of these.

00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:11.840 align:middle line:84%
By the time we finish here
in the next few hours,

00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:14.390 align:middle line:84%
you will not only be able to
answer all these questions.

00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:17.330 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we're going to
laugh about how ridiculous

00:46:17.330 --> 00:46:19.860 align:middle line:84%
these questions are, because
they're actually completely

00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:21.672 align:middle line:84%
irrelevant in a
world without money,

00:46:21.672 --> 00:46:23.130 align:middle line:84%
because they come
from a completely

00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:24.960 align:middle line:90%
different kind of head space.

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be able
to answer any other question

00:46:27.850 --> 00:46:30.460 align:middle line:84%
or problem that anyone
can throw at it.

00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:33.060 align:middle line:84%
We're going to end this
workshop by coming up

00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:35.840 align:middle line:84%
with potential problems
and seeing how quickly we

00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:37.360 align:middle line:90%
can each answer those problems.

00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to be
amazed how easy it is

00:46:41.090 --> 00:46:43.327 align:middle line:84%
and how quickly we
solve every problem.

00:46:43.327 --> 00:46:45.160 align:middle line:84%
And remember, we dealt
with the idea earlier

00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:48.930 align:middle line:84%
that we're told all our lives
that it's not easy, you know?

00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:50.970 align:middle line:90%
It's tough to solve problems.

00:46:50.970 --> 00:46:52.750 align:middle line:90%
The solutions aren't simple.

00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:53.550 align:middle line:90%
Those are lies.

00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:55.470 align:middle line:84%
The solutions are
extremely simple.

00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:57.580 align:middle line:84%
But you first have to
remove the problem,

00:46:57.580 --> 00:46:58.590 align:middle line:90%
the root of the problem.

00:46:58.590 --> 00:47:00.131 align:middle line:84%
And the root of the
problem is money.

00:47:00.131 --> 00:47:04.300 align:middle line:84%
The moment you remove money,
the solutions become so simple,

00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:09.110 align:middle line:84%
anyone can solve the problems
instantly and immediately.

00:47:09.110 --> 00:47:11.800 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we're going
to find at the end of this--

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:13.690 align:middle line:90%
by the end of this workshop.

00:47:13.690 --> 00:47:17.990 align:middle line:84%
So we've got a few minutes
to go through a few questions

00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:19.060 align:middle line:90%
or suggestions.

00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:19.860 align:middle line:90%
Marna.

00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:20.735 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you, Michael.

00:47:20.735 --> 00:47:24.360 align:middle line:84%
My question is about, so
my town, Shelburne, you say

00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:27.400 align:middle line:84%
is in a corporation,
it's a corporation.

00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:33.010 align:middle line:84%
I, as a homeowner, am I subject
to that corporation then?

00:47:33.010 --> 00:47:34.660 align:middle line:90%
>>Absolutely.

00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:38.175 align:middle line:84%
The corporations
own all the land.

00:47:38.175 --> 00:47:42.220 align:middle line:84%
You get a title deed for your
land when you buy your house,

00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:45.930 align:middle line:84%
and that title deed is
actually another deception.

00:47:45.930 --> 00:47:50.680 align:middle line:90%
You're entitled to the land.

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:53.520 align:middle line:90%
You never actually own the land.

00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:56.412 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's called a
title deed, an entitlement.

00:47:56.412 --> 00:47:58.620 align:middle line:84%
You're entitled to it, but
you never actually get it.

00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:03.560 align:middle line:84%
It remains-- it constantly
belongs to the royalty, those

00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:05.090 align:middle line:90%
that own the land.

00:48:05.090 --> 00:48:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And at this stage,
there are many people

00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:09.870 align:middle line:84%
that have written about
this, done a lot of research

00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:10.670 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to still be
in the hand-- in the hands

00:48:12.930 --> 00:48:15.360 align:middle line:84%
and the position of all
the royal bloodlines, all

00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:17.900 align:middle line:84%
the land in the world that
they've laid claim to.

00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:22.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's an entitlement thing
that we never actually receive.

00:48:22.270 --> 00:48:25.895 align:middle line:84%
This is why it's critical
for us to recognize

00:48:25.895 --> 00:48:29.340 align:middle line:84%
the direction we're
taking, this alternative--

00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:34.880 align:middle line:84%
this route removes all that
from the obligation that we're

00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:37.350 align:middle line:84%
under right now, and
brings the power back

00:48:37.350 --> 00:48:39.040 align:middle line:84%
to the people of
their communities

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:42.070 align:middle line:84%
and the self-governance
of the communities.

00:48:42.070 --> 00:48:44.976 align:middle line:84%
But there's a process that we
need to follow to get there.

00:48:44.976 --> 00:48:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's not a
difficult process.

00:48:46.350 --> 00:48:47.797 align:middle line:84%
It can happen very
quickly, and it

00:48:47.797 --> 00:48:49.630 align:middle line:84%
looks like it's going
to happen very quickly

00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:52.020 align:middle line:90%
over the next few years.

00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:53.232 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you.

00:48:53.232 --> 00:48:57.040 align:middle line:84%
>>Could you comment on the
BRICS movement and the Asian

00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:59.320 align:middle line:90%
Infrastructure Investment Bank?

00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:02.650 align:middle line:84%
>>Thanks for asking the question
about BRICS, because arguably,

00:49:02.650 --> 00:49:04.980 align:middle line:84%
it's a very powerful
part of the world.

00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:09.970 align:middle line:84%
You've got Brazil, Russia,
India, China, South Africa.

00:49:09.970 --> 00:49:12.600 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the largest
number of people in the world

00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:14.280 align:middle line:84%
actually live in
those countries.

00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:16.420 align:middle line:84%
So potentially, it
could be an alternative.

00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:19.620 align:middle line:84%
But what I find interesting is
that Russia is part of that.

00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And Russia is a very
interesting part

00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:24.120 align:middle line:84%
of the world where
Vladimir Putin owns

00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:27.050 align:middle line:84%
Russia Today, a major TV
network that really flies

00:49:27.050 --> 00:49:29.470 align:middle line:84%
in the face of everything we
see on the other mainstream

00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:32.700 align:middle line:84%
television networks
like CNN, BBC.

00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:36.250 align:middle line:84%
It always opposes
the views directly.

00:49:36.250 --> 00:49:38.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's very difficult
to actually figure out

00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:41.410 align:middle line:84%
what's really going on
financially and economically

00:49:41.410 --> 00:49:42.680 align:middle line:90%
in Russia today.

00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:46.680 align:middle line:84%
But Russian economy is
booming, and Russians

00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:47.789 align:middle line:90%
love their president.

00:49:47.789 --> 00:49:49.330 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's very
difficult to find

00:49:49.330 --> 00:49:53.230 align:middle line:84%
a Russian that doesn't like
what's going on their country.

00:49:53.230 --> 00:49:54.370 align:middle line:90%
They love what's going on.

00:49:54.370 --> 00:49:55.953 align:middle line:84%
They love their
president, and they're

00:49:55.953 --> 00:49:57.220 align:middle line:90%
very proud of what's going on.

00:49:57.220 --> 00:49:58.761 align:middle line:84%
So there's something
very interesting

00:49:58.761 --> 00:50:01.066 align:middle line:90%
brewing in Russia today.

00:50:01.066 --> 00:50:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that
they're part of BRICS

00:50:02.690 --> 00:50:04.023 align:middle line:90%
makes me wonder what's going on.

00:50:04.023 --> 00:50:07.250 align:middle line:84%
However, I still believe
it's a deception.

00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:08.750 align:middle line:84%
There's just more
smoke and mirrors.

00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:10.260 align:middle line:90%
And we've already covered this.

00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:11.420 align:middle line:90%
We don't need money.

00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:12.430 align:middle line:90%
We need people.

00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:13.240 align:middle line:90%
Money does nothing.

00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:15.350 align:middle line:90%
People do everything.

00:50:15.350 --> 00:50:18.680 align:middle line:84%
So we just need to realize
that anyone that comes up

00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:22.280 align:middle line:84%
with solutions of new money
supply or a new banking system

00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:25.730 align:middle line:84%
is just another deception,
and a delay preventing us

00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:28.790 align:middle line:84%
from reaching our final
destination where we live

00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:31.990 align:middle line:84%
in a world without money and
create a paradise for ourselves

00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:34.194 align:middle line:84%
without money, because we're
doing it for ourselves.

00:50:34.194 --> 00:50:35.860 align:middle line:84%
We don't need the
money to do it for us.

00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:38.419 align:middle line:90%


00:50:38.419 --> 00:50:40.710 align:middle line:84%
>>Just to kind of coattail
what you were talking about,

00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:43.270 align:middle line:84%
the powers that be, when
we lived in Arizona just

00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:45.780 align:middle line:84%
a couple years
back, the state just

00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:48.190 align:middle line:84%
decided that they owned
all the water in the state.

00:50:48.190 --> 00:50:49.330 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, yeah.

00:50:49.330 --> 00:50:50.792 align:middle line:84%
>>If you have a
piece of property,

00:50:50.792 --> 00:50:52.500 align:middle line:84%
you have to get a
permit to drill a well.

00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:54.290 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you drill
the well, they come in,

00:50:54.290 --> 00:50:55.330 align:middle line:84%
put a meter on it,
and you're going

00:50:55.330 --> 00:50:57.330 align:middle line:84%
to pay the state for the
water that you pump out

00:50:57.330 --> 00:50:59.170 align:middle line:84%
of the ground on
your own property.

00:50:59.170 --> 00:50:59.970 align:middle line:90%
>>That's amazing.

00:50:59.970 --> 00:51:06.880 align:middle line:84%
>>I mean, so the question really
is, taking one step back, why?

00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:08.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, does a guy
wake up-- I mean,

00:51:08.590 --> 00:51:11.180 align:middle line:84%
Hitler thought he was doing the
world a favor when he woke up.

00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:13.554 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all the bad guys think
they're doing good things.

00:51:13.554 --> 00:51:16.468 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, they
wouldn't do them.

00:51:16.468 --> 00:51:20.070 align:middle line:84%
Gee, I just made 30 million
people's lives miserable today,

00:51:20.070 --> 00:51:21.720 align:middle line:90%
and we killed another 100,000.

00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:22.520 align:middle line:90%
How about that?

00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:23.395 align:middle line:90%
That was a great day.

00:51:23.395 --> 00:51:24.800 align:middle line:90%
It's like, whoa.

00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:25.601 align:middle line:90%
Wait a minute.

00:51:25.601 --> 00:51:27.350 align:middle line:84%
Where are these guys
getting their vigors?

00:51:27.350 --> 00:51:29.900 align:middle line:84%
Nobody does anything unless
there's a payoff for them

00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:31.740 align:middle line:90%
somewhere.

00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:34.700 align:middle line:84%
What's the payoff for
making the world miserable?

00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:37.440 align:middle line:84%
Because power, having somebody
under your thumb, what do you

00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:38.240 align:middle line:90%
do with that?

00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:41.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if they've already
got control the world, OK.

00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:43.150 align:middle line:90%
So what?

00:51:43.150 --> 00:51:46.480 align:middle line:84%
Where's the payoff
for them in that?

00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:48.640 align:middle line:84%
>>That's a very
important question.

00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:51.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think unfortunately,
the answer that question

00:51:51.350 --> 00:51:53.225 align:middle line:90%
gets quite dark and sinister.

00:51:53.225 --> 00:51:55.020 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:55.020 --> 00:51:55.820 align:middle line:90%


00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think we've done enough
dark and sinister stuff here

00:51:58.560 --> 00:51:59.360 align:middle line:90%
already.

00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:02.190 align:middle line:84%
I think we should deal
with the solutions.

00:52:02.190 --> 00:52:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the solutions
we're dealing with

00:52:04.510 --> 00:52:07.640 align:middle line:84%
will also resolve all that
darkness and cynicism.

00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:09.900 align:middle line:84%
But I think just
to really answer

00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:14.020 align:middle line:84%
that briefly, I think
the global elite clearly

00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:17.450 align:middle line:84%
seem to be under a high
authority, some sort of higher

00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:19.360 align:middle line:90%
control.

00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, when
you start looking at that,

00:52:22.170 --> 00:52:24.060 align:middle line:84%
you have to come to
terms with the fact

00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:27.460 align:middle line:84%
that that higher control
may not be of this Earth,

00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:31.550 align:middle line:84%
and that there's stuff going on
that is way beyond this planet,

00:52:31.550 --> 00:52:33.890 align:middle line:84%
and stuff going on
that many people

00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:37.460 align:middle line:84%
are very uncomfortable with,
and is not of this Earth.

00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:39.540 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it doesn't
make any sense.

00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And really, you start
to wonder, as you said,

00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:42.840 align:middle line:90%
why are they doing that?

00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:45.750 align:middle line:84%
To control the planet as a
playground for themselves?

00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:46.550 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:52:46.550 --> 00:52:48.110 align:middle line:90%
And then what?

00:52:48.110 --> 00:52:51.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very important
question to deal with,

00:52:51.270 --> 00:52:53.420 align:middle line:84%
but I think let's
leave it at that.

00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:54.920 align:middle line:84%
Let's rather focus
on the solutions.

00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:57.660 align:middle line:84%
Because I know when we
get to the solution,

00:52:57.660 --> 00:53:00.970 align:middle line:84%
you'll see how those solutions
will deal with that question

00:53:00.970 --> 00:53:01.880 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:05.420 align:middle line:84%
Because what that does, what our
solutions, our new alternative,

00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:09.710 align:middle line:84%
our new direction
and our new reality

00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:12.420 align:middle line:84%
provides the opportunity
and a breeding

00:53:12.420 --> 00:53:17.550 align:middle line:84%
ground for new innovations,
new inventions, new technology,

00:53:17.550 --> 00:53:21.110 align:middle line:84%
a new united world of
conscious individuals

00:53:21.110 --> 00:53:25.100 align:middle line:84%
that work together in harmony,
that exist together in harmony,

00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:27.080 align:middle line:90%
in higher consciousness.

00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And that brings
with it technology

00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:34.380 align:middle line:84%
that also becomes-- as
terrible as it sounds--

00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:36.210 align:middle line:90%
becomes a defense mechanism.

00:53:36.210 --> 00:53:40.860 align:middle line:84%
The technology that we have
available to us by freeing up

00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:44.100 align:middle line:84%
our inventors becomes
our defense mechanism

00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:47.350 align:middle line:84%
at the same time against
anything or anyone

00:53:47.350 --> 00:53:50.960 align:middle line:84%
out there, as draconian
as they think they may be.

00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:53.240 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to thank
you for participating

00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:55.770 align:middle line:84%
in another hour
of this workshop.

00:53:55.770 --> 00:53:57.080 align:middle line:90%
Thanks very much.

00:53:57.080 --> 00:54:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And we'll continue with
answering the 13 frequently

00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:03.640 align:middle line:84%
asked questions in
the next episode.

00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:05.412 align:middle line:84%
Thank you very much
for being here.

00:54:05.412 --> 00:54:07.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm Michael Tellinger,
and thanks for watching.

00:54:07.370 --> 00:54:11.620 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:11.620 --> 00:54:17.685 align:middle line:90%
