00:00:05.324 --> 00:00:13.070 align:middle line:10%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.940 align:middle line:10%
>>Hello.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.540 align:middle line:10%
This is Michael Tellinger,
and we continue our journey

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.760 align:middle line:10%
of discovery,
exploration, in search

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.910 align:middle line:10%
of a whole new social
structure that will liberate us

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.260 align:middle line:10%
from the money
slavery system that's

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.220 align:middle line:10%
been imposed on us for the
last few thousand years.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.090 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
Ubuntu, contributionism,

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.680 align:middle line:84%
a world without money,
a world of abundance,

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.940 align:middle line:84%
a utopian world,
a beautiful world

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.660 align:middle line:90%
for every single one of us.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.350 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
find the solutions

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.700 align:middle line:84%
and the practical steps to
take us from this miserable

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.330 align:middle line:84%
world we find ourselves in, into
this utopian life that we seek.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And they are very
simple, practical steps

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.970 align:middle line:90%
that'll get us there.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.520 align:middle line:84%
This is truly a
liberating experience,

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.180 align:middle line:84%
and I'd like to remind
you to see this as such.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.090 align:middle line:84%
Take what we are reviewing
here, the basic fundamental

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.770 align:middle line:84%
information that gives
us the foundation

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.420 align:middle line:84%
to launch us into this new
world that we all so badly

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.220 align:middle line:90%
and desperately want.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.360 align:middle line:84%
So to remind you what we
covered in the previous episode,

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.150 align:middle line:84%
I want to go back
to Wolfgang Goethe,

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.840 align:middle line:84%
just to remind us how misguided
most of us have become.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.510 align:middle line:84%
When Wolfgang Goethe says
that, "none are more hopelessly

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.210 align:middle line:84%
enslaved than those who
falsely believe they are free."

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.760 align:middle line:84%
Many of us falsely
believe we are free,

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.410 align:middle line:84%
but we are working our way out
of this false belief system.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.090 align:middle line:84%
Our entire lives are controlled
by brands, by corporations,

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.710 align:middle line:90%
by careers, and by jobs.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.120 align:middle line:84%
And just to remind you
again, a job means a slave.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.460 align:middle line:84%
Our entire world is
completely and utterly

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.830 align:middle line:90%
controlled by corporations.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.970 align:middle line:84%
What's fascinating is, you
try and move from one country

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.080 align:middle line:84%
to another, and you realize
how difficult it is.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.870 align:middle line:84%
It's almost impossible
today, especially

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.500 align:middle line:84%
if you don't have enough
money to go from one country

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.420 align:middle line:90%
to another.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.910 align:middle line:84%
But if you have a
company or a corporation

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.460 align:middle line:84%
and you want to take a
corporation across the border,

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.310 align:middle line:90%
they welcome you with open arms.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.196 align:middle line:90%
Oh, absolutely.

00:02:08.196 --> 00:02:08.695 align:middle line:90%
Come.

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:09.810 align:middle line:90%
Come into our country.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.730 align:middle line:90%
Set up headquarters and offices.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.570 align:middle line:90%
Because, what?

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.840 align:middle line:84%
You're going to create
more slaves, because you're

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.140 align:middle line:90%
going to create more jobs.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly what
our governments want.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.510 align:middle line:84%
They want more jobs,
to have more slaves

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.759 align:middle line:84%
that they can control
through the corporate system

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:24.550 align:middle line:84%
and the money driven
system, because that's

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.880 align:middle line:90%
what this is all about.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.050 align:middle line:84%
All of our lives are controlled
by brands and corporations.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.300 align:middle line:84%
Money has infiltrated
every crack and crevice

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.690 align:middle line:90%
of our existence.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.260 align:middle line:84%
From the first breaths we take
to the last breath we breathe

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.820 align:middle line:90%
out is controlled by money.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.760 align:middle line:84%
If you do not yet
know this, you have

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.890 align:middle line:90%
to wake up and realize this.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.570 align:middle line:84%
Because until we've
dealt with this issue,

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.700 align:middle line:84%
we will not be in a position
to liberate ourselves

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.060 align:middle line:84%
from the slavery system and this
matrix, as Morpheus called it.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.780 align:middle line:84%
The money does not make
the world go around.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:03.810 align:middle line:90%
Remember this.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.730 align:middle line:90%
People make the world go around.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.150 align:middle line:10%
This is one of my
favorite images

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.420 align:middle line:10%
from Occupy Wall Street, when
somebody put up eat the bankers

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.640 align:middle line:10%
poster around this dummy.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.700 align:middle line:84%
Because the fat
bankers have played

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.860 align:middle line:84%
the role of supporting
the corporations,

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.290 align:middle line:84%
while they undermine their
friends and families.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.390 align:middle line:84%
But bankers are
also human beings.

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.170 align:middle line:84%
And what I find is
that every one of us,

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.020 align:middle line:84%
whether you're a
banker, whether you

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.830 align:middle line:84%
work in government, whether
you're a corrupt individual,

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.180 align:middle line:84%
all of us are sensitive and
vulnerable to this thing called

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.150 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, and all of us
are rising in consciousness.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.880 align:middle line:84%
And sooner or later, that little
critical moment, that seed

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.100 align:middle line:84%
will sprout inside of
us and inside of you,

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.520 align:middle line:90%
if you still haven't felt this.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, you
wake up and you say,

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.020 align:middle line:90%
I can no longer do this.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And there are thousands of
bankers around the world,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.020 align:middle line:84%
and people in positions
of power and control.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.290 align:middle line:84%
They know they're abusing
other people in their lives

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.040 align:middle line:90%
and around them.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.800 align:middle line:84%
They know they're making
they're children's friends lives

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.970 align:middle line:90%
miserable.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.839 align:middle line:84%
They know that they're possibly
causing death and destruction

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:21.589 align:middle line:84%
to the parents of the
friends of the children

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:23.487 align:middle line:90%
that they go to school with.

00:04:23.487 --> 00:04:25.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is when
they wake up and say,

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.760 align:middle line:84%
I can no longer do this, because
the consciousness has suddenly

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.460 align:middle line:84%
sprouted in their hearts
and in their souls.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.570 align:middle line:84%
And this is what's bringing
such a rapid change around,

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.930 align:middle line:84%
throughout, that's
spreading across this planet

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.280 align:middle line:84%
so quickly that it is
unstoppable and uncontainable.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.360 align:middle line:84%
This something that nobody
will be able to stop,

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.150 align:middle line:84%
is this explosion and
the rise of consciousness

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.180 align:middle line:90%
within the global population.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.710 align:middle line:84%
The global and historic
resistance to money

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.770 align:middle line:90%
goes back thousands of years.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.110 align:middle line:84%
There are some
brilliant examples.

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.570 align:middle line:10%
Julius Caesar is one of them.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.840 align:middle line:10%
48 BC, Julius Caesar already
took back from the money

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.770 align:middle line:10%
changers the power
to coin money.

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.600 align:middle line:10%
And he minted coins
for the benefit of all,

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.130 align:middle line:10%
for the people of Rome.

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.980 align:middle line:10%
And with this new
plentiful money supply,

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.340 align:middle line:10%
he established many massive
construction and public

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.620 align:middle line:10%
projects and made
Rome a powerful place.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.680 align:middle line:84%
He went against the
wishes of the bankers,

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.280 align:middle line:84%
and we all know what happened
to Julius Caesar, right?

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.490 align:middle line:10%
In 1225 St. Thomas
Aquinas exposes us

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:36.070 align:middle line:10%
to an interesting bit of history
regarding the church and money.

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.000 align:middle line:10%
This, I find quite fascinating,
where the charging of interest

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.330 align:middle line:10%
was actually wrong because it
applies to the double charging.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.070 align:middle line:10%
This is what the church
believed in the 1200s.

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.230 align:middle line:10%
It says that charging for both
the money and the use of money

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:51.200 align:middle line:10%
was wrong.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.600 align:middle line:10%
And the church law in
the Middle Ages in Europe

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.620 align:middle line:10%
actually forbade the charging
of interest on loans,

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.270 align:middle line:10%
and even made it a
crime called usury.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is the system that
we find ourselves in today.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.730 align:middle line:90%
And it continues.

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:06.670 align:middle line:90%
The resistance.

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.720 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
famous acts of Jesus,

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.680 align:middle line:84%
whoever this character may have
been, because obviously there's

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.670 align:middle line:84%
a lot of research
that's gone on about who

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:18.785 align:middle line:84%
this individual
called Jesus was.

00:06:18.785 --> 00:06:22.020 align:middle line:84%
Whether it was Jesus
or Jeshua or Issa,

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.840 align:middle line:84%
so many names that he
may have appeared under.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.910 align:middle line:84%
The one historic
event that is quite

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.175 align:middle line:84%
famous in the life of Jesus is
when he threw the bankers out

00:06:31.175 --> 00:06:32.690 align:middle line:90%
of the temple.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.530 align:middle line:84%
So it shows us that,
even someone like Jesus

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.890 align:middle line:84%
is showing us that bankers
were committing crimes

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:40.530 align:middle line:84%
against the people,
and they were

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.660 align:middle line:90%
using the temple as their bank.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.130 align:middle line:84%
This is a very important
bit of information,

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:48.470 align:middle line:84%
because therein lies
encoded a very important

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:49.750 align:middle line:90%
subliminal message.

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.280 align:middle line:84%
Bankers and temples
are synonymous,

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.420 align:middle line:84%
and we'll find out
more about that later.

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:58.490 align:middle line:10%
Here in the United States,
the historical statement

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.760 align:middle line:10%
by Thomas Jefferson
is just spectacular.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.420 align:middle line:10%
"I believe that
banking institutions

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:08.440 align:middle line:10%
are more dangerous to our
liberties than standing armies.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.900 align:middle line:10%
If the American people
ever allow private banks--"

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.760 align:middle line:10%
and the emphasis here
is on private banks, not

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.660 align:middle line:10%
people's banks or banks
owned by governments

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.530 align:middle line:10%
or governments of the people.

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:23.060 align:middle line:10%
So, "if the American people
ever allowed private banks

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:27.720 align:middle line:10%
to control the issue of their
currency, first by inflation

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.840 align:middle line:10%
then by deflation, the banks
and the corporations that

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.160 align:middle line:10%
will grow up around
the banks will

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.650 align:middle line:10%
deprive the people
of all property

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:38.780 align:middle line:10%
until their children wake
up homeless on the continent

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.430 align:middle line:10%
their fathers conquered."

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.680 align:middle line:10%
And this is exactly what
we find ourselves in today,

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.020 align:middle line:10%
in every country of the world.

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:47.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't particularly
like the idea

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:50.940 align:middle line:84%
of a continent being
conquered by our forefathers,

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.020 align:middle line:84%
because that means that we've
deprived traditional people

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:54.910 align:middle line:90%
of their land.

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:56.980 align:middle line:84%
So this is a whole other
issue, but the sentiment

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:58.770 align:middle line:84%
about the banking
institutions is

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:00.520 align:middle line:84%
a very important
and critical one

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.920 align:middle line:84%
for us to take in and
understand how important

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.330 align:middle line:84%
these words by Thomas
Jefferson were,

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:10.070 align:middle line:84%
because this is the situation
that has evolved and developed.

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:13.884 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to say that the War
of Independence in the United

00:08:13.884 --> 00:08:16.300 align:middle line:84%
States, and all the wars that
were fought around that era,

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:20.180 align:middle line:84%
were all about the
control of the money,

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:23.820 align:middle line:84%
and the central banks
of the United States.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:28.140 align:middle line:84%
One of the most important events
in recent United States history

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:31.660 align:middle line:84%
or global history was
the assassination of JFK.

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's very obviously,
once you do your research,

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:36.250 align:middle line:84%
that this is all
perpetrated by the banking

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:39.720 align:middle line:84%
families, the banking elite,
the largest organized crime

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.179 align:middle line:90%
syndicate in the world.

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:45.510 align:middle line:10%
JFK had issued the United
States Notes just months

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:47.560 align:middle line:10%
before he was assassinated.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.710 align:middle line:10%
His biggest problem,
or his biggest mistake,

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:52.550 align:middle line:10%
was he did not make this public.

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:55.560 align:middle line:84%
Just like his famous speech
to the press association

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.820 align:middle line:84%
or the Press Club where he
talks about secret societies

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:03.410 align:middle line:84%
and people dealing in secret
rooms and doing secret things,

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:05.690 align:middle line:84%
he wasn't specific
enough about that.

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And then, he goes and releases
the United States Note.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.360 align:middle line:84%
He took the right away
from the Federal Reserve

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.610 align:middle line:90%
to print this money.

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:14.400 align:middle line:90%
No wonder they took the guy out.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.650 align:middle line:84%
And they blame it
on some guy that

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:21.230 align:middle line:84%
was trained by Russians
and the magic guns,

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:23.190 align:middle line:90%
and it's just crazy.

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:28.810 align:middle line:84%
When you realize how the banking
elite have orchestrated pretty

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:34.260 align:middle line:84%
much all of the historic events,
the turning points in history.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.650 align:middle line:84%
The further back in time
you go, once you know this,

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:38.545 align:middle line:84%
and once it becomes
very clear to you

00:09:38.545 --> 00:09:41.700 align:middle line:84%
that this is how they've run
and manipulated the world.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.420 align:middle line:84%
If they can assassinate
the most visible,

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:49.021 align:middle line:84%
and the questionably, arguably,
the most popular president

00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:51.270 align:middle line:84%
in the history of this planet,
if they can assassinate

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:54.850 align:middle line:84%
him live on television
in front of the world,

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:57.160 align:middle line:84%
these guys will do
everything and anything.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.500 align:middle line:84%
They have murdered,
killed, raped,

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:03.710 align:middle line:84%
tortured thousands of
people to stay in control.

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:06.180 align:middle line:84%
Once we know this, we
know what to do about it.

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:07.190 align:middle line:90%
The game is up.

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:08.820 align:middle line:90%
The cat's out of the bag.

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.170 align:middle line:90%
There are too many people.

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:12.710 align:middle line:84%
This information is spreading
around the world so quickly,

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:14.300 align:middle line:90%
it can no longer be contained.

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we
have to count on.

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:19.230 align:middle line:90%
We are the 99.99%.

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:22.990 align:middle line:84%
The elite that think they run
the world, the game is over.

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:25.670 align:middle line:84%
The behavior, the
draconian behavior

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:29.590 align:middle line:84%
that we see on the news day in,
day out, the fear mongering,

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:33.770 align:middle line:84%
the lies, the terror that's
imposed on humanity all

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:36.660 align:middle line:84%
the time, using the
media as their tool.

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:40.530 align:middle line:84%
This is not the behavior of
an elite who are in control.

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:43.350 align:middle line:84%
This is clearly the
behavior of an elite who

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:45.220 align:middle line:84%
feel trapped and
caged, and they're

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:47.860 align:middle line:84%
doing everything and
anything to get out of this.

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:50.270 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to hang
onto power and control

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:52.940 align:middle line:84%
for dear life, because
they know the game is up.

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:55.710 align:middle line:84%
So, I'd like you to feel
reassured with this.

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:57.710 align:middle line:84%
Don't think that
things are getting bad.

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:00.820 align:middle line:84%
Things are getting better, it's
just currently the behavior.

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:02.100 align:middle line:90%
Stop watching the news.

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:03.790 align:middle line:90%
Stop reading the papers.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:06.680 align:middle line:84%
Once you stop watching
that and the terror tactics

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.720 align:middle line:84%
and the agenda of the
elite through the media,

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.680 align:middle line:84%
you realize how beautiful
and peaceful the world is.

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.420 align:middle line:90%
It's just being manipulated.

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And many of the things
that we see on television

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:20.110 align:middle line:84%
are false flag events, are
orchestrated, are staged,

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:21.600 align:middle line:90%
are not real events.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.940 align:middle line:90%
Watch the movie, "Wag the Dog".

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:26.390 align:middle line:84%
Just like the
information encoded

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:29.200 align:middle line:84%
in the "Matrix" and
the information encoded

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.910 align:middle line:84%
in "The Wizard of
Oz", "Wag the Dog"

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:35.670 align:middle line:84%
was another movie that was given
to us with encoded information,

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:39.440 align:middle line:84%
how the media manipulates
and stages events

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.290 align:middle line:90%
for the benefit of the elite.

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:44.040 align:middle line:84%
This is what's going on in
the world on a daily basis

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:44.630 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:48.000 align:middle line:84%
Do not underestimate how
far these individuals

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.790 align:middle line:84%
and these elite will
go to keep control.

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:52.870 align:middle line:90%
They are cornered.

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:54.210 align:middle line:90%
The game is up.

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:56.270 align:middle line:84%
Many researchers that
have done their work

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:58.390 align:middle line:90%
will tell you the same.

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:01.120 align:middle line:84%
Let's deal with the
origins of money.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:06.630 align:middle line:84%
Most people have no bloody clue
or idea where money comes from.

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And if you ask people
where money comes from,

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:11.710 align:middle line:84%
they'll give you the
same regurgitated stuff

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:13.660 align:middle line:90%
that we get taught in school.

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:16.540 align:middle line:84%
That money is a
consequence of thousands

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:18.760 align:middle line:84%
of years of barter and
trade, and money was first

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:22.120 align:middle line:84%
created when the bankers-- and
they put stuff in the bank,

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.360 align:middle line:84%
and they were issued pieces
of paper, and all this.

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's some bits
of truth attached to that,

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:29.830 align:middle line:90%
but most of it is a lie.

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:32.170 align:middle line:84%
Money is not a
consequence of thousands

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:34.000 align:middle line:90%
of years of barter and trade.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.090 align:middle line:84%
Money was maliciously introduced
as a tool of control thousands

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:39.460 align:middle line:90%
and thousands of years ago.

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:42.560 align:middle line:84%
And there are very specific
situations and conditions

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:46.610 align:middle line:84%
that point us in this direction,
that give us this information.

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:49.620 align:middle line:84%
One of the most important
clues and bits of evidence

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:51.600 align:middle line:84%
we get about the
origins of money

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:55.685 align:middle line:84%
comes to us, as in many cases,
from the Sumerian texts.

00:12:55.685 --> 00:12:58.180 align:middle line:84%
The ancient clay
tablets that give us

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:03.430 align:middle line:84%
the guidelines and the hints
to where money comes from.

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:09.570 align:middle line:84%
The Sumerian Kings Lists carry
phenomenal bits of information.

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:12.830 align:middle line:84%
And this is where--
the Kings List tell us

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:16.970 align:middle line:84%
about a time in history
where kingdom was lowered

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:20.000 align:middle line:84%
to earth from heaven,
and the first kings

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.720 align:middle line:84%
and first priest-kings
were appointed by the gods.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.300 align:middle line:84%
We've already dealt
with who the gods were,

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:29.190 align:middle line:84%
who these beings of such
high power and knowledge

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:31.180 align:middle line:90%
and technology were.

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:34.450 align:middle line:84%
So, these beings appointed
the first priest-kings

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:36.250 align:middle line:84%
and the royal
bloodlines on earth.

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:40.800 align:middle line:84%
They gave these royal bloodlines
serious weapons and knowledge

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.540 align:middle line:84%
and technology,
and the knowledge

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:44.620 align:middle line:84%
of alchemy and
sorcery, with which

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:47.680 align:middle line:84%
they could contain and
manipulate and control

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:48.870 align:middle line:90%
humanity.

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:50.280 align:middle line:90%
And this is what we find.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:53.790 align:middle line:84%
The first priest-kings,
and the small group

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:56.200 align:middle line:84%
of royal-political
elite bloodlines

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.180 align:middle line:90%
that took control of the world.

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:01.310 align:middle line:84%
This is where we see the origins
of the royal bloodlines that

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:02.770 align:middle line:90%
still continues today.

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:04.700 align:middle line:84%
And these Sumerian
tablets actually

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.070 align:middle line:84%
tell us where this
all began, where

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:09.080 align:middle line:90%
the royal bloodlines started.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:12.270 align:middle line:84%
Because if you think
about the Royalty on earth

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:14.800 align:middle line:84%
and where do they
come from, no one's

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.520 align:middle line:90%
really answered that question.

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:19.950 align:middle line:84%
What you do see in
movies is often they

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:21.117 align:middle line:90%
actually tell us, right?

00:14:21.117 --> 00:14:22.950 align:middle line:84%
When you watch these
movies about gladiators

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:25.590 align:middle line:84%
and ancient times and
Alexander the Great

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:28.690 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, they all tell
us, I did not make myself king.

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:29.980 align:middle line:90%
God made me king.

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:31.970 align:middle line:90%
I was appointed as king by god.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And they're telling us
the truth, once again.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.290 align:middle line:84%
The truth is encoded
in these movies.

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:39.020 align:middle line:84%
They were appointed by
the gods to rule over

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:40.430 align:middle line:90%
the rest of humanity.

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:46.060 align:middle line:84%
But this is not God, the creator
of everything in creation.

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.060 align:middle line:84%
These are the gods
we're talking about.

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:51.455 align:middle line:84%
The Elohim or the Anunnaki,
all these malicious beings

00:14:51.455 --> 00:14:53.810 align:middle line:84%
that have imposed
themselves on humanity,

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:56.950 align:middle line:84%
and made themselves
god over humanity.

00:14:56.950 --> 00:15:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And who were these
first priest-kings?

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:03.130 align:middle line:84%
They then took
control of the planet.

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:05.200 align:middle line:84%
They took control
of all the land,

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.410 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly these kings
owned all the land.

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:10.330 align:middle line:84%
The real estate,
the royal estate.

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:11.570 align:middle line:90%
Reale, as in French.

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:13.465 align:middle line:90%
Reale, royal estate.

00:15:13.465 --> 00:15:16.070 align:middle line:90%
Like Montreal, royal mountain.

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:18.070 align:middle line:84%
The real estate
means royal estate

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:20.670 align:middle line:84%
that belongs to the
royal bloodlines.

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:25.230 align:middle line:84%
This spectacular enslavement
through the language

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:27.730 align:middle line:84%
that we've endured
is unimaginable,

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:31.760 align:middle line:84%
how they use language
and words against us.

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:35.380 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the best examples
of the origins of money.

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:37.170 align:middle line:84%
The first forms
of money actually,

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:40.980 align:middle line:84%
once again, come to us
in clay tablet form.

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And this is probably the
oldest bill of exchange

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:47.740 align:middle line:84%
that you'll find, except
the ancient Sumerians

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:50.230 align:middle line:84%
made their bills of
exchange in clay,

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:52.470 align:middle line:84%
which lasts a lot longer
than pieces of paper.

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:55.390 align:middle line:84%
Today, the bankers
make bills of exchange,

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:58.270 align:middle line:84%
and they just print pieces of
paper with fancy logos on it,

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:00.600 align:middle line:90%
and suddenly it's worth so much.

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:04.090 align:middle line:84%
Well in ancient times,
they used clay tablets.

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the oldest
examples of the first forms

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:09.470 align:middle line:90%
of money that I could find.

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:14.331 align:middle line:84%
It's a 4,000 year old bill
of exchange from 2046 BC.

00:16:14.331 --> 00:16:16.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how they
dated it, but that's

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.500 align:middle line:90%
what they tell us, right.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.890 align:middle line:10%
So, just to remind you,
money was maliciously

00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:22.200 align:middle line:10%
introduced as a
tool of enslavement

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:26.370 align:middle line:10%
by these first priest-kings
that were appointed by the gods.

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:28.650 align:middle line:10%
It is not a consequence
of thousands

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:30.760 align:middle line:10%
of years a barter and trade.

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:35.100 align:middle line:84%
One of the first things that
these first priest-kings did,

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:37.396 align:middle line:90%
is they created money.

00:16:37.396 --> 00:16:39.450 align:middle line:90%
They owned all the land.

00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:42.330 align:middle line:84%
They were the first
bankers, and their temples

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.110 align:middle line:90%
were the first banks.

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:48.480 align:middle line:84%
Just like Jesus threw out the
bankers out of the temple,

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.240 align:middle line:84%
the first temples were
actually the first banks

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:54.320 align:middle line:84%
where money was created
out of thin air,

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.950 align:middle line:84%
by these first
priest-kings that started

00:16:56.950 --> 00:17:00.780 align:middle line:84%
this whole thing of money
that was imposed on humanity.

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:04.160 align:middle line:84%
Some people actually call
this origins of money

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.740 align:middle line:84%
as the Babylonian Magic
Money Slavery System.

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly what it is,
because if you look at the way

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:13.119 align:middle line:84%
people respond to
money and what it is,

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:16.240 align:middle line:84%
it's like it's imbued with
some sort of black magic.

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:18.940 align:middle line:84%
It does the strangest
things to people.

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:22.329 align:middle line:84%
Think about the
misery, the sadness,

00:17:22.329 --> 00:17:27.650 align:middle line:84%
the bloodshed that money has
caused over thousands of years.

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:31.150 align:middle line:84%
We cannot even begin
to quantify that.

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:33.920 align:middle line:84%
It is responsible
for all the darkness

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.830 align:middle line:90%
that we endure as human beings.

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:40.580 align:middle line:84%
We are completely at odds
with this concept of money.

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:45.360 align:middle line:84%
It's not part of our human
nature or the human psyche.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.380 align:middle line:90%
It is an inhumane idea.

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:49.240 align:middle line:90%
It's an inhumane thought.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And these Sumerian
texts actually

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.880 align:middle line:84%
suggest that that's
exactly what it is.

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.600 align:middle line:84%
Because the first
priest-kings were appointed

00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:00.630 align:middle line:84%
by the gods and they became
the controllers of humanity,

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:04.570 align:middle line:84%
and they were given the idea
of money to control humanity.

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:08.500 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it is an
inhumane idea, a magic money

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.780 align:middle line:90%
slavery system from Babylon.

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:14.280 align:middle line:84%
So, these same royal
bloodlines there

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:17.385 align:middle line:84%
was appointed by the gods
thousands of years ago,

00:18:17.385 --> 00:18:20.630 align:middle line:84%
are the same royal bloodlines
that run the world today.

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And the banking families
are inextricably connected

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:25.730 align:middle line:90%
to these royal bloodlines.

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:29.300 align:middle line:84%
They have the exclusive right
to create money out of thin air.

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:31.920 align:middle line:84%
They have imposed themselves
on all our governments,

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:36.200 align:middle line:84%
and they control our countries
through the control of money.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we can
say that the banking

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:41.520 align:middle line:84%
families and the banking
system around the world

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:46.030 align:middle line:84%
is the largest organized crime
syndicate we have ever faced.

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:49.630 align:middle line:84%
These are the guys that control
all the other crime syndicates.

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:52.300 align:middle line:84%
They are the guys that
control all the other drug

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:55.900 align:middle line:84%
smuggling cartels, and
the mafia, and everything

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:58.920 align:middle line:84%
that we've ever faced and
that we've seen in movies.

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:02.740 align:middle line:84%
The banking families
is the highest level

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:05.580 align:middle line:84%
of organized crime
syndicate that we've ever

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:07.330 align:middle line:90%
faced on this planet.

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:09.950 align:middle line:10%
It is important to
realize that's all

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:13.390 align:middle line:10%
our central banks, the
Fed, the Bank of England,

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:15.980 align:middle line:10%
the Bank of Scotland, the
Reserve Bank of Australia,

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:17.900 align:middle line:10%
the Reserve Bank
of South Africa,

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:19.730 align:middle line:10%
these are all
private corporations.

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:21.980 align:middle line:10%
They do not belong
to the governments.

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
very important area.

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And I often suggest
to people, when

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:29.910 align:middle line:84%
you discuss this with someone,
when you want to try and start

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:33.010 align:middle line:84%
this debate with somebody,
the money in the banking

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:34.510 align:middle line:84%
is a good place to
start, because it

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:36.400 align:middle line:90%
affects every single one of us.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's something that people
would be open to discuss.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And the one area that people
are not very familiar with,

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:45.220 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that our central
banks are private corporations.

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:48.120 align:middle line:84%
So when you launch
into the discussion,

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:52.930 align:middle line:84%
I suggest, use this to break
through the veneer of defense

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:56.430 align:middle line:84%
that many people have to
get into this discussion.

00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:58.399 align:middle line:84%
And just tell them
about the fact

00:19:58.399 --> 00:20:00.190 align:middle line:84%
that the Fed and the
Bank of England, these

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:01.650 align:middle line:90%
are all private companies.

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:04.080 align:middle line:84%
They do not belong
to the government.

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And even though the people
at first may resist you

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:09.349 align:middle line:84%
and they'd say, well,
I didn't know that.

00:20:09.349 --> 00:20:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find that
often people say this.

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:12.410 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know this.

00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:14.570 align:middle line:84%
Then they go away, and
they do the research.

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:17.381 align:middle line:84%
What happens then is they
come back and say, wow.

00:20:17.381 --> 00:20:19.380 align:middle line:84%
I checked out what you
told me, and it turns out

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:20.500 align:middle line:90%
that you were right.

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:24.390 align:middle line:84%
The moment you've gained
their trust, where they now

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:27.500 align:middle line:84%
believe that the central banks
are private companies owned

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:30.720 align:middle line:84%
by these invisible and
faceless bankers that operate

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:34.400 align:middle line:84%
from Basel, Switzerland
and the city of London,

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.650 align:middle line:84%
suddenly they're open to
receive more information.

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And this is how you
can start this debate,

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:42.600 align:middle line:84%
then get deeper into
the enslavement system

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.840 align:middle line:84%
through money and thousands
of years of control.

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Remember that these private
banking corporations,

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:49.670 align:middle line:90%
they don't have vaults of money.

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:51.810 align:middle line:84%
They have nothing
that supports this.

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:54.840 align:middle line:84%
They make money out of thin
air, and they've simply

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:57.540 align:middle line:84%
retained and reserved
the right for themselves

00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.960 align:middle line:84%
to keep creating
money out of thin air.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I said earlier
is it's not about the money.

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:08.310 align:middle line:84%
They can keep creating as
much money as they want.

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:10.120 align:middle line:90%
They don't ever have to stop.

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.000 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.790 align:middle line:84%
Because they use as the
slaves to repay the money.

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:16.420 align:middle line:84%
So the more money
our governments

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:18.730 align:middle line:84%
borrow from these
private institutions

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:22.780 align:middle line:84%
called central banks, the more
money we have to pay back.

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:24.460 align:middle line:84%
And we are the slaves
that have to work

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.350 align:middle line:90%
to pay back all this money.

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:29.080 align:middle line:84%
So these bankers are very
happy to just dish out

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:32.450 align:middle line:84%
money, and enslave us
more and more and more.

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:36.180 align:middle line:84%
We don't need private banks
to issue money for the people.

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:38.100 align:middle line:84%
Remember what Thomas
Jefferson said,

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:41.410 align:middle line:84%
the private banks and the
issuing of their private money.

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:44.960 align:middle line:84%
We don't need a private company
to print and issue money to us.

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.010 align:middle line:84%
We can issue and
print our own money.

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:47.990 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:49.900 align:middle line:84%
We know how a
printing press works.

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:54.040 align:middle line:84%
We too can take empty pieces,
blank pieces of paper,

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:55.990 align:middle line:84%
and print some fancy
logos on them and say,

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:57.780 align:middle line:84%
this is now worth
a trillion dollars.

00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:01.310 align:middle line:84%
We can do that as well as any
Fed or any Bank of England.

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:03.190 align:middle line:84%
We don't need them
to do that for us,

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:06.130 align:middle line:84%
and this is where the concept
of a people's bank comes in.

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:08.050 align:middle line:10%
And I'll talk more
about a people's bank,

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:11.400 align:middle line:10%
and how a people's bank can
release us from this slavery

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.420 align:middle line:10%
system virtually overnight.

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:15.000 align:middle line:90%
And this has happened before.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.410 align:middle line:84%
This is where independent
countries, and countries

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:19.840 align:middle line:84%
in the past have become
very, very successful.

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:22.970 align:middle line:84%
But the moment they did this,
the moment a people's bank

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:24.910 align:middle line:84%
was actually issuing
money for the people,

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:27.540 align:middle line:84%
by the people, in which
case the money can be tax

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:30.170 align:middle line:84%
free and interest free--
because if we issue and print

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:32.490 align:middle line:84%
our own money, are we
going to charge ourselves

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:33.430 align:middle line:90%
interest and tax?

00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:34.600 align:middle line:90%
Of course not.

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.700 align:middle line:84%
If we're issuing the
money to ourselves,

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:39.600 align:middle line:84%
we make the money available
to ourselves for everything

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:40.494 align:middle line:90%
we need.

00:22:40.494 --> 00:22:42.660 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to enslave
ourselves with the money,

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:44.290 align:middle line:84%
but this is how the
private banks work.

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:46.310 align:middle line:84%
They use it as a
tool of enslavement.

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:49.750 align:middle line:84%
So this is why whenever
a country is outside

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:53.140 align:middle line:84%
of the Rothschild banking
empire, Rothschild,

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:56.512 align:middle line:84%
the Rockefeller, the Morgan,
the Carnegie, the Warburg,

00:22:56.512 --> 00:22:58.470 align:middle line:84%
if you don't know who
the banking families are,

00:22:58.470 --> 00:22:59.810 align:middle line:90%
go look it up.

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:01.730 align:middle line:84%
Well known bunch of
criminals that you

00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:03.290 align:middle line:90%
can look up very quickly.

00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:05.610 align:middle line:84%
And we-- the moment
that a country

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:08.420 align:middle line:84%
operates outside of the
Rothschild banking empire,

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:10.530 align:middle line:84%
they're invaded,
they're infiltrated,

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:15.280 align:middle line:84%
and the government is overthrown
and their own Rothschild

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.220 align:middle line:90%
banking government is imposed.

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:19.240 align:middle line:84%
Until about 20 years
ago, there were a number

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.656 align:middle line:84%
of countries around
the world that

00:23:20.656 --> 00:23:23.690 align:middle line:84%
operated outside of the
Rothschild banking empire.

00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:26.200 align:middle line:84%
Now I think you'll
follow the trend here.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:33.250 align:middle line:84%
These countries were Cuba,
Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Iran,

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:37.690 align:middle line:84%
North Korea, South Korea,
Libya, Sudan, North Sudan,

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:40.880 align:middle line:84%
South Sudan, and maybe
one or two others.

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:44.300 align:middle line:90%
Today, Iraq is gone.

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:46.330 align:middle line:90%
Libya is gone.

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:49.170 align:middle line:90%
Cuba is about to go.

00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:51.220 align:middle line:90%
Afghanistan is gone.

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:54.940 align:middle line:84%
North Korea is hanging
in there, and Sudan

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:56.149 align:middle line:90%
is another questionable.

00:23:56.149 --> 00:23:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And Crimea is another one that
suddenly appeared on the list,

00:23:58.690 --> 00:23:59.620 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:03.390 align:middle line:84%
So it's very obvious to
see what's happened here.

00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:06.625 align:middle line:84%
You know, the people in Libya
didn't despise Muammar Gaddafi.

00:24:06.625 --> 00:24:08.410 align:middle line:90%
They actually quite liked him.

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:11.190 align:middle line:84%
Muammar Gaddafi didn't
do terrible things,

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:13.790 align:middle line:90%
the way we are led to believe.

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:16.346 align:middle line:84%
People were actually
paid to go to university.

00:24:16.346 --> 00:24:17.970 align:middle line:84%
Students were paid
to go to university,

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:19.630 align:middle line:84%
and after they left
university, they

00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:22.320 align:middle line:84%
were given a lump sum of
money to start their lives.

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:24.460 align:middle line:84%
But this is not the
picture that was painted

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:26.920 align:middle line:84%
to us in the West
about Muammar Gaddafi,

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:28.700 align:middle line:84%
and the dictator and
the terrible human

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:30.120 align:middle line:90%
being that he was.

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:33.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, now that the Libyan
government is overthrown,

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:37.360 align:middle line:84%
it's chaos and misery in a
country that was actually

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:39.670 align:middle line:84%
doing quite fine,
thank you very much.

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:43.310 align:middle line:84%
This is the modus operandi
that the Rothschild banking

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:45.700 align:middle line:90%
empire has imposed on humanity.

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:48.160 align:middle line:84%
Over the last 500
years, this system

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.730 align:middle line:84%
has been imposed through
secret societies,

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:55.290 align:middle line:84%
through secret meetings
and planning committees.

00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And these banking families
have been planning

00:24:57.210 --> 00:24:59.110 align:middle line:84%
this hundreds of
years in advance,

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:00.940 align:middle line:84%
were just being
completely oblivious.

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:03.560 align:middle line:84%
The education system is one
of the greatest examples.

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:05.900 align:middle line:10%
How the education
system we face today

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:09.700 align:middle line:10%
is being systematically and
meticulously and maliciously

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:14.890 align:middle line:10%
planned to become the education
system, the enslavement system,

00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:17.240 align:middle line:10%
the indoctrination,
the brainwashing system

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:19.580 align:middle line:10%
that it's become today.

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:23.900 align:middle line:10%
So, just to bring a bit of light
relief into this conversation,

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:27.490 align:middle line:10%
here is one of the
famous movie clips

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:31.120 align:middle line:10%
from another movie that's
deeply encoded with information.

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.570 align:middle line:10%
We just created worthless
electronic money out

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:34.500 align:middle line:10%
of nothing.

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:37.500 align:middle line:10%
Then we lend it out and
charge interest on it.

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:40.000 align:middle line:10%
And then we make them
give us their houses

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.600 align:middle line:10%
and their real wealth when
they can't pay back the money.

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:47.650 align:middle line:10%
And we had no actual
value in creating it.

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:50.060 align:middle line:90%
So, it just shows us the scam.

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:51.890 align:middle line:10%
The money system
that we face today

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:54.870 align:middle line:10%
is the largest
scam and con that's

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:58.880 align:middle line:10%
ever been pulled on humanity,
by the largest organized crime

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.850 align:middle line:10%
syndicate that's ever existed.

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:05.490 align:middle line:10%
I want to talk about the private
banks versus the people's bank.

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:10.190 align:middle line:10%
I mentioned already, the fact
that many countries in the past

00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:12.700 align:middle line:10%
have had people's
banks, has been

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:15.820 align:middle line:10%
the biggest threat to the
Rothschild global banking

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:17.310 align:middle line:10%
empire.

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is why they've slowly
and systematically done away

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:25.780 align:middle line:84%
with these governments that
imposed or ran people's banks.

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And this is why the Ubuntu
movement, on a national level,

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:33.740 align:middle line:84%
proposes and promotes the
establishment of a people's

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:35.890 align:middle line:90%
bank as the first step.

00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:39.600 align:middle line:84%
When we ran the elections
in South Africa in 2014

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:44.460 align:middle line:84%
as the Ubuntu party, our main
motto for the 2014 elections

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:48.040 align:middle line:84%
was, we will close down the
central bank, the South African

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:51.290 align:middle line:84%
Reserve Bank, and replace
it with a people's bank that

00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:53.940 align:middle line:84%
issues money for the
people, by the people,

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:55.610 align:middle line:90%
tax free and interest free.

00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And this money will be
available for all public works,

00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:00.150 align:middle line:90%
for all community projects.

00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:01.810 align:middle line:84%
Not for people to
enrich themselves,

00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:06.450 align:middle line:84%
buy houses and Ferrari's,
but to uplift communities,

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:08.420 align:middle line:90%
wherever you may be.

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:12.170 align:middle line:84%
The effect of a people's bank
on a country and a community

00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:13.510 align:middle line:90%
is spectacular.

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:17.010 align:middle line:84%
It is not the final solution
or the file destination.

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:19.990 align:middle line:84%
It is, however, the first
and most important step

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:22.430 align:middle line:84%
we need to take to
liberate ourselves

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:25.900 align:middle line:84%
from this terrible matrix
money enslavement system,

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:28.530 align:middle line:84%
and release the lid off
the pressure cooker.

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:31.740 align:middle line:84%
So people can feel
a sense of relief,

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:34.590 align:middle line:84%
and freedom to move
away from the cities,

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:37.540 align:middle line:84%
move into any small town
or village or country

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:41.810 align:middle line:84%
where they may want to live, and
don't feel compelled or obliged

00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:44.650 align:middle line:84%
to live, or forced to
live in cities where they

00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:46.280 align:middle line:90%
don't necessarily want to live.

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:49.409 align:middle line:84%
Remember, most people in
the huge metropolitan areas

00:27:49.409 --> 00:27:50.950 align:middle line:84%
are not there because
they choose to,

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:53.750 align:middle line:84%
because they love to live in
smoky, overcrowded cities.

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:56.040 align:middle line:84%
They've come to cities
in search of a job,

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:57.410 align:middle line:90%
in search of security.

00:27:57.410 --> 00:28:00.380 align:middle line:84%
And then, they get stuck
there and there's no way out,

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:03.090 align:middle line:84%
because they can't go to a
small town and get a job.

00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:05.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, what a people's
bank will do,

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:08.750 align:middle line:84%
and this is a promise on a
national level with the Ubuntu

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:14.410 align:middle line:84%
party, is that a people's
bank will allow anyone

00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:15.500 align:middle line:90%
to go anywhere.

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And as long as they're doing
something for their community,

00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:23.870 align:middle line:84%
as long as they're creating
a new community project,

00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:25.630 align:middle line:84%
whether it's breeding
horses, whether it's

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:30.880 align:middle line:84%
a bakery or an engineering
company or a rocket science

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:34.830 align:middle line:84%
research laboratory or a
laboratory that creates cures

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:38.010 align:middle line:84%
for all disease, anything
that you do or want

00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:42.210 align:middle line:84%
to do for the community, will
be funded by the people's bank.

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And this then creates
more jobs, well

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:47.970 align:middle line:84%
jobs are obviously
transitional phases

00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:50.840 align:middle line:84%
as we move from a money
driven society into a world

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:51.630 align:middle line:90%
without money.

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:55.090 align:middle line:84%
But what this does, it allows
all these many community

00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:58.560 align:middle line:84%
projects, for people to come and
express their natural talents,

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:02.200 align:middle line:84%
whether they're scientists
or creative people.

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:05.840 align:middle line:84%
No matter what they do, can then
express their natural talents

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:09.610 align:middle line:84%
in these many public works
and community projects.

00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And this is how we take
the lid off this pressure

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:16.850 align:middle line:84%
cooker of the central banks that
control our governments, that

00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:18.670 align:middle line:90%
turn us all into their slaves.

00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:21.860 align:middle line:84%
The first step is to shut
down the central banks,

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:23.940 align:middle line:84%
and replace it with
a people's bank.

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And how we take
this forward, we'll

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:27.280 align:middle line:90%
discuss in the next episode.

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:30.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm Michael Tellinger,
and thanks for watching.

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:35.200 align:middle line:90%
