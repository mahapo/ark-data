00:00:07.936 --> 00:00:12.810 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:13.610 align:middle line:90%
>>Hi.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:14.510 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.460 align:middle line:84%
We're in the second-last episode
of the Ubuntu contributions

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.720 align:middle line:90%
and workshop.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.040 align:middle line:10%
And I'd just like to recap
on some of the points

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.070 align:middle line:10%
we ended off with
in the last episode,

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.030 align:middle line:10%
and that is some of the
important considerations, just

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.810 align:middle line:10%
a few bullet points.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.350 align:middle line:84%
Transitional phase
versus final destination.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.340 align:middle line:84%
It's important that we can't go
from zero to hero in one step.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
take several steps.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.080 align:middle line:84%
It could take many
steps to get us

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.850 align:middle line:84%
from where we are today
to these beautiful united

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.690 align:middle line:90%
communities of abundance.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.320 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't necessarily mean
it's going to take a long time.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.395 align:middle line:84%
It could take
very, very quickly.

00:00:53.395 --> 00:00:57.710 align:middle line:84%
It could happen overnight if
certain things fall into place.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that we can make
those things fall into place

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.000 align:middle line:84%
by simply working together and
realizing what we have to do

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.920 align:middle line:84%
and going out
there and doing it.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And I guess this is what we're
discussing here and sharing

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:09.450 align:middle line:90%
that information.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And the more people
know about this,

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.630 align:middle line:84%
the easier it is for them to
go out there and implement

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.570 align:middle line:84%
this in their own
communities and start

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.750 align:middle line:84%
to get as many
people as possible

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.420 align:middle line:84%
to start thinking along these
lines in your own communities

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.470 align:middle line:84%
and as I always say, become
the seed of consciousness

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.580 align:middle line:84%
in your own community
and infect everyone else

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.730 align:middle line:84%
with this simple idea and
plan of action and unity

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.070 align:middle line:84%
consciousness that
we're moving towards.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:40.360 align:middle line:84%
So final destination is
possibly not that far away.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And the effect on
neighboring towns,

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.160 align:middle line:84%
that we discussed as
well, is the moment

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.810 align:middle line:84%
we have one of
these little towns

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.950 align:middle line:84%
and this community that works
on this principle of abundance,

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.460 align:middle line:84%
the effect and the
resonant effect

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.170 align:middle line:84%
it'll have on all
the neighboring towns

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.820 align:middle line:90%
is unimaginable to us.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.350 align:middle line:84%
The pressure that
will be imposed

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.410 align:middle line:84%
on the mayors and the leaders
of the neighboring towns

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.840 align:middle line:84%
and communities we
can't even begin

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.650 align:middle line:84%
to quantify from this
position right now.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.140 align:middle line:84%
All we know is that it
will be unstoppable,

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.670 align:middle line:84%
because once one
community operates

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.280 align:middle line:84%
on this very simple
principle of abundance,

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.190 align:middle line:84%
it is not going to
be possible to stop

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.370 align:middle line:84%
the others from adopting
that same principle

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.300 align:middle line:90%
and the same philosophy.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.960 align:middle line:84%
Everything changes when you
remove the money, everything

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.140 align:middle line:90%
in our reality.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that we-- it's actually

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.560 align:middle line:84%
a good point of
departure to answer

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.970 align:middle line:84%
the questions, the many
questions that people come up

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.950 align:middle line:84%
with, the 13 or
whatever frequently

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.320 align:middle line:84%
asked questions is
start from the premise

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.490 align:middle line:90%
that everything changes.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And we have to ask
ourselves, whatever

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.287 align:middle line:84%
question it is that
people throw at you--

00:02:53.287 --> 00:02:55.120 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to end
off this whole series

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.310 align:middle line:84%
with those questions again and
throw other questions that we

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.800 align:middle line:84%
come up with here in the
studio and see how easily we

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.660 align:middle line:90%
can solve any problem.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.540 align:middle line:84%
There is no problem
that cannot be solved,

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.060 align:middle line:84%
because it's a
self-correcting system.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.460 align:middle line:84%
It always corrects itself
for the best outcome

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:14.790 align:middle line:90%
of the community.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we can
solve all the problems.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:17.840 align:middle line:90%
It's not complicated.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.120 align:middle line:90%
It's very simple.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.990 align:middle line:84%
So the way we can approach these
questions when they come up

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.080 align:middle line:84%
is to rather ask a
question in return.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.260 align:middle line:84%
How will this work in
a world without money?

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.020 align:middle line:84%
So when people say, well, what's
going to happen to education?

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.300 align:middle line:84%
The question is, well, will
we have schools the way

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.960 align:middle line:90%
we have schools today?

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.250 align:middle line:84%
Or if people say, what's going
to happen to cars in a world

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.050 align:middle line:90%
without money?

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.850 align:middle line:84%
And the question
is, well, well we

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.950 align:middle line:90%
drive the cars we drive today?

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.690 align:middle line:84%
Will we still use petrol
the way we use petrol today?

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:52.530 align:middle line:90%
And so it goes.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.310 align:middle line:84%
Will we need roads the
way we have roads today?

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And the answer to do
that is no, we're not,

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.110 align:middle line:90%
because that's going to change.

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.580 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to use the cars
in the way we use cars today.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.150 align:middle line:84%
Transportation will
change completely.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.310 align:middle line:84%
Will we have airplanes using the
same technology we use today?

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.520 align:middle line:84%
The answer to that is, most
likely not, most probably not,

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.200 align:middle line:84%
most definitely not, because
if we set our scientists free,

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.000 align:middle line:84%
that technology is going to be
replaced very, very quickly.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And that applies to every
aspect of our lives.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And the moment you remove
money, those questions

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.190 align:middle line:90%
can be solved very quickly.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.200 align:middle line:84%
Then we get to this
Labor Of Love, the LOL.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.310 align:middle line:84%
Remember, in a
world without money,

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.190 align:middle line:84%
there are no jobs,
because you're now

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.630 align:middle line:90%
fulfilling your life purpose.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.740 align:middle line:84%
You're giving expression
to your creative needs

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.120 align:middle line:90%
and what drives you from within.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:51.900 align:middle line:84%
So we call it a labor of love
and not a job or your life work

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.580 align:middle line:90%
that you choose to do.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.350 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is that
you choose to do,

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.750 align:middle line:84%
whether you're a shoemaker
or a rocket scientist

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.650 align:middle line:84%
or a sculptor or a
chemical engineer

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.020 align:middle line:84%
or a baker, whatever
it is-- or you

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.480 align:middle line:84%
breed horses for your
community, whatever

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.990 align:middle line:84%
it is that you love
to do will ultimately

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.120 align:middle line:84%
become part of your community
and serve your community

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.190 align:middle line:90%
in some way.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.770 align:middle line:84%
So sooner or later, whatever
it is you choose to do

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.850 align:middle line:84%
will most likely become
a community project.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the most
amazing things to realize,

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.320 align:middle line:84%
how what you do actually
affects and impacts and benefits

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.340 align:middle line:90%
everyone in your community.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And this is why it's a
one-to-many exchange.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.700 align:middle line:84%
It's not a bartering
or trading system.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.080 align:middle line:84%
It is a one-to-many exchange
so everybody benefits

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.990 align:middle line:84%
from everything
that everybody does.

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.440 align:middle line:84%
Then the council
of elders, we've

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.920 align:middle line:84%
discussed how important
it is to implement

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.840 align:middle line:90%
the council of elders.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:50.500 align:middle line:84%
So this is the guiding body,
the body of wise people

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.130 align:middle line:84%
that are appointed
from the community that

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:59.250 align:middle line:84%
guide and govern and advise
the community what's best.

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.664 align:middle line:84%
So if I come up
with an idea, wow,

00:06:01.664 --> 00:06:03.830 align:middle line:84%
I want to build a foofy
slide from the mountain down

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.560 align:middle line:84%
to my garden and I want
everybody to help me build it,

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.160 align:middle line:84%
the council of elders will
probably say, listen, Michael,

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.430 align:middle line:84%
you're a nice guy, but if we're
going to build a foofy slide,

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.290 align:middle line:84%
let's not build
it to your garden.

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:17.970 align:middle line:84%
Let's build a foofy
slide from the top

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:20.430 align:middle line:84%
of the mountain to
the park so everybody

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.330 align:middle line:84%
can use the foofy
slide and not just you,

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.930 align:middle line:84%
because these kind of
things will happen.

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.000 align:middle line:84%
So I'm using a silly
example, but to show you

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.235 align:middle line:84%
how easily these things can be
solved, because, yes, people

00:06:32.235 --> 00:06:34.430 align:middle line:84%
will still want to do
things for their own benefit

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.500 align:middle line:84%
while we're getting
over this sharing thing

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.180 align:middle line:84%
and we don't really do
things for ourselves anymore.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.982 align:middle line:84%
Of course, your home
will be your home.

00:06:42.982 --> 00:06:44.440 align:middle line:84%
Your furniture will
be your choice.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.523 align:middle line:84%
The kind of clothes you
wear will be your clothes.

00:06:46.523 --> 00:06:48.790 align:middle line:90%
And everything is made for you.

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.561 align:middle line:84%
It's custom made for you
because that's how it works.

00:06:51.561 --> 00:06:54.060 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to go into a
shop and get it off the shelf,

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.601 align:middle line:84%
because we're not
going to have shops

00:06:55.601 --> 00:06:59.450 align:middle line:84%
where things sit getting ready
waiting for people to buy them.

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.620 align:middle line:84%
That no longer exists, so that
changes when you take money out

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:03.420 align:middle line:90%
of the system.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.305 align:middle line:84%
The way we shop, the
way we get things, well,

00:07:06.305 --> 00:07:08.820 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to be shopping,
but how we get and attain

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.680 align:middle line:90%
things changes completely.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.350 align:middle line:84%
That's where the council of
elders comes in and guides

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:17.000 align:middle line:84%
and make sure that people
don't abuse the system

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.530 align:middle line:90%
for their own personal benefit.

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:20.170 align:middle line:84%
And then the minority
rule principle

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:25.520 align:middle line:84%
is important to consider, where
all the minorities, no matter

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.630 align:middle line:84%
how small the group
of individuals

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:31.890 align:middle line:84%
may be, because
they're performing

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:35.230 align:middle line:84%
an important task
or important support

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:39.040 align:middle line:84%
or anything for the community,
they need to be supported.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.690 align:middle line:84%
They need to be given all the
tools, the scientific research.

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:44.690 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is
you're doing, you'll

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:48.080 align:middle line:84%
be given-- if you're doing this
and it benefits the community.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.217 align:middle line:84%
Then the one thing
we didn't touch upon

00:07:50.217 --> 00:07:52.300 align:middle line:84%
is the lone ranger, because
not everybody is going

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.622 align:middle line:90%
to want to live in a community.

00:07:53.622 --> 00:07:55.580 align:middle line:84%
What if you want to go
and live out on your own

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.140 align:middle line:84%
somewhere on a farm
in the mountains?

00:07:58.140 --> 00:07:59.990 align:middle line:84%
Then that's what
you're going to do.

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:03.630 align:middle line:84%
But again, things are now
going to change, because today

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:09.140 align:middle line:84%
when people are out on farms,
they often farm things, right?

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:12.450 align:middle line:84%
They either farm
cattle or huge tracts

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:15.026 align:middle line:90%
of land of maize or whatever.

00:08:15.026 --> 00:08:16.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's no longer
going to happen,

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:18.930 align:middle line:84%
because you're not going
to be able to sell that.

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:19.730 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:21.030 align:middle line:90%
You're going to have 400 cows.

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:23.151 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot of work to
look after 400 cows.

00:08:23.151 --> 00:08:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And you're not going to
have people helping you,

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:27.441 align:middle line:84%
because you're not going to
be paying them to help you.

00:08:27.441 --> 00:08:29.070 align:middle line:90%
So that whole thing changes.

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:33.340 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to do
and occupy as much land

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:37.440 align:middle line:84%
as you need to serve your
community, your community that

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.900 align:middle line:90%
belongs to your family.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.880 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a family of
five or six or 10 people,

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.220 align:middle line:84%
then you're probably going
to only use up so much space

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:48.570 align:middle line:84%
that you need to serve your
community on your little piece

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:51.920 align:middle line:90%
of land wherever that may be.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:55.127 align:middle line:84%
So you're not going to
grow 20 acres of maize,

00:08:55.127 --> 00:08:57.460 align:middle line:84%
because you're not going to
need that and it's too much.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:59.470 align:middle line:84%
What are you going to
do with the rest of it?

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:00.680 align:middle line:90%
You can't eat all of it.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.350 align:middle line:90%
You can't sell it to anybody.

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:04.400 align:middle line:90%
See how that changes?

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.900 align:middle line:84%
So the Lone Ranger aspect
is a very exciting part

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.560 align:middle line:84%
of this evolution
and how this works.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.830 align:middle line:84%
So you can go and
live out on your own,

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:16.770 align:middle line:84%
but sooner or later, you're
going to probably interact

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:18.199 align:middle line:90%
with the closest community.

00:09:18.199 --> 00:09:19.990 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to go
in there once a week

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:22.610 align:middle line:84%
and perform some task
for that community

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:26.320 align:middle line:84%
so you can benefit from whatever
that community is doing.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And then you can carry on
living as a lone ranger,

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:30.130 align:middle line:90%
because you don't like company.

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:31.500 align:middle line:90%
You want to be on your own.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the benefits
and the best of both worlds.

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And nobody's going
to mess with you,

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:38.686 align:middle line:84%
because you're not taking
up unnecessary space.

00:09:38.686 --> 00:09:40.560 align:middle line:84%
You're not claiming all
this land and saying,

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.450 align:middle line:84%
this is my land,
get off my land,

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:45.890 align:middle line:84%
because you don't need to
have 400 cows so you've

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:47.930 align:middle line:90%
got security for the future.

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:49.622 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
grow all this food,

00:09:49.622 --> 00:09:51.330 align:middle line:84%
because you've got
all the food you need,

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.080 align:middle line:84%
because you're still part
of the nearest community.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.670 align:middle line:90%
You can choose not to do that.

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:58.420 align:middle line:84%
But that's just going to make
it more difficult for yourself.

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:01.410 align:middle line:84%
So it's a lot better just to
participate in the closest

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:04.890 align:middle line:84%
community activity and then
have the benefits of all

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:07.332 align:middle line:90%
that community produces.

00:10:07.332 --> 00:10:09.290 align:middle line:84%
So the Lone Ranger thing
I find quite exciting.

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's a great
example to show how

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:15.240 align:middle line:84%
things change for the
benefit of those that choose

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.570 align:middle line:90%
to live out on their own.

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And again, remember that land
ownership flies out the window.

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:24.400 align:middle line:90%
There is no land ownership.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:28.920 align:middle line:84%
People use land and
space based on what

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.860 align:middle line:84%
it is they're doing
for the community.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:34.290 align:middle line:84%
So if you're a shoemaker, you
don't need 100 acres of land,

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:35.090 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:37.970 align:middle line:84%
But if you're participating in
growing food for the community,

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:38.770 align:middle line:90%
that changes.

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:41.450 align:middle line:84%
Then you will use
as much land as it

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:43.280 align:middle line:84%
takes to grow the food
for the community.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.834 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to use
less or more, because we

00:10:45.834 --> 00:10:48.250 align:middle line:84%
know how much food we're going
to grow, so that's how much

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:49.330 align:middle line:90%
land we use.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.140 align:middle line:84%
So this whole thing of
ownership of land and I've

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:56.324 align:middle line:84%
got all this land belongs to me,
me, me, that no longer exists.

00:10:56.324 --> 00:10:58.490 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to move
from this town to that town,

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:01.010 align:middle line:84%
then that's what
you do, because you

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:02.830 align:middle line:84%
choose to move to
another community

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:05.760 align:middle line:84%
because you've had enough living
in the mountains and the snow.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.980 align:middle line:84%
You want to go and live near the
beach where the coconuts grow.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.040 align:middle line:90%
That's your choice.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.860 align:middle line:84%
And when you arrive there,
they welcome you with open arms

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:16.800 align:middle line:84%
and you plug into this community
and you get a beautiful place

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:17.600 align:middle line:90%
to live.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.600 align:middle line:84%
Or if there is no house
for you to live in,

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:23.770 align:middle line:84%
then you have one
built for yourself,

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:27.080 align:middle line:84%
because that's what the
builders and the architects do.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.430 align:middle line:84%
They design your home
based on what you like

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:30.334 align:middle line:90%
and what you want.

00:11:30.334 --> 00:11:31.750 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, there
are restrictions.

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:34.280 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to
build a 20-room mansion up

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:38.180 align:middle line:84%
on the mountain, because you
have to clean your house.

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:40.940 align:middle line:84%
So again, all of
that kicks in, right?

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:43.260 align:middle line:84%
So why do you want
a 20-room mansion?

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.450 align:middle line:84%
Today, people have 20-room
mansions because it's value,

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:47.580 align:middle line:90%
perceived value.

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:50.070 align:middle line:84%
It's worth a lot more
than a little small room.

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:53.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, you see how quickly
people's perception

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:56.610 align:middle line:84%
change when they no longer
see it as something of value

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:58.800 align:middle line:84%
that they could sell
to make some money

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.520 align:middle line:90%
to have a retirement.

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.000 align:middle line:90%
Everything changes.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.790 align:middle line:84%
I want to live in a
mud hut on the beach.

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:05.900 align:middle line:90%
That's my personal wish.

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:09.040 align:middle line:84%
I want to live in the land
of the low-hanging fruits

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:14.800 align:middle line:84%
in a mud hut near the
beach, where I can just

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.810 align:middle line:90%
live in warm climates.

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:18.960 align:middle line:84%
I don't like the
cold climate at all.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's another thing
that people ask you.

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.540 align:middle line:84%
People say-- often they
use it as an argument,

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:25.660 align:middle line:84%
say, well, everybody's going
to want to live on the beach.

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:26.580 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:27.530 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:29.029 align:middle line:84%
You might want to
live on the beach.

00:12:29.029 --> 00:12:30.446 align:middle line:84%
But I know that
him, her, and her,

00:12:30.446 --> 00:12:31.904 align:middle line:84%
they want to live
on the mountains,

00:12:31.904 --> 00:12:33.240 align:middle line:90%
because they like snowboarding.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.230 align:middle line:84%
They want to live
where the snow is.

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:37.270 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to live
anywhere near the beach.

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:38.603 align:middle line:90%
And some people like the rivers.

00:12:38.603 --> 00:12:41.010 align:middle line:90%
Some people like the desert.

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:44.100 align:middle line:84%
There are as many preferences
as there are people.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:45.980 align:middle line:84%
So this whole notion
that everybody

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:49.600 align:middle line:84%
wants to live on a beach is
another capitalistic poisoning

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:53.120 align:middle line:84%
of our minds how we've
been completely baffled

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:57.430 align:middle line:84%
by the system that we've
grown into or born into.

00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:59.660 align:middle line:84%
Finally on this
important considerations

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:05.510 align:middle line:84%
list is this whole process is
a process of no confrontation.

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:07.000 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
confront anybody.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.480 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to oppose anybody.

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:13.950 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to take up arms
against anybody or get violent.

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:18.290 align:middle line:84%
All we do is we just create
this new alternative.

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And the moment we create
this new alternative,

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:26.030 align:middle line:84%
we've started a chain reaction
that can no longer be stopped.

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:28.550 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to confront or
fight or argue with anybody

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:32.260 align:middle line:84%
or convince any
government of anything.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.320 align:middle line:84%
Just create a new path
for ourselves, a new path

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.690 align:middle line:90%
away from the global control.

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And that brings us to one of
the foundations of our poisoned

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.010 align:middle line:90%
society, and that is education.

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And this really is one
of my favorite subjects,

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.880 align:middle line:84%
because this is where you really
start seeing how quickly we can

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:53.710 align:middle line:84%
convert our society and
our children into really

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:57.320 align:middle line:84%
well-balanced individuals,
well integrated into

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:59.850 align:middle line:84%
their communities,
that truly start

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:04.010 align:middle line:84%
adding to the well-being
of their community

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:06.250 align:middle line:90%
from the earliest of ages.

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:09.150 align:middle line:84%
So all the community
projects that we

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:11.940 align:middle line:84%
have that you're going
to participate in,

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.670 align:middle line:84%
they're actually going to
become the new education system.

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:18.270 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine after a while--
and not only for the adults,

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:20.380 align:middle line:90%
for the children as well.

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:23.930 align:middle line:84%
So what we propose with
the Ubuntu philosophy

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:26.230 align:middle line:84%
is that there are
really no schools.

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:30.550 align:middle line:84%
It's complete unschooling
and unlearning and learning

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:33.740 align:middle line:84%
hands-on, experiential
learning skills for life

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:35.170 align:middle line:90%
from the earliest of age.

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:38.090 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there are going
to be gatherings of children,

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:41.070 align:middle line:84%
and teachers who are really--
who love teaching, who

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:43.840 align:middle line:84%
know the art of
teaching, that understand

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:47.300 align:middle line:84%
that play and interaction
with children is critical.

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:51.460 align:middle line:84%
As Plato said, without the
element of play and games,

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:53.910 align:middle line:84%
children really
don't learn much.

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:56.120 align:middle line:90%
So we need to implement this.

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And there are master teachers
that really understand

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.610 align:middle line:84%
how to bring this forth
and how to bring out

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:05.170 align:middle line:84%
the best in the
children in this kind

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:09.240 align:middle line:84%
of interactive, participatory
way of teaching and learning

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.900 align:middle line:90%
real skills for life.

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:13.410 align:middle line:84%
But let's start with
the adults first.

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:16.170 align:middle line:84%
First of all, if
you're participating

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:19.820 align:middle line:84%
in these community
projects, and it's

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:27.350 align:middle line:84%
from bakery to engineering
to chemicals to new materials

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:30.660 align:middle line:84%
development to technology
to rocket science

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:33.790 align:middle line:84%
to growing food to
purifying water,

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:36.230 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be active in
all these community projects.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:39.220 align:middle line:84%
Sooner or later, you're going
to go and work in those areas.

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:43.380 align:middle line:84%
Within a few years, the people
of our town and our community

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:46.820 align:middle line:84%
will be so well trained
and so well informed

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:50.500 align:middle line:84%
in all these areas, far
more hands-on knowledge

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.532 align:middle line:84%
and hands-on
experience, we'll be

00:15:52.532 --> 00:15:53.990 align:middle line:84%
able to do everything
and anything,

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:56.390 align:middle line:90%
because we've actually done it.

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:59.140 align:middle line:84%
You've assisted or
worked in these areas.

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:01.480 align:middle line:84%
You'll know how to bake
bread, how to make cheese,

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:05.750 align:middle line:84%
how to build a rocket,
how to milk a cow.

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:07.140 align:middle line:90%
I recently milked a cow.

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:09.590 align:middle line:84%
It's first time that I
milked a cow in years.

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:11.860 align:middle line:84%
It was such an
amazing experience.

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:13.312 align:middle line:90%
It was like wow.

00:16:13.312 --> 00:16:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And I know that some people
have a problem with that,

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.990 align:middle line:84%
but that's another
discussion altogether.

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:21.350 align:middle line:90%


00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:24.170 align:middle line:84%
The animals, what happens to
vegetarianism and all that?

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:26.450 align:middle line:84%
It's all part of the
growth of consciousness.

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:28.700 align:middle line:84%
So let's put it out
there and say, yes, it

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:30.870 align:middle line:90%
is something that is considered.

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:33.700 align:middle line:84%
It is a very important
subject matter.

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:37.630 align:middle line:84%
But it is part of the growth
of this unity consciousness

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:40.370 align:middle line:84%
that we start to
growing into realizing

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:42.760 align:middle line:84%
in our own personal
capacity, start

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.057 align:middle line:90%
growing into that awareness.

00:16:44.057 --> 00:16:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And sooner or later, you'll
get to the point you'll say,

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:48.720 align:middle line:84%
I can no longer drink
milk from a cow,

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:51.710 align:middle line:90%
when the time is right for you.

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:53.170 align:middle line:90%
We can't force that on anybody.

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:55.570 align:middle line:84%
We can't force people
to be vegetarians.

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:58.380 align:middle line:84%
It's part of our
individual growth

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:01.140 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness that
becomes-- hopefully

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:07.630 align:middle line:84%
will speed up as this
philosophy comes into fruition.

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:12.990 align:middle line:84%
So what this really means is
that the sooner we implement

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:14.940 align:middle line:84%
the community
projects, the sooner we

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:18.640 align:middle line:84%
start creating a
really well integrated

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:22.310 align:middle line:84%
and a united community of well
informed and highly skilled

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:25.359 align:middle line:84%
people that know how to
do everything and have

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:27.540 align:middle line:84%
no fear of anything
because they participate

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:29.300 align:middle line:90%
in all this activity.

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And the teachers, the masters
of the different areas

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:37.310 align:middle line:84%
of the projects, whether it's
the baker or the engineer

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:42.450 align:middle line:84%
or the rocket scientist or
the farmer or the anything,

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:47.140 align:middle line:84%
clearly we're going to have
the best people in charge

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:48.260 align:middle line:90%
of those areas.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:49.770 align:middle line:84%
We're not just going
to put somebody

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:51.480 align:middle line:84%
who doesn't know
how to grow food

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.890 align:middle line:84%
or how to build bridges
in charge of that area.

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:55.890 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to have
the best people possible.

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Those individuals ultimately
become the master teachers

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:02.560 align:middle line:84%
in the community of
that specific subject.

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.810 align:middle line:84%
Think about our current
education system.

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And this is with all due
respect to the teachers

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:09.434 align:middle line:84%
out there, because I know
that many of the teachers that

00:18:09.434 --> 00:18:10.850 align:middle line:84%
go out there
actually go out there

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:13.624 align:middle line:84%
with a passion for teaching
and the love of teaching

00:18:13.624 --> 00:18:14.540 align:middle line:90%
and sharing knowledge.

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:17.550 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately they get
caught up in the system

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:19.880 align:middle line:84%
and they are forced
to teach in a way

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.340 align:middle line:84%
that they don't
necessarily want to teach.

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:24.300 align:middle line:84%
But how could you
possibly call yourself

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:27.910 align:middle line:84%
a teacher unless you are a
master of what is that you do?

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:29.520 align:middle line:84%
If you don't know
how to bake, how

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.520 align:middle line:84%
can you teach
someone else to bake

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.650 align:middle line:90%
from a textbook in a classroom?

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:35.440 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work, does it?

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.390 align:middle line:84%
If you don't know how
to build a bridge,

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:40.420 align:middle line:84%
how could you tell somebody in
theory how to build a bridge?

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:44.310 align:middle line:84%
So this is why I believe that
we don't need classrooms.

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:47.930 align:middle line:84%
Hands-on experience
is far more important

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:51.200 align:middle line:84%
that teaches us real skills for
life, not theoretical knowledge

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.020 align:middle line:90%
or information.

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:54.400 align:middle line:84%
There is no such
thing as failure.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.850 align:middle line:84%
This whole concept
of failing an exam

00:18:56.850 --> 00:19:00.660 align:middle line:84%
is just another example
how the fear tactics

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.420 align:middle line:84%
and the fear-mongering
is imposed on our society

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:05.720 align:middle line:84%
and on our children from
the earliest of ages.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:09.350 align:middle line:84%
The fear of failing an exam,
failing and not moving on

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:11.670 align:middle line:90%
in life, how is that possible?

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:13.570 align:middle line:84%
You're a living,
breathing human being.

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:15.050 align:middle line:90%
You're already alive.

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:16.660 align:middle line:90%
How can you fail?

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:19.090 align:middle line:90%
We can't fail.

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:22.220 align:middle line:84%
We choose to do
things we love to do.

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:25.000 align:middle line:84%
And when you choose to do what
you love to do, how could you

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.694 align:middle line:90%
possibly fail?

00:19:26.694 --> 00:19:28.360 align:middle line:84%
The only reason we
fail is because we're

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:31.250 align:middle line:84%
forced to do things
we don't love to do.

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And then they use
our lack of resonance

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:38.330 align:middle line:84%
with what we're forced to do as
an expression that you failed,

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:40.290 align:middle line:84%
because look how badly
you've done this.

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:42.130 align:middle line:84%
So that all flies
out the window.

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:44.510 align:middle line:84%
No longer do we see
ourselves as failures

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:46.470 align:middle line:90%
in any sense whatsoever.

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And that changes the
whole energetic structure

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:51.900 align:middle line:84%
of our society and our
community very quickly.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:55.642 align:middle line:84%
So practical knowledge, we've
already spoken about the jobs,

00:19:55.642 --> 00:19:56.600 align:middle line:90%
that there are no jobs.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.610 align:middle line:90%
They're really labors of love.

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And that leads us to
the fact that whatever

00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:03.340 align:middle line:84%
it is for your
community-- and somebody

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:06.640 align:middle line:90%
brought this up earlier.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.330 align:middle line:84%
If you do something
for your community

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:10.500 align:middle line:84%
that benefits the
community, that's

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:13.760 align:middle line:84%
what you are known for
and respected and loved

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.920 align:middle line:84%
and cherished, because
everybody knows

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:19.540 align:middle line:84%
that Michael is the guy
that bakes the best bread.

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And they love you for it,
because they love your bread,

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:26.210 align:middle line:84%
or they love the way
that you make shoes

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:28.490 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it is that you do.

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:32.250 align:middle line:84%
You're respected because
of what you contribute

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:35.280 align:middle line:84%
to your community, not because
how much money you have

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:39.390 align:middle line:84%
or how many people you
employ and give them

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:42.680 align:middle line:84%
the illusion of
security, you know,

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:45.420 align:middle line:84%
because that's why I said
today the respect we carry

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:48.720 align:middle line:84%
in our society today is
actually a completely

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:51.830 align:middle line:90%
misguided sense of respect.

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:54.000 align:middle line:84%
It's more of a fear-based
kind of gratitude.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.590 align:middle line:84%
Thank god this guy's
giving us a job.

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:58.260 align:middle line:90%
We really respect you for that.

00:20:58.260 --> 00:20:59.060 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:00.120 align:middle line:90%
That's not respect.

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:02.870 align:middle line:84%
That's a fear-based
kind of servitude.

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:07.510 align:middle line:84%
So this really causes a rapid
rise in unity consciousness

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:10.540 align:middle line:84%
as people pursue their
passions, because out

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:14.400 align:middle line:84%
of 168 hours in
a week, you still

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:18.590 align:middle line:84%
have 165 hours to
do what you love.

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:22.260 align:middle line:84%
What are you going to do
with all that time, right?

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And this is where it
really starts to-- wow.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:30.670 align:middle line:84%
Today we work like slaves
just to stay alive.

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:33.130 align:middle line:84%
With this kind of system,
three hours a week

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:36.440 align:middle line:84%
in the community
project, what I find

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:41.112 align:middle line:84%
and what many people seem to
believe is that most of us

00:21:41.112 --> 00:21:43.320 align:middle line:84%
will probably work a lot
more than three hours a week

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:44.510 align:middle line:90%
in the community projects.

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:45.680 align:middle line:90%
>>I was just thinking that.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.510 align:middle line:84%
>>Because you're going to
find something you love.

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:49.550 align:middle line:84%
Like you might-- because
of the different things

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:51.430 align:middle line:84%
that you're now
exposed to, you're

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:54.410 align:middle line:84%
going to suddenly find that you
love the chemical engineering

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:54.700 align:middle line:90%
part.

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:55.730 align:middle line:84%
And you'll say,
well, listen, I want

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:57.680 align:middle line:84%
to spend more time
in the chemistry lab,

00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:00.000 align:middle line:84%
because I love this stuff
and I'll get some ideas

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.379 align:middle line:90%
about developing new materials.

00:22:01.379 --> 00:22:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to say,
yeah, sure, great, what

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:05.510 align:middle line:84%
are your ideas, because
that's how it works.

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:05.730 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:06.200 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:06.830 align:middle line:90%
You're an idiot.

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:07.400 align:middle line:90%
Go away.

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:08.370 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:10.078 align:middle line:84%
They'll invite you in
and say, all right.

00:22:10.078 --> 00:22:11.230 align:middle line:90%
What are you thinking?

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:12.350 align:middle line:90%
What should we try?

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And experiment, because
that's what this is all about,

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:17.830 align:middle line:84%
learning through
experimentation,

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:22.050 align:middle line:84%
playing, because that's the
opportunity that you have.

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:25.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's all there for you
presented by the community.

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:29.960 align:middle line:84%
So it really explodes
with possibility.

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:32.970 align:middle line:84%
You decided that you
love breeding fish

00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:36.070 align:middle line:84%
and you just have
a knack for this.

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And to breed the fish
better and quicker,

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:41.481 align:middle line:84%
we're going to need
highly oxygenated water.

00:22:41.481 --> 00:22:43.980 align:middle line:84%
So then we're going to need the
scientists and the guys that

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:47.220 align:middle line:84%
know how to energize and
oxygenate water naturally

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:48.880 align:middle line:84%
from the streams
and the rivers that

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.210 align:middle line:90%
feed through our fish farm.

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, our fish
grow three times as quickly

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:58.640 align:middle line:84%
and they taste
better and they look

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.920 align:middle line:84%
better for those that want to
breed koi fish not necessarily

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:04.430 align:middle line:90%
fish to eat.

00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:06.360 align:middle line:90%
Everything becomes possible.

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:11.080 align:middle line:84%
So everything becomes
a community project.

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.955 align:middle line:84%
And here's an
interesting example.

00:23:13.955 --> 00:23:15.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm a painter.

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:18.930 align:middle line:90%
I paint beautiful paintings.

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And I get my canvases
from the guys

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:24.736 align:middle line:84%
that create canvases
in town for free.

00:23:24.736 --> 00:23:26.530 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that amazing?

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:29.320 align:middle line:84%
And normally they'd cost
you a bloody fortune,

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.565 align:middle line:90%
to buy a canvas these days.

00:23:30.565 --> 00:23:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And the paintbrushes are
real wooden paintbrushes

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:34.520 align:middle line:90%
with real horsehair.

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And today, that's
very, very expensive.

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And my paintbrushes
are prepared for me

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:42.130 align:middle line:84%
by the guys that make
paintbrushes in my town.

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:45.090 align:middle line:84%
And I use this,
this is my hobby.

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:47.950 align:middle line:84%
This is my labor of love,
what I do for myself.

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:52.310 align:middle line:84%
So I start to paint, and I
make these beautiful paintings.

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:54.409 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly people start
coming to me saying,

00:23:54.409 --> 00:23:56.200 align:middle line:84%
Michael, wow, we really
love your painting.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:59.560 align:middle line:84%
Can you paint me a picture
of that mountain over there?

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:00.370 align:middle line:90%
I say sure.

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:01.786 align:middle line:84%
And I'll paint a
beautiful picture

00:24:01.786 --> 00:24:03.060 align:middle line:90%
of the mountain for John.

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And John takes it and
everyone goes, wow,

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:05.610 align:middle line:90%
John, that's amazing.

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:06.070 align:middle line:90%
Who did that?

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:06.890 align:middle line:90%
Michael did that.

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:07.530 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wow.

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:08.660 align:middle line:90%
Michael, can you do that--

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:10.184 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly before
you know, people

00:24:10.184 --> 00:24:11.850 align:middle line:84%
are coming to you
from your town saying,

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:13.641 align:middle line:84%
can you do this painting
and that painting?

00:24:13.641 --> 00:24:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly
people say, Michael,

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.620 align:middle line:90%
you're the best painter in town.

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:20.510 align:middle line:84%
Can you teach our
children how to paint?

00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And automatically, people
gravitate towards you

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:24.510 align:middle line:90%
to teach them how to paint.

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:28.130 align:middle line:84%
So at some stage, the council
of elders will call you in

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:31.780 align:middle line:84%
and say, Michael, everybody
loves you as a painter.

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:34.090 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to take on
the role as the master

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:36.120 align:middle line:90%
painter of our community?

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And then you have a choice
to say either yes or no,

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:41.000 align:middle line:90%
because it's your choice.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.494 align:middle line:90%
You're not forced into it.

00:24:42.494 --> 00:24:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And if you take on
that choice, then you

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.430 align:middle line:90%
become the master painter.

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:46.310 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:48.230 align:middle line:84%
You've already become
the master painter.

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:50.700 align:middle line:84%
Whether you accept it or not,
the people have chosen you.

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:52.970 align:middle line:84%
It's just that the
council of elders

00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:56.360 align:middle line:84%
will give you I guess the
platform to say, look,

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.520 align:middle line:84%
we acknowledge you
as the master painter

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.620 align:middle line:90%
more than anything else.

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:03.960 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, before you
know, you say, well, look,

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.760 align:middle line:84%
you no longer have to do three
hours a week in the community

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:09.310 align:middle line:84%
project, because everybody
needs to come to you

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:14.410 align:middle line:84%
as your paint workshop is now
the new community project,

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:17.740 align:middle line:84%
because everybody's coming
to you to learn how to paint.

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And now you need
the actual paint,

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:22.340 align:middle line:84%
so that comes from the
chemists in the lab that

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:24.140 align:middle line:90%
are creating the paint for you.

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:27.070 align:middle line:84%
But the paint is
biodegradable, nontoxic,

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:29.170 align:middle line:84%
and you get multiple
colors, far more

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:31.690 align:middle line:84%
than you get from the
current laboratories that

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:34.130 align:middle line:90%
make the poisonous paint.

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:38.160 align:middle line:84%
And everything that you get is
made out of the best materials

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:42.770 align:middle line:84%
and it's nontoxic and
biodegradable and free,

00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:45.480 align:middle line:84%
because you get it because
you're part of the community.

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't get
the paint, then you

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:50.280 align:middle line:84%
go to the chemists
in the chemical lab,

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.320 align:middle line:84%
and say, listen, I need
the following colors

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.900 align:middle line:90%
for my paint shop.

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:57.700 align:middle line:84%
And they create it for you,
because that's what they do.

00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:01.940 align:middle line:84%
Can you see how simple
and integrated this?

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:05.040 align:middle line:84%
It's insane that
anything else is actually

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:09.190 align:middle line:84%
been allowed to rise and
consume our lives, anything

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:13.780 align:middle line:84%
other than this kind of way
of thinking and philosophy.

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:17.310 align:middle line:84%
So when I say everything
becomes a community project,

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:19.070 align:middle line:84%
I hope that it's now
making more sense

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:22.430 align:middle line:84%
and that it's easy to comprehend
that kind of statement

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:25.977 align:middle line:84%
and how that expands
the community projects.

00:26:25.977 --> 00:26:27.560 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly we're going
to need to create

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:30.000 align:middle line:84%
more paint, for not
just painting houses,

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.226 align:middle line:90%
but for artists.

00:26:32.226 --> 00:26:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to need to
create different kind of clays

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.500 align:middle line:84%
for the sculptors and materials
with which they sculpt.

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:38.760 align:middle line:90%
And it might not just be clay.

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:43.890 align:middle line:84%
It might be a graphene kind
of material mixed with hemp

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:47.530 align:middle line:84%
or whatever that is
moldable and biodegradable

00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:50.550 align:middle line:84%
and is far stronger
and doesn't break.

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:54.870 align:middle line:84%
So our needs for materials
will change totally.

00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:57.130 align:middle line:84%
So this brings us to
another consideration,

00:26:57.130 --> 00:26:59.950 align:middle line:84%
and that is, how do
we invite and include

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:03.720 align:middle line:84%
existing businesses and
companies and factories

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:07.280 align:middle line:84%
and industry to participate
in this creation of abundance?

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And this is really
a beautiful example

00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:12.750 align:middle line:84%
that demonstrates how
inclusive this philosophy

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:14.710 align:middle line:90%
of Contributionism is.

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:16.140 align:middle line:90%
It does not exclude anyone.

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:18.640 align:middle line:84%
It always invites
everyone to participate

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:20.870 align:middle line:90%
in this abundance creation.

00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:23.610 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to use an
example of a little factory

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:24.830 align:middle line:90%
that we have in our town.

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:29.670 align:middle line:84%
They make door windows and--
wooden doors and windows.

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:32.290 align:middle line:84%
So what we do is
we invite everybody

00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:35.920 align:middle line:84%
to participate in becoming
a community project.

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And normally, the
question is-- first

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:41.400 align:middle line:84%
an immediate question is, well,
what's in it for me, right?

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.910 align:middle line:90%
So the answer is very simple.

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:44.960 align:middle line:84%
You already know what
the answer is, right?

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:48.140 align:middle line:84%
What's in it for you
as a factory owner is

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:54.250 align:middle line:84%
free electricity; no rent; no
rates and taxes; free labor,

00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:56.760 align:middle line:84%
because now that you're part
of the community project,

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:58.520 align:middle line:84%
people will be allocated
to come and work

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:01.300 align:middle line:84%
in your factory; free
wood, because you'll

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:03.950 align:middle line:84%
get the wood from our sawmill,
because the sawmill is

00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:07.660 align:middle line:84%
a community project;
free glue, because you'll

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:10.570 align:middle line:84%
get the glue from our
chemical laboratory that's

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:14.550 align:middle line:84%
going to be better and stronger,
nontoxic and biodegradable glue

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:17.250 align:middle line:90%
that you can't afford today.

00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And any other components that
you need for your factory

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:22.200 align:middle line:90%
will be provided for you.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:25.000 align:middle line:90%
So that's what's in it for you.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And all you have to do
in return is manage that,

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:33.540 align:middle line:84%
be the master carpenter, and
teach the people what to do.

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And in return, you retain
1/3 of the profits and 2/3

00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:39.650 align:middle line:90%
go back to the community.

00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:41.650 align:middle line:84%
And guess what people say
when you approach them

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:44.540 align:middle line:84%
with this, whether they're
farmers, whether they're

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:47.720 align:middle line:84%
factory owners, doesn't
matter what field of work

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:50.730 align:middle line:84%
they come from, the
answer is always the same.

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:52.750 align:middle line:90%
When can we start?

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:55.140 align:middle line:84%
You don't even
enter a negotiation,

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:57.410 align:middle line:84%
because suddenly
they've got no cost

00:28:57.410 --> 00:28:59.330 align:middle line:84%
and you're offering
them all the stuff,

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:01.920 align:middle line:84%
the expertise that they
can't afford today.

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And they retain
1/3 of the profits?

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:06.050 align:middle line:90%
It's a no-brainer, right?

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:09.620 align:middle line:84%
So this is how beautiful
and elegant this system is,

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:12.300 align:middle line:84%
and how you invite everybody
into your community.

00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And this is why whether
it's computer geeks building

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.380 align:middle line:84%
supercomputers or any kind
of manufacturing, research,

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:25.755 align:middle line:84%
or industry that's
doing things, people

00:29:25.755 --> 00:29:27.660 align:middle line:84%
will start to come
to your community

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:30.440 align:middle line:84%
and say, can I make my
business and my factory

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:33.470 align:middle line:84%
part of your community projects,
because suddenly they'll

00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:36.080 align:middle line:84%
realize that it's a
huge benefit to them.

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:39.270 align:middle line:84%
So our town will
become like this magnet

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:44.410 align:middle line:84%
for creativity, for
imagining stuff,

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:46.560 align:middle line:84%
for arts and culture,
for-- can you

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:50.210 align:middle line:84%
imagine the halls and
the musical instruments

00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:54.050 align:middle line:84%
and the sound systems that
we're going to have in our town?

00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:58.110 align:middle line:84%
Better than any small town
could possibly afford.

00:29:58.110 --> 00:29:59.660 align:middle line:90%
It just never stops.

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:02.500 align:middle line:90%
The benefits are never-ending.

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And this is how we grow and
expand this very, very quickly,

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.440 align:middle line:84%
and becomes unstoppable once you
start and you plant the seed.

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And now we get to the
very exciting part

00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:20.030 align:middle line:84%
of how this abundance spreads
not just beyond our town,

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:24.280 align:middle line:84%
but beyond our borders, and how
it allows us to not only travel

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:27.130 align:middle line:84%
within our own countries,
but travel internationally

00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:31.400 align:middle line:84%
and really ground this
and land this philosophy

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.090 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And I call it the Ubuntu
warehouses and the creating

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:38.560 align:middle line:90%
of alternative currencies.

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:40.410 align:middle line:90%
This is what happens.

00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:43.580 align:middle line:84%
From all these projects that we
do, from growing food, building

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:47.340 align:middle line:84%
supercomputers, furniture,
whatever it is that we do,

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:52.220 align:middle line:84%
clothing, shoes,
anything you can imagine,

00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:54.800 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be creating
so much in our little town

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:57.170 align:middle line:84%
and then the neighboring
towns around us as they start

00:30:57.170 --> 00:30:59.320 align:middle line:84%
joining us, we're
not always going

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:00.829 align:middle line:90%
to be able to sell the stuff.

00:31:00.829 --> 00:31:02.870 align:middle line:84%
So what are we going to
do the rest of the stuff?

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:04.536 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
to put it somewhere.

00:31:04.536 --> 00:31:06.530 align:middle line:84%
We can't just leave
it lying in the fields

00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:08.810 align:middle line:90%
or in somebody's house.

00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:10.922 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to have
to put it somewhere,

00:31:10.922 --> 00:31:12.630 align:middle line:84%
so we're going to
create these warehouses

00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:14.730 align:middle line:84%
and I call them the
Ubuntu warehouses.

00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:16.580 align:middle line:84%
Think of it as like
a Walmart, but it

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:18.190 align:middle line:90%
belongs to the community.

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:20.380 align:middle line:84%
So everything we do
and create and build

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:25.100 align:middle line:84%
goes into the Ubuntu
Walmart warehouse.

00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, we've just
created our own little warehouse

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:32.230 align:middle line:84%
full of incredible stuff
that belongs to us.

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:34.110 align:middle line:90%
Nobody can take it away from us.

00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:35.880 align:middle line:84%
We don't owe anybody
money for it.

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:38.640 align:middle line:84%
It belongs to us
and our community.

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:42.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, because of
the system that you

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:46.320 align:middle line:84%
don't want to keep stuff
because you don't need to,

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:49.240 align:middle line:84%
all the stuff in the warehouse
is available to all the people

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:50.510 align:middle line:90%
that participate.

00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:54.520 align:middle line:84%
And we'll probably, in the
initial stages I guess,

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:57.520 align:middle line:84%
have to create some sort of
a card, like an Ubuntu card,

00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:58.780 align:middle line:90%
and electronic card.

00:31:58.780 --> 00:31:59.910 align:middle line:90%
It's not really money.

00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:04.590 align:middle line:84%
It's just your
benefit to get what

00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:06.670 align:middle line:84%
is allocated to
you from what we've

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:08.650 align:middle line:90%
allocated to ourselves, right?

00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:12.070 align:middle line:84%
So it's not I'll add
less than him or her.

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:13.780 align:middle line:84%
We've allocated
this to ourselves.

00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:17.160 align:middle line:84%
We sit and decide how much
maize we're going to grow

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:20.140 align:middle line:84%
and how many potatoes
we're going to grow, right?

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:22.987 align:middle line:84%
So we know how much you're
entitled to every week.

00:32:22.987 --> 00:32:25.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I said
earlier, keep that in mind.

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:27.880 align:middle line:84%
We grow at least three times
as much as what we need

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:32.010 align:middle line:84%
and build and do-- always
create three times as much

00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:35.730 align:middle line:84%
as what we need in
every area of activity.

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:40.050 align:middle line:84%
So you can't just pull up a
truck in front of the Ubuntu

00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:42.190 align:middle line:84%
warehouse and fill it
up, because that's not

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:42.670 align:middle line:90%
how it works.

00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:43.710 align:middle line:84%
And you're not going
to want to do that.

00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:45.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, what are you
going to do it?

00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:46.520 align:middle line:90%
What, are you going to sell it?

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:46.940 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:48.920 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to sell
it, because you don't really

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:49.920 align:middle line:90%
want the money.

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:53.000 align:middle line:84%
You don't need the money,
so that notion also

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.042 align:middle line:90%
flies out the window, right?

00:32:55.042 --> 00:32:56.750 align:middle line:84%
This card just really--
in the beginning,

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:59.335 align:middle line:84%
in the transitional phases,
so you take your Ubuntu card

00:32:59.335 --> 00:33:01.710 align:middle line:84%
and every week or every month
you can go to the warehouse

00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:04.880 align:middle line:84%
and swipe it and get
whatever you need.

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:09.000 align:middle line:84%
But what this does is by
creating the warehouse,

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.170 align:middle line:84%
we just created a new
supply of goods and services

00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:14.580 align:middle line:90%
that belongs to us.

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And we've simply bypassed
the current existing

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:20.440 align:middle line:84%
supply of the Walmarts
and the supermarkets that

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.530 align:middle line:84%
are selling us
goods that are made

00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:27.360 align:middle line:84%
in sweat factories in
China, exploiting people.

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.980 align:middle line:84%
We've completely
bypassed and created

00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:32.910 align:middle line:84%
a new supply chain
that comes from us,

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:36.360 align:middle line:84%
from our labor of love,
from our technology.

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:38.040 align:middle line:90%
That's available to all of us.

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:40.020 align:middle line:84%
Nobody can come take
the stuff away from us,

00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:41.410 align:middle line:90%
because it belongs to us.

00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And we've created a new
alternative currency system

00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:46.510 align:middle line:90%
that is not based on money.

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:48.290 align:middle line:84%
You don't have a bank
account, so the bank

00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:50.200 align:middle line:84%
can't close your
account and prevent

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:53.540 align:middle line:84%
you access to the things
that you're entitled to.

00:33:53.540 --> 00:34:01.530 align:middle line:84%
In one very short period, we can
create this new supply of all

00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:04.400 align:middle line:84%
our goods and services
completely away from

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:08.800 align:middle line:84%
the current global supply and
the alternative currency that

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:12.330 align:middle line:84%
nobody can undermine, cannot
close, cannot collapse.

00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:14.880 align:middle line:84%
The Rothschilds, the banking
families of the world

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.280 align:middle line:90%
have no access to that.

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:18.590 align:middle line:90%
There is no money in your card.

00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:20.770 align:middle line:84%
They can't take your
money away from you.

00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is a huge, huge
hurdle that we've just

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:28.360 align:middle line:84%
crossed, the biggest hurdle
that currently prevents us

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:30.250 align:middle line:84%
from getting anywhere,
because it's always

00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:34.030 align:middle line:84%
a lack of money, a lack of
funds of doing anything.

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens
is you live in Boulder

00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:40.670 align:middle line:84%
and you're part of the
community, the Ubuntu

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:42.666 align:middle line:84%
community here that's
creating this abundance.

00:34:42.666 --> 00:34:43.540 align:middle line:90%
And everyone's happy.

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:44.831 align:middle line:90%
You've got everything you need.

00:34:44.831 --> 00:34:47.719 align:middle line:84%
And you say, well, I want to go
visit my buddy in Los Angeles.

00:34:47.719 --> 00:34:50.110 align:middle line:84%
I want to go live in
LA for a few months.

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:53.409 align:middle line:84%
And you get all the money that
you make from the community

00:34:53.409 --> 00:34:55.750 align:middle line:84%
projects, because we still
live in a capitalistic world

00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:58.380 align:middle line:84%
right now, so to
get from here to LA,

00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:01.270 align:middle line:84%
you might still have to use
this transportation that

00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:03.090 align:middle line:90%
still costs money, right?

00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:05.710 align:middle line:84%
That's going to fly out
the window soon as well.

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:07.210 align:middle line:84%
But in the meantime,
you're still

00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:10.090 align:middle line:84%
going to have to buy a
ticket, an airplane ticket

00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:11.690 align:middle line:90%
and fly to LA.

00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:13.210 align:middle line:84%
So you take all
this money that's

00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:16.370 align:middle line:84%
now sitting in the community
account or your own account

00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:18.590 align:middle line:84%
somewhere and you buy a
ticket and you fly to LA.

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:21.714 align:middle line:84%
And you get off the plane and
you go to your Ubuntu community

00:35:21.714 --> 00:35:22.630 align:middle line:90%
there and you say, hi.

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:23.440 align:middle line:90%
My name's Michael.

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:25.695 align:middle line:84%
I've come to stay here
for the next six months.

00:35:25.695 --> 00:35:27.890 align:middle line:84%
I want to enjoy the
sun and the beach.

00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:29.470 align:middle line:90%
And they say, welcome, Michael.

00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:30.660 align:middle line:90%
Just swipe your card.

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:33.620 align:middle line:84%
So thanks very much, welcome
to our Ubuntu community,

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:36.840 align:middle line:84%
and choose where
you want to live.

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:39.350 align:middle line:84%
And they show you a bunch of
places where you want to live.

00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:41.720 align:middle line:84%
You can choose from where
you live, either on the beach

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:43.960 align:middle line:84%
or up on the mountain
based on what you like,

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:45.260 align:middle line:90%
or in the desert.

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:47.220 align:middle line:90%
And then they say, right.

00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:50.290 align:middle line:84%
So this week they need some
help in the chemistry lab

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:53.970 align:middle line:84%
or they need some help with
gathering potatoes in the field

00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:57.750 align:middle line:84%
or they need help in grooming
the horses in the horse farm,

00:35:57.750 --> 00:36:02.730 align:middle line:84%
and please report at 3
o'clock on Thursday afternoon

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:04.620 align:middle line:84%
to go help them
groom the horses,

00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:07.860 align:middle line:84%
and that's your
chore for this week.

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And because you've done
that community project

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:14.770 align:middle line:84%
or that community service, you
can go to the Ubuntu warehouse

00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:18.210 align:middle line:84%
in Los Angeles and get whatever
you need for that week.

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:20.720 align:middle line:84%
So not only have you created
an alternative currency

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:22.510 align:middle line:84%
in your own town, in
your own community,

00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:25.700 align:middle line:84%
you've created an alternative
currency in between towns

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:27.370 align:middle line:90%
and communities.

00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:29.202 align:middle line:90%
And then it gets even better.

00:36:29.202 --> 00:36:30.410 align:middle line:90%
Then you've had enough of LA.

00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:33.820 align:middle line:84%
You say, I want to fly to Sydney
and visit my buddy in Sydney.

00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:36.360 align:middle line:84%
So you buy a ticket
and you fly to Sydney.

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:38.690 align:middle line:84%
Very soon those airplanes
will belong to the Ubuntu

00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:40.400 align:middle line:90%
communities in any case.

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And they're not going to fly
using jet engine propulsion

00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:44.590 align:middle line:90%
technologies.

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:47.410 align:middle line:84%
We are going to use much
better technology, right?

00:36:47.410 --> 00:36:49.350 align:middle line:84%
And you fly to
Sydney and you arrive

00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:52.940 align:middle line:84%
and you say, hey, I'll come live
in this town in this community

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:54.090 align:middle line:90%
and the same happens.

00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:55.220 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:56.020 align:middle line:90%
Choose a place.

00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And if there isn't a
place, they probably

00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:03.120 align:middle line:84%
will have a variety of
accommodation for travelers,

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:06.555 align:middle line:84%
people that are just traveling
through until they build you

00:37:06.555 --> 00:37:09.790 align:middle line:84%
a house of your own choice,
wherever you want it,

00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:12.210 align:middle line:84%
because that's what the
builders and the planners do.

00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:13.930 align:middle line:90%
They build houses for people.

00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:15.980 align:middle line:84%
That's their contribution
to the community,

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:18.850 align:middle line:84%
using the materials that
are created by the material

00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:21.350 align:middle line:84%
designers and builders
that are better

00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:24.350 align:middle line:84%
than the bricks and the
building materials we use today.

00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:26.850 align:middle line:84%
So you just see the knock-on
effect on every level.

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And you now have access
to international currency.

00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:34.030 align:middle line:84%
We've created a local currency
and an international currency

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:37.350 align:middle line:84%
that cannot be collapsed
by the banking families.

00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:38.730 align:middle line:90%
They cannot touch it.

00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:39.650 align:middle line:90%
They cannot access it.

00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:42.370 align:middle line:84%
They cannot close your account
like what they've just done

00:37:42.370 --> 00:37:43.630 align:middle line:90%
to me.

00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And we've solved a huge, huge
problem, all the problems.

00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:51.690 align:middle line:84%
We've become immune
to their control

00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:53.650 align:middle line:90%
by creating a new alternative.

00:37:53.650 --> 00:37:55.320 align:middle line:84%
This is what I've
been saying all along.

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:57.030 align:middle line:84%
We simply create
a new alternative.

00:37:57.030 --> 00:38:00.930 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to confront
them, fight them, oppose them,

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:02.510 align:middle line:90%
just bypass them.

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And what we've done is we've
left these global elite

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:10.170 align:middle line:84%
in charge of nobody,
in control of nothing.

00:38:10.170 --> 00:38:14.230 align:middle line:84%
They'll be sitting and--
let's actually carry on,

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:17.630 align:middle line:84%
because now this takes us
to the current industry,

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:19.730 align:middle line:90%
manufacturing, and mining.

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:24.480 align:middle line:84%
So are we still going to
be doing this, mining coal,

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:28.590 align:middle line:84%
creating huge destruction
of our planet?

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:30.110 align:middle line:90%
Of course not.

00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:33.800 align:middle line:84%
Why would we ever possibly
want to mine coal?

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:35.750 align:middle line:90%
It makes no sense.

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:39.950 align:middle line:84%
So all this destructive
mining activity-- and mining

00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:42.600 align:middle line:84%
is probably the most
destructive activity

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:44.720 align:middle line:90%
that we engage on this planet.

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:46.060 align:middle line:90%
It poisons our soil.

00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:47.570 align:middle line:90%
It poisons the water.

00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:52.080 align:middle line:84%
It destroys the
surface of the planet

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:56.170 align:middle line:84%
and leaves scars behind
that take centuries to fix.

00:38:56.170 --> 00:38:58.510 align:middle line:84%
But because we're going to
have really smart people that

00:38:58.510 --> 00:38:59.968 align:middle line:84%
know how to fix
this thing, they're

00:38:59.968 --> 00:39:04.350 align:middle line:84%
going to fix it a lot
quicker, because we can.

00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:06.690 align:middle line:84%
No longer mining,
especially coal.

00:39:06.690 --> 00:39:10.640 align:middle line:84%
Why would we want to mine
coal to burn the coal

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:13.700 align:middle line:84%
to boil the water
to create steam

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:17.500 align:middle line:84%
that drives the hydroturbines
that gives us electricity?

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.380 align:middle line:90%
I mean that's-- really?

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:21.850 align:middle line:84%
We've got free electricity
coming out of our ears,

00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:23.970 align:middle line:84%
or we've got hydroturbines
in the rivers

00:39:23.970 --> 00:39:27.830 align:middle line:84%
if you really need to
use existing technology,

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:33.070 align:middle line:84%
tried and tested technology,
we don't need to burn coal.

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:37.430 align:middle line:84%
So that stops, and the
desecration of our planet

00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:38.640 align:middle line:90%
will stop.

00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:41.270 align:middle line:90%
So we no longer have this.

00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:44.230 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I would like
to suggest that all mining

00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:45.530 align:middle line:90%
activity is going to stop.

00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:49.690 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to mine anything,
because our scientists

00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:51.680 align:middle line:84%
and our inventors
will be inventing

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:55.720 align:middle line:84%
new kinds of materials that
are infinitely stronger, more

00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:59.430 align:middle line:84%
durable, and
biodegradable, and lighter,

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:01.380 align:middle line:84%
and are actually
created and made

00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:04.090 align:middle line:84%
for a specific purpose
that actually serves

00:40:04.090 --> 00:40:08.360 align:middle line:84%
that purpose for which it needs
to be applied and implemented.

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:10.840 align:middle line:84%
Especially gold, I mean, the
whole thing with gold, right?

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:12.670 align:middle line:84%
We're not even going
to go into that,

00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:15.720 align:middle line:84%
because the history of gold is
that murky origins of humankind

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:18.790 align:middle line:84%
and our obsession with
gold and why gold even ever

00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:22.900 align:middle line:84%
became this obsession, because
it doesn't make any sense.

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, the
pollution of our planet

00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:26.840 align:middle line:90%
comes to an immediate stop.

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:31.300 align:middle line:84%
All this changes virtually
overnight once we remove money

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:32.100 align:middle line:90%
from the system.

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:34.610 align:middle line:90%


00:40:34.610 --> 00:40:38.830 align:middle line:84%
Our needs for materials changes
completely, like I said.

00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:40.660 align:middle line:90%
What materials do we need?

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:43.350 align:middle line:84%
We will create whatever
materials we need,

00:40:43.350 --> 00:40:46.430 align:middle line:84%
because we no longer have
to sell stuff, remember.

00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:50.190 align:middle line:84%
Think about everything
that we go and buy today.

00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:55.310 align:middle line:84%
It's packaged in these
boxes with-- you open it up

00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:58.410 align:middle line:84%
and there's polystyrene and
plastic and more plastic

00:40:58.410 --> 00:41:01.510 align:middle line:84%
and booklets with
instructions and just

00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:middle line:84%
the waste and the pollution
we create is insane.

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:08.550 align:middle line:84%
None of that will
happen anymore.

00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:11.410 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to create
those materials for packaging

00:41:11.410 --> 00:41:15.820 align:middle line:84%
purposes so we can build the
crap that we can try and sell

00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:18.580 align:middle line:84%
to somebody, put it
in shiny metal boxes

00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:20.460 align:middle line:84%
and put it on the
shelf somewhere so

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:22.929 align:middle line:84%
some unsuspecting schmuck
walks into the shop

00:41:22.929 --> 00:41:24.720 align:middle line:84%
and sees it and says,
wow, that looks nice.

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:25.630 align:middle line:90%
I want to buy that.

00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:26.430 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:27.270 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:29.400 align:middle line:84%
All of that flies
right out the window.

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:31.150 align:middle line:84%
I haven't done this
for a while, actually,

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:33.050 align:middle line:84%
so here's an
interesting example.

00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:35.860 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at
nail clippers, right?

00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:37.180 align:middle line:90%
We all need nail clippers.

00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:41.150 align:middle line:84%
So how many nail clippers do
we need in the world, right?

00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:44.110 align:middle line:84%
Everybody bloody chemist
and travel shop you get to

00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:45.945 align:middle line:84%
has got hundreds of
nail clippers hanging,

00:41:45.945 --> 00:41:49.110 align:middle line:84%
and nail files, which
is such a bloody waste.

00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:50.700 align:middle line:90%
It's insane.

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:52.490 align:middle line:84%
How many nail clippers
do we need, right?

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:55.410 align:middle line:84%
So let's just make
the best nail clippers

00:41:55.410 --> 00:41:57.390 align:middle line:90%
that we can design and make.

00:41:57.390 --> 00:42:00.270 align:middle line:84%
And let's make three
types or a dozen types

00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:02.890 align:middle line:84%
and make as many nail
clippers as there

00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:05.930 align:middle line:84%
are people so everybody's got
a bloody set of nail clippers.

00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And then we don't need to hang
them in shops so that they hang

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:13.310 align:middle line:84%
there for some unsuspecting
person that suddenly

00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:18.550 align:middle line:84%
decides they need a new pair
of nail clippers, or computers.

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:20.770 align:middle line:84%
I think we've
mentioned this before.

00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:23.300 align:middle line:84%
How long will it take a
bunch of computer geeks

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:26.590 align:middle line:84%
to build a supercomputer
in one of our communities

00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:29.100 align:middle line:84%
when they have the best
facilities, the best

00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:30.540 align:middle line:90%
technology available to them.

00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And anything they need or
any components they need

00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:34.630 align:middle line:84%
will be made and
produced for them

00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:37.740 align:middle line:90%
to make that supercomputer.

00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:39.830 align:middle line:84%
I think that those
supercomputers already exist,

00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:40.659 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:42:40.659 --> 00:42:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And even if they don't exist,
because they haven't had access

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:46.020 align:middle line:84%
to the really good
components, it

00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:48.680 align:middle line:84%
might take them six months
or 12 months, whatever it is,

00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:52.070 align:middle line:84%
but very quickly we'll
have a supercomputer that

00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:54.820 align:middle line:84%
is going to be 1,000 years ahead
of the current computers we

00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:56.120 align:middle line:90%
have today.

00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:58.430 align:middle line:84%
So how many people
around the world

00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:01.260 align:middle line:84%
do you think are going to want
that supercomputer once we've

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:03.610 align:middle line:90%
created it in our little town?

00:43:03.610 --> 00:43:05.740 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine
the amount of money

00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:09.380 align:middle line:84%
that our town will make in
that first interim phase?

00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:11.890 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is going to
want our supercomputer.

00:43:11.890 --> 00:43:17.660 align:middle line:84%
The amount of money coming into
our little town will be insane.

00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:21.080 align:middle line:84%
We can't begin to try and
project how much money we're

00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:22.370 align:middle line:90%
going to be making.

00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:23.930 align:middle line:84%
But very quickly,
that money is going

00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:27.600 align:middle line:84%
to be absolutely
useless as we transition

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:31.290 align:middle line:84%
from a money-driven society to
where we no longer need money

00:43:31.290 --> 00:43:33.610 align:middle line:84%
and we start sharing
all this abundance

00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:35.100 align:middle line:90%
with all the other communities.

00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:36.810 align:middle line:84%
This is very important
because, remember,

00:43:36.810 --> 00:43:40.650 align:middle line:84%
there are places in the desert
that can't grow tropical fruit

00:43:40.650 --> 00:43:44.530 align:middle line:84%
or places up on the mountains
that can't grow tropical fruit

00:43:44.530 --> 00:43:45.660 align:middle line:90%
and vice versa.

00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:48.440 align:middle line:84%
So you can't always grow
things and do things

00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:49.690 align:middle line:90%
in certain parts of the world.

00:43:49.690 --> 00:43:53.090 align:middle line:84%
This is why we have to create
abundance in our community

00:43:53.090 --> 00:43:57.130 align:middle line:84%
so we can share it with those
that can't have or grow what it

00:43:57.130 --> 00:44:00.340 align:middle line:84%
is that we have and we
can create in our towns

00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:01.810 align:middle line:90%
or grow in our towns.

00:44:01.810 --> 00:44:04.780 align:middle line:84%
That's where the abundance
thing becomes very important,

00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:08.960 align:middle line:84%
for future sharing of this
abundance, not selling.

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:12.790 align:middle line:84%
So our needs for materials
will change dramatically.

00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:17.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, graphene is one of the
most spoken-about inventions.

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:21.130 align:middle line:84%
It's this very, very thin
carbon-based substance.

00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:24.040 align:middle line:84%
It's now the strongest and the
thinnest substance available.

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:25.200 align:middle line:90%
But now it's under patent.

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:28.120 align:middle line:84%
Somebody owns the
rights to make it.

00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:31.500 align:middle line:84%
So no, no one's going to
own the right to make it.

00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And everyone will have
access to graphene and blend

00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:38.920 align:middle line:84%
graphene with hemp or
whatever else, or silica,

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:41.410 align:middle line:84%
and make the best,
strongest substances that

00:44:41.410 --> 00:44:45.880 align:middle line:84%
conduct light or sound
or stores energy,

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:50.330 align:middle line:84%
technology that is driven by
materials that are specifically

00:44:50.330 --> 00:44:54.290 align:middle line:84%
made for the technology,
which today we can't afford.

00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:57.940 align:middle line:84%
There's not enough money,
not financially viable.

00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is how we keep
tripping ourselves up.

00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:05.640 align:middle line:84%
So the final consideration
in this sort of thought

00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:11.542 align:middle line:84%
is in this world of abundance
where everything is possible,

00:45:11.542 --> 00:45:13.000 align:middle line:84%
everything is
available, everything

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.560 align:middle line:84%
is created for whatever
it is we need to do,

00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:20.640 align:middle line:84%
everything we do and make
is recyclable, renewable,

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:21.930 align:middle line:90%
and reusable.

00:45:21.930 --> 00:45:24.940 align:middle line:84%
There is no
pollution whatsoever.

00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:28.750 align:middle line:84%
I find this interesting,
because this takes me back

00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:31.530 align:middle line:84%
to the research of the
ancient civilizations,

00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:33.650 align:middle line:84%
those guys that
used really advanced

00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:36.700 align:middle line:84%
silicon-based technology
that they left behind

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:39.750 align:middle line:84%
in the tools and artifacts
that we've been finding.

00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:41.800 align:middle line:90%
They didn't use money.

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is why
it's very difficult

00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:45.760 align:middle line:84%
to find evidence of
those civilizations,

00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:47.560 align:middle line:84%
of those people,
because if you don't

00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:50.560 align:middle line:84%
use money and everything
is recyclable, renewable,

00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:53.040 align:middle line:84%
and reusable, you don't
leave behind the mess

00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:54.760 align:middle line:90%
that we leave behind.

00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:57.990 align:middle line:84%
So to find evidence of
advanced civilizations

00:45:57.990 --> 00:46:00.130 align:middle line:84%
in the past becomes
very difficult.

00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:02.250 align:middle line:84%
We're going to leave
behind very little trace

00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:05.660 align:middle line:84%
and evidence of what
we do, because we

00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:07.790 align:middle line:90%
keep our place clean.

00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:10.630 align:middle line:90%
We don't create pollution.

00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's when we
start really living

00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:17.000 align:middle line:84%
in harmony with our own planet
and environment on every level.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
this is all about,

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:20.660 align:middle line:84%
moving into that higher
state of consciousness,

00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:23.670 align:middle line:84%
living in harmony not only with
the people in our communities,

00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:26.500 align:middle line:84%
but with our environment
and our planet,

00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:32.820 align:middle line:84%
Gaia as a whole, everything
in coherent, resonant harmony.

00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
state that we need

00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:37.010 align:middle line:84%
to achieve as
quickly as possible,

00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:40.520 align:middle line:84%
because the state of
dissonance and disease

00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:43.160 align:middle line:84%
destroying our planet,
destroying ourselves

00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:47.900 align:middle line:84%
in the process, we've hit
the wall, as Truman did

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:52.140 align:middle line:84%
in The Truman Show, when
he physically in his boat--

00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:55.690 align:middle line:84%
finally, remember he
overcomes-- he finally gets out

00:46:55.690 --> 00:47:00.240 align:middle line:84%
of the slave mentality and they
try everything to hold him back

00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:04.030 align:middle line:84%
with the water and the waves and
eventually he gets through it

00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:06.780 align:middle line:84%
and his boat literally
hits the wall.

00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And we use that expression,
right, I've hit the wall?

00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:12.650 align:middle line:84%
So I think humanity has
finally hit the wall.

00:47:12.650 --> 00:47:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
moment that we choose

00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:16.350 align:middle line:90%
to take another direction.

00:47:16.350 --> 00:47:19.930 align:middle line:84%
And I find this really,
really the most exciting thing

00:47:19.930 --> 00:47:21.370 align:middle line:90%
I could possibly think of.

00:47:21.370 --> 00:47:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And I trust many people feel
the same way around the world.

00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:27.050 align:middle line:84%
And this is why this philosophy
is growing on its own.

00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:29.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to try and
sell this to anybody.

00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:32.107 align:middle line:84%
And the reason you're here is
because you resonate with it

00:47:32.107 --> 00:47:33.230 align:middle line:90%
already.

00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:35.180 align:middle line:84%
And now hopefully you
understand how simple

00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:39.120 align:middle line:84%
it is to implement this, how
we've been lied to, how we've

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:41.030 align:middle line:84%
been tripping ourselves
up thinking that it's

00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:43.460 align:middle line:84%
going to be very difficult
and very hard to get out

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:44.370 align:middle line:90%
of this system.

00:47:44.370 --> 00:47:45.280 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:47.140 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot easier
and a lot simpler

00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:49.000 align:middle line:90%
to get out of this system.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:53.170 align:middle line:84%
So we've come out of
this one-hour episode.

00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to go into the
final hour in the next episode.

00:47:57.770 --> 00:47:59.970 align:middle line:84%
But before we do, are they
any comments or questions

00:47:59.970 --> 00:48:02.070 align:middle line:90%
anybody wants to raise?

00:48:02.070 --> 00:48:06.290 align:middle line:84%
>>My name is Brooks Remaley, and
I'm from the Dallas-Fort Worth

00:48:06.290 --> 00:48:07.220 align:middle line:90%
area.

00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:10.020 align:middle line:84%
Michael, I would like
to say, first of all,

00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:13.420 align:middle line:84%
thank you for the
opportunity to spend a couple

00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:15.310 align:middle line:90%
days with like-minded people.

00:48:15.310 --> 00:48:19.440 align:middle line:84%
I've made some
fantastic friends here.

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:21.450 align:middle line:84%
This has just been an
amazing experience,

00:48:21.450 --> 00:48:22.590 align:middle line:90%
so thank you very much.

00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:23.820 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you for being here.

00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:27.000 align:middle line:84%
>>So being from the
Dallas-Fort Worth area,

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.380 align:middle line:84%
I would like to eventually
maybe pass this on to some folks

00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:32.640 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And my question is,
do you have sort

00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:40.960 align:middle line:84%
of an outline or some
support for somebody who

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:42.540 align:middle line:90%
wants to do what you're doing?

00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:46.020 align:middle line:84%
I know you can't duplicate
yourself and be everywhere

00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:47.060 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:49.160 align:middle line:84%
But I want to do
this in my community

00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:53.990 align:middle line:90%
and inform people of this idea.

00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:57.300 align:middle line:84%
So my question is, do you
have something in place

00:48:57.300 --> 00:48:59.320 align:middle line:84%
where you have like
support and you

00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:02.256 align:middle line:84%
could guide me through doing
the same thing in my community?

00:49:02.256 --> 00:49:03.056 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:49:03.056 --> 00:49:03.856 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:49:03.856 --> 00:49:06.610 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for that
question, Brooks.

00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:12.480 align:middle line:84%
I do obviously need to
multiply this philosophy

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:13.590 align:middle line:90%
as widely as possible.

00:49:13.590 --> 00:49:17.890 align:middle line:84%
I can't be in all places all the
time, so I need as many people

00:49:17.890 --> 00:49:21.840 align:middle line:84%
out there to take this knowledge
on this kind of platform

00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:25.040 align:middle line:84%
in this way as
widely as possible.

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:30.320 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is that the
book is an instrument.

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:32.930 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot easier to give
somebody the book to read.

00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:35.090 align:middle line:84%
That's why I wrote
the book instead of me

00:49:35.090 --> 00:49:37.190 align:middle line:84%
having to sit and
talk people through it

00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:40.150 align:middle line:84%
for hours and hours on end,
say, well, read this book.

00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:42.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's a good starter,
a good starting point

00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:45.830 align:middle line:84%
for people to get into this
idea of thinking, oh, wow, OK.

00:49:45.830 --> 00:49:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Give them the background,
easy to read and digest.

00:49:49.290 --> 00:49:50.550 align:middle line:90%
But then it goes further.

00:49:50.550 --> 00:49:54.480 align:middle line:84%
Then it goes onto a one-to-one
and a personal contact

00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:58.570 align:middle line:84%
with people doing these kind
of meetings and meetup groups,

00:49:58.570 --> 00:50:04.830 align:middle line:84%
so the intention is that we
have an easy-to-watch shorter

00:50:04.830 --> 00:50:08.610 align:middle line:84%
version of kind of a workshop,
either on DVD or a flash drive

00:50:08.610 --> 00:50:12.010 align:middle line:84%
or downloadable from the
website that anybody anywhere

00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:14.990 align:middle line:84%
can get so it's
the same workshop

00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:16.750 align:middle line:84%
so people don't fill
in their own ideas.

00:50:16.750 --> 00:50:19.034 align:middle line:84%
What I've found is
that often people

00:50:19.034 --> 00:50:21.450 align:middle line:84%
get a sniff of this idea, they
read a little bit about it,

00:50:21.450 --> 00:50:23.432 align:middle line:84%
and they get the wrong
end of the stick.

00:50:23.432 --> 00:50:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And they run out there
and they try and promote

00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:27.223 align:middle line:84%
this Ubuntu philosophy,
but they're actually

00:50:27.223 --> 00:50:29.580 align:middle line:84%
promoting a very
different kind of idea

00:50:29.580 --> 00:50:32.030 align:middle line:84%
and then they get it all
wrong and they confuse people.

00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:34.200 align:middle line:84%
So what we've got to be
very careful about here

00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:36.640 align:middle line:84%
is that we stick to the
knitting and we keep

00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:38.640 align:middle line:90%
promoting the same philosophy.

00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:41.950 align:middle line:84%
So I think what I need to do is
create like a DVD or something

00:50:41.950 --> 00:50:44.240 align:middle line:84%
that we can make available
or download so it's

00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:46.150 align:middle line:84%
the same presentation
that everybody

00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:49.350 align:middle line:84%
gets the same steps
and the guidelines.

00:50:49.350 --> 00:50:51.560 align:middle line:84%
So everybody can then
take that and say, OK,

00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:52.874 align:middle line:90%
come to my house for a meeting.

00:50:52.874 --> 00:50:55.040 align:middle line:84%
We have a little group
gathering, talk about a world

00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:55.840 align:middle line:90%
without money.

00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:57.790 align:middle line:84%
You put this onto
your computer or TV.

00:50:57.790 --> 00:51:00.760 align:middle line:84%
You show everybody the DVD, so
everybody shows the same thing

00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:02.920 align:middle line:84%
and they don't put their
own ideology into it,

00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:05.390 align:middle line:84%
because that's what I
found was a mistake that I

00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:06.900 align:middle line:90%
made some time ago.

00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:09.590 align:middle line:84%
And it backfired
on us quite badly,

00:51:09.590 --> 00:51:11.600 align:middle line:84%
where I just assumed
people would get it.

00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:12.400 align:middle line:90%
But no.

00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:14.500 align:middle line:84%
It takes a little bit
of training and guidance

00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:17.430 align:middle line:84%
to really get to the core
understanding of this.

00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And we've been through two
days here in the studio,

00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:23.050 align:middle line:84%
and I think finally
now you have it

00:51:23.050 --> 00:51:25.760 align:middle line:84%
and it's a lot easier for you to
go and share this with others.

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:27.910 align:middle line:84%
But if you just spend an
hour or two with people,

00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:30.130 align:middle line:90%
often that's not enough.

00:51:30.130 --> 00:51:36.910 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to have to be
that focused workshop that's

00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:41.610 align:middle line:84%
available to everyone, that is
the same ethos and philosophy,

00:51:41.610 --> 00:51:43.850 align:middle line:90%
without diluting it.

00:51:43.850 --> 00:51:46.720 align:middle line:84%
But also what I
must say is that we

00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:49.140 align:middle line:84%
have a database on
the Ubuntu website

00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:51.240 align:middle line:90%
from people all over the world.

00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And the plan of
action is actually--

00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:56.780 align:middle line:84%
and again, because we have
so little support in admin

00:51:56.780 --> 00:52:00.780 align:middle line:90%
and IT support, it's been tough.

00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:02.610 align:middle line:90%
It's been tough going.

00:52:02.610 --> 00:52:04.875 align:middle line:84%
Some people think that we've
got this big organization

00:52:04.875 --> 00:52:05.750 align:middle line:90%
doing all this stuff.

00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:06.550 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:52:06.550 --> 00:52:07.469 align:middle line:90%
It's me.

00:52:07.469 --> 00:52:08.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing all this stuff.

00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:09.843 align:middle line:90%
I have to answer all the emails.

00:52:09.843 --> 00:52:11.404 align:middle line:84%
I have to deal with
all the people,

00:52:11.404 --> 00:52:13.070 align:middle line:84%
either they're happy
or unhappy with me.

00:52:13.070 --> 00:52:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And Louisa's been
supporting in many ways,

00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:21.090 align:middle line:84%
but she's sort of going on a
whole different energetic part

00:52:21.090 --> 00:52:25.680 align:middle line:84%
of this, not the hands-on
political community project

00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:26.480 align:middle line:90%
philosophy.

00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:30.100 align:middle line:84%
She's moving away into the
whole energetic shamanic working

00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:33.500 align:middle line:84%
of this philosophy, which is a
very important aspect of this.

00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:36.510 align:middle line:84%
We're holding the space
as best as we can.

00:52:36.510 --> 00:52:39.790 align:middle line:84%
But what I do have is
I've got a database

00:52:39.790 --> 00:52:41.420 align:middle line:90%
of people in every country.

00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:43.290 align:middle line:84%
In the USA we've
got a huge database

00:52:43.290 --> 00:52:44.950 align:middle line:90%
of people that have signed up.

00:52:44.950 --> 00:52:47.650 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is to connect
all those people together

00:52:47.650 --> 00:52:50.890 align:middle line:84%
and those in communities
in close proximity

00:52:50.890 --> 00:52:54.610 align:middle line:84%
start meeting up physically, not
just virtually on the internet.

00:52:54.610 --> 00:52:55.650 align:middle line:90%
That's not good enough.

00:52:55.650 --> 00:52:58.670 align:middle line:84%
You've got to actually share
physical energy with each other

00:52:58.670 --> 00:53:01.690 align:middle line:84%
and get to know each other
and share this knowledge

00:53:01.690 --> 00:53:04.380 align:middle line:84%
face to face where you can
actually hug the person

00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:06.390 align:middle line:84%
and know that it's a
real living, breathing

00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:09.070 align:middle line:84%
human being and
not a cyberbuddy.

00:53:09.070 --> 00:53:13.780 align:middle line:84%
That's been part of the
problem is that we can't just

00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:17.460 align:middle line:84%
depend on the internet
and Facebook and emails

00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:19.300 align:middle line:84%
to connect people
around the world.

00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:21.270 align:middle line:90%
It has to be physical contact.

00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:23.580 align:middle line:84%
I've just had that
experience in Austria.

00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:26.390 align:middle line:84%
I was in a
mind-blowing experience

00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:29.570 align:middle line:84%
where I came from
Turkey to Austria

00:53:29.570 --> 00:53:32.630 align:middle line:84%
and Gernot Gauper, who's setting
up the Ubuntu party in Austria

00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:34.896 align:middle line:84%
now, just set up three
meetings in Vienna,

00:53:34.896 --> 00:53:36.270 align:middle line:84%
in Graz, and in
Salzburg, where I

00:53:36.270 --> 00:53:40.850 align:middle line:84%
walked into rooms filled with
more than 100 people that just

00:53:40.850 --> 00:53:43.310 align:middle line:84%
want to embrace this
philosophy and start the Ubuntu

00:53:43.310 --> 00:53:44.440 align:middle line:90%
movement in Austria.

00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:45.880 align:middle line:90%
It blew my mind.

00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's the energetic
exchange that you need,

00:53:48.410 --> 00:53:50.900 align:middle line:84%
where people gather
with the same intent,

00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:54.270 align:middle line:84%
the same-- the intention
is already there.

00:53:54.270 --> 00:53:57.870 align:middle line:84%
So this is what I'd like to
help share and facilitate

00:53:57.870 --> 00:54:01.840 align:middle line:84%
by putting the people in
contact in their communities

00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:06.000 align:middle line:84%
so you can really then exchange
details and start meeting up.

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And I will do the best I can
to come and meet these groups

00:54:09.070 --> 00:54:12.330 align:middle line:84%
and have more of these kind
of face-to-face meetings

00:54:12.330 --> 00:54:15.800 align:middle line:84%
to maybe keep things
focused, because I've

00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:20.400 align:middle line:84%
seen how quickly things can
go off track very easily.

00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:22.790 align:middle line:90%
Let's wind up this episode.

00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:25.340 align:middle line:84%
It's the second-last
episode, and I look forward

00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:29.700 align:middle line:84%
to the final episode, where
we really unravel and answer

00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:31.100 align:middle line:90%
all the questions.

00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:32.920 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
really exciting part,

00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:34.900 align:middle line:84%
where I'd like each
and every one of you

00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:37.930 align:middle line:84%
to think about the
questions, the most difficult

00:54:37.930 --> 00:54:41.780 align:middle line:84%
and what you think is the most
insurmountable problem that we

00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:44.800 align:middle line:84%
may have in this world without
money and the communities.

00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And before we leave here and
finish these eight episodes,

00:54:48.910 --> 00:54:52.110 align:middle line:84%
I want us all to be
able to those questions

00:54:52.110 --> 00:54:55.350 align:middle line:84%
and know that we've
totally internalized this,

00:54:55.350 --> 00:54:57.020 align:middle line:84%
because until you've
internalized this

00:54:57.020 --> 00:54:59.420 align:middle line:84%
and you feel totally
comfortable with facing

00:54:59.420 --> 00:55:02.200 align:middle line:84%
any kind of question
from anyone in the world,

00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:04.220 align:middle line:90%
you have not yet embraced this.

00:55:04.220 --> 00:55:07.060 align:middle line:84%
You must not have any
fear from anyone thinking

00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:11.330 align:middle line:84%
that, oh, I hope he doesn't
ask me a difficult question.

00:55:11.330 --> 00:55:13.500 align:middle line:84%
Then you haven't
embraced it yet.

00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is where I'd like us
to leave with by the time we

00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:20.210 align:middle line:84%
finish these eight episodes,
knowing, being absolutely

00:55:20.210 --> 00:55:22.730 align:middle line:84%
confident no matter what
anyone throws at you,

00:55:22.730 --> 00:55:26.850 align:middle line:84%
that you feel in a position
of self-empowerment,

00:55:26.850 --> 00:55:29.880 align:middle line:84%
self-knowledge,
and self-resonating

00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:33.600 align:middle line:84%
with the simple philosophy that
you feel capable of handling

00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:34.770 align:middle line:90%
any kind of question.

00:55:34.770 --> 00:55:36.810 align:middle line:84%
So thanks for being
in the studio.

00:55:36.810 --> 00:55:40.380 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for being here
for this whole exercise.

00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:42.160 align:middle line:84%
We'll pick this up
in the final episode.

00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:42.960 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:45.485 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:45.485 --> 00:55:48.810 align:middle line:90%


00:55:48.810 --> 00:55:49.810 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for watching.

00:55:49.810 --> 00:55:51.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm Michael Tellinger.

00:55:51.870 --> 00:55:57.205 align:middle line:90%
