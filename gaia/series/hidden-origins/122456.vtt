00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:13.366 align:middle line:10%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:14.610 align:middle line:10%
>>Welcome back.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.510 align:middle line:10%
This is our third hour of
the Ubuntu Contributionism

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:18.310 align:middle line:10%
workshop.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.060 align:middle line:10%
And we continue
where we left off,

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.580 align:middle line:10%
with the wise words of
Wolfgang Goethe that

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.270 align:middle line:10%
said, "None are more enslaved
than those who falsely believe

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.210 align:middle line:10%
they are free."

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.450 align:middle line:84%
And the emphasis there was on
falsely-- because as we know,

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.680 align:middle line:84%
most of us live
under the illusion

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.370 align:middle line:84%
that we are free, when
everything around us

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.270 align:middle line:90%
is just tightening.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.220 align:middle line:84%
More and more laws
are being created

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.940 align:middle line:84%
every month, every
year, every week,

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.210 align:middle line:84%
that curb our rights
and our freedom.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.710 align:middle line:84%
These are the laws created by
the governments and the people

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.420 align:middle line:84%
we put into positions
of authority--

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.170 align:middle line:84%
our slaves, our
servants that are

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.650 align:middle line:90%
supposed to serve us, right?

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And these servants
are making laws

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.920 align:middle line:84%
that constantly curtail
and decrease our rights

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.980 align:middle line:90%
and our freedoms.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.560 align:middle line:84%
So something is
clearly wrong there,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.670 align:middle line:84%
and there's very little
we can do about it

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.604 align:middle line:90%
except create a new alternative.

00:01:10.604 --> 00:01:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
this is all about,

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.360 align:middle line:90%
is creating a new alternative.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.320 align:middle line:84%
And we were just talking
about closing bank accounts

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.540 align:middle line:90%
and keeping your money.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.810 align:middle line:84%
Cyprus was a great example--
how the banking system can just

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:24.990 align:middle line:90%
do what they want.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.370 align:middle line:84%
The banks just can
get away with crimes.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:28.980 align:middle line:90%
No one gets prosecuted.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.530 align:middle line:90%
Nobody sees the courtroom.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And they just keep doing
this, over and over again.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.010 align:middle line:84%
So what this false
belief of freedom does

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.650 align:middle line:84%
is, it has turned our planet
into a planet of brands,

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.420 align:middle line:84%
corporations, and where
people seek careers,

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.880 align:middle line:84%
where jobs are
promised to people.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.690 align:middle line:84%
Jobs means nothing more,
nothing less than being a slave.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.800 align:middle line:84%
Every time we hear a politician
talk about, oh, we're

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.240 align:middle line:84%
going to create a million more
jobs, all they're really saying

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.550 align:middle line:84%
is, we're going to create
a million more slaves.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.250 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're no
longer needed, you get

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.310 align:middle line:90%
kicked out on the street.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And then you're jobless
and homeless again,

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.420 align:middle line:84%
and you start looking
for another job.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.620 align:middle line:84%
So this is the illusion that
gets shoved in our face.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.800 align:middle line:84%
The banksters own
the corporations,

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.310 align:middle line:84%
and the corporations
rule the world.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.360 align:middle line:84%
That's what our
world has become.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.710 align:middle line:84%
It's incredible that
corporations have more rights

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.270 align:middle line:84%
than living, breathing
human beings.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.860 align:middle line:84%
That's what our entire
legal system has become.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.740 align:middle line:84%
That's what I learned in my
own trials and tribulations

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.030 align:middle line:84%
in the Supreme Court in South
Africa, in Johannesburg.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.250 align:middle line:84%
When I went up
against the banks,

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.317 align:middle line:84%
it becomes very obvious
to you that that's

00:02:45.317 --> 00:02:46.900 align:middle line:84%
all about the
corporations-- upholding

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.200 align:middle line:90%
the rights of the corporations.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.500 align:middle line:84%
Our courts have
got nothing to do

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.720 align:middle line:84%
with upholding the rights of
living, breathing human beings.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.470 align:middle line:84%
It's procedure, red tape,
bureaucracy, and making sure

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.760 align:middle line:90%
that corporations survive.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.410 align:middle line:84%
So when you try and move
from one country to another,

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.280 align:middle line:84%
just keep comparing the
rights between human beings

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.950 align:middle line:90%
and corporations.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.090 align:middle line:84%
If you try and move to
Australia or Germany, forget it.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.970 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- it's
virtually possible

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.980 align:middle line:84%
to move to another
country today.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:21.780 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.210 align:middle line:84%
Especially people trying
to move to the USA.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.165 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very
difficult to immigrate

00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:29.510 align:middle line:90%
or to move to another country.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.046 align:middle line:84%
There are so many restrictions,
and laws, and hurdles.

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:35.420 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to move your
company to another country--

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.300 align:middle line:90%
oh, my boy.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.760 align:middle line:90%
Of course, welcome.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.810 align:middle line:84%
Please move your company
into our country,

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.530 align:middle line:84%
because you're going to
create more slaves for us.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.630 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.210 align:middle line:84%
This is incredible,
how corporations

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.780 align:middle line:84%
can move across borders,
virtually overnight,

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.810 align:middle line:90%
but people can't do that.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.070 align:middle line:84%
Every time I get to a
border, especially when

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.110 align:middle line:84%
you're driving up to borders and
you pull up at the border post,

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.920 align:middle line:84%
and you sit there
waiting to cross.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.700 align:middle line:84%
And you see all
these cars lining up,

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.780 align:middle line:84%
and people crossing
and having to fill

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.800 align:middle line:84%
in all these papers,
and passports,

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.770 align:middle line:90%
and this stressful situation.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And then you look
out of the window

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.461 align:middle line:84%
and you see these
birds flying across,

00:04:16.461 --> 00:04:18.839 align:middle line:90%
from one side to the other.

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And you go, are
you getting them?

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.950 align:middle line:90%
They're crossing illegally, man.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.090 align:middle line:90%
Get that bird.

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.880 align:middle line:84%
It's like you
realize the insanity

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.790 align:middle line:84%
of this, these synthetic
lines drawn in the sand.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.290 align:middle line:84%
And we're not allowed
to cross them,

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.050 align:middle line:84%
when this is supposed
to be our planet.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.970 align:middle line:84%
What this really
points to is the fact

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.070 align:middle line:84%
that this thing called money
has infiltrated every crack

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.640 align:middle line:90%
and crevice of our existence.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And when people don't get
it, it's difficult for them

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.680 align:middle line:84%
to understand what it is that
we have to deal with, to free

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.570 align:middle line:90%
ourselves from the slavery.

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.130 align:middle line:84%
Again, like we discussed
before, until we

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.260 align:middle line:84%
deal with the issue
of money, we're

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.400 align:middle line:84%
never going to
solve the problems.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.350 align:middle line:84%
Every aspect of our lives--
from the first breath we take,

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.710 align:middle line:84%
until the last breath
we breathe out--

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.040 align:middle line:84%
even after you breathe
out your last breath,

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.340 align:middle line:90%
the money still controls you.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.480 align:middle line:84%
The bankers and the financial
institutions, the insurance

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.400 align:middle line:84%
companies, and the government--
you need death certificates.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.950 align:middle line:84%
You need this and that before
you can cremate somebody.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.450 align:middle line:84%
There has to be a
death certificate.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.340 align:middle line:84%
All these kind of certificates
and shuffling of papers,

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.930 align:middle line:84%
and you need money to
bury your dead these days.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.330 align:middle line:84%
We can't even bury our
loved ones with dignity

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.020 align:middle line:84%
without the governments and
corporations getting involved.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.620 align:middle line:84%
It's a complete insanity,
how this has been distorted.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:49.200 align:middle line:84%
This thing of believing that we
are free needs to be addressed.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.170 align:middle line:84%
And the people that still run
around saying that-- I'm free,

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:56.930 align:middle line:84%
I can do what I want-- live in
a complete and utter illusion.

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:04.010 align:middle line:84%
This was one of my favorite
images from Occupy Wall Street.

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.490 align:middle line:84%
When the food runs
out, we can just

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:12.640 align:middle line:84%
go and eat the fat bankers--
emphasis on fat bankers.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.820 align:middle line:84%
But again, we've got to stop
pointing fingers, like we said.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:22.160 align:middle line:84%
We've got to really thank these
banking institutions and some

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.850 align:middle line:84%
of the ignorant politicians
for showing us the way,

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.600 align:middle line:84%
that this is not what
we want to be doing.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.420 align:middle line:90%
This is not how we want to live.

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:32.370 align:middle line:84%
I recently had
spent an afternoon

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.420 align:middle line:84%
with the CEO of one of
the four major banks

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.670 align:middle line:84%
in South Africa, who
happens to be the neighbor

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:37.980 align:middle line:90%
of a good friend of mine.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.150 align:middle line:84%
So my friend Dave said, hey,
let me invite so-and-so.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:42.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
mention names, too.

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:47.130 align:middle line:84%
And we got together and watched
some rugby over some beers,

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:47.930 align:middle line:90%
in the afternoon.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.535 align:middle line:84%
And he had no idea who
I was and what I did.

00:06:50.535 --> 00:06:52.410 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know that two
months prior to that,

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:54.520 align:middle line:84%
I was petitioning
outside his bank

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.710 align:middle line:84%
with the march against the
banks, calling him a coward

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.820 align:middle line:84%
and calling him to come
outside and face the crowd.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And he never came
outside, obviously.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:07.710 align:middle line:84%
They sent people to receive
the petitions, and so forth.

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:12.110 align:middle line:84%
So nevertheless,
what that taught me,

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:14.290 align:middle line:84%
however, is that even
the CEO of a bank

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:16.590 align:middle line:90%
has no idea how things work.

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:18.770 align:middle line:84%
Because I asked him, how
did you get this job?

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:20.650 align:middle line:84%
How did you land up
in this position?

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:23.470 align:middle line:84%
And he was the CEO of a
major financial institution,

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:28.500 align:middle line:84%
like KPMG or one of these big
financial accounting firms.

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.415 align:middle line:84%
And those guys have
got no clue how money

00:07:30.415 --> 00:07:31.540 align:middle line:90%
works, where it comes from.

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.760 align:middle line:84%
They just know how to
shuffle numbers and push

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:35.810 align:middle line:90%
pieces of paper around.

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:41.220 align:middle line:84%
So that's how they headhunt
CEOs and senior management

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.930 align:middle line:84%
for banks, these days--
people with huge egos, people

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.430 align:middle line:84%
who believe they're doing an
important job because they know

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:47.910 align:middle line:90%
how to control and manage money.

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:50.510 align:middle line:84%
But they actually have no
idea how money is created,

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:53.490 align:middle line:84%
where it comes
from, how it works.

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:55.740 align:middle line:84%
They just know the
rules and regulations

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.245 align:middle line:84%
that they were taught at
school, at accounting school,

00:07:58.245 --> 00:08:01.365 align:middle line:84%
or economic school, of
Bachelor of Commerce school,

00:08:01.365 --> 00:08:06.040 align:middle line:84%
or all these accounting
and financial degrees that

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:10.410 align:middle line:84%
have been created to create
a whole new generation

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:13.740 align:middle line:84%
of brainwashed people that
believe they're doing something

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.610 align:middle line:90%
good for society.

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:18.660 align:middle line:84%
So I realized that this poor
guy was just doing a job,

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:23.080 align:middle line:84%
and that my anger or
frustration at him

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.290 align:middle line:90%
was completely misplaced.

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And it was a big wake-up
call for me, as well.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And so most of the people
in the corporations that we

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:38.530 align:middle line:84%
hold accountable for making our
lives miserable-- politicians

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:42.080 align:middle line:84%
included-- most of them
are completely clueless how

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.130 align:middle line:90%
things actually work.

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And many people in
politics actually

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:47.220 align:middle line:84%
go into politics
believing-- because they

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.660 align:middle line:84%
want to do something good,
just like people that join

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:50.924 align:middle line:90%
the police force or the army.

00:08:50.924 --> 00:08:53.090 align:middle line:84%
They believe they're going
to come and go and defend

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:56.940 align:middle line:84%
their country, or fight
evil, or protect the people

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:58.704 align:middle line:90%
against criminals and so forth.

00:08:58.704 --> 00:09:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And then they get
trapped in the system,

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:02.980 align:middle line:84%
and they have to abide and
follow rules, and follow

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:04.355 align:middle line:90%
protocol and procedure.

00:09:04.355 --> 00:09:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And if they don't,
then they get fired.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And then they start
fearing losing their job

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:13.540 align:middle line:84%
and protecting their
families, so they just

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:17.210 align:middle line:84%
follow orders and follow
rules, and irrespective of

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:18.710 align:middle line:84%
whether they know
that it's actually

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:24.620 align:middle line:84%
harming their neighbors or
the members of their society.

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:27.270 align:middle line:84%
So the historic
resistance to money

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:29.740 align:middle line:90%
goes back thousands of years.

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.690 align:middle line:90%
It's not something new.

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:35.820 align:middle line:84%
Just a few examples of what
happened in the past-- Julius

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:39.260 align:middle line:84%
Caesar, in 48 BC,
he did exactly that.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.422 align:middle line:90%
He did what JFK did.

00:09:40.422 --> 00:09:41.630 align:middle line:90%
He did what Adolf Hitler did.

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:46.410 align:middle line:84%
He did what a lot of more recent
politicians and leaders did.

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:50.700 align:middle line:84%
He took away the right from the
money changers to coin money,

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:53.250 align:middle line:84%
and he minted coins for
the benefit of all--

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:56.380 align:middle line:84%
and with this state bank,
if you want to call it that,

00:09:56.380 --> 00:10:00.190 align:middle line:84%
created public works and made
Rome a very powerful state.

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:02.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, the bankers didn't
like that, just the way

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.971 align:middle line:84%
they didn't like what JFK did
or what Abraham Lincoln did.

00:10:05.971 --> 00:10:08.470 align:middle line:84%
They didn't like it, and you
know what the consequences are,

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:12.150 align:middle line:90%
and what the consequences were.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:14.390 align:middle line:84%
We all know what happened
to Julius Caesar.

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And that was pretty much the
fall of the Roman Empire,

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:19.920 align:middle line:90%
after that.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.520 align:middle line:10%
It started to go into demise

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:25.310 align:middle line:10%
This is a very
interesting one-- 1225,

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:28.960 align:middle line:10%
St Thomas Aquinas said that
the charging of interest

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.620 align:middle line:10%
is wrong, because it applies
to double-charging-- charging

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:35.580 align:middle line:10%
for both the money and
the use of the money.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.140 align:middle line:10%
And the church law
in the Middle Ages,

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:41.530 align:middle line:10%
Europe, forbade the charging
of interest on loans,

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:44.750 align:middle line:10%
and even made it a
crime called usury.

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:48.550 align:middle line:84%
So it's really interesting to
see how the church got involved

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:50.890 align:middle line:84%
in the issuing and
the use of money,

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:52.660 align:middle line:90%
at that period of our history.

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:56.450 align:middle line:84%
And then this very
popular character,

00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:59.780 align:middle line:84%
Jesus, or Jeshua, or
Issa-- several names

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:01.430 align:middle line:90%
by which he was known.

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:05.310 align:middle line:84%
Whoever this particular
individual may have been,

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:08.410 align:middle line:84%
and whatever he means to
many people around the world,

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:11.910 align:middle line:84%
one of the famous incidents
is when he apparently

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:15.070 align:middle line:84%
chased out the bankers or the
money changers from the temple.

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:19.660 align:middle line:84%
One of the few moments, or
periods, or events of his life

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:22.130 align:middle line:84%
where he probably showed
violence or became violent

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:23.500 align:middle line:90%
with other individuals.

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.730 align:middle line:90%
It was with the bankers.

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And think about what
we read in here.

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:29.320 align:middle line:90%
Read between the lines.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.280 align:middle line:84%
The bankers in the
temple-- because this

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:35.820 align:middle line:84%
is really, really significant--
the bankers in the temple,

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.280 align:middle line:84%
and this goes back
thousands of years,

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:42.260 align:middle line:84%
that the original bankers were
actually the royal priests

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:43.270 align:middle line:90%
and the kings.

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And the first banks
were their temples.

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:50.350 align:middle line:84%
But I'll go into
that in more detail.

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:52.170 align:middle line:84%
This here, for
the United States,

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:54.990 align:middle line:84%
especially, is
really significant.

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:57.430 align:middle line:84%
Thomas Jefferson-- one
of the founding fathers--

00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:00.000 align:middle line:84%
said at that stage,
already, that, "I

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.420 align:middle line:84%
believe that banking
institutions are

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:05.780 align:middle line:84%
more dangerous to our
liberties than standing armies.

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:09.070 align:middle line:84%
If the American people
ever allow private banks,"

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:11.830 align:middle line:90%
private banks, not state banks.

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:14.240 align:middle line:84%
Private banks,
right? "Private banks

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.780 align:middle line:84%
to control the issue
of their currency,

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:19.700 align:middle line:84%
first by inflation,
then by deflation,

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:22.020 align:middle line:84%
the banks and the
corporations that will grow up

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:25.510 align:middle line:84%
around the banks will deprive
the people of all property

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:28.910 align:middle line:84%
until their children wake
up homeless on the continent

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:30.570 align:middle line:90%
their fathers conquered."

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:33.170 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly
what has happened.

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:35.730 align:middle line:84%
Private banks
muscled their way in,

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:38.600 align:middle line:84%
and the War of Independence
here in the United States

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.940 align:middle line:84%
was all about the control of
the money, the implementation

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:44.700 align:middle line:84%
of the private Rothschild
banking system,

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.550 align:middle line:84%
against the State
Bank that created

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:49.300 align:middle line:84%
abundance for the
people, and prosperity

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.730 align:middle line:84%
for the people of
the United States.

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:54.090 align:middle line:84%
This is really an
important statement

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:58.340 align:middle line:84%
in the history of
modern Western world.

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:03.280 align:middle line:10%
And then JFK, 1963-- seven
days before his assassination.

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:07.070 align:middle line:10%
"There's a plot in this country
to enslave every man, woman,

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:08.010 align:middle line:10%
and child.

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:09.990 align:middle line:10%
Before I leave this
high and noble office,

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:12.190 align:middle line:10%
I intend to expose this plot."

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:13.090 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:16.540 align:middle line:84%
But just prior to this,
what he did-- he actually

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:19.490 align:middle line:84%
issued what became known
as the United States

00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:22.690 align:middle line:84%
notes, where he stopped
the Fed from printing money

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:26.840 align:middle line:84%
and started printing money for
the people, by the people--

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.810 align:middle line:84%
in essence, if you
can call it that.

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And that pretty much, I believe,
led to his assassination.

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.746 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the bankers
are behind all the wars.

00:13:34.746 --> 00:13:36.120 align:middle line:84%
They are behind
all the conflict.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.390 align:middle line:84%
They're behind the invasions,
bringing down governments.

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:45.520 align:middle line:84%
This is a very obvious plan
of action by the bankers--

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.970 align:middle line:84%
the global elite that
control the supply of money,

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:49.680 align:middle line:90%
that control our governments.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.940 align:middle line:10%
So when President J.F.
Kennedy wrote and signed

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:57.360 align:middle line:10%
the executive order 11110
on the 4th of June, 1963,

00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:00.930 align:middle line:10%
which ordered the US Treasury
to issue a new public currency,

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:03.480 align:middle line:10%
the United States
note, he essentially

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.690 align:middle line:10%
signed his own death warrant.

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:08.460 align:middle line:10%
And six months later, he
was assassinated in Dallas.

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:11.620 align:middle line:84%
This is how these
banking families do it.

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:14.920 align:middle line:84%
I might as well tell you right
now, if you don't know it yet,

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:20.060 align:middle line:84%
the global financial institution
is the largest organized crime

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:22.390 align:middle line:90%
syndicate in the world.

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:23.735 align:middle line:90%
It's really as simple as that.

00:14:23.735 --> 00:14:25.360 align:middle line:84%
But they get away
with it, because they

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.840 align:middle line:90%
control the governments.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:28.112 align:middle line:90%
They make the laws.

00:14:28.112 --> 00:14:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And they issue the money
that control the governments

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.810 align:middle line:90%
and can control the judiciary.

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:37.850 align:middle line:84%
This is the United States
note that was not the Federal

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:40.590 align:middle line:90%
Reserve note-- big difference.

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:43.970 align:middle line:84%
About four billion of these
notes went into circulation.

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:45.950 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately,
JFK paid the price.

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:48.257 align:middle line:84%
Now, I believe that if he
was more vocal about it,

00:14:48.257 --> 00:14:50.590 align:middle line:84%
if he was telling the American
people what he was doing,

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:52.510 align:middle line:84%
everybody would have
stood behind him.

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:54.270 align:middle line:90%
But it was pretty much a secret.

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:55.860 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knew about it.

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:58.560 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knew the
difference, at that stage.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.289 align:middle line:90%
People were just oblivious.

00:15:00.289 --> 00:15:01.830 align:middle line:84%
If you went out and
said, we're going

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:04.045 align:middle line:84%
to issue our own money-- we're
going to shut down the Fed

00:15:04.045 --> 00:15:05.160 align:middle line:84%
and issue our own
money-- he would

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.690 align:middle line:90%
have had everybody on his side.

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:10.250 align:middle line:84%
That would not have necessarily
prevented the assassination,

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:13.360 align:middle line:84%
but it would have made
it a lot more obvious.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And people would not think that
it was some crazy guy called

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:18.920 align:middle line:90%
Lee Harvey Oswald, right?

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:25.090 align:middle line:84%
A lone gunman with a magic gun,
and all that hogwash that had

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:26.880 align:middle line:90%
been shoved down our throats.

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:30.230 align:middle line:84%
So this whole thing about money
is really fascinating when

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:33.390 align:middle line:84%
you start asking, well, where
does money actually come from?

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:36.620 align:middle line:84%
This is where most people's
knowledge and information

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.580 align:middle line:90%
hits the wall.

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:41.450 align:middle line:84%
Very few people actually
have any clue or idea

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:43.830 align:middle line:90%
where money really comes from.

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:47.630 align:middle line:84%
This is a huge,
huge wake-up call.

00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:51.700 align:middle line:84%
So the origins of money-- when
and how did it get so bad?

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:53.630 align:middle line:84%
What was the first
money created?

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:56.120 align:middle line:84%
How did it come into
existence and creation?

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:59.470 align:middle line:84%
And this really
challenges our knowledge

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:03.840 align:middle line:84%
about origins of humankind and
the really murky and mysterious

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:06.260 align:middle line:84%
history that we face
as the human race.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And the critical information
about the origins of money

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:13.450 align:middle line:84%
comes to us from the Sumerian
texts, the Sumerian tablets,

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:15.800 align:middle line:84%
and especially
these two here, that

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.790 align:middle line:90%
are known as the King's Lists.

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:20.360 align:middle line:84%
They give us a lot of
information about the earliest

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:25.440 align:middle line:84%
kings, the first kings, and
the control of the world

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.890 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of other information.

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:31.560 align:middle line:84%
But it, in essence, tells
us about a time when kingdom

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:33.370 align:middle line:84%
was lowered to
Earth from heaven,

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:36.280 align:middle line:84%
and the first kings
and priest kings

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.090 align:middle line:90%
were appointed by the gods.

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:41.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, what this was and
who these gods were

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:43.180 align:middle line:84%
is a whole other
debate, so we're not

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:44.570 align:middle line:90%
going to dwell on that.

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:47.090 align:middle line:84%
But basically, this
tells us that there

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:50.410 align:middle line:84%
was a time in history-- and
the Sumerian texts, as we know,

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:54.590 align:middle line:84%
still remain the oldest written
record of human history.

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And there are millions
of clay tablets,

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:59.680 align:middle line:84%
and hundreds of thousands
have been translated.

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And they all tell
us the same stories,

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:04.030 align:middle line:84%
or they give us a
lot of information.

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:08.079 align:middle line:84%
But there's a recurring
story about these gods

00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:10.630 align:middle line:84%
that were causing
havoc on planet Earth,

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:13.619 align:middle line:84%
and especially in
the land of Sumer,

00:17:13.619 --> 00:17:16.270 align:middle line:84%
and interacting with
the Sumerian people.

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:19.569 align:middle line:84%
And it tells us that
there was a time

00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:22.920 align:middle line:84%
that the royal bloodline
suddenly emerged on Earth,

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:26.579 align:middle line:84%
and that these priest kings,
these first priest kings,

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:31.980 align:middle line:84%
were actually appointed and took
on this role and the control

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:32.780 align:middle line:90%
of humanity.

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:36.060 align:middle line:84%
So the first priest kings
were appointed by the gods,

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:37.940 align:middle line:84%
and we suddenly
see the appearance

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:39.990 align:middle line:84%
of the royal
political bloodlines.

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:41.950 align:middle line:84%
This goes back,
thousands of years back.

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And these elite bloodlines
took control of the world.

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly,
they had all this money

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:51.510 align:middle line:90%
and they owned all the land.

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:53.875 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea of
royalty and where

00:17:53.875 --> 00:17:57.650 align:middle line:84%
do kings and royalty comes
from, is a great mystery.

00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:59.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Sumerian texts
tell us very clearly

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:01.640 align:middle line:84%
where the royal
bloodlines come from,

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.430 align:middle line:84%
and that they were given
fierce weapons, and knowledge

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:07.460 align:middle line:84%
of alchemy, and weaponry,
and sorcery, or whatever,

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:09.710 align:middle line:84%
with which to
control the people.

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, they must
have had serious knowledge

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:16.427 align:middle line:84%
of this advanced technology,
in those days, because they

00:18:16.427 --> 00:18:18.010 align:middle line:84%
did control the
people, and the people

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:19.860 align:middle line:84%
feared them and they
feared for their lives.

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:22.470 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, they would
have never obeyed them.

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:25.240 align:middle line:84%
So this is the origins
of the royal bloodlines.

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And these are the guys that have
passed down the royal bloodline

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:31.750 align:middle line:90%
control for thousands of years.

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And the banking
families are part

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:36.510 align:middle line:84%
of this ancient royal
bloodline, that run and control

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:37.880 align:middle line:90%
the world today.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:41.290 align:middle line:84%
Real estate-- we use the
word in English, real estate.

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:43.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, in French it's a
much better description--

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:44.650 align:middle line:90%
real, royale.

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:45.940 align:middle line:90%
Royal estate.

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:50.090 align:middle line:84%
It belongs to the
royalty-- royal estate.

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:54.150 align:middle line:90%
In English it loses its meaning.

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:55.939 align:middle line:84%
So the origins of
money-- this is

00:18:55.939 --> 00:18:58.480 align:middle line:84%
one of the oldest forms of money
that I've been able to find,

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:02.220 align:middle line:84%
and it comes in the
form of a clay tablet.

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:07.770 align:middle line:84%
It's probably the oldest bill of
exchange that we have on record

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:11.740 align:middle line:84%
today-- a 4,000-year-old
bill of exchange.

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:13.540 align:middle line:84%
What this tells us
is the banks have

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:17.060 align:middle line:84%
been doing the same thing
for at least 4,000 years--

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:21.330 align:middle line:84%
creating bills of exchange,
making money out of nothing,

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:25.830 align:middle line:84%
fresh air-- just taking a piece
of clay, stamping some letters

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:26.630 align:middle line:90%
on it.

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:29.010 align:middle line:84%
Because remember, in
the ancient times,

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:30.900 align:middle line:90%
people didn't know how to write.

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:32.500 align:middle line:84%
Only the royalty
knew how to write.

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:33.500 align:middle line:90%
They had scribes.

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:35.590 align:middle line:84%
Only written material
ever came out

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:38.714 align:middle line:84%
of the royal palaces and the
temples, with the scribes.

00:19:38.714 --> 00:19:40.630 align:middle line:84%
The average people didn't
know how to do that.

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:43.850 align:middle line:84%
So they couldn't even read,
and they could be lied to

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:45.300 align:middle line:90%
and manipulated.

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:48.690 align:middle line:84%
So this is how far back
this control of money goes.

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:51.980 align:middle line:84%
It's a spectacular awakening
when we start seeing this.

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:56.960 align:middle line:84%
With a sleight of hand,
oh, this is very important.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.460 align:middle line:84%
As you see, this
piece of clay here,

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:02.810 align:middle line:84%
it's got the seal of the King,
the seal of the high priest,

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:04.470 align:middle line:90%
and the seal of whoever.

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:06.344 align:middle line:90%
And this is very important.

00:20:06.344 --> 00:20:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's the same
thing goes on today.

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:10.210 align:middle line:84%
At least in the
ancient times, they

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:12.520 align:middle line:84%
created the bills of
exchange out of clay.

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:16.000 align:middle line:84%
At least they can
survive a fire.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.650 align:middle line:84%
It gets preserved when it gets
exposed to fire-- you bake it,

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:21.080 align:middle line:90%
gets stronger.

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:23.710 align:middle line:84%
In today's pieces of
paper, they burn up

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:26.550 align:middle line:84%
and they disappear
into nothingness.

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:28.704 align:middle line:84%
Today, our banks
do the same thing.

00:20:28.704 --> 00:20:30.120 align:middle line:84%
They take an empty
piece of paper.

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:32.350 align:middle line:84%
They write a bunch
of fancy stuff on it,

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:35.280 align:middle line:84%
a bunch of nonsense, put some
fancy logos and stamps on it,

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:38.090 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly an empty piece
of paper is worth $20 billion.

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:40.920 align:middle line:90%
Wow, that's magic.

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
how they do it.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:47.180 align:middle line:84%
So this is very important
for us to digest.

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:51.940 align:middle line:84%
Money was maliciously introduced
as a tool of enslavement.

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:54.890 align:middle line:84%
This seems to be the
moment that this happened,

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:58.810 align:middle line:84%
in these ancient times-- when
the first royal bloodlines were

00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:01.640 align:middle line:84%
introduced, when these
first priest-kings suddenly

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:04.740 align:middle line:84%
appear and control the
planet, control the world,

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:07.410 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly have these
temples filled of money,

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:11.360 align:middle line:84%
or the ability to create money
and control all the land.

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And the people had
to work for the kings

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:17.090 align:middle line:84%
and earn money so they could
pay taxes to the kings,

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:20.130 align:middle line:84%
because suddenly the
kings owned all the land.

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:25.020 align:middle line:84%
So this is the one point
that people will probably

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:28.320 align:middle line:84%
argue with you, when they first
come across this information,

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:32.280 align:middle line:84%
because most of us are
under the misconception

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.870 align:middle line:84%
that money is a
consequence of thousands

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:36.650 align:middle line:90%
of years of barter and trade.

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:38.020 align:middle line:90%
And that is a lie.

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:40.600 align:middle line:90%
That is not true.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.990 align:middle line:84%
Money was maliciously introduced
as a tool of enslavement.

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:48.220 align:middle line:84%
That is its only pure
intent, is to enslave people.

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:50.660 align:middle line:84%
Instead of having
chains and whips,

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:52.390 align:middle line:90%
you have a thing called money.

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:55.820 align:middle line:84%
That becomes the
tool of enslavement.

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And I mentioned
previously that the most

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:01.760 align:middle line:84%
recent archaeological
discoveries and the conclusions

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:07.380 align:middle line:84%
actually support exactly this--
that people in ancient towns,

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:09.380 align:middle line:84%
and ancient cultures,
and ancient villagers

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:11.340 align:middle line:90%
did not barter and trade.

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:14.550 align:middle line:84%
They lived in harmonious
Ubuntu kind of communities,

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:17.290 align:middle line:84%
where they shared everything,
where they created abundance

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:19.090 align:middle line:90%
for everyone in the community.

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:22.090 align:middle line:84%
The bartering and trading
was a slow development,

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:24.630 align:middle line:84%
and a consequence of people
moving around and traveling

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:28.140 align:middle line:84%
and then spending the
night, being looked after,

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:31.220 align:middle line:84%
and giving being given food
and shelter for the night,

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:34.860 align:middle line:84%
and then feeling--
out of gratitude,

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:38.180 align:middle line:84%
leaving behind a horse
or something of value

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:40.930 align:middle line:84%
that they felt had
value to the people

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:42.740 align:middle line:90%
that offered them hospitality.

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:48.020 align:middle line:84%
So money did not evolve
out of barter and trade.

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:50.100 align:middle line:84%
The first kings
owned all the land.

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:53.150 align:middle line:84%
They were the first
bankers, and the temples

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:55.100 align:middle line:90%
were the first banks.

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:59.000 align:middle line:84%
So this is where we
find the global elite

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.850 align:middle line:84%
and the rise of the central
banks-- the global control.

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:07.060 align:middle line:84%
Some people, some researchers,
call it the Babylonian Magic

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:08.990 align:middle line:90%
Money Slavery System.

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:12.640 align:middle line:84%
It was created exactly for
that purpose-- somehow imbued

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:15.580 align:middle line:84%
with some sort of black
magic that has turned people

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:18.490 align:middle line:90%
into mumbling idiots, often.

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:20.180 align:middle line:90%
Look what money does to people.

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:21.750 align:middle line:90%
It makes some people go crazy.

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:23.680 align:middle line:90%
It makes people commit murder.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:26.580 align:middle line:84%
It makes people kill their
families, kill their friends,

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:28.550 align:middle line:84%
kill their partners--
makes people

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:31.430 align:middle line:84%
commit horrendous crimes,
because of this thing called

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:32.830 align:middle line:90%
money.

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:34.760 align:middle line:90%
It's tainted with blood.

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we
need to get away from.

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:42.010 align:middle line:84%
So what do these central
private banks do?

00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:44.110 align:middle line:84%
Remember that they are
private corporations.

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:48.420 align:middle line:84%
These private corporations,
just like in ancient times,

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:50.450 align:middle line:90%
create money out of thin air.

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:52.430 align:middle line:10%
They have the exclusive
rights to do this.

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:55.620 align:middle line:10%
If you and I go
and create money,

00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:57.040 align:middle line:10%
it's called counterfeiting.

00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:57.840 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And we go to jail
for life for that.

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:05.010 align:middle line:84%
Wow, it's incredible how
they skew the legal system

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:06.710 align:middle line:84%
for the benefit
of those that have

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:09.020 align:middle line:90%
retained this exclusive right.

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:10.060 align:middle line:90%
We can't do that.

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:11.900 align:middle line:90%
And yet, we can.

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:14.230 align:middle line:84%
There are ways of creating
your own promissory notes.

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:17.420 align:middle line:84%
There are ways of doing it so
that it becomes a legal tender.

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:20.190 align:middle line:84%
But then you've got to know
a little bit more about it.

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:21.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
delve into this,

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:26.320 align:middle line:84%
or spend time on this in this
workshop because, in a way,

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:30.310 align:middle line:84%
it's playing back into the hands
of those that create the money.

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:32.570 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to use
their money or anything

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:35.650 align:middle line:84%
resembling their money-- any
form of trade or exchange.

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:37.130 align:middle line:90%
We need to move away from that.

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:39.370 align:middle line:84%
As long as we've got
pieces of paper or anything

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:40.810 align:middle line:84%
that we're sharing
and exchanging,

00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:43.660 align:middle line:84%
we have an opportunity
for somebody

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:47.560 align:middle line:84%
to abuse that and use it against
us, or against the people.

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:49.850 align:middle line:84%
Somebody is going to
devise a scheme, somehow,

00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:55.790 align:middle line:84%
to use those tools of
exchange against the people,

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:57.540 align:middle line:90%
for their own personal benefit.

00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:00.340 align:middle line:84%
That's, unfortunately,
what happens.

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:03.820 align:middle line:84%
Because it creates
that scarcity,

00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:07.216 align:middle line:84%
and demand, and
value, and that's

00:25:07.216 --> 00:25:08.340 align:middle line:90%
what we need to break down.

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:12.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's critical
to also recognize

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:15.950 align:middle line:84%
that these private corporations
called central banks that

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:19.010 align:middle line:84%
control the other
banks-- central banks is

00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:22.250 align:middle line:84%
like the Federal Reserve
System, Federal Reserve

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:28.020 align:middle line:84%
Bank in the USA-- these guys
control all the other banks.

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And there's this interesting
relationship between the banks

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:35.170 align:middle line:84%
that you go walk into
on the street, and then

00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:36.120 align:middle line:90%
the central banks.

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And they try and mask their
relationship very carefully.

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:43.360 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the entire
money banking system

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.350 align:middle line:90%
is a giant Ponzi scheme.

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:47.600 align:middle line:84%
It's layers and
layers of deception,

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:51.100 align:middle line:84%
to make it look very complicated
and very difficult to break

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:52.880 align:middle line:84%
through the veneer,
to really figure out,

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:53.810 align:middle line:90%
well, who's behind it?

00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:54.890 align:middle line:90%
Who's really in control?

00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:55.690 align:middle line:90%
Who owns who?

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:56.700 align:middle line:90%
Who owns what?

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:59.580 align:middle line:84%
Because it is so
deeply convoluted

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:03.580 align:middle line:84%
that it's very difficult to
really get to the root of who's

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:04.380 align:middle line:90%
really behind it.

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:05.890 align:middle line:84%
But what we know
is that there are

00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:08.110 align:middle line:84%
a number of banking
families that are behind all

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:09.360 align:middle line:90%
of this global control.

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:12.600 align:middle line:10%
The Rothschilds really sit
at the top of the pile,

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:15.500 align:middle line:10%
on the global banking control.

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:17.430 align:middle line:10%
The rest of you, you
know well by now,

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:20.400 align:middle line:10%
I'm sure, the Rockefellers,
the Morgans, the Carnegies,

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:23.290 align:middle line:10%
the Schiffs, the Harriman, the
Warburgs, the Vanderbilts--

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:26.800 align:middle line:10%
and there are a number of
other families in this pecking

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.870 align:middle line:10%
order that go from
the United States,

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:31.640 align:middle line:10%
to Europe, and to China,
right across the world.

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.660 align:middle line:90%
And these guys run the world.

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:35.910 align:middle line:90%
They control the world.

00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:37.770 align:middle line:84%
They own all of the
banks in the world--

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:39.930 align:middle line:84%
all the central banks
and all the other banks.

00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:42.840 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, somewhere, they
always have control.

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And the little banks that they
don't control, in essence,

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:48.380 align:middle line:84%
are really completely
ineffective.

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:49.690 align:middle line:90%
And they don't really matter.

00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:53.250 align:middle line:84%
They cannot-- they have no
impact on the greater scheme

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:55.740 align:middle line:84%
of things and the
control of the world.

00:26:55.740 --> 00:27:01.180 align:middle line:84%
So through these central
banks, like the Reserve Bank,

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:04.310 align:middle line:84%
the Federal Reserve in the
USA, the Bank of England,

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:06.850 align:middle line:84%
the South African Reserve Bank,
Reserve Bank of Australia,

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:11.220 align:middle line:84%
and so forth-- this is how
they control the governments.

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:12.960 align:middle line:90%
It's not the other way around.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.240 align:middle line:84%
The banks control
the governments.

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And this is a huge thing for
some people to get across.

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, when
you talk to people

00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:26.600 align:middle line:84%
about this, when you start
engaging people in this debate,

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:29.070 align:middle line:84%
this is generally a
good point of departure.

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:30.880 align:middle line:84%
Because first of
all, it's a shock

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:32.505 align:middle line:84%
to the system when
you tell people, oh,

00:27:32.505 --> 00:27:34.470 align:middle line:84%
did you know that the
Central Bank or the Fed

00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:35.734 align:middle line:90%
is a private company?

00:27:35.734 --> 00:27:37.150 align:middle line:84%
Some people are
not aware of this.

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:39.100 align:middle line:84%
They're still under
the misconception

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:42.100 align:middle line:84%
that the central bank
belongs to the government.

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:45.410 align:middle line:90%
No, it's the other way around.

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:48.620 align:middle line:10%
The central banks all around the
world control the governments

00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:51.820 align:middle line:10%
and they own all the other
financial institutions.

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:56.580 align:middle line:10%
The World Bank is controlled
by these central bankers.

00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:01.490 align:middle line:84%
The European Central Bank--
the European Central Banking

00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:05.080 align:middle line:84%
System, just to show
you how they control all

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:06.430 align:middle line:90%
the central banks of Europe.

00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And we get to the
International Monetary Fund--

00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:12.530 align:middle line:84%
all controlled by these
same banking families.

00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:17.200 align:middle line:84%
And then all the central banks
of the world are controlled,

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:24.750 align:middle line:84%
most of them, are controlled by
this mysterious place in Basel,

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:30.060 align:middle line:84%
Switzerland, called the Bank
of International Settlements.

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:32.870 align:middle line:84%
When you try and get
information on these things,

00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:34.580 align:middle line:90%
it's not that easy.

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:38.010 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's layers and layers of
deception-- smoke and mirrors,

00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:39.380 align:middle line:90%
wherever you go.

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:41.150 align:middle line:84%
You try and find
out who actually

00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:45.270 align:middle line:84%
owns-- who are the owners
of these central banks,

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:48.400 align:middle line:90%
and you never know.

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.600 align:middle line:90%
It's like a secret society.

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.610 align:middle line:84%
There is no document
anywhere that will show you

00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:53.680 align:middle line:90%
who these owners are.

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And this is how, often,
they confuse people.

00:28:56.870 --> 00:29:02.220 align:middle line:84%
So this BIS controls, as I
said, the Federal Reserve Bank.

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:04.930 align:middle line:10%
Here's a picture of
some of the agents

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:07.900 align:middle line:10%
who started the Federal
Reserve in 1913.

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:10.300 align:middle line:10%
You see that some of the names
that I mentioned earlier.

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:14.680 align:middle line:10%
And in the United States,
the Federal Reserve System

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:17.590 align:middle line:10%
has been broken up into,
interestingly enough,

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:20.030 align:middle line:10%
into 12 districts.

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:23.250 align:middle line:84%
They like to work with sacred
geometric numbers, right?

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:25.340 align:middle line:84%
Even these guys-- remember
what we said earlier,

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:26.140 align:middle line:90%
what we discussed.

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:29.170 align:middle line:84%
The guys are not in control
by accident, because they're

00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:30.140 align:middle line:90%
stupid or ignorant.

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:32.880 align:middle line:84%
They are in control because
they know how things work.

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.660 align:middle line:84%
They understand
the laws of nature.

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:36.190 align:middle line:90%
They understand sacred geometry.

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:38.110 align:middle line:84%
They understand
the flow of energy.

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:39.840 align:middle line:90%
This is why they're in control.

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.580 align:middle line:84%
This is why they've had
secret societies for thousands

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:45.430 align:middle line:84%
of years, holding onto this
ancient and occult knowledge,

00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:47.870 align:middle line:84%
with which they've controlled
humanity and controlled

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:48.670 align:middle line:90%
all of us.

00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:51.139 align:middle line:84%
But the cat's out
of the bag, now.

00:29:51.139 --> 00:29:53.180 align:middle line:84%
The knowledge and the
information are spread out,

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:56.230 align:middle line:84%
and we have been
fortunate enough

00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:58.410 align:middle line:84%
to share this
knowledge with millions

00:29:58.410 --> 00:29:59.550 align:middle line:90%
of people around the world.

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And this is why this
collapse of the system

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:03.190 align:middle line:90%
is happening on its own.

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:04.555 align:middle line:90%
There is not much we have to do.

00:30:04.555 --> 00:30:06.180 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to try
and bring it down.

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:08.290 align:middle line:90%
It's collapsing itself.

00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:10.780 align:middle line:84%
We just need to create
a new alternative,

00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:13.390 align:middle line:84%
so when this thing
collapses, we've

00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:16.280 align:middle line:84%
actually got another
path to walk already,

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:19.790 align:middle line:90%
because we're working on it.

00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:23.800 align:middle line:84%
Or while it's collapsing, we're
creating a new alternative.

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:27.060 align:middle line:84%
So before it collapses
we'll just-- they'll

00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:31.300 align:middle line:84%
be leaders that lead nobody, and
banks that have no customers,

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:35.860 align:middle line:84%
and presidents that
control nobody.

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:39.000 align:middle line:10%
So the Bank of
England-- and you just

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.600 align:middle line:10%
see all these grand buildings.

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:43.630 align:middle line:10%
It's amazing, these
huge, grand buildings

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:48.040 align:middle line:10%
that all resemble ancient
temples in Egypt and Sumer.

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:53.230 align:middle line:84%
You see the construction, and
even the South African Reserve

00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:55.960 align:middle line:84%
Bank-- you start looking
at these ominous buildings

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:58.910 align:middle line:84%
that they spend
billions of dollars,

00:30:58.910 --> 00:31:02.590 align:middle line:84%
or millions and hundreds of
millions of dollars putting up.

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:04.150 align:middle line:84%
If you notice how
banks have always

00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:07.000 align:middle line:84%
got the most biggest and
most advanced buildings

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.420 align:middle line:90%
and all the latest technology.

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:11.110 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And people are--
well, not everyone--

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:16.440 align:middle line:84%
but the majority
of the people still

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:19.520 align:middle line:84%
think that banks are places
where we go put our money.

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:21.450 align:middle line:90%
They work with our money.

00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:23.570 align:middle line:84%
So where would they be
getting all the money from,

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:25.028 align:middle line:84%
to build all these
fancy buildings,

00:31:25.028 --> 00:31:27.210 align:middle line:90%
if they were using our money?

00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:29.900 align:middle line:84%
That one little thought
should wake us all up.

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:31.440 align:middle line:84%
Whose money are
they using to build

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:34.150 align:middle line:90%
all these fancy buildings?

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:36.780 align:middle line:84%
They create money
out of thin air.

00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:38.160 align:middle line:90%
They can do anything.

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:40.370 align:middle line:84%
They can play that game
for as long as they want,

00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:43.020 align:middle line:84%
because they're in control
of creating that money out

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:44.560 align:middle line:90%
of thin air.

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:49.490 align:middle line:84%
The Reserve Bank of Australia,
Reserve Bank of India,

00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:53.800 align:middle line:84%
and so it goes, on and on--
the World Trade Organization,

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:55.920 align:middle line:84%
all controlled by
these banking families.

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.870 align:middle line:84%
And the other important
thing to realize,

00:31:57.870 --> 00:32:00.780 align:middle line:84%
that this global control
of the money system

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:03.130 align:middle line:84%
seems to be coming
from what is referred

00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:05.460 align:middle line:84%
to as the Trinity
of Global Control--

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:08.530 align:middle line:84%
the three independent states
within other countries.

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:11.120 align:middle line:10%
And that's-- the religious
state is the Vatican City.

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:13.950 align:middle line:84%
Finance is controlled
from the City of London.

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:17.450 align:middle line:84%
And the City of London is
not London, the London town.

00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:20.610 align:middle line:84%
It's this square mile
in the heart of London

00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:23.710 align:middle line:84%
that's known as the City of
London, an independent state

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:28.720 align:middle line:84%
with its own constitution,
with its own governance, which

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:32.910 align:middle line:84%
is not part of the
British-- or what we believe

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:35.270 align:middle line:90%
is the existing control system.

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:36.980 align:middle line:10%
And then Washington
DC-- so we've

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:40.410 align:middle line:10%
got the religious, the finance,
and the military headquarters

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:42.830 align:middle line:10%
of this global elite control.

00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:44.660 align:middle line:10%
What I find fascinating
is this picture--

00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:47.530 align:middle line:10%
they all have these
obelisks, again,

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:50.440 align:middle line:10%
bringing us back to the
ancient civilizations,

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:52.910 align:middle line:10%
reminding us that
they've inherited this

00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:56.990 align:middle line:10%
from the Sumerian times, when
those first priest-kings were

00:32:56.990 --> 00:33:00.030 align:middle line:10%
appointed and took control,
and that their temples were

00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:01.510 align:middle line:10%
the first banks.

00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:04.030 align:middle line:84%
These reminders all
over the place--

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:05.880 align:middle line:90%
this is how far back it goes.

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:07.880 align:middle line:84%
So when people
tell you that money

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:11.070 align:middle line:84%
is a consequence of thousands
of years of barter and trade,

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:14.800 align:middle line:84%
just shows how ignorant they
are or that they've just bought

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:18.210 align:middle line:84%
the lies and the deceptions
of our education system,

00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:20.950 align:middle line:84%
because that's what our
education system tells us.

00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:23.080 align:middle line:90%
And that is not true.

00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:24.500 align:middle line:84%
Those are the lies
and deceptions.

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:28.290 align:middle line:84%
So it is now very clear that the
banking families own the world.

00:33:28.290 --> 00:33:30.340 align:middle line:84%
They control our
governments, and they

00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:31.570 align:middle line:90%
operate outside the law.

00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:34.750 align:middle line:84%
You cannot succeed against
the banks in a court of law.

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:40.040 align:middle line:84%
There is a great interview
with the old governor-- would

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:42.690 align:middle line:90%
you call him-- of the Fed.

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:44.094 align:middle line:90%
What was his name again?

00:33:44.094 --> 00:33:45.010 align:middle line:90%
>>It's Alan Greenspan.

00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:46.480 align:middle line:90%
>>Greenspan.

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And he was asked-- I think
it was on "60 Minutes"--

00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:51.830 align:middle line:84%
and he was asked, so what
is your relationship between

00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:55.370 align:middle line:84%
the Fed, and the President,
and the government?

00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh, we have
a very good relationship

00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:59.200 align:middle line:84%
between the Fed
and the government.

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:01.390 align:middle line:84%
There's always been a
very good relationship.

00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:04.340 align:middle line:84%
But then he says,
but you know, we're

00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:06.940 align:middle line:90%
a independent institution.

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:09.359 align:middle line:84%
We don't fall under the
legislation of the United

00:34:09.359 --> 00:34:10.159 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:12.800 align:middle line:84%
We operate outside
of the system.

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:15.810 align:middle line:84%
So he actually tells everybody
that they are untouchable.

00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:18.370 align:middle line:90%
They can do what they want.

00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:21.840 align:middle line:90%
It's spectacular.

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:27.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's the central banks that
dictate the economic policy

00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:29.880 align:middle line:84%
to the government, not
the other way around.

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:33.530 align:middle line:10%
They decide how they're
going to manage the country's

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:35.989 align:middle line:10%
economy for the next 12 months.

00:34:35.989 --> 00:34:39.310 align:middle line:84%
So every year when the
Minister of Finance, or whoever

00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:43.690 align:middle line:84%
runs the money in the country,
stands up and does the budget

00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:46.270 align:middle line:84%
speech, it's got nothing
to do with what's

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:48.679 align:middle line:84%
good for the people,
and everything

00:34:48.679 --> 00:34:51.190 align:middle line:84%
to do with the agenda
of the central bankers--

00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:54.340 align:middle line:84%
how are they going to manipulate
and control the people?

00:34:54.340 --> 00:35:00.734 align:middle line:84%
Remember that we've
seen a huge collapse

00:35:00.734 --> 00:35:02.900 align:middle line:84%
of a number of countries
around the world in Europe,

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:07.277 align:middle line:84%
like Greece, and Ireland,
and Portugal, and Spain,

00:35:07.277 --> 00:35:09.360 align:middle line:84%
and I forget which other
countries were in trouble

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:11.670 align:middle line:84%
with the central
banks, big trouble,

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:14.286 align:middle line:84%
because they owe so
much money to the banks

00:35:14.286 --> 00:35:15.410 align:middle line:90%
and they can't pay it back.

00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:17.380 align:middle line:84%
Just that thought
alone, just how

00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:20.830 align:middle line:84%
could a country be
indebted to a bank?

00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:21.630 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And yet people
don't question that.

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:27.530 align:middle line:84%
And then these banks
come along and they

00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:28.850 align:middle line:90%
start bailing out countries.

00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:30.560 align:middle line:84%
They say, oh, well,
we'll bail you out.

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:32.560 align:middle line:84%
How can a bank, which
is a private company,

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.620 align:middle line:90%
bail out a country?

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:36.230 align:middle line:90%
It's an insane thought, right?

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:37.240 align:middle line:90%
And yet we accept it.

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:38.920 align:middle line:90%
We see it on the news.

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:41.430 align:middle line:84%
They shove it down our throats,
and we buy all this stuff.

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:44.150 align:middle line:84%
And we think, well, this
is just how it works.

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:46.470 align:middle line:84%
No, this is how
they've infiltrated

00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:48.380 align:middle line:84%
our countries, taken
over our governments,

00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:52.040 align:middle line:84%
imposed themselves as a private
corporation on our government

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:54.830 align:middle line:84%
and they lend money
to our government.

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:59.370 align:middle line:84%
So the government borrows
money from this private company

00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:01.780 align:middle line:84%
that creates money
out of thin air

00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:03.650 align:middle line:84%
and then gives it
to our government,

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:05.180 align:middle line:90%
lends it to our government.

00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:06.797 align:middle line:84%
They call it bonds
and treasury bonds,

00:36:06.797 --> 00:36:08.630 align:middle line:84%
and all these fancy
names that they make up.

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And they put a bunch
of fancy logos on them.

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:15.087 align:middle line:84%
And then we have to work as the
slaves, through our government,

00:36:15.087 --> 00:36:17.170 align:middle line:84%
to pay the money back to
this private corporation,

00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:18.580 align:middle line:90%
the Central Bank.

00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:19.480 align:middle line:90%
This is insanity.

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:21.570 align:middle line:84%
We can print pieces
of paper ourself.

00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:23.310 align:middle line:84%
We don't need some
private corporation

00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:24.510 align:middle line:90%
to print the money for us.

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:27.490 align:middle line:84%
We can do it very, very
comfortably ourselves.

00:36:27.490 --> 00:36:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And this, really,
is why there is

00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:32.520 align:middle line:84%
inflation-- why
we have inflation,

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:37.330 align:middle line:84%
why we pay taxes, why
there's VAT and income

00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:40.210 align:middle line:84%
tax, and personal tax,
and levies, and fees,

00:36:40.210 --> 00:36:42.490 align:middle line:84%
and import duty,
and export duty--

00:36:42.490 --> 00:36:45.320 align:middle line:84%
all this stuff is
synthetically, artificially

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:48.580 align:middle line:84%
created to keep this
money scam going,

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:51.372 align:middle line:84%
because of the private
banking institutions

00:36:51.372 --> 00:36:52.580 align:middle line:90%
that control our governments.

00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:55.330 align:middle line:84%
Everything controlled is
controlled by the money.

00:36:55.330 --> 00:36:56.130 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:36:56.130 --> 00:37:00.340 align:middle line:84%
You drive down the road,
you get a traffic fine.

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:02.730 align:middle line:84%
Do they make you go and
pick potatoes in the field?

00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:04.176 align:middle line:90%
No, you have to pay money.

00:37:04.176 --> 00:37:04.976 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:37:04.976 --> 00:37:07.960 align:middle line:84%
So everything is controlled
by the money system.

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:10.280 align:middle line:84%
If you come into a country
you have to buy a visa,

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:12.610 align:middle line:84%
and you have to pay
money to get a visa

00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:14.782 align:middle line:90%
to enter another country.

00:37:14.782 --> 00:37:16.240 align:middle line:84%
Everything is
controlled by money--

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:19.330 align:middle line:84%
these bankers that have imposed
themselves on our governments

00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:23.210 align:middle line:84%
and just run amok,
completely taking control.

00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:26.850 align:middle line:90%
They bail out countries.

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:31.180 align:middle line:84%
That is insane, how private
banks can bail out countries.

00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And every time they
bail out a country,

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:34.710 align:middle line:84%
they enslave the
people even more,

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:36.810 align:middle line:84%
because now the
people have agreed--

00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:38.530 align:middle line:84%
through their
government, of course,

00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:41.390 align:middle line:84%
because the government is the
agent of the central bank--

00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:42.770 align:middle line:90%
so the government's, oh no.

00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:45.400 align:middle line:84%
We have to take out
this austerity measure--

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:49.090 align:middle line:84%
just that word, austerity
measure, is like whoa, right?

00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:52.300 align:middle line:84%
So these nasty measures
and indebtedness

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:54.810 align:middle line:84%
that the people sign up for,
through their governments,

00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:57.230 align:middle line:84%
to pay back money to
these banks, money

00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:59.070 align:middle line:84%
that they just created
out of thin air.

00:37:59.070 --> 00:37:59.870 align:middle line:90%
It's an insanity.

00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:00.912 align:middle line:90%
We need to get rid of it.

00:38:00.912 --> 00:38:02.411 align:middle line:84%
We need to create
a new alternative.

00:38:02.411 --> 00:38:03.220 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:05.370 align:middle line:84%
How these countries are
invaded and controlled

00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:09.185 align:middle line:84%
is beautifully spelled out by
John Perkins in "Confessions

00:38:09.185 --> 00:38:11.980 align:middle line:90%
of an Economic Hit Man".

00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And this just explains
how, through the bankers

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:18.970 align:middle line:84%
and the money system-- how they
invade countries, infiltrate

00:38:18.970 --> 00:38:21.910 align:middle line:84%
the governments, bribe
people, threaten them, hijack

00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:24.140 align:middle line:84%
them, kill them,
whatever-- and eventually

00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:26.320 align:middle line:90%
take over the government.

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen this
over the last 20 years.

00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:31.200 align:middle line:84%
Until about the year
2000 there were a number

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:34.490 align:middle line:84%
of countries that had
state banks that did not

00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:38.850 align:middle line:84%
belong to the Rothschild family,
the Rothschild banking empire.

00:38:38.850 --> 00:38:40.520 align:middle line:84%
And these countries--
I think you'll

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:43.390 align:middle line:84%
start seeing the agenda
here, very quickly, right?

00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:48.650 align:middle line:10%
Cuba, Iran, Libya, Iraq, North
Korea, Sudan, Afghanistan,

00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:54.300 align:middle line:10%
Syria-- well, very, very
few of those remain.

00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:55.170 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:56.930 align:middle line:84%
Even Cuba is now
out of the picture,

00:38:56.930 --> 00:38:59.650 align:middle line:84%
because the United States is
suddenly big buddies with Cuba.

00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:03.140 align:middle line:84%
So that means Cuba's
independence is out

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:07.030 align:middle line:84%
of the window, and they're
now being infiltrated.

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:09.090 align:middle line:84%
There is, however, very
interesting information

00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:14.610 align:middle line:84%
about Bolivia, as a
country that has basically

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:17.200 align:middle line:84%
kicked out the
international bankers

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:20.500 align:middle line:84%
and taken control of
their own money supply.

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:22.370 align:middle line:84%
But you'll never see
that on the news,

00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:25.540 align:middle line:84%
because all the news
and media is controlled

00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:26.980 align:middle line:90%
by the same banking families.

00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:28.396 align:middle line:84%
So they're never
going to tell us,

00:39:28.396 --> 00:39:31.980 align:middle line:84%
oh, Bolivia's cut ties with the
International Monetary Fund,

00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:34.299 align:middle line:84%
and they've kicked out the
Fed, and blah, blah, blah.

00:39:34.299 --> 00:39:35.590 align:middle line:90%
You're never going to see that.

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And according to the reports
that I've been given,

00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:42.890 align:middle line:84%
the life in Bolivia
has just exploded.

00:39:42.890 --> 00:39:49.110 align:middle line:84%
They are experiencing a boom,
economic boom, and prosperity

00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:50.880 align:middle line:84%
of the people, because
they've taken back

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:52.540 align:middle line:90%
the control of their own money.

00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:55.330 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to see that
on the news or any newspapers.

00:39:55.330 --> 00:39:57.910 align:middle line:84%
So that needs more
investigation.

00:39:57.910 --> 00:40:00.220 align:middle line:84%
It's relatively new information
that I've been given,

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:02.160 align:middle line:84%
and I need to go and
research this more.

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:04.190 align:middle line:84%
So anyone that has
the ability to go

00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:07.260 align:middle line:84%
and look into this, please do
so, and put it on the internet.

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:08.260 align:middle line:90%
Share it with everybody.

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:10.610 align:middle line:84%
And when you find
out what's happening

00:40:10.610 --> 00:40:14.510 align:middle line:84%
in countries like Bolivia,
and share that with everybody.

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:18.100 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk about
Iceland, because many people--

00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:20.630 align:middle line:84%
I wrote about Iceland
in the Ubuntu book,

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:22.870 align:middle line:84%
but what I can tell
you, in hindsight now,

00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:24.390 align:middle line:90%
that was another trick.

00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:29.470 align:middle line:84%
Do not underestimate the
evilness and the cunningness

00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:32.200 align:middle line:90%
of the banking families.

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:36.650 align:middle line:84%
These guys are so
cunning, and they

00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:37.829 align:middle line:90%
know how to play this game.

00:40:37.829 --> 00:40:39.870 align:middle line:84%
They've been playing this
for thousands of years.

00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:41.930 align:middle line:90%
They'll set up scenarios.

00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:44.400 align:middle line:84%
They'll set up
false flag events.

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:46.940 align:middle line:84%
They'll sacrifice
their own people

00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:49.850 align:middle line:84%
to make it look like
it's legitimate.

00:40:49.850 --> 00:40:53.600 align:middle line:84%
The Iceland event was not
what we believe it is.

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:56.960 align:middle line:84%
Iceland was another test
to see what would happen.

00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:59.780 align:middle line:84%
The same president or prime
minister is still in charge.

00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:03.010 align:middle line:84%
The same central bank
is still in charge.

00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:05.290 align:middle line:84%
But what the latest thing
has happened in Iceland

00:41:05.290 --> 00:41:07.820 align:middle line:84%
is what everyone
is excited about.

00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:09.780 align:middle line:84%
They said, OK, we're
no longer going

00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:12.590 align:middle line:84%
to allow the private
banks to issue money--

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:15.320 align:middle line:90%
the banks on the corner, right?

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:17.730 align:middle line:84%
They're no longer going
to be able to issue money.

00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:20.690 align:middle line:84%
The issuing of money is
going to be restricted only

00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:22.300 align:middle line:90%
to the central bank.

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And this is what people
suddenly think, OK.

00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:26.430 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:28.250 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no-- it's another con.

00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:31.920 align:middle line:84%
The central bank still
belongs to the banking empire.

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:34.810 align:middle line:84%
So this is just smoke
and mirrors, again,

00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:36.130 align:middle line:90%
that they are playing with us.

00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:38.870 align:middle line:84%
When the whole Iceland thing
happened several years ago,

00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:41.980 align:middle line:84%
they sacrificed
some of the bankers.

00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:43.170 align:middle line:90%
The bankers went to jail.

00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:47.836 align:middle line:84%
They're out, and no one
really paid a big price.

00:41:47.836 --> 00:41:49.710 align:middle line:84%
They were probably paid
huge amounts of money

00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:51.970 align:middle line:90%
to do some jail time.

00:41:51.970 --> 00:41:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And that was just used
to give the people

00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:57.610 align:middle line:84%
a false sense of security, and
a belief that something good

00:41:57.610 --> 00:41:58.930 align:middle line:90%
is happening.

00:41:58.930 --> 00:42:02.110 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to talk a little
bit more, also, about Cyprus.

00:42:02.110 --> 00:42:06.250 align:middle line:84%
So this is clearly an agenda
by the banking families

00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:09.040 align:middle line:90%
and global banking empire.

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And through this kind of
infiltration and taking

00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:14.300 align:middle line:84%
over governments, this
is how they start wars,

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:16.180 align:middle line:90%
and they control wars.

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:18.890 align:middle line:84%
They've done this, not just
for the last few hundred years.

00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:22.490 align:middle line:84%
This has been going on
for thousands of years.

00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:26.360 align:middle line:84%
Even in ancient times,
when the kings of Europe

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:28.140 align:middle line:84%
wanted to go to war
against each other,

00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:31.800 align:middle line:84%
they would have to go and
borrow money to wage war.

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:36.009 align:middle line:84%
And they would go into debt,
with the banking families

00:42:36.009 --> 00:42:38.300 align:middle line:84%
in those days, already,
because they wanted to wage war

00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:40.634 align:middle line:90%
against other kingdoms and all.

00:42:40.634 --> 00:42:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And then the Pope would
have to give them permission

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:46.240 align:middle line:84%
to go into war against
another country.

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:47.870 align:middle line:90%
It's just insanity.

00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:49.320 align:middle line:84%
OK, you can attack
another country

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:50.950 align:middle line:90%
and go kill those people.

00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:52.240 align:middle line:90%
This from the Pope, right?

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:53.410 align:middle line:90%
So really?

00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:56.610 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here?

00:42:56.610 --> 00:43:00.430 align:middle line:90%
So money controls the wars.

00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:03.730 align:middle line:84%
And here are some fascinating
statements by politicians.

00:43:03.730 --> 00:43:07.780 align:middle line:84%
"The refusal of King George
3rd, to allow the colonies

00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:10.450 align:middle line:84%
to operate an honest
money system, which

00:43:10.450 --> 00:43:13.370 align:middle line:84%
freed the ordinary man from
the clutches of the money

00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:16.340 align:middle line:84%
manipulators, was
probably the prime cause

00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:19.560 align:middle line:84%
of the revolution."--
Benjamin Franklin.

00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:21.760 align:middle line:84%
So this is just an
indication to show you

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:25.530 align:middle line:84%
what the War of Independence
and all the wars in the United

00:43:25.530 --> 00:43:27.400 align:middle line:84%
States-- it was all
about the money.

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:30.280 align:middle line:84%
It was always about the money,
and the control of the United

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:33.150 align:middle line:84%
States, and this part of
the world, of the Americas.

00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:37.700 align:middle line:84%
Mayor Amschel Rothschild--
one of the founding Rothschild

00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:41.860 align:middle line:84%
family members-- "Let me issue
and control a nation's money

00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:44.810 align:middle line:84%
and I care not who
makes the laws."

00:43:44.810 --> 00:43:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's how it
operates today.

00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:50.430 align:middle line:84%
Those who issue and control the
money control the governments.

00:43:50.430 --> 00:43:51.770 align:middle line:90%
This just blows my mind.

00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:54.820 align:middle line:84%
Remember, this is a banker
talking about a country.

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:58.270 align:middle line:84%
He says, "Either the application
for renewal of the charter

00:43:58.270 --> 00:44:00.392 align:middle line:84%
is granted," the
charter was a charter

00:44:00.392 --> 00:44:02.850 align:middle line:84%
that allowed the private bank
to control the United States,

00:44:02.850 --> 00:44:04.740 align:middle line:84%
or to issue the money
for the United States.

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:07.490 align:middle line:84%
So, "Either the application
for the renewal of the charter

00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:10.940 align:middle line:84%
is granted, or the United
States will find itself involved

00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:12.470 align:middle line:90%
in a most disastrous war."

00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:15.480 align:middle line:84%
Here's a banker threatening
a country with war

00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:19.830 align:middle line:84%
unless they allow him to
institute his own private bank.

00:44:19.830 --> 00:44:23.540 align:middle line:84%
"Teach those impudent
Americans a lesson.

00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:26.580 align:middle line:84%
Bring them back to
colonial status."

00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:31.430 align:middle line:84%
These are bankers, people--
manipulating countries

00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:34.220 align:middle line:90%
and people of those countries.

00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:35.345 align:middle line:90%
This is the "London Times".

00:44:35.345 --> 00:44:40.210 align:middle line:10%
It says, "If this mischievous
financial policy, which

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:42.460 align:middle line:10%
has its origins
in North America,

00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:45.350 align:middle line:10%
shall become endurated
down to a fixture,

00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:48.480 align:middle line:10%
then that government will
furnish its own money

00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:49.560 align:middle line:10%
without cost.

00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:52.660 align:middle line:10%
It will pay off debts
and be without debt.

00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:55.150 align:middle line:10%
It will have all the
money necessary to carry

00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:56.480 align:middle line:10%
on its commerce.

00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:58.930 align:middle line:10%
It will become prosperous
without precedent

00:44:58.930 --> 00:45:01.080 align:middle line:10%
in the history of the world.

00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:03.200 align:middle line:10%
The brains and the
wealth of all countries

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:04.900 align:middle line:10%
will go to North America.

00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:07.970 align:middle line:10%
That country must be
destroyed or it will destroy

00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:10.800 align:middle line:10%
every monarchy on the globe."

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:14.500 align:middle line:84%
This is just insane,
when you read this.

00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:16.030 align:middle line:84%
This is how these
banking families

00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:18.080 align:middle line:84%
have been controlling
all our countries,

00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:22.030 align:middle line:84%
and especially this one
here, the United States.

00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:25.200 align:middle line:84%
This is a famous
one by Henry Ford--

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:26.730 align:middle line:84%
now that you know
how it works, you

00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:28.160 align:middle line:84%
can imagine how
he felt about it,

00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:29.550 align:middle line:90%
because he knew how it worked.

00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:31.230 align:middle line:90%
Imagine his sleepless nights.

00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:32.030 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:34.270 align:middle line:84%
When you know this stuff,
and you can't really

00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:36.060 align:middle line:84%
share it with the
people-- because then

00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:39.860 align:middle line:84%
you basically destroy your
own business, your own empire.

00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:42.200 align:middle line:10%
"It is well enough that
the people of the nation

00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:44.920 align:middle line:10%
do not understand our
banking and monetary system,

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:48.120 align:middle line:10%
for if they did, I believe
there would be a revolution

00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:49.830 align:middle line:10%
before tomorrow morning."

00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly what would
happen, and will happen,

00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:55.610 align:middle line:90%
and is happening right now.

00:45:55.610 --> 00:45:59.310 align:middle line:84%
People are waking up to
these lies and deceptions.

00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:02.860 align:middle line:10%
Winston Churchill-- one of the
most evil men of the last 100

00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:07.320 align:middle line:10%
years, or 120 years--
"Should Germany merchandise

00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:10.250 align:middle line:10%
or do business again
in the next 50 years,

00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:12.370 align:middle line:10%
we have led this war in vain."

00:46:12.370 --> 00:46:16.440 align:middle line:10%
It means the intention was to
destroy Germany and its ability

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:19.630 align:middle line:10%
to create its own money.

00:46:19.630 --> 00:46:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly what
Adolf Hitler did, in case

00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:24.160 align:middle line:90%
you don't know this yet.

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:27.275 align:middle line:84%
The main reason that
he was lured into war,

00:46:27.275 --> 00:46:30.850 align:middle line:84%
or was pushed into
war, was-- there's

00:46:30.850 --> 00:46:32.620 align:middle line:84%
obviously a huge
debate about this,

00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:34.980 align:middle line:84%
because we know very little
about what really happened.

00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:38.100 align:middle line:84%
We only know what we've
been told by the media.

00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:40.770 align:middle line:84%
But it was all about the fact
that Germany became incredibly

00:46:40.770 --> 00:46:43.290 align:middle line:84%
powerful and prosperous,
because of the money issued

00:46:43.290 --> 00:46:47.820 align:middle line:84%
by the German National
Bank, that did not belong

00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:49.730 align:middle line:90%
to the Rothschild family.

00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:52.580 align:middle line:10%
So, "Germany becomes
too powerful.

00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:55.110 align:middle line:10%
We have to crush it."
says Winston Churchill.

00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:59.530 align:middle line:10%
"We will force this war upon
Hitler, if he wants it or not."

00:46:59.530 --> 00:47:00.740 align:middle line:90%
Says Winston Churchill.

00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And by all my research, points
very clearly that Hitler

00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:07.860 align:middle line:90%
didn't want to go into war.

00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:11.450 align:middle line:84%
He really-- he did everything
in his power to avoid war.

00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:14.060 align:middle line:84%
He was trying to reach
treaties and peace agreements.

00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:15.190 align:middle line:90%
He was forced into war.

00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:18.780 align:middle line:84%
It was forced upon him by
this evil man here, Winston

00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:20.160 align:middle line:90%
Churchill.

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:23.690 align:middle line:84%
"This war is an English war,"
says Churchill. "Its goal

00:47:23.690 --> 00:47:25.690 align:middle line:90%
is the destruction of Germany."

00:47:25.690 --> 00:47:29.280 align:middle line:84%
Because Germany was
becoming too powerful,

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:32.390 align:middle line:84%
and where was the control of
the global banking empire?

00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:36.160 align:middle line:84%
In the City of
London-- so you start

00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:39.220 align:middle line:84%
seeing how everything
we believe to be true,

00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:41.680 align:middle line:84%
everything we've
been told, is a lie.

00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:44.540 align:middle line:84%
Just remind yourself of
that again, how close

00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:46.860 align:middle line:84%
and how accurate that
statement becomes.

00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:49.520 align:middle line:10%
More of Winston
Churchill, "The war

00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:51.640 align:middle line:10%
wasn't only about
abolishing fascism,

00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:54.110 align:middle line:10%
but to conquer sales markets.

00:47:54.110 --> 00:47:56.440 align:middle line:10%
We could have, if
we had intended so,

00:47:56.440 --> 00:48:00.590 align:middle line:10%
prevented this war from breaking
out without doing one shot.

00:48:00.590 --> 00:48:03.490 align:middle line:10%
But we didn't want to."

00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:08.260 align:middle line:84%
It's just spectacular--
millions and millions of lives,

00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:11.530 align:middle line:84%
because of politicians and
the control of the banking

00:48:11.530 --> 00:48:13.170 align:middle line:90%
institutions.

00:48:13.170 --> 00:48:16.620 align:middle line:84%
"Germany's unforgivable
crime before World War II

00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:20.660 align:middle line:84%
was its attempt to loosen its
economy out of the world trade

00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:23.680 align:middle line:84%
system and to build up
an independent exchange

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:26.580 align:middle line:84%
system from which the
world finance could not

00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:28.190 align:middle line:90%
profit anymore.

00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:30.590 align:middle line:90%
We butchered the wrong pig."

00:48:30.590 --> 00:48:32.230 align:middle line:84%
So let's just
recap, because we've

00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:34.790 align:middle line:84%
come to the end of
this one-hour session.

00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:37.330 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
go into question,

00:48:37.330 --> 00:48:40.930 align:middle line:90%
or your comments on this.

00:48:40.930 --> 00:48:43.210 align:middle line:84%
Let's just recap
here, to finish off,

00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:46.240 align:middle line:84%
to remind ourselves that
the banking industry is

00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:48.860 align:middle line:84%
the largest organized crime
syndicate the planet has ever

00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:49.660 align:middle line:90%
seen.

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:51.390 align:middle line:90%
It is legalized crime.

00:48:51.390 --> 00:48:55.290 align:middle line:84%
Their activities are upheld
by the courts and the judges,

00:48:55.290 --> 00:48:58.120 align:middle line:84%
ignorantly protected by the
police and other security

00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:00.130 align:middle line:84%
forces, not knowing
what they're really

00:49:00.130 --> 00:49:02.810 align:middle line:84%
doing-- oppressing their
brothers and sisters,

00:49:02.810 --> 00:49:05.540 align:middle line:84%
all because they've
been told to do

00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:08.120 align:middle line:84%
so-- not because they believe
they're doing the right thing.

00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:09.911 align:middle line:84%
They've been given
orders and instructions.

00:49:09.911 --> 00:49:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And all of these
crimes against humanity

00:49:12.810 --> 00:49:16.200 align:middle line:84%
are being perpetrated, top
down, controlled by the banking

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:18.000 align:middle line:84%
families, the
banking institutions,

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.090 align:middle line:84%
that write the legal
systems that control

00:49:21.090 --> 00:49:23.080 align:middle line:90%
our countries and our lives.

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:26.480 align:middle line:84%
So in the last 10
minutes, if anyone

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:29.085 align:middle line:84%
has anything to say or
contribute, please do so.

00:49:29.085 --> 00:49:29.885 align:middle line:90%
>>Good afternoon.

00:49:29.885 --> 00:49:32.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm Patrick Anderson,
and I wanted

00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:36.410 align:middle line:84%
to say that before you were
talking about the banking

00:49:36.410 --> 00:49:37.630 align:middle line:90%
system in Bolivia.

00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And I could be
mistaken, but they

00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:45.820 align:middle line:84%
are working with the
Venezuelan government

00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:49.200 align:middle line:84%
and the Cuban government to
make sure that the United States

00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:54.610 align:middle line:84%
and worldwide banking systems
are not impacting them the way

00:49:54.610 --> 00:49:57.300 align:middle line:90%
that it is their intention.

00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:59.970 align:middle line:84%
Simon Bolivar is
a perfect example

00:49:59.970 --> 00:50:04.260 align:middle line:84%
of a gentleman that conquered
a certain area for the purpose

00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:06.870 align:middle line:84%
of freedom, and
then was executed

00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:10.680 align:middle line:84%
as the country of Gran
Colombia was instituted.

00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:12.140 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, thanks for sharing that.

00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:12.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:15.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, hopefully there'll be
more information coming out

00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:16.790 align:middle line:90%
about Bolivia.

00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:18.998 align:middle line:84%
But I'm certainly very keen
to learn more about that.

00:50:18.998 --> 00:50:22.630 align:middle line:84%
>>An indigenous group of
people, like my brothers here.

00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:24.590 align:middle line:90%
>>Awesome.

00:50:24.590 --> 00:50:26.290 align:middle line:90%
Anybody else?

00:50:26.290 --> 00:50:27.090 align:middle line:90%
>>Hi.

00:50:27.090 --> 00:50:27.960 align:middle line:90%
My name's Mark.

00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And this is really
dark material,

00:50:30.370 --> 00:50:32.940 align:middle line:84%
and it's definitely a
downer, as you've mentioned.

00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:36.370 align:middle line:84%
My question is, how
do you personally

00:50:36.370 --> 00:50:39.130 align:middle line:90%
keep your positive attitude?

00:50:39.130 --> 00:50:41.430 align:middle line:84%
What do you personally
do in your life?

00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:42.640 align:middle line:90%
Do you have practices?

00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:47.960 align:middle line:84%
Do you have beliefs
that you align with?

00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:51.110 align:middle line:84%
How do you stay so
positive and optimistic,

00:50:51.110 --> 00:50:52.860 align:middle line:90%
and your eye on the vision?

00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:55.100 align:middle line:84%
Because this is
really depressing--

00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:58.010 align:middle line:84%
it's so hard to really
face some of this stuff.

00:50:58.010 --> 00:51:00.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
problems I come up

00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:03.150 align:middle line:84%
against a lot, when I
try to share information,

00:51:03.150 --> 00:51:04.950 align:middle line:90%
is people go to sleep.

00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:06.300 align:middle line:90%
Their eyes glaze over.

00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:09.320 align:middle line:84%
Even my eyes are glazing
over, with this stuff.

00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:14.330 align:middle line:84%
And so how do you stay
connected, aligned, positive,

00:51:14.330 --> 00:51:17.240 align:middle line:84%
in the midst of
facing all this stuff?

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:18.060 align:middle line:90%
>>Thanks.

00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:19.893 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad you brought
that up, because it is.

00:51:19.893 --> 00:51:23.092 align:middle line:84%
As you go through it, you
realize how dark this is.

00:51:23.092 --> 00:51:24.580 align:middle line:84%
That's why I said
right up front,

00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:26.090 align:middle line:84%
let's realize
we're going to have

00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:28.830 align:middle line:84%
to go through a lot of dark
and depressing material

00:51:28.830 --> 00:51:31.930 align:middle line:84%
to get to the root
of the problem.

00:51:31.930 --> 00:51:34.260 align:middle line:84%
But we have to go
through this, to be

00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:36.940 align:middle line:84%
able to dig
ourselves out of this

00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:38.430 align:middle line:90%
and find the new alternative.

00:51:38.430 --> 00:51:40.320 align:middle line:84%
Without knowing this
and understanding this,

00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:44.290 align:middle line:84%
it's virtually impossible to
find an alternative system,

00:51:44.290 --> 00:51:46.980 align:middle line:90%
because this is the clue.

00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:50.570 align:middle line:84%
These are the clues that point
us in the right direction.

00:51:50.570 --> 00:51:53.400 align:middle line:84%
So that's how I stay
positive and optimistic

00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:56.180 align:middle line:84%
about it-- knowing that
we have a solution.

00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:59.480 align:middle line:84%
By learning about this, we
know exactly what not to do.

00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And it gives us a
very clear direction.

00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:03.769 align:middle line:84%
And when we get
beyond this and we

00:52:03.769 --> 00:52:05.560 align:middle line:84%
start talking about
the solutions-- really,

00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:08.350 align:middle line:84%
the Ubuntu philosophy,
the plan of action--

00:52:08.350 --> 00:52:11.060 align:middle line:84%
that's when you start seeing all
this knowledge and information

00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:13.290 align:middle line:84%
actually becomes
fodder and ammunition

00:52:13.290 --> 00:52:17.110 align:middle line:84%
for raising the new
philosophy to greater heights,

00:52:17.110 --> 00:52:19.710 align:middle line:84%
and realizing how
brilliant and simple it is.

00:52:19.710 --> 00:52:24.000 align:middle line:84%
Out of this deep, dark,
ancient control, manipulation

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.030 align:middle line:84%
of evil enslavement
of humanity, suddenly

00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:32.120 align:middle line:84%
rises this simple, elegant,
and brilliant solution

00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:38.470 align:middle line:84%
that we are not only
dreaming of, or thinking of,

00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:41.050 align:middle line:84%
or believe it's possible--
we're doing it already.

00:52:41.050 --> 00:52:42.410 align:middle line:90%
We're already on that path.

00:52:42.410 --> 00:52:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
remain positive,

00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:49.660 align:middle line:84%
because I know it's
not only possible,

00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:51.880 align:middle line:84%
but I know how we're going
to do it and the fact

00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:54.100 align:middle line:84%
that we're already
engaged in doing it.

00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:59.640 align:middle line:84%
>>One of the things that is very
important for me to remember

00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:03.350 align:middle line:84%
is that all of us are
living in this system.

00:53:03.350 --> 00:53:06.925 align:middle line:84%
And many people who earn
their living working

00:53:06.925 --> 00:53:09.050 align:middle line:84%
in the systems that are
part of the problem-- we're

00:53:09.050 --> 00:53:13.240 align:middle line:84%
all, most of us are doing
part of what's the problem.

00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And that it's not that
everybody's a bad guy.

00:53:15.250 --> 00:53:16.050 align:middle line:90%
>>Exactly.

00:53:16.050 --> 00:53:19.040 align:middle line:84%
>>People are just not
aware-- the people

00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:23.170 align:middle line:84%
who are working in their local
banks, the schoolteachers,

00:53:23.170 --> 00:53:25.770 align:middle line:84%
the doctors, the pharmaceutical
companies-- all these

00:53:25.770 --> 00:53:27.960 align:middle line:90%
that are part of the system.

00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And for me that's helpful,
because otherwise-- when

00:53:30.370 --> 00:53:31.786 align:middle line:84%
I first learned
about this-- like,

00:53:31.786 --> 00:53:33.230 align:middle line:90%
there's bad guys everywhere.

00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:35.865 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, well, and I
am too because of course, I

00:53:35.865 --> 00:53:37.930 align:middle line:90%
am supporting the system.

00:53:37.930 --> 00:53:41.120 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it's really important
to keep the bigger picture

00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:43.339 align:middle line:84%
in mind-- that it's the
system that's the problem.

00:53:43.339 --> 00:53:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And as long as we go
along with the system,

00:53:45.130 --> 00:53:47.047 align:middle line:84%
then we're all part
of the problem.

00:53:47.047 --> 00:53:48.880 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't mean we
all have a bad heart.

00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:50.210 align:middle line:90%
It just means we're ignorant.

00:53:50.210 --> 00:53:51.690 align:middle line:90%
>>Exactly.

00:53:51.690 --> 00:53:52.940 align:middle line:90%
We're born into the system.

00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:55.110 align:middle line:84%
We're blissfully ignorant
of what we're doing.

00:53:55.110 --> 00:53:57.597 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly, we
find ourselves in a job.

00:53:57.597 --> 00:53:58.680 align:middle line:90%
And we realize, oh my god.

00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:00.244 align:middle line:90%
I'm destroying people's lives.

00:54:00.244 --> 00:54:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
got a lot to do

00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:04.860 align:middle line:84%
with so many bankers committing
suicide, because they wake up

00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:08.540 align:middle line:84%
suddenly-- and you may be
aware of how many bankers have

00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:11.700 align:middle line:84%
committed suicide in the last
few years, senior bankers

00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:14.110 align:middle line:84%
around the world--
because they obviously,

00:54:14.110 --> 00:54:17.360 align:middle line:84%
many of them-- I suppose maybe
some of them were killed,

00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:19.580 align:middle line:84%
thrown off buildings,
because a lot of them

00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:22.080 align:middle line:84%
seem to be jumping
out of closed windows

00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:25.710 align:middle line:84%
or off the rooftops
of their buildings.

00:54:25.710 --> 00:54:29.340 align:middle line:84%
But I think some of them
do actually commit suicide,

00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:32.420 align:middle line:84%
because they don't know how to
deal with their own reality.

00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:34.390 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, they
realize that they've

00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:37.306 align:middle line:84%
been the cause of millions
of people's misery,

00:54:37.306 --> 00:54:39.180 align:middle line:84%
that they actually have
blood on their hands.

00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And that probably
has a deep effect

00:54:41.290 --> 00:54:44.800 align:middle line:84%
on a lot of people that suddenly
try and find introspection.

00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:46.890 align:middle line:84%
And so my message
to those people is,

00:54:46.890 --> 00:54:49.030 align:middle line:90%
don't take it upon yourself.

00:54:49.030 --> 00:54:53.750 align:middle line:84%
Like you said, we
end up in situations,

00:54:53.750 --> 00:54:56.230 align:middle line:84%
not knowing what we're
getting ourselves into.

00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:58.920 align:middle line:84%
Just as long as you recognize
that when you're in it,

00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:02.680 align:middle line:84%
recognize that you can no longer
do that, and move out and go

00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:03.770 align:middle line:90%
do something else.

00:55:03.770 --> 00:55:07.460 align:middle line:90%
Go grow cabbage or corn.

00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:11.330 align:middle line:84%
Go live out in the country
and groom horses or something.

00:55:11.330 --> 00:55:14.360 align:middle line:84%
Get out of the system,
and stop feeding it,

00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:17.350 align:middle line:84%
and do something
for yourself, if you

00:55:17.350 --> 00:55:18.790 align:middle line:84%
feel that you've
been responsible

00:55:18.790 --> 00:55:21.740 align:middle line:90%
for the misery of other people.

00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:24.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's not your
fault. You were just

00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:25.230 align:middle line:90%
trapped in the system.

00:55:25.230 --> 00:55:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And we can't blame
ourselves for any of this.

00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:31.020 align:middle line:84%
We need to recognize
that we are coming up

00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:33.090 align:middle line:84%
with the solutions
for the problem,

00:55:33.090 --> 00:55:36.700 align:middle line:84%
and nobody is to
blame for anything.

00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:40.050 align:middle line:84%
It's a recognition that
we need to learn from this

00:55:40.050 --> 00:55:42.040 align:middle line:90%
and find the new alternative.

00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And I believe we have
the new alternative.

00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:46.746 align:middle line:90%
It's just for us to embrace it.

00:55:46.746 --> 00:55:49.200 align:middle line:84%
>>And in a way,
it's very much going

00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:52.700 align:middle line:84%
to be a freeing thing when the
new system comes into play,

00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:56.070 align:middle line:84%
so that those people who
care about those things--

00:55:56.070 --> 00:55:59.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean like the doctors who
truly want to help people to be

00:55:59.410 --> 00:56:02.370 align:middle line:84%
healthier, but they're caught in
the medical system, which often

00:56:02.370 --> 00:56:04.010 align:middle line:90%
makes people sicker.

00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:07.432 align:middle line:84%
When they are able to learn
alternative ways to be--

00:56:07.432 --> 00:56:09.890 align:middle line:84%
and I realize that's not what
we're talking about-- but any

00:56:09.890 --> 00:56:11.950 align:middle line:84%
of the systems that
are not working well,

00:56:11.950 --> 00:56:14.977 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a great gift
to all of the people that

00:56:14.977 --> 00:56:17.060 align:middle line:84%
are currently working in
systems that are working,

00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:18.230 align:middle line:90%
to show them a better way.

00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:19.030 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:56:19.030 --> 00:56:20.488 align:middle line:84%
Thank you very much
for bringing up

00:56:20.488 --> 00:56:23.190 align:middle line:84%
the health thing, because we are
going to be talking about that.

00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:24.600 align:middle line:90%
That's part of the solution.

00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:27.890 align:middle line:84%
The fact that we have found
the cure for all disease that's

00:56:27.890 --> 00:56:30.280 align:middle line:84%
been hidden is another
indicator of how

00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:34.215 align:middle line:84%
our lives have been manipulated
and controlled by the system.

00:56:34.215 --> 00:56:35.590 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
pick up on that

00:56:35.590 --> 00:56:39.060 align:middle line:90%
in some of the upcoming chats.

00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And in the meantime, we're
going to close this episode off.

00:56:42.620 --> 00:56:45.880 align:middle line:84%
And thanks very much for being
here and participating in this.

00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:46.740 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:52.192 align:middle line:90%

00:56:52.192 --> 00:56:58.261 align:middle line:90%
