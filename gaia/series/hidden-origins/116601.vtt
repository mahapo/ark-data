00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.791 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.791 --> 00:00:13.290 align:middle line:90%
>>Hello.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.000 align:middle line:10%
This is Michael Tellinger.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.310 align:middle line:10%
And we continue our
journey of looking

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.160 align:middle line:10%
into ancient human
history, trying

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.140 align:middle line:10%
to learn from the wisdom
of ancient civilizations

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.650 align:middle line:10%
and putting the
pieces of the puzzle

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.700 align:middle line:10%
together to figure out a
better future for humanity

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.159 align:middle line:10%
on this crazy and
mysterious planet of ours.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:36.120 align:middle line:84%
So the previous episode ended
with the mysterious discovery

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.600 align:middle line:84%
of a pre-Inca civilization in
an ancient and mysterious mining

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.140 align:middle line:84%
tunnel in the town
of Carltonville.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And we pick up on this Inca
connection in Southern Africa

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.730 align:middle line:84%
by showing how this
part of the world

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.020 align:middle line:84%
can be connected to pretty much
every ancient civilization.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And until recently, I thought
that the original people

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.390 align:middle line:84%
of Australia were
omitted from that list.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.220 align:middle line:84%
But my recent trip to
Australia, and going

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.920 align:middle line:84%
to some of the ancient
rock carving sites

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.020 align:middle line:84%
that we were taken to
by the aboriginal elders

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.570 align:middle line:84%
or the original originese
elders convinced me

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.850 align:middle line:84%
that there's a definite link and
a connection between the style

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.040 align:middle line:84%
of the rock art and
the rock carvings

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.390 align:middle line:84%
and the rock carvings that are
seen around Southern Africa

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.210 align:middle line:84%
and specifically at
Driekops Eiland, which is

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.180 align:middle line:90%
close to the town of Kimberley.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.710 align:middle line:84%
So let's continue this
journey in this episode

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.170 align:middle line:84%
and this takes us
to the many links

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.890 align:middle line:84%
to the ancient civilizations
from across the world.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.800 align:middle line:84%
And we find the evidence of
Romans, Phoenicians, Egyptians,

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.220 align:middle line:84%
Maltese, Sumerians, the Dogons,
the Hindus and Dravidians

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.180 align:middle line:84%
and even the pre-Inca,
as I mentioned,

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.800 align:middle line:84%
and now even a connection
to the originese

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.260 align:middle line:84%
and the original
people of Australia.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.210 align:middle line:10%
Here is a beautiful
example that was discovered

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.770 align:middle line:10%
by Theodore Bent, one of
the English archaeologists

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.930 align:middle line:10%
that was a pioneer explorer
in the ruins of Great Zimbabwe

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.230 align:middle line:10%
in the late 1800s,
early 1900s, discovering

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.150 align:middle line:10%
this piece of ceramic ball,
of a stone ball that was found

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.770 align:middle line:10%
carved out and this piece
of Phoenician carving on it

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.570 align:middle line:10%
that's typically a
Phoenician zodiac that's

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.070 align:middle line:10%
carved on this piece of the ball
that connects the Phoenician

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.900 align:middle line:10%
empire to this
part of the world.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot more
evidence that we'll cover later

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.290 align:middle line:84%
about the fact that the
Phoenicians were actually

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.840 align:middle line:84%
doing a lot of business
with gold mining

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.640 align:middle line:84%
and trading with gold, from
Zimbabwe and the Great Zimbabwe

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.800 align:middle line:84%
and the Monomotapa
Empire, the golden kings.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.560 align:middle line:84%
The artifacts and
tools that were

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.040 align:middle line:84%
discovered by Theodore Bent in
Great Zimbabwe boggle the mind.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And we can spend a long
time just on that alone.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.840 align:middle line:84%
But for the sake of
keeping this more

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.720 align:middle line:84%
to the point-- we can
elaborate on this later-- let's

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.560 align:middle line:84%
continue with some of the
other phenomenal links

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.260 align:middle line:90%
to other ancient cultures.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And here's a connection to
the Romans being present

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.630 align:middle line:84%
in Southern Africa,
once again in Zimbabwe.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.350 align:middle line:84%
In the town of Umtali,
this Roman coin

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.800 align:middle line:84%
was found that dates to 138
AD, of Emperor Antoninus

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.330 align:middle line:84%
Pius that was found about 25
meters deep in a gold mine.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.810 align:middle line:84%
Once again, gold mining,
Zimbabwe, Southern Africa,

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.640 align:middle line:84%
connections to ancient
civilizations-- it never stops,

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.630 align:middle line:90%
never ends.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.030 align:middle line:84%
Here is a famous
Sumerian/Babylonian coin

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.920 align:middle line:84%
that was found while they
were digging the foundations

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.210 align:middle line:84%
for a monastery in the
town of Mariannhill,

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.710 align:middle line:84%
which is not far from Durban on
the east coast of South Africa.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And this clearly shows us the
connections to the Sumerian

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.130 align:middle line:84%
or Babylonian civilization
that is connected to Southern

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.550 align:middle line:90%
Africa, as all the others.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.660 align:middle line:84%
The Dravidians and the
Hindus, but specifically

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.079 align:middle line:84%
the Dravidians, have a very long
history with Southern Africa.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.000 align:middle line:84%
There are thousands
of little dolmen,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.600 align:middle line:84%
like this little shrine,
Hindu and Dravidian shrines,

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.630 align:middle line:84%
that are scattered throughout
Southern Africa and especially

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.680 align:middle line:84%
the eastern parts near the
towns of Waterval Boven,

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:36.620 align:middle line:84%
and Lydenburg and Nelspruit
and even further up into Sabi

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.290 align:middle line:84%
and those towns that used to be
the frontier gold mining towns.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.690 align:middle line:84%
The Dravidian culture goes
back thousands of years,

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.870 align:middle line:84%
and there is evidence that
the Dravidian gold miners have

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.710 align:middle line:84%
been active in South
Africa probably

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.310 align:middle line:90%
for about 3,000 years already.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.510 align:middle line:84%
Once again,
sometimes as evidence

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.310 align:middle line:84%
comes to me from scholars that
are connected to universities

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.750 align:middle line:84%
that want to share
information with me

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.640 align:middle line:84%
but don't want their
names exposed because they

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.430 align:middle line:90%
fear losing their jobs.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.900 align:middle line:84%
This is a great example
of a stone circle

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:14.300 align:middle line:84%
or a stone site that is built in
the shape of a Hindu fertility

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.810 align:middle line:84%
symbol, connecting it to
that part of the world.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say more about
this particular site

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.980 align:middle line:84%
and its location in
connection to the stone ruins

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.320 align:middle line:84%
and the stone circles
of Southern Africa

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.910 align:middle line:84%
later, but just
emphasizing that we

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.330 align:middle line:84%
have a rich heritage and a rich
connection to the Dravidians

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.870 align:middle line:84%
and the Hindus in ancient
times in South Africa.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.520 align:middle line:84%
Here's a great example of what
used to be called a headrest,

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.030 align:middle line:90%
an Egyptian headrest.

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.380 align:middle line:84%
Compared to a southern
African headrest,

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.990 align:middle line:84%
you can notice the pillars of
Egypt in the Egyptian headrest

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.910 align:middle line:84%
and then the circles
or concentric circles

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:54.140 align:middle line:90%
from Southern Africa.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.870 align:middle line:84%
But what's fascinating
is when you zoom in

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.130 align:middle line:84%
on the headrest from
Southern Africa,

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.700 align:middle line:84%
you find carved out
in it a Maltese cross

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.700 align:middle line:84%
on top of a headrest
from Southern Africa,

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.080 align:middle line:84%
clearly indicating a connection
to the Maltese empire

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.170 align:middle line:84%
or the Knights of
Malta, the Knights

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:14.890 align:middle line:84%
Templar, and that whole
mysterious history

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:19.150 align:middle line:84%
on this planet of the secret
societies and so forth.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.500 align:middle line:84%
The cross in a circle is one
of the most commonly found

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.430 align:middle line:84%
carvings, rock carvings
and symbols, wherever

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:27.660 align:middle line:90%
you go in the world.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:32.320 align:middle line:84%
I just recently saw dozens,
if not hundreds, of crosses

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.000 align:middle line:84%
in circles scattered
throughout Australia on my trip

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.730 align:middle line:84%
through the ancient sites of the
original people of Australia.

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:44.170 align:middle line:84%
And it just boggles the
mind how what I sometimes

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.770 align:middle line:84%
refer to as the
Sumerian cross can

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:51.450 align:middle line:84%
be found all over the
world, carved in rocks

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:56.240 align:middle line:84%
and painted as well, in various
forms, shapes, and sizes.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.100 align:middle line:84%
Then we have this
phenomenal display,

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:03.400 align:middle line:84%
what seems like some sort of
prototype Chinese alphabet

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:07.890 align:middle line:84%
or a written language from which
other ancient languages then

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:08.750 align:middle line:90%
sprouted.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:10.330 align:middle line:90%
It is still mysterious.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:16.630 align:middle line:84%
There also could be connections
to the runic or rune alphabet,

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:20.790 align:middle line:84%
but this still needs to
be examined and explored

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:25.426 align:middle line:84%
in much more detail than it
has been explored so far.

00:07:25.426 --> 00:07:27.050 align:middle line:84%
And if you think the
Greeks are omitted

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:29.740 align:middle line:84%
from this list of ancient
civilizations connected

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.330 align:middle line:84%
to Southern Africa,
you'd be mistaken.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:38.180 align:middle line:84%
Here is a beautiful example
of a Greek coin with a serpent

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:43.990 align:middle line:84%
and inside or around some
sort of a structure behind it.

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And here we have carved in
a rock, the similar kind

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:49.640 align:middle line:84%
of serpent, similar
kind of shape and form

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.440 align:middle line:84%
of that serpent
inside a pentagon,

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.850 align:middle line:90%
which I find fascinating.

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think that particular
carving tells 1,000 words

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.080 align:middle line:84%
that we can spend a lot
of time on, just analyzing

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.430 align:middle line:90%
what that really means.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:06.070 align:middle line:84%
Here we have an example of
ancient civilization and sun

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:10.610 align:middle line:84%
worshipping, with carvings of
radiating circles and a heart

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:16.140 align:middle line:84%
radiating energy out of it that
would suggest sun worshipping.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And specifically, the carving
on the right hand side

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:25.010 align:middle line:84%
of this image is a very
interesting connection

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:29.120 align:middle line:84%
to the Dogon people of Mali
that seem to have these four

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.580 align:middle line:90%
seeds of life.

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And this particular
carving very strongly

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:37.480 align:middle line:84%
resembles the incomplete circle
where these rays coming out

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.100 align:middle line:90%
of it and specific points.

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:42.669 align:middle line:84%
That is very reminiscent
of these seeds of life

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:45.590 align:middle line:84%
that we find with the
Dogon people of Mali.

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:47.150 align:middle line:84%
The other important
thing to notice

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:51.220 align:middle line:84%
about this particular carving is
the crack through the carving,

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.060 align:middle line:90%
which indicates the age.

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.090 align:middle line:84%
The erosion on the crack
through the carving

00:08:56.090 --> 00:09:00.620 align:middle line:84%
suggests that the crack appeared
after the carving was made.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And what we can do is
then look at the erosion

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.550 align:middle line:84%
on the crack which indicates
the age of the carving.

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:09.290 align:middle line:84%
My take on this is that
these carvings are way

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:11.069 align:middle line:90%
more than 100,000 years old.

00:09:11.069 --> 00:09:12.860 align:middle line:84%
They are not just a
few thousand years old.

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.670 align:middle line:90%
They go back a long, long time.

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:18.280 align:middle line:84%
And once again, I'll discuss
this in future episodes

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:20.950 align:middle line:84%
when we look at the
dating of the sites

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:23.640 align:middle line:84%
and how we approach
the dating process

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:28.020 align:middle line:84%
to give us an idea how old
these sites and the tools

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:29.910 align:middle line:90%
and artifacts are.

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And this is a fascinating
and exciting evaluation.

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.890 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian ankh
is a well-known,

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:38.900 align:middle line:84%
one of the most famous
symbols in history.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.250 align:middle line:90%
And this is also present.

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:43.460 align:middle line:84%
There are several
sites in South Africa

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:46.560 align:middle line:84%
that carry the Egyptian
ankh carved into a rock.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is a site also,
at Driekops Eiland.

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And here we have a
phenomenal example

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:55.630 align:middle line:84%
of an ankh inside
a radiating circle.

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:59.820 align:middle line:84%
So it actually tells us so much
about the ankh and what it is.

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:03.120 align:middle line:84%
It suggests that it is
a tool that radiates,

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.180 align:middle line:84%
that creates energy,
that gives off resonance.

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:08.670 align:middle line:84%
And so it is the
ankh that brings us

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:13.130 align:middle line:84%
to sound and resonance as common
links in ancient civilizations

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:15.800 align:middle line:84%
and the common links
and common denominators

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.520 align:middle line:90%
in ancient religions.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.380 align:middle line:84%
Remember, after all,
the Bible tells us

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:23.400 align:middle line:84%
that God said, let
there be light.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.610 align:middle line:84%
So it is always the sound of
the creator that comes first.

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:30.470 align:middle line:84%
Light is the consequence
of the sound.

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:33.140 align:middle line:84%
It is not the
light first-- light

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:35.140 align:middle line:90%
that brings forth the sound.

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And this is very important for
those people-- let the light

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:41.826 align:middle line:84%
be with you or you're
a light worker.

00:10:41.826 --> 00:10:43.200 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if we
shouldn't actually

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.310 align:middle line:90%
be saying, be a sound worker.

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:47.290 align:middle line:90%
Be a resonant healer.

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:48.630 align:middle line:90%
Let the sound be with you.

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:52.690 align:middle line:84%
Let the resonance be with you,
instead of this light thing

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:54.780 align:middle line:84%
that we get stuck
on all the time.

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:59.610 align:middle line:84%
So what's fascinating is that
all ancient cultures, no matter

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:02.810 align:middle line:84%
where you go, seem to
have sound and resonance

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:04.910 align:middle line:90%
at its source of creation.

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:07.040 align:middle line:84%
In Christianity,
it's the word of God,

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.560 align:middle line:90%
the word of the creator.

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.700 align:middle line:90%
God said, let there be light.

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:16.190 align:middle line:84%
In Hinduism, Buddhism, we have
the om, the aum, the resonance,

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:19.660 align:middle line:84%
the primordial resonant
source that brought everything

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:21.020 align:middle line:90%
into creation.

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:23.440 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians talk
about the universe

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.780 align:middle line:90%
being sung into creation.

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And the original
people of Australia

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:30.260 align:middle line:84%
tell us that
everything was created

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.430 align:middle line:90%
with three sacred songs.

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:33.980 align:middle line:90%
And so it goes.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:37.380 align:middle line:84%
The Hindu creation story
is a spectacular one.

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to
read this for you.

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:45.080 align:middle line:10%
It says, everything was so
peaceful and silent that Vishnu

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:49.360 align:middle line:10%
slept undisturbed
by dreams or motion.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:54.239 align:middle line:10%
From the depths, a humming
sound began to tremble.

00:11:54.239 --> 00:11:57.140 align:middle line:10%
Om.

00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:00.820 align:middle line:10%
It grew and spread,
filling the emptiness

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.570 align:middle line:10%
and throbbing with energy.

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:05.640 align:middle line:10%
The night had ended.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:08.170 align:middle line:10%
Vishnu awoke.

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:11.170 align:middle line:84%
All this is telling us
is exactly the same story

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:12.840 align:middle line:90%
as we read in the Bible.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.980 align:middle line:90%
God said, let there be light.

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:19.200 align:middle line:84%
It's just a lot more
dramatic and a lot more left

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.270 align:middle line:90%
to the imagination.

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:25.390 align:middle line:84%
Vishnu awoke means the
darkness had ended.

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:27.990 align:middle line:90%
God said, let there be light.

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:29.610 align:middle line:90%
I trust you can all see that.

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And that brings us to
this thing of sound,

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.910 align:middle line:84%
since all ancient cultures
talk about sound and resonance

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:37.670 align:middle line:90%
being the source of creation.

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:39.620 align:middle line:84%
So what is this
thing called sound?

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:41.040 align:middle line:90%
We talk about sound.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.570 align:middle line:84%
Ancient cultures tell us
about sound bringing forth

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:45.270 align:middle line:90%
everything in creation.

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:47.450 align:middle line:84%
Let's explore this
thing called sound,

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:49.610 align:middle line:84%
what we understand
about it, and how can we

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:53.210 align:middle line:84%
use sound to benefit
humanity into the future.

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:56.760 align:middle line:84%
Since sound is the thing
and sound and resonance

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.340 align:middle line:84%
is a thing that brought
everything into creation,

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:03.670 align:middle line:84%
the argument is that we could
use sound to do everything.

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And we'll find that that
is in fact the case.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.410 align:middle line:84%
So let us explore
what sound can do.

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And this is just a short
list that I've compiled.

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:14.310 align:middle line:90%
The list goes on and on and on.

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:16.210 align:middle line:90%
Sound levitates.

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:17.960 align:middle line:84%
You can levitate
things with sound.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.850 align:middle line:84%
This has been shown throughout
all of human history

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:22.930 align:middle line:84%
for thousands and
thousands of years.

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:27.250 align:middle line:84%
Sound was used to levitate very
large and very heavy objects.

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:29.600 align:middle line:90%
Sound boils water.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.180 align:middle line:90%
Sound creates light.

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:34.270 align:middle line:84%
Remember, God said,
let there be light.

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:36.020 align:middle line:90%
Sound creates DNA.

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:42.480 align:middle line:84%
This is a spectacular discovery
and a creation in 2011.

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.140 align:middle line:84%
Sound heals and
destroys pathogens.

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:47.940 align:middle line:84%
We can cure all
disease with sound.

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:50.330 align:middle line:84%
This has been done
for many, many times

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.490 align:middle line:90%
over for thousands of years.

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:54.780 align:middle line:84%
Sound moves beyond
the speed of light.

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:57.020 align:middle line:84%
Yes, this may be a
big surprise to many,

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:59.070 align:middle line:84%
and it's probably one
of the best-kept secrets

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:01.380 align:middle line:90%
in modern science and physics.

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:03.870 align:middle line:84%
But sound moves beyond
the speed of light.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And not just a little
bit-- it moves infinitely

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:08.530 align:middle line:90%
beyond the speed of light.

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:10.700 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it is the
sound and resonance

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:14.940 align:middle line:84%
that reaches everything in the
fabric of creation instantly.

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:17.660 align:middle line:84%
And we'll explore that
in much more detail, how

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:21.210 align:middle line:84%
that is possible to give
those that are still

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:23.300 align:middle line:84%
doubtful in their mind
how that is possible,

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:26.310 align:middle line:84%
to give you the scientific
background to this

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:28.250 align:middle line:90%
how sound connects everything.

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:31.360 align:middle line:84%
Sound and resonance connects
everything in creation

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.320 align:middle line:90%
instantly.

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.940 align:middle line:84%
Sound is responsible
for new technology

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.680 align:middle line:84%
that was only released
to us in 2009,

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.610 align:middle line:90%
known as saser technology.

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:41.660 align:middle line:84%
As opposed to laser
beams, we've now

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:46.070 align:middle line:84%
talking about saser beams, where
we have coherent beams of sound

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:49.750 align:middle line:84%
that can be used to create
weapons of mass destruction.

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:51.130 align:middle line:90%
And so it goes.

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:53.590 align:middle line:84%
So this is a
phenomenal discovery

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:56.280 align:middle line:84%
in new technology and
our scientists today.

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:57.690 align:middle line:90%
What else can we do with sound?

00:14:57.690 --> 00:14:59.600 align:middle line:90%
Sound can make things invisible.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.490 align:middle line:90%
Sound can make things disappear.

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:02.750 align:middle line:90%
This is phenomenal.

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:06.110 align:middle line:84%
This goes to the heart of
now really understanding

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:08.170 align:middle line:84%
how we can use
sound and manipulate

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:12.900 align:middle line:84%
sound for our benefit and
as a tool and as a weapon

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:15.510 align:middle line:90%
and as a source of energy.

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And everything we can
imagine, we can use sound for.

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:21.200 align:middle line:90%
Sound energizes water.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:25.420 align:middle line:84%
The water that we drink is
actually energized by the sound

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:28.780 align:middle line:84%
as it flows through nature
and through vortexes

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:31.040 align:middle line:90%
and through spirals as it moves.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:34.330 align:middle line:84%
It is actually the sound in
the spirals that energizes

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:35.870 align:middle line:90%
the water when we drink it.

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:37.750 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, the
water would be dead.

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And the same can be said
for the air that we breathe.

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:45.010 align:middle line:84%
It is the sound of the air
that we breathe that actually

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:48.720 align:middle line:84%
energizes the oxygen. This is
one of the greatest-- for me--

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:51.000 align:middle line:84%
one of the most important
discoveries that I have made

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.660 align:middle line:84%
over the last two
or three years,

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.330 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that it
is the sound that

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:59.150 align:middle line:84%
actually activates and energizes
the oxygen that we breathe.

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And we'll go into much
more detail about that.

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:04.810 align:middle line:10%
And finally, on this
little short list of ours,

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:08.510 align:middle line:10%
sound can create hurricanes
and sound can create

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:11.420 align:middle line:10%
big clouds and storms and rain.

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:14.820 align:middle line:84%
Many of you will be familiar
with the experiments done

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:19.660 align:middle line:84%
that started already in the
1700s and the Chladni plates

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:25.060 align:middle line:84%
and sound that vibrates on a
metal plate, sand that vibrates

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.600 align:middle line:84%
on a metal plate and the
sound comes from beneath

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.710 align:middle line:84%
and creates these
beautiful patterns.

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:33.560 align:middle line:84%
So what this does is show
us the physical evidence

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:36.350 align:middle line:84%
how this invisible
thing called sound can

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:38.510 align:middle line:90%
manifest into physical form.

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:41.910 align:middle line:84%
Now remember, there are some
people, ignorant and arrogant

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:44.130 align:middle line:84%
people that make
silly statements,

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:46.310 align:middle line:84%
or should I say
stupid statements,

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:49.100 align:middle line:84%
and say, if I can't touch
it and I can't feel it,

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:50.310 align:middle line:90%
then it doesn't exist.

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:51.090 align:middle line:90%
Give me proof.

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:52.480 align:middle line:90%
It's got to be solid proof.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.230 align:middle line:90%
I want to feel it.

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:53.900 align:middle line:90%
I want to touch it.

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:54.600 align:middle line:90%
I want to taste it.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:55.516 align:middle line:90%
Then I can believe it.

00:16:55.516 --> 00:16:58.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can't
see the sound waves

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:00.650 align:middle line:90%
leaving my mouth to your ears.

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:01.610 align:middle line:90%
You can't see them.

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And yet when I talk to
you, you understand.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:07.280 align:middle line:84%
So clearly, I'm either
doing magic here

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:09.500 align:middle line:84%
or there's something
else going on here.

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:13.109 align:middle line:90%
So let's use this as an example.

00:17:13.109 --> 00:17:16.480 align:middle line:84%
So next time somebody says
to you, if I can't see it

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.020 align:middle line:84%
and I can't touch it,
I don't believe it--

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:21.710 align:middle line:84%
I need physical proof--
you can say something

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:22.880 align:middle line:90%
like the following.

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.099 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you still
think that you

00:17:25.099 --> 00:17:28.569 align:middle line:84%
need to touch it or feel
it to know that it's real,

00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:41.290 align:middle line:84%
you must be a big-- and
maybe they'll get the point.

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:44.740 align:middle line:84%
Sand on a metal plate--
sound frequencies

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:48.040 align:middle line:84%
through the metal plate--
every sound frequency has

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:51.400 align:middle line:90%
its very own special shape.

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Every frequency is referred to
as a prime resonance frequency.

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.380 align:middle line:84%
Everything in
existence resonates

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:02.710 align:middle line:84%
at a specific frequency,
from the tiniest atom, virus,

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:07.100 align:middle line:84%
molecule-- everything has its
own prime resonance frequency.

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:10.690 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting that this prime
resonance frequency was most

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:13.490 align:middle line:84%
likely referred
to in "Star Trek"

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:17.600 align:middle line:84%
as the prime directive and that
you cannot breach the prime

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:18.180 align:middle line:90%
directive.

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:22.420 align:middle line:84%
Now let me explain to you what
I believe this actually means.

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:26.400 align:middle line:84%
If everything comes out of
the prime resonance frequency

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.810 align:middle line:84%
of creation, from the word or
the sound of God the creator,

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:35.550 align:middle line:84%
everything comes forth from
that one burst of creation,

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:37.420 align:middle line:84%
this resonance of
creation and keeps

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.520 align:middle line:84%
coming forth out
of this resonance,

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.540 align:middle line:84%
coherent harmonic
resonance of creation,

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:45.340 align:middle line:84%
that means that if
you breach that,

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:47.470 align:middle line:90%
you're going against creation.

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:48.910 align:middle line:90%
You're in dissonance.

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:50.380 align:middle line:90%
You're in disharmony.

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.770 align:middle line:84%
You're in dis-ease
with creation.

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:55.590 align:middle line:84%
You're breaching the
prime resonance frequency

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:58.060 align:middle line:84%
or you're breaching
the prime directive.

00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And this is why "Star Trek" was
telling us for more than five

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:03.900 align:middle line:84%
decades now that you cannot
breach the prime directive.

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:06.460 align:middle line:84%
What's the consequence of
breaching the prime directive

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:09.400 align:middle line:84%
is that you actually
start to destroy yourself,

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:13.360 align:middle line:84%
because you're in dissonance
with the resonant frequency,

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.930 align:middle line:84%
the coherent resonant,
prime resonant frequency.

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:19.220 align:middle line:84%
So hopefully that
starts making sense

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:23.310 align:middle line:84%
how important the sound and
the creation story really is.

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:27.760 align:middle line:84%
So every sound frequency
has its own specific shape.

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And in this little
example, it shows us

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:35.200 align:middle line:84%
that the lower the
frequency, the simpler

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:38.341 align:middle line:84%
the shapes-- the higher the
frequency, the more complex

00:19:38.341 --> 00:19:38.840 align:middle line:90%
the shapes.

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:41.990 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the simplest,
most beautiful examples

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:47.020 align:middle line:84%
to show people how sound
manifests into physical form.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.920 align:middle line:84%
This is the keyword
here, people.

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.240 align:middle line:84%
Sound manifests
in physical form.

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:54.810 align:middle line:84%
This invisible, untouchable
thing that leaves my mouth

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:56.570 align:middle line:90%
manifests in physical form.

00:19:56.570 --> 00:20:00.470 align:middle line:84%
Now while you're watching this
little experiment that I have

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:03.480 align:middle line:84%
seen 100 times-- and I
cannot get enough of it,

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.940 align:middle line:84%
because it's like watching magic
appear in front of your eyes.

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what we're doing here.

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:11.280 align:middle line:84%
We are manifesting
physical form.

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:14.150 align:middle line:84%
Now imagine, this
is sand on a metal

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:16.950 align:middle line:90%
plate, a very simple sound.

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:19.020 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine the
complexity of the sound

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:23.270 align:middle line:84%
that we make with our voices
as we speak-- how much we're

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:26.890 align:middle line:84%
actually manifesting, how
much physical form and shape

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:29.592 align:middle line:90%
we are manifesting as we speak.

00:20:29.592 --> 00:20:31.050 align:middle line:84%
So I'll leave you
with that thought

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:34.150 align:middle line:84%
while you watch this little
video clip showing us

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:38.460 align:middle line:84%

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:44.840 align:middle line:84%
So that's sand on a
metal plate showing us

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:47.680 align:middle line:84%
how sound manifests
into physical form

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:49.120 align:middle line:90%
and physical shapes.

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And just because you
can't hear the frequency

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:54.670 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean it's not
going to change the sand.

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:58.370 align:middle line:84%
The higher the frequency,
the more complex the shapes.

00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:00.040 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't stop.

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:03.230 align:middle line:84%
It gets more and more complex
as a sound and the frequency

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:05.330 align:middle line:90%
goes up.

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:07.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, this takes us to
a brilliant discovery

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:12.080 align:middle line:84%
by a man called Eric Larson,
who created or discovered what's

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:14.450 align:middle line:84%
known as the CymaScope
that can actually

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:18.730 align:middle line:84%
show us the physical form
and the shape of the sound

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:22.300 align:middle line:84%
that we make with our voices,
and the infinite number

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:24.370 align:middle line:90%
of shapes of our voices.

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:28.460 align:middle line:84%
But before we look at
this incredible example

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:30.630 align:middle line:84%
in this video, I'd
like to remind you

00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:32.520 align:middle line:84%
that what you saw
on the metal plate

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.530 align:middle line:84%
was a two-dimensional
representation

00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:37.570 align:middle line:90%
of a three-dimensional effect.

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:41.360 align:middle line:84%
So imagine that those shapes
that you see on the metal plate

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:44.370 align:middle line:84%
actually go out
in all directions.

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And remember that sound-- when
I make a sound with my mouth,

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:48.885 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't travel
in a straight line.

00:23:48.885 --> 00:23:51.350 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't go from my
mouth to your ears.

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:53.600 align:middle line:90%
It goes in all directions.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.180 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a bubble
that's growing and going

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:57.280 align:middle line:90%
in all directions.

00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:59.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, see it as
that-- this bubble

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:02.310 align:middle line:90%
that grows and goes everywhere.

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:04.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you sing
into a microphone

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:07.580 align:middle line:84%
and it's connected
to the CymaScope,

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:10.680 align:middle line:84%
you actually see a
two-dimensional perspective

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.640 align:middle line:84%
of a three-dimensional
event that

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:17.130 align:middle line:84%
is captured in water in this
beautiful experiment done

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:18.320 align:middle line:90%
by Eric Larson.

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:23.900 align:middle line:84%
So imagine the human voice
as a tool of creation.

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:27.110 align:middle line:84%
I will be talking about the
tool of creation and our ability

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:31.770 align:middle line:84%
to manifest, with our sound
and the words that we speak

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:33.480 align:middle line:90%
and the thoughts that we have.

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And this brings us to
a deeper understanding

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:38.800 align:middle line:84%
of who we are as
spiritual beings,

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.440 align:middle line:84%

to a physical body

00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And this gets into much
deeper spiritual levels

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:53.040 align:middle line:84%
of understanding our place on
this earth, the fact that we

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.660 align:middle line:84%
are divine beings of
infinite potential

After all, even more than 100
years ago, quantum physics

00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:06.270 align:middle line:84%
has clearly shown us
that we are the makers

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:09.610 align:middle line:84%
of our own reality, the
creators of our own reality.
