00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.230 align:middle line:90%


00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.100 align:middle line:90%
>>Welcome back.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
continue our exploration

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.650 align:middle line:84%
into a world of abundance with
Ubuntu Contributionism system.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.650 align:middle line:10%
And we left off talking
about the plan of action

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.510 align:middle line:10%
that Ubuntu and the
Ubuntu Party has taken.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.810 align:middle line:10%
And it is a dual approach.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.490 align:middle line:84%
We are approaching this
from a grassroots community

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.460 align:middle line:84%
development and a
political approach.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for
that is very simple,

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.960 align:middle line:84%
because as soon as we
start creating community

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.770 align:middle line:84%
projects that create abundance
and start threatening

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.130 align:middle line:84%
the authorities they'll
send the men with guns,

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.820 align:middle line:84%
or they'll create
laws or pass acts

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.340 align:middle line:84%
or bills to shut
your projects down

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.860 align:middle line:90%
because that's how it works.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.410 align:middle line:84%
So we've got to create
a protection system

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.170 align:middle line:84%
and use the political arena
and the political party--

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.610 align:middle line:84%
the Ubuntu party--
as a protection

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.180 align:middle line:84%
and a political platform to
allow these grassroots projects

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.270 align:middle line:90%
to take root and to blossom.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.240 align:middle line:90%
And that's why we are doing it.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.650 align:middle line:84%
So the Ubuntu Party was formed
in South Africa in 2012,

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.190 align:middle line:84%
and then in 2014
we participated in

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.490 align:middle line:90%
our first national elections.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And that was really our baptism
by fire where we learned--

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.810 align:middle line:84%
and I learned as much as I
could about the political arena.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.930 align:middle line:84%
What I learned is that it's a
completely crooked and staged

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:38.870 align:middle line:90%
event.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.920 align:middle line:84%
The outcomes and
the numbers are not

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.050 align:middle line:84%
representative of what
the people vote for.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And I know this for
various reasons.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.400 align:middle line:84%
One of them was the fact that we
were told by one of the ladies

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.040 align:middle line:84%
in one of the other
political parties

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.000 align:middle line:84%
that was represented at
one of those tables there.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.380 align:middle line:84%
Every party's got a
table in this big hall

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.380 align:middle line:90%
as the results come in.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.580 align:middle line:84%
And once she leaned
back at me and said,

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.140 align:middle line:84%
hey, Ubuntu, did you know that
your party got the largest

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.360 align:middle line:84%
number of votes in
the foreign votes--

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.620 align:middle line:84%
people casting their votes
outside of South Africa?

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.230 align:middle line:90%
And that blew my mind.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.420 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't believe
it, and what happened

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.040 align:middle line:84%
then is that must have sent a
shock wave through the election

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.050 align:middle line:84%
system because that
obviously wasn't expected.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And the ANC is the big
party, and if not them

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.130 align:middle line:84%
then the opposition
party, because they often

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.400 align:middle line:84%
have the more liberal
kind of followers,

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.810 align:middle line:84%
but still sold out to
capitalist banking system.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.390 align:middle line:84%
By the time the results were
released three days later--

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.890 align:middle line:84%
they held on to the foreign
vote count for three days

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.020 align:middle line:90%
before they released it.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.280 align:middle line:84%
There's only 18,500
votes, so Ubuntu Party

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.840 align:middle line:84%
based on that statement said--
because she was an observer.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.926 align:middle line:84%
She was an observer
when the counts came in.

00:02:57.926 --> 00:02:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And by the time they
released it Ubuntu Party

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.880 align:middle line:90%
was given 28 votes.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.100 align:middle line:84%
We expected about 4,000 or
5,000 votes of the 18,000 vote.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.420 align:middle line:90%
We had 28 votes.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.810 align:middle line:84%
So at that moment I realized,
well, the outcome of this

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.300 align:middle line:84%
is going to be completely
staged and manipulated.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.900 align:middle line:84%
But what it did
teach us is that we

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.020 align:middle line:84%
can inject a virus
of consciousness

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.410 align:middle line:84%
or a seed of consciousness
into the political beast.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
this is all about.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And when people say, why
do we go into politics?

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.420 align:middle line:90%
It's for exactly that reason.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.180 align:middle line:84%
We can't allow politics, which
is a dirty, disgusting filthy,

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.430 align:middle line:84%
crooked, inhumane system to
control and destroy lives.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.440 align:middle line:90%
And that's what it's doing.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.420 align:middle line:84%
By sitting on the
fence and ignoring

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.810 align:middle line:84%
it is not going to
solve the problems.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.830 align:middle line:90%
So we have to change it.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And people say to
me sometimes people

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.180 align:middle line:84%
say, oh Tellinger, you
go into politics you're

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.020 align:middle line:90%
going to become just like them.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.240 align:middle line:84%
I say really, have you
read our manifesto?

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.840 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to
become just like them?

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.500 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.710 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about shutting
down the government,

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.100 align:middle line:84%
closing the Fed, replacing
it with a People's Bank,

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.090 align:middle line:84%
letting communities
govern themselves.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.630 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we sound
like them at all.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.080 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I think we sound
completely the opposite

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.210 align:middle line:90%
to them, whoever them may be.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.329 align:middle line:84%
But the point is that we're
not going into politics

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.160 align:middle line:90%
to become just like them.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.769 align:middle line:84%
We're going into politics to
inject a virus of consciousness

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.440 align:middle line:84%
and to change this
disgusting field of politics

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.920 align:middle line:84%
into a respectful, respectable,
honorable part of society that

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.642 align:middle line:90%
actually serves the people.

00:04:32.642 --> 00:04:34.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's what it
should be doing.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.110 align:middle line:84%
It should be serving us,
and at the moment it's not.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.860 align:middle line:90%
So we can't sit on the fence.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.400 align:middle line:84%
We have to change it, and
once again, it's up to us

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.510 align:middle line:90%
to change it.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's great that we've
learned from this, and the fact

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.820 align:middle line:84%
that we realize that to go
off to the national elections

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.070 align:middle line:90%
is not going to get us anywhere.

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And we followed that
in the UK a year later.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.270 align:middle line:10%
The Ubuntu Party was
registered in the UK,

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.418 align:middle line:10%
and Paul Toussaint and Mark
Sleigh in Sutton Coldfield

00:05:00.418 --> 00:05:06.490 align:middle line:10%
and Paul in Stoke on Trent
ran as Ubuntu party candidates

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:07.290 align:middle line:10%
in the UK.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:08.827 align:middle line:10%
Each one of the
few hundred votes.

00:05:08.827 --> 00:05:10.410 align:middle line:84%
They were obviously
very disappointed.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.840 align:middle line:84%
They thought they were going
to win because they were so

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.870 align:middle line:84%
inspired by the
message, but it's not

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.710 align:middle line:90%
going to happen on that level.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.730 align:middle line:84%
What we have learned
from this, however, that

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.690 align:middle line:84%
focusing on the local levels,
on the local municipal level,

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.050 align:middle line:84%
is going to be far
more effective for us.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's really where
we're leading with this

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.710 align:middle line:90%
in this transitional phase.

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.460 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just giving you
a little hint here,

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.150 align:middle line:84%
but we're going
to get there soon.

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.970 align:middle line:10%
So what we entered the political
arena with as a manifesto,

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.850 align:middle line:10%
in case you're
not aware of this,

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.790 align:middle line:10%
was the following-- the
Ubuntu Party believes

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.470 align:middle line:10%
that the country
belongs to its people,

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.710 align:middle line:10%
that the mineral wealth
and the energy creation

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.910 align:middle line:10%
belongs to its people, and that
the government is appointed

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:56.010 align:middle line:10%
as the servant of other
people, by the people

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.580 align:middle line:10%
to serve the needs of
the people on every level

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.270 align:middle line:10%
of our human endeavor.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.470 align:middle line:10%
Based on these
simple principles,

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.180 align:middle line:10%
we plan to do the following--
and this is where we really

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.890 align:middle line:10%
let the cat out of the bag-- to
restructure the entire banking

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:14.280 align:middle line:10%
system to serve the people
are not enslave the people.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.890 align:middle line:84%
So already we show
that we are not

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:17.630 align:middle line:90%
like any other political party.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.460 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, I need to
mention this right here,

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.880 align:middle line:84%
is any politician or
any political party that

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.150 align:middle line:84%
doesn't tell the people about
the banking system, that

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.340 align:middle line:84%
doesn't talk about the
Fed, or the central banks

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:35.140 align:middle line:84%
being private corporations,
is lying to the people.

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And either they lie to the
people because they don't know,

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:39.490 align:middle line:84%
or they simply
blatantly lie and they

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.040 align:middle line:84%
don't want to share that
information with the people.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And neither of those points
make them fit to lead or govern

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.980 align:middle line:84%
anyone, and this is what we need
to keep reminding ourselves.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And any politician
that's says we're

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.102 align:middle line:84%
going to create a
million new jobs

00:06:53.102 --> 00:06:54.560 align:middle line:84%
is just telling us
that we're going

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.630 align:middle line:84%
to create a million more slaves
that work for the corporations

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:00.590 align:middle line:84%
until the corporation
no longer needs them

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.140 align:middle line:90%
and then they kick them out.

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:05.560 align:middle line:84%
So this is the point that we
try and get across to the people

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.960 align:middle line:84%
as strongly as we can
with this manifesto.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.340 align:middle line:84%
We've got to change the banking
system at the top level,

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.164 align:middle line:84%
and on the national party
on the national elections

00:07:14.164 --> 00:07:16.580 align:middle line:84%
this is what the manifesto
says, because that's what we're

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.770 align:middle line:90%
going for on a national level.

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.250 align:middle line:84%
But that obviously
changes on a local level

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:23.280 align:middle line:84%
when we get to the
local elections.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.910 align:middle line:90%
So let's continue here.

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:28.320 align:middle line:84%
We create a People's Bank that
creates money for the people,

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.410 align:middle line:84%
by the people,
and in which case,

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:33.520 align:middle line:84%
the money is tax-free and
interest-free, with 100%

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.140 align:middle line:84%
employment as a consequence and
stop the financial enslavement

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:40.250 align:middle line:84%
of our people by the
private owned Reserve Bank.

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:43.430 align:middle line:84%
This will immediately free
the people from debt slavery.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:45.630 align:middle line:84%
And we discussed this in
the previous episodes--

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:48.830 align:middle line:84%
how a People's Bank will
provide all the funding

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:53.290 align:middle line:84%
and the money
necessary for people

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:56.340 align:middle line:84%
to move into any town,
any village anywhere,

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:59.080 align:middle line:84%
and start any project they
want, because that money

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.820 align:middle line:84%
will be provided for
by the People's Bank.

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.150 align:middle line:84%
That's the job of
a People's Bank.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:08.460 align:middle line:84%
So it stops that
exploitation immediately.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.380 align:middle line:90%
There's no inflation.

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.160 align:middle line:90%
There's no interest rate.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.890 align:middle line:84%
There's no taxes
or fees or levees,

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:18.880 align:middle line:84%
because the people's
bank belongs to us.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And this is where a lot
of economists or people

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.940 align:middle line:84%
that have studied finance
and say, oh, you're

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:25.648 align:middle line:84%
going to create
hyperinflation, all this.

00:08:25.648 --> 00:08:27.990 align:middle line:84%
They have no idea what
they're talking about.

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:30.380 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones with
their heads in the sand.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:34.799 align:middle line:84%
They're regurgitating the
lies and the manipulation

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:37.630 align:middle line:84%
of the institutions called
universities and schools

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:40.780 align:middle line:84%
that taught them all the
stuff and just taught

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:43.610 align:middle line:84%
them to regurgitate
all this nonsense.

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:45.280 align:middle line:84%
Because every time
the People's Bank

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.040 align:middle line:84%
takes over a country
it becomes prosperous.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And we've read some
of the statements made

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:57.296 align:middle line:84%
by in the early 1800s by
the bankers around the world

00:08:57.296 --> 00:08:59.170 align:middle line:84%
and those guys that
descended upon the United

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:01.190 align:middle line:84%
States and various
other parts of the world

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:03.510 align:middle line:84%
to take over with
the private banks.

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:04.620 align:middle line:90%
And then we continue.

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.410 align:middle line:84%
So the People's Bank is
the critical first step.

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:09.290 align:middle line:84%
It's not the final
destination, but it's

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:11.010 align:middle line:90%
the critical first step to take.

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:13.170 align:middle line:84%
It's like taking the lid
off the pressure cooker,

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:15.710 align:middle line:84%
and just releasing
the stress and anxiety

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:18.650 align:middle line:90%
and the misery off everyone.

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:21.880 align:middle line:10%
Let our scientists and inventors
deliver a renewable source

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.790 align:middle line:10%
of free energy for everyone.

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:27.240 align:middle line:84%
Does it sound like any
other political party?

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.580 align:middle line:90%
No, it doesn't.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.724 align:middle line:84%
So clearly we already show
our humanness here-- the fact

00:09:31.724 --> 00:09:33.140 align:middle line:84%
that we are not a
political party.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.801 align:middle line:90%
We are human beings.

00:09:34.801 --> 00:09:36.925 align:middle line:84%
And this is often, say,
oh, so you're a politician?

00:09:36.925 --> 00:09:39.080 align:middle line:90%
I say no, I'm a human being.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a politician.

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:43.319 align:middle line:84%
Again, with
politicians, politics

00:09:43.319 --> 00:09:45.610 align:middle line:84%
has become such a dirty
business we don't even see them

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:47.530 align:middle line:90%
as human beings anymore.

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:50.660 align:middle line:10%
Support our traditional
healers and research scientists

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:53.530 align:middle line:10%
in finding alternative
cures for all disease

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:55.930 align:middle line:10%
and prevent the drug cartels
from hiding such goods

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:56.970 align:middle line:10%
from the people.

00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:58.850 align:middle line:84%
Support our farmers
on every level

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:02.200 align:middle line:84%
to escape the groups of Monsanto
to grow organic food and plant

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.900 align:middle line:84%
gardens across the nation
to ensure that no one ever

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.310 align:middle line:90%
goes hungry again.

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:07.974 align:middle line:90%
It's easy to grow food.

00:10:07.974 --> 00:10:09.390 align:middle line:84%
And there are
people that know how

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:12.450 align:middle line:84%
to grow food in so much
abundance it completely

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:16.500 align:middle line:84%
boggles your mind how much food
can be grown in a small area.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.570 align:middle line:90%
And then it continues.

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:19.620 align:middle line:10%
Decentralize the
government so that people

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.040 align:middle line:10%
can govern themselves in
their own communities,

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.710 align:middle line:10%
taking care of their own
needs immediately supported

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:27.100 align:middle line:10%
by the new People's Bank
every step of the way.

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.870 align:middle line:10%
Again, this is a transitional
phase showing you

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:33.150 align:middle line:10%
how we can go from in
a political arena how

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:37.520 align:middle line:10%
we can go from where we are
now into very rapid abundance

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.870 align:middle line:10%
and prosperity by simply
creating and introducing

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:42.990 align:middle line:10%
a Peoples Bank.

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:45.890 align:middle line:10%
Restructuring the judiciary
and the legal system

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:48.290 align:middle line:10%
to be written by the
people, for the people,

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:51.550 align:middle line:10%
unlike the unjust legal
system we face in our courts

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:54.040 align:middle line:10%
today, which holds the
rights of corporations

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.660 align:middle line:10%
above those of living,
breathing human beings.

00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:00.500 align:middle line:10%
So this is our seven point
manifesto-- very simple.

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And all other points come
from this foundation.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.840 align:middle line:84%
Everything else comes from
this-- health care, education,

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:10.780 align:middle line:84%
energy, technology,
society-- all that start

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:12.510 align:middle line:90%
from this foundation.

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:15.390 align:middle line:84%
So really what I'm
talking about is

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:18.480 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at the political
arena from a national

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.720 align:middle line:90%
and from a local perspective.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.580 align:middle line:84%
So from a national perspective
as I've just showed you

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.910 align:middle line:84%
we focus on the
People's Bank, but we

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:28.860 align:middle line:84%
realize that we're not going
to win the national elections.

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.740 align:middle line:84%
We just don't have the
money or the funding.

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:33.880 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to happen, but
we had to go through the process

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.140 align:middle line:84%
to learn that, and
now we understand

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:38.440 align:middle line:84%
how the beast
functions and what we

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.580 align:middle line:90%
can do to bring the beast down.

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's called the
Achilles heel approach,

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:46.670 align:middle line:84%
and that Achilles heel approach
takes as into the small towns

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:50.310 align:middle line:84%
and small municipalities
to affect the change

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:52.920 align:middle line:84%
and to create that
first domino to fall.

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we
are now focusing,

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:59.390 align:middle line:84%
and this philosophy is applied
to all countries in the world,

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:02.000 align:middle line:84%
on the smallest towns in
the smallest municipalities,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.700 align:middle line:84%
no matter what
country you live in.

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:09.590 align:middle line:84%
Our promise to the people
and our campaign manifesto

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:13.350 align:middle line:84%
in the local municipal elections
is free electricity for all.

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:15.250 align:middle line:90%
That's our main slogan.

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:17.900 align:middle line:84%
We know we can provide
an alternative source

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.470 align:middle line:84%
of electricity for the
small towns and villages.

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:22.060 align:middle line:90%
It's not a big task.

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:25.360 align:middle line:84%
To provide electricity for
a big city is another story,

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.380 align:middle line:84%
but for a small town of
1,000 of 5,000 people

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.010 align:middle line:90%
we know we can do that.

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:31.660 align:middle line:90%
And that changes everything.

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:34.640 align:middle line:84%
So this takes us to
a plan of action.

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:38.680 align:middle line:84%
No matter what country you
live the next elections

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.660 align:middle line:84%
as the Ubuntu party, and
I must just also tell you

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:44.970 align:middle line:84%
that right now the Ubuntu party
is being formed in Australia,

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:49.370 align:middle line:84%
in Canada, the USA, it already
exists in UK and South Africa,

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:53.000 align:middle line:84%
in Austria, Germany,
Slovenia, Croatia--

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.890 align:middle line:84%
it's just spreading
almost uncontrollably

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:59.580 align:middle line:84%
around the world, all
with the same manifesto,

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:03.820 align:middle line:84%
the same philosophy, the same
unity consciousness foundation.

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:06.055 align:middle line:84%
So we're creating
a global movement,

00:13:06.055 --> 00:13:07.930 align:middle line:84%
not just the movement
of unity consciousness,

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:10.710 align:middle line:84%
but a political movement
that moves across borders,

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:13.430 align:middle line:84%
beyond borders, across countries
that cannot be controlled

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:14.624 align:middle line:90%
by bored anymore.

00:13:14.624 --> 00:13:16.040 align:middle line:84%
People sharing the
same philosophy

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.970 align:middle line:84%
no matter what country they
find themselves in-- this

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:22.170 align:middle line:84%
is just really very,
very encouraging.

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And remember, this is not
something that are planned.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:25.950 align:middle line:90%
This happened.

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:27.630 align:middle line:90%
It evolve naturally.

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:30.530 align:middle line:84%
And we're just supporting
the natural evolution

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:34.040 align:middle line:84%
of this the best way we can,
which is not always easy.

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.760 align:middle line:84%
But we are doing
the best we can.

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.670 align:middle line:84%
So you're focusing on
local, municipal elections

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:40.636 align:middle line:84%
no matter what
country you're in.

00:13:40.636 --> 00:13:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And in South Africa we have
the local elections in 2016.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.284 align:middle line:84%
We don't yet know
when they're going

00:13:47.284 --> 00:13:49.920 align:middle line:84%
to be because the government
will announce when they will be

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.230 align:middle line:84%
when it best suits
them, as they always do,

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:56.020 align:middle line:84%
but I trust sometime
between April and June 2016.

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:59.050 align:middle line:84%
And our plan is to
win at least one

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:01.800 align:middle line:90%
of the small municipalities.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.140 align:middle line:84%
We're targeting the 12
smallest municipalities,

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:08.030 align:middle line:84%
and I suggest that the
same line of action

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:11.940 align:middle line:84%
is applied in every country
where the Ubuntu parties is

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:13.320 align:middle line:90%
established.

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.120 align:middle line:84%
Go after the 12
smallest municipalities.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.460 align:middle line:84%
The 12 smallest
municipalities in South Africa

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:22.400 align:middle line:84%
have as few as seven and
a half thousand people

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.670 align:middle line:90%
in the whole municipality.

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:25.710 align:middle line:90%
Why do we do this?

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:28.150 align:middle line:84%
Because we know we
can reach 7,500 people

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:30.720 align:middle line:84%
far more effectively
than 100,000 people

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:34.220 align:middle line:84%
with out pamphlets, our
posters on the lamp poles,

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:36.930 align:middle line:84%
our little campaigns with
our gazebo in the town.

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:39.430 align:middle line:84%
You know, if we go into
a little time like that

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:41.840 align:middle line:84%
or the small towns that
makeup these municipalities--

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.990 align:middle line:84%
there's normally between four
and 10 towns that make up

00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:46.430 align:middle line:90%
these little municipalities.

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:48.480 align:middle line:84%
You go in there and you
put up your little gazebo

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.938 align:middle line:84%
with your flags and your banners
and you hand out pamphlets

00:14:50.938 --> 00:14:54.110 align:middle line:84%
for a weekend everybody in
the town will know about you,

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:56.069 align:middle line:84%
because that's how
small the town is.

00:14:56.069 --> 00:14:57.610 align:middle line:84%
They'll know what
your plan of action

00:14:57.610 --> 00:14:59.340 align:middle line:84%
is, they'll know what
your philosophy is,

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.850 align:middle line:84%
they'll understand our
plan of action, which

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:04.810 align:middle line:90%
is free electricity for all.

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And we can explain to them how
we get that free electricity,

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.820 align:middle line:84%
and how that free electricity
will benefit everyone

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:11.990 align:middle line:90%
in the community.

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.790 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:14.480 align:middle line:90%
Because it's our electricity.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.690 align:middle line:84%
Before I go there what
we need to explain-- we

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:20.540 align:middle line:84%
use the electricity as
a tool of unification,

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:22.440 align:middle line:90%
a platform to unite the people.

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.750 align:middle line:90%
This is critical.

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:26.330 align:middle line:84%
Really important to
understand and embrace this.

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And this is where Ubuntu
differs, I believe,

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:33.210 align:middle line:84%
quite radically with a
lot of other movements

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:36.410 align:middle line:84%
that suggest or try
to get an electricity

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:40.110 align:middle line:84%
device into every household
that could actually

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:41.460 align:middle line:90%
be very dangerous.

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:43.640 align:middle line:84%
Right now at our current
level of consciousness

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:47.140 align:middle line:84%
we're ready so divided as a
species we fear our neighbors.

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:48.870 align:middle line:84%
We don't even know
who our neighbors are,

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:50.286 align:middle line:84%
and now you want
to give everybody

00:15:50.286 --> 00:15:53.464 align:middle line:84%
their own independent
individual energy supply.

00:15:53.464 --> 00:15:54.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't think
that's the solution.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:58.090 align:middle line:84%
I think that's actually a tool
of even creating more division

00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:01.230 align:middle line:84%
and more fear, and possibly
a lot more violence,

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:04.550 align:middle line:84%
especially in the areas of
the haves and the don't-haves.

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:07.500 align:middle line:84%
If you have one of those devices
in your home or on your farm,

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.580 align:middle line:84%
and the neighboring
farmer doesn't have one,

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:12.100 align:middle line:84%
he's going to climb over your
wall to take it from you.

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:15.040 align:middle line:84%
So that's not really a solution,
but if you turn it around

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.860 align:middle line:84%
and you say, let's
give our whole town,

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:21.520 align:middle line:84%
let's give everybody electricity
equally, free electricity, that

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.910 align:middle line:84%
becomes a unifying factor
and a tool of unity

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:25.730 align:middle line:90%
between the people.

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:28.300 align:middle line:90%
Everybody gets free electricity.

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:33.202 align:middle line:84%
So to come back to this is
we can explain to people

00:16:33.202 --> 00:16:35.160 align:middle line:84%
very quickly where this
electricity comes from,

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:38.210 align:middle line:84%
how we generate
it, and we are not

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:40.300 align:middle line:84%
talking about exotic
kind of electricity

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:43.450 align:middle line:84%
here because that could
be too much information

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:45.940 align:middle line:84%
for most people they don't
know enough about this

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:48.360 align:middle line:84%
or they haven't
research this enough.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:51.860 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about putting
hydro-turbines in the river.

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.830 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
rivers around our towns,

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:59.064 align:middle line:84%
especially in the
Americas and South Africa

00:16:59.064 --> 00:17:01.230 align:middle line:84%
probably has fewer rivers
than most other countries,

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:03.644 align:middle line:90%
but even there we can do that.

00:17:03.644 --> 00:17:05.560 align:middle line:84%
You put a bunch of
hydro-turbines in the river

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.859 align:middle line:84%
and we can have electricity
for the whole town very,

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:08.950 align:middle line:90%
very quickly.

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:10.690 align:middle line:84%
The one thing that
we do have is access

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:14.460 align:middle line:84%
to very advanced
hydro-turbine technology,

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:16.690 align:middle line:84%
and this is because in my
travels around the world

00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:18.235 align:middle line:84%
and meeting some
really brightest

00:17:18.235 --> 00:17:20.150 align:middle line:84%
and incredible
people, inventors,

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:23.359 align:middle line:84%
and scientists that have
shared his knowledge with us.

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:25.329 align:middle line:90%
This is not generally known.

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:27.091 align:middle line:84%
Once again, these
inventors struggle

00:17:27.091 --> 00:17:29.590 align:middle line:84%
from the same problem that every
other invent struggles from

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:32.760 align:middle line:84%
is lack of funding, but
we know they are there.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.260 align:middle line:84%
We know the
technology works, and

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:38.790 align:middle line:84%
these hydro-turbine technologies
are 20 to 40 times as effective

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:41.470 align:middle line:84%
as current hydro-turbines
technology.

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:43.530 align:middle line:84%
So that can solve
a lot of problems.

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:46.520 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking exotic
or strange technology.

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:50.550 align:middle line:84%
We're talking tried and tested
things that people understand,

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:51.700 align:middle line:90%
and they get it.

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:53.980 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't matter how
poor the people maybe.

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:56.060 align:middle line:84%
They understand
this, and I think

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:58.430 align:middle line:84%
this is where our government
has made a big mistake.

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:00.890 align:middle line:84%
They think that because people
are poor, they're stupid.

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:03.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, poor people
are not stupid.

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:04.890 align:middle line:84%
They know exactly
what's going on,

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:09.800 align:middle line:84%
and they're sick and tired of
how they've been mistreated.

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.750 align:middle line:84%
So wherever we go with our
philosophy and our message

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:14.710 align:middle line:84%
of Ubuntu and the
free electricity,

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:16.670 align:middle line:84%
people get it
very, very quickly.

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:19.620 align:middle line:84%
So we're gathering a lot
of support much quicker

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:22.650 align:middle line:84%
than I ever imagined, and
we'll see how it goes.

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:26.990 align:middle line:84%
So the whole manifesto is
based on the free electricity.

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:29.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm just sharing
some of the art work

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:32.770 align:middle line:84%
that we've developed
for our campaigns

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:34.590 align:middle line:90%
for the various parts of it.

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:38.240 align:middle line:10%
These are pull up banners that
talk about free electricity,

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.790 align:middle line:10%
upgrading our towns,
creating abundance.

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:42.832 align:middle line:84%
Where do people
get, how do people

00:18:42.832 --> 00:18:44.790 align:middle line:84%
get this for electricity,
or why does everybody

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:45.873 align:middle line:90%
get this free electricity?

00:18:45.873 --> 00:18:51.330 align:middle line:84%
Because they participate in the
well-being of the community.

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:53.880 align:middle line:84%
Everybody gives three
hours a week towards one

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.346 align:middle line:90%
of the community projects.

00:18:56.346 --> 00:18:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
some people get stuck

00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:59.524 align:middle line:90%
and they get well, hold on.

00:18:59.524 --> 00:19:01.190 align:middle line:84%
How you're going to
set up the projects?

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:02.648 align:middle line:84%
Where you're going
to get the money

00:19:02.648 --> 00:19:03.865 align:middle line:90%
to create the electricity?

00:19:03.865 --> 00:19:05.909 align:middle line:84%
We say, well, we're going
to win the election.

00:19:05.909 --> 00:19:07.200 align:middle line:90%
This is why we're going for it.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.690 align:middle line:84%
We are campaigning so
we can win the election.

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:11.950 align:middle line:84%
When we win and I'm
the mayor and we

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:13.720 align:middle line:84%
get the money that
comes from government,

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.730 align:middle line:84%
that money then gets
funneled and put

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:19.770 align:middle line:84%
into all the community projects
to actually serve the people.

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:21.330 align:middle line:84%
At the moment, that
money disappears

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:24.050 align:middle line:84%
into the back pockets
of the politicians

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:25.936 align:middle line:84%
and we don't see any
benefits from it.

00:19:25.936 --> 00:19:27.435 align:middle line:84%
So we actually apply
the money where

00:19:27.435 --> 00:19:29.270 align:middle line:90%
it's supposed to be applied.

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:32.450 align:middle line:84%
So the first chunk of money
that comes from government

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:35.220 align:middle line:84%
we set up the electricity
device for our town.

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:36.970 align:middle line:84%
Once it's paid for,
once it's set up,

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:39.230 align:middle line:84%
and once it's giving us
electricity, it's ours.

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:41.080 align:middle line:90%
it belongs to us.

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And then it's free to us,
because we've paid for it.

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:46.560 align:middle line:90%
Ah.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.010 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:49.055 align:middle line:90%
It's that simple.

00:19:49.055 --> 00:19:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And then people get
stuck even further.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.540 align:middle line:84%
They say, well, who's going
to give you permission to put

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:54.670 align:middle line:90%
the electricity device in?

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:56.260 align:middle line:90%
I say well, I am.

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:59.140 align:middle line:84%
We just won the election
on that manifest.

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:02.267 align:middle line:84%
We said we will give out
town free electricity.

00:20:02.267 --> 00:20:03.850 align:middle line:84%
We're just implementing
the manifesto.

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:06.191 align:middle line:90%
Who's going to stop us?

00:20:06.191 --> 00:20:07.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't know who's
going to stop us.

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:09.780 align:middle line:84%
Are they going to send
the men with guns in?

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:10.730 align:middle line:90%
Possibly.

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:12.670 align:middle line:84%
What are the people going to do
if they send the men with guns

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:12.770 align:middle line:90%
in?

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:14.910 align:middle line:84%
At least we've
united the community,

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:18.420 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to see a
result that maybe nobody has

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.090 align:middle line:90%
thought of before.

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:23.890 align:middle line:84%
However, this is
again what brings out

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:27.040 align:middle line:84%
that fear-based,
knee-jerk reaction.

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:31.230 align:middle line:84%
People more often than not
are looking for approval

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:32.870 align:middle line:90%
from some higher authority.

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Somebody up there must
give you the approval

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:36.560 align:middle line:90%
that you can do this.

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're no longer
looking for approval

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:39.440 align:middle line:90%
from high authority.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.130 align:middle line:90%
We become the authority.

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:42.320 align:middle line:90%
The time belongs to us.

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.790 align:middle line:90%
The time belongs to its people.

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:45.287 align:middle line:84%
The country belongs
to its people.

00:20:45.287 --> 00:20:47.120 align:middle line:84%
The government is the
servant of the people.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:50.400 align:middle line:84%
They should be kissing our
butts on each cheek every day.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.200 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.060 align:middle line:84%
Standing on every corner
asking us what can

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:55.380 align:middle line:90%
we do for you, sir and ma'am.

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And the same with politicians
in the municipalities.

00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:00.050 align:middle line:90%
What can we do for you today?

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:02.150 align:middle line:84%
They're not doing that,
so this is the manifesto

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:03.700 align:middle line:90%
that we're giving the people.

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:07.090 align:middle line:84%
Free electricity, community
projects, abundance for all.

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:09.230 align:middle line:84%
The money that comes
in from the government

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:13.630 align:middle line:84%
gets used to set up
the community projects.

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:17.140 align:middle line:84%
And all the people have to do
to get their free electricity is

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:19.640 align:middle line:84%
to work for three hours a
week in one of these community

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:20.670 align:middle line:90%
projects.

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:22.980 align:middle line:90%
What does this do?

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:26.660 align:middle line:84%
What have we achieved
when we do this?

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:29.610 align:middle line:84%
We've achieved something
quite remarkable.

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:33.070 align:middle line:84%
We've just turned our
town into a powerful labor

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:37.340 align:middle line:84%
force the no corporation, or
municipality, or government

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:40.060 align:middle line:90%
department can compete with.

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:41.980 align:middle line:90%
And this changes everything.

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:45.550 align:middle line:10%
In a town of 5,000 people like
our little town, three hours

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:49.990 align:middle line:10%
a week that's 15,000
hours of labor week.

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:53.490 align:middle line:84%
What company or
government or municipality

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:56.610 align:middle line:84%
can afford to pay 15,000
labor hours a week?

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:58.660 align:middle line:84%
They can't afford
that, but we've just

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:00.660 align:middle line:84%
created that for ourselves
because we've chosen

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:02.535 align:middle line:90%
to do that between ourselves.

00:22:02.535 --> 00:22:04.740 align:middle line:90%


00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:07.200 align:middle line:84%
You need a lot of
community projects

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.210 align:middle line:84%
to put the people to
work, so understand

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:10.790 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of
things that have

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:12.530 align:middle line:90%
to happen at the same time.

00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:16.010 align:middle line:84%
The electricity device,
setting up the projects,

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:19.650 align:middle line:84%
allocating specialists to each
project, project coordinators,

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:21.935 align:middle line:84%
project managers that
actually look after it,

00:22:21.935 --> 00:22:23.560 align:middle line:84%
and finding the people
in the community

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:27.590 align:middle line:84%
that are naturally drawn to that
activity so they're part of it

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:28.620 align:middle line:90%
and support it.

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:31.400 align:middle line:84%
And then setting up
a project manager

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.390 align:middle line:84%
to allocate the
people to each project

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:35.880 align:middle line:84%
so that we've got
the 15,000 hours

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:37.745 align:middle line:90%
allocated across the week.

00:22:37.745 --> 00:22:42.590 align:middle line:84%
This is huge, huge labor
force and production line

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:44.030 align:middle line:90%
that we just created here.

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:45.220 align:middle line:90%
And it's all for free.

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:46.800 align:middle line:90%
It's that simple, people.

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.000 align:middle line:84%
We've been so blinded by
the corporate structure.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.750 align:middle line:84%
We're constantly doing
something for others outside

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:52.550 align:middle line:90%
of ourselves.

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:54.760 align:middle line:84%
We're working for
corporations like slaves

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:56.500 align:middle line:84%
to create wealth
for the corporations

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:58.640 align:middle line:84%
or the municipalities
or the governments.

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:00.050 align:middle line:90%
Let's stop doing that.

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:03.570 align:middle line:84%
Let's start whatever it is
we do we do for ourselves,

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:05.710 align:middle line:84%
and it starts with
our communities.

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:08.090 align:middle line:84%
And from there it
grows and spills over.

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:13.910 align:middle line:84%
So what this is a great
example or an opportunity

00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:17.060 align:middle line:84%
for, as well, or
a demonstration of

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:21.540 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that this it brings
in the transitional phase.

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:23.680 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's got
three hours a week.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.500 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
give up your job.

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:27.890 align:middle line:84%
You can keep your
job in the bank

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:30.400 align:middle line:84%
and activate the people
in your bank with what

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.850 align:middle line:90%
you're doing in your community.

00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:34.433 align:middle line:84%
You can still get up at 5:00 in
the morning, put on your suit,

00:23:34.433 --> 00:23:37.290 align:middle line:84%
and drive into the city, or
wherever you've got your job

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:39.200 align:middle line:84%
and go do that
and come and spend

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.340 align:middle line:84%
three hours at night or
whenever on the weekend

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:44.800 align:middle line:84%
to do your community work
contributing to a community.

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:49.710 align:middle line:84%
And whatever you do, once again,
will be supported and valued

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:50.970 align:middle line:90%
by those around you.

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:53.940 align:middle line:84%
It's not just the
three hours a week

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:56.740 align:middle line:84%
that we create the
transitional phase in,

00:23:56.740 --> 00:24:01.880 align:middle line:84%
but this leads to abundance
very, very quickly.

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.340 align:middle line:84%
Because we're not just going
to get a bunch of people

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:07.830 align:middle line:84%
together to grow some food
like a bunch of hippies saying,

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:10.620 align:middle line:84%
hey, let's grow some
food over there, bro.

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:12.160 align:middle line:84%
This is not what
we're doing here.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:16.620 align:middle line:84%
This is a well planned, well
structured, well calculated

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:20.770 align:middle line:84%
exercise, and this is where
the whole Contributionism

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:22.920 align:middle line:90%
principal kicks in.

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And the whole idea of
creating abundance really

00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:30.710 align:middle line:84%
starts to come to
light, because whatever

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:36.460 align:middle line:84%
it is we do, whether its growing
potatoes or corn or cabbages

00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:41.880 align:middle line:84%
or wood factory or breeding fish
or whatever it is we're doing,

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:45.030 align:middle line:84%
it is worked out and calculated
based on the number of people

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:46.330 align:middle line:90%
in our community.

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:48.490 align:middle line:84%
When I say community,
it's the town, right?

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:50.130 align:middle line:90%
Town or village.

00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:54.190 align:middle line:84%
And then making sure
that we create or grow

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:57.330 align:middle line:84%
at least three times as
much as what we need,

00:24:57.330 --> 00:25:01.650 align:middle line:84%
because whether we sustain
ourselves and just create

00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:04.170 align:middle line:84%
enough for ourselves to
hang on for dear life,

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:06.290 align:middle line:84%
we might as well just
create three times as much

00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:08.550 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't take
three times as much effort.

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:10.360 align:middle line:84%
It probably takes
10% more effort

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:13.230 align:middle line:84%
to create three times
as much, if that.

00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:15.830 align:middle line:84%
So this is where the
abundance thing kicks in.

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:17.580 align:middle line:84%
So we create at least
three times as much.

00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:19.615 align:middle line:84%
So we have a plan
of action here,

00:25:19.615 --> 00:25:21.490 align:middle line:84%
and this is really
important to remember this

00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:24.110 align:middle line:84%
because when we get a
little further down when

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:27.030 align:middle line:84%
you go and claim your things
so you know that you can't just

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:30.140 align:middle line:84%
load your truck full of stuff
and drive off, because we've

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:33.300 align:middle line:84%
apportioned and
allocated produce

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:38.630 align:middle line:84%
and things to ourselves
very comfortably and very

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:39.430 align:middle line:90%
generously.

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:40.971 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
be stingy in this.

00:25:40.971 --> 00:25:42.710 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
be stingy, right?

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:45.530 align:middle line:84%
We can allocate as
much as we think.

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:47.395 align:middle line:84%
How many potatoes do
you need to eat a day?

00:25:47.395 --> 00:25:48.720 align:middle line:90%
Can you eat 10 potatoes a day?

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:49.595 align:middle line:90%
No, I don't think so.

00:25:49.595 --> 00:25:50.820 align:middle line:90%
That's too many.

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:55.060 align:middle line:84%
Can you eat two cobs
of corn every day?

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:57.507 align:middle line:84%
No, it's probably too
much, but you're seeing

00:25:57.507 --> 00:25:58.590 align:middle line:90%
where I'm going with this.

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:00.840 align:middle line:84%
So it's really well
planned and allocated

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:04.710 align:middle line:84%
so we've got more than enough
for every person every day,

00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:07.456 align:middle line:90%
and then three times as much.

00:26:07.456 --> 00:26:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's that
three times as much

00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:11.490 align:middle line:84%
that creates that abundance,
because what then happens

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:15.320 align:middle line:84%
is whatever we don't use within
our community we start selling

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:18.010 align:middle line:84%
and making available to the
people and the communities

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:19.740 align:middle line:90%
around us.

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:22.150 align:middle line:84%
But we can make that
available for a fraction

00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:25.980 align:middle line:84%
of the price of Walmart
or any other supermarket

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:29.320 align:middle line:84%
because we doing it
for virtually for free,

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:30.860 align:middle line:90%
and it's organic.

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:34.530 align:middle line:84%
And so we can under price
any other competitor

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:38.720 align:middle line:84%
so the moment we do this and we
start providing and supplying

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.960 align:middle line:84%
whatever we're doing for
ourselves to a neighboring

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:44.550 align:middle line:84%
communities, we've
affected their well-being.

00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to make them
do what we've just done.

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.710 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I
say Contributionism

00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:54.250 align:middle line:84%
devours and destroys capitalism
wherever it finds it.

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:58.200 align:middle line:84%
You cannot survive and continue
operating a capitalist system

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.570 align:middle line:84%
within close proximity of a
Contributionist community.

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:03.870 align:middle line:90%
It is just not possible.

00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:05.720 align:middle line:90%
It will get toppled.

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:10.170 align:middle line:84%
It will get destroyed for
the benefit of the people.

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's not going to take a
long time for the people in you

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:16.609 align:middle line:84%
neighboring communities
to want what you've got.

00:27:16.609 --> 00:27:18.400 align:middle line:84%
Why are they going to
want what you've got?

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Because suddenly they
realize that you've

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:24.450 align:middle line:84%
got free electricity, free
food, free milk, free bread,

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:27.510 align:middle line:84%
free eggs, free cheese, free
cream, fish, clothing, shoes,

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:32.300 align:middle line:84%
furniture-- whatever it is
we do is free for the people,

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:35.930 align:middle line:84%
just because you give
your three hours a week.

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:37.730 align:middle line:90%
And that's how simple it is.

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:40.780 align:middle line:84%
If you start doing
the numbers-- my mind

00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:44.050 align:middle line:84%
literally boggled when I started
putting the numbers together.

00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:48.330 align:middle line:84%
This is how we start
imitating the nature around us

00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:51.270 align:middle line:84%
and the laws of nature,
really creating abundance

00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:55.080 align:middle line:84%
like one apple tree doesn't
grow another apple tree.

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:58.100 align:middle line:84%
One apple tree grows
thousands of apple trees,

00:27:58.100 --> 00:27:59.630 align:middle line:90%
and that's what we're doing now.

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:02.830 align:middle line:84%
One community creates
abundance thousands

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:05.990 align:middle line:84%
of times of its own capacity,
and that's what we're becoming.

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:11.610 align:middle line:84%
We're becoming the fractal
capacity of the laws of nature

00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:15.020 align:middle line:84%
around us, and this
is really fantastic.

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:18.890 align:middle line:84%
Now the question is--
we're transitioning

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:22.960 align:middle line:84%
from today's really
divided society where

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:24.210 align:middle line:90%
we live in fear of each other.

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:26.230 align:middle line:84%
We don't know our
neighbors and so forth.

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:27.890 align:middle line:84%
It's different in
small communities,

00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:29.350 align:middle line:84%
and this is why
it's probably going

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:30.724 align:middle line:84%
to be a lot easier
to do it there

00:28:30.724 --> 00:28:33.294 align:middle line:84%
as well to unite the people
because they know each other.

00:28:33.294 --> 00:28:34.460 align:middle line:90%
They know they're neighbors.

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:35.460 align:middle line:90%
They talk to each other.

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:38.750 align:middle line:84%
They get together at the pub,
and it's a lot closer knit

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:41.190 align:middle line:90%
in the smaller communities.

00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:43.760 align:middle line:84%
But there still will
be fence-sitters.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:46.574 align:middle line:84%
The guys with the big SUVs that
have a fancy job in the city

00:28:46.574 --> 00:28:48.740 align:middle line:84%
but live in the town, and
they're going to say well,

00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:50.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to work
for three hours a week.

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:51.460 align:middle line:90%
I don't need to do that.

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:52.360 align:middle line:90%
I've got a fancy job.

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:53.360 align:middle line:90%
I don't need to do that.

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.280 align:middle line:90%
Why should I do that?

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, how do long
do you think they're

00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:58.063 align:middle line:90%
going to sit on the fence?

00:28:58.063 --> 00:29:00.200 align:middle line:90%


00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.840 align:middle line:84%
When at the end
of the first month

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:03.820 align:middle line:84%
everyone's getting
all the food for free,

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:08.860 align:middle line:84%
and at the end of
the first year people

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:11.830 align:middle line:84%
are getting everything for
free and this guy's still

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:12.950 align:middle line:90%
got a job in the city.

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:16.615 align:middle line:84%
He's still putting petrol in
his car, and buying everything.

00:29:16.615 --> 00:29:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And you're getting
everything for free.

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.614 align:middle line:84%
How long is he going to sit
on that fence until he says--

00:29:20.614 --> 00:29:22.761 align:middle line:84%
and paying for electricity,
by the way, right?

00:29:22.761 --> 00:29:24.760 align:middle line:84%
Remember so everyone's
getting free electricity,

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:26.960 align:middle line:84%
but he's still going
to be sent a bill.

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:30.939 align:middle line:84%
And then the Council of
Elders can actually decide,

00:29:30.939 --> 00:29:33.230 align:middle line:84%
what about the fence-sitters
because they're not really

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:35.063 align:middle line:84%
playing ball with the
rest of the community.

00:29:35.063 --> 00:29:38.189 align:middle line:84%
They say they are sort
of separating themselves

00:29:38.189 --> 00:29:39.480 align:middle line:90%
from the rest of the community.

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:40.870 align:middle line:84%
Everyone else is
working together

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:42.990 align:middle line:84%
and they want to be
special, so let's hike

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:45.060 align:middle line:84%
the price of the
electricity to those people.

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:46.740 align:middle line:90%
Everyone's getting it for free.

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:48.656 align:middle line:84%
They're going to pay
extra because they're not

00:29:48.656 --> 00:29:50.690 align:middle line:90%
contributing to the community.

00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:53.100 align:middle line:84%
You can do that as
the Council of Elders.

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:55.000 align:middle line:84%
So there's very
interesting things

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.485 align:middle line:90%
that could be happening here.

00:29:56.485 --> 00:29:58.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm not suggesting we
do that, because that's

00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:00.070 align:middle line:84%
acting like Capitalists,
but I'm just

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:03.670 align:middle line:84%
throwing out an example
of what could happen.

00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:07.230 align:middle line:84%
So I suggest that these
fence-sitters will probably

00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:10.010 align:middle line:84%
stop sitting on the fence very
quickly, especially when they

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:14.230 align:middle line:84%
start seeing their friends
not working, stopping work,

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:16.170 align:middle line:84%
and why are they
going to stop work?

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:18.880 align:middle line:84%
Because once we've got
these community projects

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:23.460 align:middle line:84%
going for a year or two
years, all the money

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:26.700 align:middle line:84%
that comes into
the projects keeps

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:30.130 align:middle line:84%
getting reallocated to
upgrade the projects

00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:33.220 align:middle line:84%
or improve the projects
and create new projects.

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And we constantly have
to create new project

00:30:35.150 --> 00:30:38.220 align:middle line:84%
because we need to create
components for other community

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:39.060 align:middle line:90%
projects, right?

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:43.640 align:middle line:84%
So if we get a bicycle factory
and we the spokes or the tubes,

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:45.890 align:middle line:84%
the tires, we're going
to create a project that

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:48.970 align:middle line:84%
creates the tires to supply
the bicycle factory, right?

00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:50.822 align:middle line:84%
So we're constantly
upgrading, creating

00:30:50.822 --> 00:30:51.780 align:middle line:90%
more and more projects.

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And this shows you how this
grows exponentially and just

00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:58.090 align:middle line:84%
creates more and more
opportunity and skills.

00:30:58.090 --> 00:30:59.770 align:middle line:90%
This is the important thing.

00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:01.960 align:middle line:84%
So let's get to the bullet
point plan of action,

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:06.320 align:middle line:84%
because I think this is
an interesting, quick scan

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:07.550 align:middle line:90%
of the plan of action.

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:09.930 align:middle line:90%
So we win the local election.

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:12.080 align:middle line:10%
We become the
political authority,

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.130 align:middle line:10%
and we implement
the plan of action.

00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:17.200 align:middle line:10%
This is why we can do it,
because we've given ourselves

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.000 align:middle line:10%
the right.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And the people have
voted us in to do

00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:21.850 align:middle line:90%
what we said we're going to do.

00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:24.500 align:middle line:10%
We install an Ubuntu
municipality and a Council

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:27.380 align:middle line:10%
of Elders, provide our
own electricity supply

00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:30.410 align:middle line:10%
for every town under
our control-- hydro

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:32.440 align:middle line:10%
or more exotic kind.

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is really
important to understand

00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:38.130 align:middle line:84%
the role of the
Council of Elders,

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:41.010 align:middle line:84%
and how you actually
hand over the control

00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:44.790 align:middle line:84%
of the town to the Council
of Elders almost immediately.

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:47.650 align:middle line:84%
So even as a mayor,
if and when I

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:51.680 align:middle line:84%
become the mayor of our little
municipality the first thing

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:55.310 align:middle line:84%
we do is start setting
up the Council of Elders.

00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And the Council of Elders
is not just one council.

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:02.317 align:middle line:84%
We suggest, for example, that
it's a Council of Elders that

00:32:02.317 --> 00:32:04.400 align:middle line:84%
could be probably mostly
men-- because that's just

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.680 align:middle line:90%
the way it works.

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And for that to
balance that equation

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:11.440 align:middle line:84%
we believe that we need to set
up a Council of Women and also

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.379 align:middle line:90%
a Youth Council.

00:32:12.379 --> 00:32:13.920 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
have three councils

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:16.930 align:middle line:84%
in the community that
represent the different sectors

00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:19.560 align:middle line:84%
of our community, especially
the Council of Women,

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:21.940 align:middle line:84%
because in this male
dominated society

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:23.870 align:middle line:84%
we find ourselves
in the role of women

00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:26.460 align:middle line:84%
have been being completely
undermined and negated

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:29.810 align:middle line:84%
and in many ways
suppressed to a level that

00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:31.760 align:middle line:90%
is quite unimaginable.

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.630 align:middle line:90%
So we need to correct that.

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:36.320 align:middle line:84%
So I think a Council of Women
is probably the right thing

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:37.850 align:middle line:90%
to do in the beginning.

00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:40.060 align:middle line:84%
But again, it's for
the people to decide.

00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:41.600 align:middle line:84%
What I'm saying
is that the moment

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.390 align:middle line:84%
we point a Council of
Elders, me as the mayor,

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:48.600 align:middle line:84%
no longer run the show
because I've automatically

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:51.920 align:middle line:84%
handed over the running of the
town to the Council of Elders.

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:53.710 align:middle line:84%
This is how
incredible the system

00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:56.950 align:middle line:84%
is so no one can point the
finger at me and say, Michael,

00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:59.430 align:middle line:90%
you're screwing this thing up.

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:02.220 align:middle line:84%
The Council is now
making the-- they can

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:05.570 align:middle line:84%
choose to consult me
and ask for guidance,

00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:06.890 align:middle line:90%
but that's their choice.

00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:11.730 align:middle line:84%
I just remain a political figure
that sits in the mayoral office

00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:14.660 align:middle line:84%
and does nothing, because
the consulate is actually

00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:17.450 align:middle line:84%
running and managing the
town and guiding the town

00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:20.050 align:middle line:84%
and creating the new
laws and new structures

00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:22.830 align:middle line:84%
and the guidance for the
town and the community.

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:27.350 align:middle line:84%
So we launch a diverse number
of community projects-- food,

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:30.260 align:middle line:84%
water, clean water,
especially in our town,

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:33.990 align:middle line:84%
improved health care,
engineering, bakery, et cetera.

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:36.000 align:middle line:84%
These are well-managed
and coordinated

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.730 align:middle line:84%
by a chosen team of
experts in that field.

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:40.860 align:middle line:84%
Everyone is asked to
contribute three hours a week

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:43.950 align:middle line:84%
for these project in return
for the free electricity.

00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:45.740 align:middle line:84%
Those who do not
participate continue

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:47.210 align:middle line:90%
to pay for electricity.

00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:50.200 align:middle line:84%
We turn our town into a powerful
labor force doing everything

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:53.120 align:middle line:84%
for ourselves, creating
abundance for our people

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.614 align:middle line:90%
and others around us.

00:33:54.614 --> 00:33:57.030 align:middle line:84%
Free electricity for everyone
that contributes three hours

00:33:57.030 --> 00:33:59.570 align:middle line:84%
a week to the project, free
electricity to all community

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:02.900 align:middle line:84%
projects, free labor for
all community projects.

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:06.500 align:middle line:84%
We create three times
abundance of everything we do.

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:11.250 align:middle line:84%
We export the 2/3 that we don't
need outside our community

00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:13.889 align:middle line:84%
at a price that
is very lucrative.

00:34:13.889 --> 00:34:17.830 align:middle line:10%
We invite all industry to become
part of the Community Project

00:34:17.830 --> 00:34:21.760 align:middle line:10%
pool and benefit immensely from
no labor cost, no electricity

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:25.310 align:middle line:10%
cost, and an increasing
supply of free components

00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:27.100 align:middle line:10%
as the projects
become integrated

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:29.540 align:middle line:10%
and start to supply
each other for free.

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:33.760 align:middle line:10%
Business owners retain one
third of the profits and the 2/3

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:35.280 align:middle line:10%
go to the community.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:38.850 align:middle line:10%
Interim generation of wealth,
which goes to the community

00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:40.199 align:middle line:10%
projects.

00:34:40.199 --> 00:34:42.320 align:middle line:10%
No corporation can
compete with us

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:45.840 align:middle line:10%
because we provide the
labor for free ourselves

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:48.489 align:middle line:10%
and an ever increasing
percentage of raw materials

00:34:48.489 --> 00:34:50.639 align:middle line:10%
and components.

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:53.120 align:middle line:84%
We activate more projects
and attract top talent

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:54.409 align:middle line:90%
in all areas.

00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:57.980 align:middle line:84%
Once the people feel the broad
benefits of so many levels,

00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:00.795 align:middle line:84%
the Ubuntu party will
never get voted out.

00:35:00.795 --> 00:35:01.670 align:middle line:90%
And that's the thing.

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:03.045 align:middle line:84%
The moment you
implement this, do

00:35:03.045 --> 00:35:05.490 align:middle line:84%
you think we'll ever get voted
out as a political party?

00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:07.330 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to happen.

00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:11.580 align:middle line:84%
And this is how you secure
your control of the town.

00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:12.990 align:middle line:90%
Control is such a terrible word.

00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:16.510 align:middle line:90%


00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:19.340 align:middle line:84%
The activating, the
stewardship of the town.

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:20.470 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:22.490 align:middle line:84%
So everything becomes
available for free

00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:24.330 align:middle line:84%
to all those who
participate in the project.

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:26.400 align:middle line:84%
Everything we do
eventually becomes a part

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:27.495 align:middle line:90%
of the community project.

00:35:27.495 --> 00:35:29.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go through
these in more detail.

00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:31.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm just spelling
these bullet points out

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:33.880 align:middle line:84%
so you can see where
we're going with this.

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.517 align:middle line:84%
Everything we do
eventually becomes

00:35:35.517 --> 00:35:37.850 align:middle line:84%
part of a community project,
and this is where it really

00:35:37.850 --> 00:35:39.180 align:middle line:90%
starts to unfold.

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:42.587 align:middle line:84%
No matter what you do in
your town, sooner or later

00:35:42.587 --> 00:35:44.670 align:middle line:84%
it's going to become part
of the community project

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:48.160 align:middle line:84%
because what you do is somehow
in some way going to benefit

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.714 align:middle line:90%
the people around you.

00:35:49.714 --> 00:35:51.880 align:middle line:84%
Whether you're a painter,
a sculptor, a horse breed,

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:54.940 align:middle line:84%
or a rubbish collector--
whatever it is that you do

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:56.670 align:middle line:84%
will benefit the
community around you.

00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
interesting example

00:35:58.810 --> 00:36:01.265 align:middle line:84%
of how completely united
the community becomes

00:36:01.265 --> 00:36:03.270 align:middle line:84%
and how integrated
everything is.

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:05.250 align:middle line:84%
Everything affects
everything else,

00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:07.410 align:middle line:84%
and everything supports
everything else.

00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:11.340 align:middle line:84%
Nothing is made to be special
or separate, because it's not.

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:14.390 align:middle line:84%
It's all there providing a
foundation for a cohesive,

00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:16.230 align:middle line:90%
united community.

00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:19.700 align:middle line:84%
This system creates a
new educational structure

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:21.860 align:middle line:84%
where people learn
valuable skills for life

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:23.690 align:middle line:90%
while doing community projects.

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:24.820 align:middle line:90%
Very important.

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:26.160 align:middle line:90%
We'll talk more about that.

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:28.750 align:middle line:84%
In a few years we'll have a
well-trained and highly skilled

00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:31.360 align:middle line:84%
community where everyone
can do everything--

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:32.800 align:middle line:90%
do everything-- and loving it.

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:36.110 align:middle line:84%
Using this one small town
as the first domino to fall,

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:38.640 align:middle line:84%
lead by example to
all other small towns.

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:42.140 align:middle line:84%
This will cause a win in the
national elections next time

00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:43.830 align:middle line:84%
we get around to the
national election,

00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:46.620 align:middle line:84%
because now suddenly you've
got all the towns running

00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:49.580 align:middle line:84%
this Contributionist
system it goes

00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:52.400 align:middle line:84%
to reason that we're going
to win the national elections

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:53.970 align:middle line:90%
without much effort.

00:36:53.970 --> 00:36:55.990 align:middle line:84%
So we start with one
tiny, little town.

00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:58.220 align:middle line:84%
This is why I say
it's so critical.

00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:01.250 align:middle line:84%
So converting our whole
country into a united community

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:04.730 align:middle line:84%
of abundant diversity on all
levels of human endeavor.

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:07.980 align:middle line:10%
Important considerations--
the transitional phase

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:10.180 align:middle line:10%
versus final destination.

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:12.520 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned already
the transitional phase

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:13.360 align:middle line:90%
is very simple.

00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:14.170 align:middle line:90%
Three hours a week.

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:15.880 align:middle line:84%
Everybody can afford
three hours a week,

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:21.090 align:middle line:84%
but we have to win the political
elections on the local level

00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:24.270 align:middle line:84%
with which to implement and
kick start this process.

00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:26.020 align:middle line:84%
Without the political
authority it's

00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:28.680 align:middle line:84%
going to be very
difficult to achieve this.

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:31.460 align:middle line:84%
So this is why I've
realized that we

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:36.880 align:middle line:84%
can use the political front
as a very critical and very

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:41.070 align:middle line:84%
clever and strategic tool to
help us speed up this process.

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:44.410 align:middle line:84%
Without the political victory
it might take us a lot longer,

00:37:44.410 --> 00:37:47.770 align:middle line:84%
and we can get bashed
down all the time.

00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:49.990 align:middle line:84%
So the effects on our
neighboring towns.

00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:52.760 align:middle line:90%


00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:55.860 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if I become the
mayor of a town like this,

00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:58.250 align:middle line:84%
and we implement this
philosophy and start

00:37:58.250 --> 00:38:01.700 align:middle line:84%
creating this abundance and
exporting it to our neighboring

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:05.350 align:middle line:84%
towns and destroying
their capitalist model,

00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:08.450 align:middle line:90%
or whatever the effect it has.

00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:14.090 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, the people of our
town not only become very happy

00:38:14.090 --> 00:38:16.600 align:middle line:84%
very quickly--
imagine how you will

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:19.640 align:middle line:84%
feel as the mayor of
the neighboring town?

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:22.960 align:middle line:84%
So if I become the town mayor
and we implement this-- what

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:25.760 align:middle line:84%
are you going to do as
the mayor of your town?

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:28.970 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to
resist doing the same,

00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:30.550 align:middle line:84%
or are you going
to continue running

00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:32.410 align:middle line:84%
your town on the same
capitalist model,

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:34.860 align:middle line:90%
keeping your people in misery?

00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:35.800 align:middle line:90%
The choice is yours.

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:38.860 align:middle line:84%
So what we do by
winning one little town

00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:43.540 align:middle line:84%
is we create a huge, invisible,
energetic, quantum effect

00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:45.540 align:middle line:90%
without having to say a word.

00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:47.670 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to go to
the neighboring towns,

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:50.080 align:middle line:84%
convince the mayor
to do the same.

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:52.991 align:middle line:84%
He will feel or she will
feel the pressure themselves.

00:38:52.991 --> 00:38:54.490 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
say a word to them.

00:38:54.490 --> 00:38:57.470 align:middle line:84%
We just carry on making
sure that what we do works

00:38:57.470 --> 00:39:00.180 align:middle line:84%
as best as it can possibly
work for our community,

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:02.010 align:middle line:84%
because that'll be
the energetic field

00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:04.540 align:middle line:84%
and the message on the
quantum level that gets

00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:05.960 align:middle line:90%
sent out to everyone.

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And that message doesn't just
go to the neighboring towns

00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:11.480 align:middle line:84%
and communities and
the mayors that'll

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:13.960 align:middle line:84%
be changing their tune
very, very quickly, that

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:15.920 align:middle line:90%
goes across the boarders.

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.130 align:middle line:90%
It goes into other countries.

00:39:17.130 --> 00:39:19.220 align:middle line:84%
It goes everywhere
around the world,

00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:22.920 align:middle line:84%
because people in Australia will
go wow, in South Africa look

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:23.720 align:middle line:90%
what they're doing.

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:25.850 align:middle line:84%
If they can do it there
we can do it here.

00:39:25.850 --> 00:39:28.540 align:middle line:84%
And already we have people that
are absorbing this philosophy

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:30.320 align:middle line:90%
all around the world.

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:33.970 align:middle line:84%
There are Ubuntu supporters
in every country or the world,

00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:36.950 align:middle line:84%
so that consciousness is
already reaching there.

00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:40.280 align:middle line:84%
This is how simply we can
spread this so quickly.

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:41.830 align:middle line:84%
But I want to
backtrack a little bit,

00:39:41.830 --> 00:39:43.420 align:middle line:84%
because I've changed
this presentation

00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:46.990 align:middle line:84%
for this particular
event and I messed up

00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:48.710 align:middle line:84%
my train of thought
a little bit,

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:50.690 align:middle line:84%
so I want to
backtrack a little bit

00:39:50.690 --> 00:39:53.240 align:middle line:84%
and just go back to
the community projects.

00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:56.732 align:middle line:84%
Once we start selling the
stuff out of our town--

00:39:56.732 --> 00:39:58.690 align:middle line:84%
remember that's in the
beginning while we still

00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:00.570 align:middle line:90%
live in a money-driven society.

00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:04.910 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, the 2/3 that we
create extra for ourselves

00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:07.100 align:middle line:84%
are going to be to share
with other communities that

00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:08.610 align:middle line:90%
don't have what we have.

00:40:08.610 --> 00:40:11.260 align:middle line:84%
So in the beginning is to
sell, and eventually when

00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:14.570 align:middle line:84%
we no longer and have the need
for money later down the road,

00:40:14.570 --> 00:40:16.250 align:middle line:84%
we then use that to
share with others.

00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:18.740 align:middle line:84%
We make that available
to every other community.

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:20.850 align:middle line:90%
So understand this.

00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:24.580 align:middle line:84%
There's not a greed factor built
into this because sometimes

00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:25.780 align:middle line:90%
people get confused by this.

00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:27.154 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're still
selling stuff.

00:40:27.154 --> 00:40:29.680 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, while we're still stuck
in a money-driven, capitalist

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:30.660 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:32.980 align:middle line:90%
We have to use money.

00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:35.700 align:middle line:84%
This is really important,
and sometimes people

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:36.570 align:middle line:90%
attack me for this.

00:40:36.570 --> 00:40:39.500 align:middle line:84%
They say, oh, Tellinger, if
this is such a clever idea,

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:42.080 align:middle line:84%
why don't you practice what
you preach and set this

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:43.810 align:middle line:90%
all up with no money?

00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:45.090 align:middle line:90%
I go, really?

00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:46.342 align:middle line:90%
Come on, you know?

00:40:46.342 --> 00:40:48.900 align:middle line:90%
Are you that dumb?

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:51.610 align:middle line:84%
The money system prevents
us from setting it up,

00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:54.920 align:middle line:90%
so that's why it's there.

00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:57.480 align:middle line:84%
Just remember the entire
global financial system

00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:00.300 align:middle line:84%
was structured so that
it destroys anything

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:03.610 align:middle line:90%
that tries to undermine it.

00:41:03.610 --> 00:41:05.990 align:middle line:84%
That's how it's set
up, and it's been

00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:08.640 align:middle line:90%
very successful in doing that.

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:10.610 align:middle line:84%
It's currently
right now everything

00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:12.390 align:middle line:84%
we're doing with
the Ubuntu movement

00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:14.380 align:middle line:84%
all the negative
feedback we get is always

00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:17.920 align:middle line:84%
about the money-- shutting
our bank account down

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:21.950 align:middle line:84%
or people claiming that
we're misusing the money.

00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:23.170 align:middle line:90%
It's always about the money.

00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:25.095 align:middle line:84%
They try and bring you
down and it's always

00:41:25.095 --> 00:41:25.970 align:middle line:90%
to do with the money.

00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:27.700 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:30.370 align:middle line:84%
So we have to
understand to implement

00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:34.650 align:middle line:84%
this process we have to use
the money to get ourselves

00:41:34.650 --> 00:41:36.120 align:middle line:90%
rid of the money.

00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:38.670 align:middle line:84%
We have to set up the
projects and the systems

00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:41.410 align:middle line:84%
and the structures to
create so much money.

00:41:41.410 --> 00:41:43.430 align:middle line:84%
I call it the
f-you money factor.

00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:46.186 align:middle line:84%
We have to have so much
money coming to our community

00:41:46.186 --> 00:41:48.060 align:middle line:84%
that we don't know what
to do with the money.

00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:50.405 align:middle line:84%
Oh, well what should we do
the $100 million we've got?

00:41:50.405 --> 00:41:51.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's build
a new hospital.

00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:52.110 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:53.236 align:middle line:90%
Let's build a new hospital.

00:41:53.236 --> 00:41:54.035 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:41:54.035 --> 00:41:54.855 align:middle line:90%
Because we can't.

00:41:54.855 --> 00:41:56.730 align:middle line:84%
And we've got the
technology and the research

00:41:56.730 --> 00:41:59.460 align:middle line:84%
labs and the scientists and
the healers that are there

00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:03.460 align:middle line:84%
to do the work, and they
doing it by choice, not

00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:04.510 align:middle line:90%
because their forced.

00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:07.560 align:middle line:84%
We set up the projects and they
start to make a lot of money.

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:08.770 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you one example.

00:42:08.770 --> 00:42:13.100 align:middle line:84%
Our town right now gets about
three million Rand a month.

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:17.340 align:middle line:84%
Let's say that's $300,000
a month, arguably.

00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:19.280 align:middle line:90%
That all disappears.

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:22.320 align:middle line:84%
One community project
alone-- our fish farm.

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:26.950 align:middle line:84%
A fish farm is capable
of breeding a million

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:29.750 align:middle line:90%
fish a month.

00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:31.820 align:middle line:84%
That's equivalent
about 10 million

00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:34.760 align:middle line:90%
Rand month, 10 Rand to fish.

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:38.520 align:middle line:84%
That's 10 million Rand a month
from one community project.

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:41.000 align:middle line:84%
We're get a three million Rand
a month from our government.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:44.360 align:middle line:84%
One project gives us three times
as much money as the government

00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:46.520 align:middle line:90%
gives the entire town.

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:50.760 align:middle line:84%
So imagine on our current list
we have about 24 community

00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:51.650 align:middle line:90%
projects.

00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:53.580 align:middle line:90%
Multiply that by 24.

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:55.080 align:middle line:84%
Not all of them are
going to be that

00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:58.920 align:middle line:84%
profitable for the community,
but what I'm saying

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:00.770 align:middle line:84%
is that the projects
are going to bring

00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:03.800 align:middle line:84%
in huge amounts of
money for our community,

00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:05.820 align:middle line:84%
especially if they're
managed by experts who

00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:07.321 align:middle line:90%
really know what they're doing.

00:43:07.321 --> 00:43:08.570 align:middle line:90%
And that's the key thing here.

00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:12.400 align:middle line:84%
It's not just a bunch of
dope smokers or people

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.565 align:middle line:84%
that say, hey, I'll
come and help you out.

00:43:14.565 --> 00:43:15.375 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:43:15.375 --> 00:43:16.880 align:middle line:90%
We choose the best people.

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:19.290 align:middle line:84%
If we need a baker
to run the bakery,

00:43:19.290 --> 00:43:21.410 align:middle line:84%
if we don't have a baker
we get the best baker

00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:24.070 align:middle line:84%
we can from France or Germany
to come and teach our people

00:43:24.070 --> 00:43:26.090 align:middle line:84%
how to bake, and
make sure that we

00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:29.390 align:middle line:84%
run the bakery to the best of
our capacity because we can

00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:31.720 align:middle line:90%
and we choose to do that.

00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:33.930 align:middle line:84%
So every project
is managed and run

00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:37.340 align:middle line:84%
on that highest possible
quality level, which

00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:40.020 align:middle line:84%
means that the money that
comes in portions of it

00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:42.507 align:middle line:84%
will always go into upgrading
and creating more project,

00:43:42.507 --> 00:43:45.090 align:middle line:84%
but we're not going to spend all
the money on all the projects

00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:47.440 align:middle line:84%
all the time, so what do we
do the rest of the money?

00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:49.800 align:middle line:84%
We distribute it to the
people that participate

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:51.540 align:middle line:90%
in the community projects.

00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:53.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've done some
calculations on this

00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:57.750 align:middle line:84%
and once again, it's mind
blowing to see what happens.

00:43:57.750 --> 00:44:00.245 align:middle line:84%
Within a year or two,
the amount of money

00:44:00.245 --> 00:44:01.620 align:middle line:84%
we will be
distributing-- and I'm

00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:05.370 align:middle line:84%
using my town, Waterval
Boven, as an example.

00:44:05.370 --> 00:44:11.510 align:middle line:84%
A community of 5,000 people
will be distributing twice as

00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:15.470 align:middle line:84%
much money to everyone
that participates

00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:18.850 align:middle line:84%
and I'm basing that so let's
say 3,000 people of the 5,000

00:44:18.850 --> 00:44:20.080 align:middle line:90%
participate.

00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:23.970 align:middle line:84%
We'll be distributing twice
as much money to every one

00:44:23.970 --> 00:44:29.251 align:middle line:84%
than the current monthly
salary is in South Africa.

00:44:29.251 --> 00:44:31.500 align:middle line:84%
Everyone in our town will
be getting about 10,000 Rand

00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:33.820 align:middle line:84%
a month if you do
the numbers when

00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:36.483 align:middle line:84%
the current monthly salary
is probably around 5,000 Rand

00:44:36.483 --> 00:44:37.410 align:middle line:90%
a month.

00:44:37.410 --> 00:44:42.750 align:middle line:84%
So you work for three hours
a week, everything is free,

00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:45.790 align:middle line:84%
you're working
and enjoying life.

00:44:45.790 --> 00:44:47.790 align:middle line:84%
Your life is
improving all the time

00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:49.900 align:middle line:84%
and you get money at
the end of every month

00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:52.060 align:middle line:90%
for working three hours a week.

00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:54.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that I believe is
the foundation of creating

00:44:54.490 --> 00:44:58.530 align:middle line:84%
paradise and creating the
camaraderie and the friendship

00:44:58.530 --> 00:45:01.080 align:middle line:84%
and the unity within
that community

00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:04.810 align:middle line:84%
and constantly coming up
with new and clever artistic,

00:45:04.810 --> 00:45:07.590 align:middle line:84%
cultural ideas to
uplift your community.

00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:11.220 align:middle line:84%
So that's what happens
with the money.

00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:13.280 align:middle line:84%
Remember the other thing
that we're going to do?

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:17.620 align:middle line:84%
When I become mayor, if I become
mayor-- or any Ubuntu party

00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:20.480 align:middle line:84%
mayor-- the first thing
you do is you go our

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:22.880 align:middle line:90%
and you make a public statement.

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And remember, you're not
the political authority.

00:45:24.970 --> 00:45:27.136 align:middle line:84%
So you're speaking from a
different kind of position

00:45:27.136 --> 00:45:32.600 align:middle line:84%
of-- I guess authority
is a terrible word

00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:36.970 align:middle line:84%
but-- with resonance with
the public around the world.

00:45:36.970 --> 00:45:40.730 align:middle line:84%
You're speaking as the mayor,
not as a leader of some ground

00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:42.350 align:middle line:90%
movement.

00:45:42.350 --> 00:45:45.460 align:middle line:84%
As a mayor you invite all the
healers and the scientists

00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:46.760 align:middle line:90%
in the world to come.

00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Those that can cure
disease and cure cancer

00:45:48.690 --> 00:45:50.610 align:middle line:84%
to come into your
own and community,

00:45:50.610 --> 00:45:53.190 align:middle line:84%
and you'll set them
up into a laboratory

00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:55.540 align:middle line:84%
and give them whatever
they need to develop

00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:57.287 align:middle line:90%
the cures for all disease.

00:45:57.287 --> 00:45:59.370 align:middle line:84%
How long do you think it's
going to take for those

00:45:59.370 --> 00:46:01.930 align:middle line:90%
healers to come to your town?

00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:03.560 align:middle line:90%
They'll be there within a week.

00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:06.280 align:middle line:84%
From all over the world they'll
be knocking on your door

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:07.790 align:middle line:84%
because they're
never, ever provided

00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:09.040 align:middle line:90%
with those kind of facilities.

00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:13.000 align:middle line:84%
They always have to do it behind
the scenes and hidden from.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:14.910 align:middle line:84%
Now you're opening it
up and you're telling

00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:16.250 align:middle line:90%
the world what you doing.

00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:18.732 align:middle line:84%
You don't make the
mistake that JFK did.

00:46:18.732 --> 00:46:20.190 align:middle line:84%
You don't hide the
fact that you're

00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:21.980 align:middle line:90%
going to print your own money.

00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:23.800 align:middle line:84%
We invite the scientists
and the inventors

00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:26.010 align:middle line:84%
that can create free
energy into our community.

00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:26.810 align:middle line:90%
Come.

00:46:26.810 --> 00:46:27.750 align:middle line:90%
We'll give you the labs.

00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:30.166 align:middle line:84%
We'll give you whatever you
need, the research facilities,

00:46:30.166 --> 00:46:33.000 align:middle line:84%
to create alternative
energy devices.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And then we share
it with the world.

00:46:35.330 --> 00:46:40.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, do you know how much
money medical tourism creates?

00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:43.870 align:middle line:84%
It's a huge global industry,
and in South Africa,

00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:46.450 align:middle line:84%
it is one of the
biggest industries is

00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:47.840 align:middle line:90%
the medical tourism industry.

00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:49.567 align:middle line:84%
On the one hand, our
government hospitals

00:46:49.567 --> 00:46:51.400 align:middle line:84%
will kill you if you
go in there because you

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:54.920 align:middle line:84%
get some secondary infection
and because they're

00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:57.860 align:middle line:84%
just so badly managed from
being some of the best

00:46:57.860 --> 00:46:59.220 align:middle line:90%
hospitals in the world.

00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And on the other hand, we've
got our private hospitals

00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:04.780 align:middle line:84%
that have tourist from
all over the world come

00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:08.979 align:middle line:84%
pay billions of dollars every
year to have surgery performed

00:47:08.979 --> 00:47:11.520 align:middle line:84%
in South Africa because it's a
lot cheaper and then they come

00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:12.710 align:middle line:90%
and have a holiday.

00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:15.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, imagine our little hospital
in our little town where we've

00:47:15.830 --> 00:47:17.330 align:middle line:84%
got the best healers
is in the world

00:47:17.330 --> 00:47:20.630 align:middle line:84%
and we're actually curing
cancer and other diseases,

00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:22.540 align:middle line:84%
how long do you think
it's going to take

00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:24.390 align:middle line:84%
for the first millionaires
to arrive there?

00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:26.700 align:middle line:84%
Millionaires with
cancer to be cured.

00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:30.260 align:middle line:84%
They'll be knocking at our
door within the first month.

00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:33.600 align:middle line:84%
What will happen once we cure
the first multimillionaire

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:34.540 align:middle line:90%
with cancer?

00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:37.650 align:middle line:84%
We have immediately created
the best possible protection

00:47:37.650 --> 00:47:38.690 align:middle line:90%
for ourselves.

00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:41.060 align:middle line:84%
No amount of money
could ever buy,

00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:43.640 align:middle line:84%
because suddenly
everyone with cancer,

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:45.810 align:middle line:84%
all the rich people in
the world with cancer,

00:47:45.810 --> 00:47:49.960 align:middle line:84%
will be your biggest support
and ally and your protector.

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:51.010 align:middle line:90%
That's what happens.

00:47:51.010 --> 00:47:52.990 align:middle line:84%
This is why you
have to open it up.

00:47:52.990 --> 00:47:54.290 align:middle line:90%
You have to talk about it.

00:47:54.290 --> 00:47:57.680 align:middle line:84%
You have to shout it
from the mountaintop.

00:47:57.680 --> 00:47:59.750 align:middle line:84%
Put it out on the
media, and you have

00:47:59.750 --> 00:48:03.500 align:middle line:84%
to put together to start off
with virtually immediately

00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:07.040 align:middle line:84%
a very powerful PR and
marketing team for your town

00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:08.980 align:middle line:84%
to constantly put
out the good news,

00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:10.610 align:middle line:84%
because there will
immediately be

00:48:10.610 --> 00:48:14.370 align:middle line:84%
a backlash from the
Rothschild Banking Empire

00:48:14.370 --> 00:48:16.790 align:middle line:84%
to try and shut you
down, to try and make

00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:18.370 align:middle line:84%
you look like a
bunch of lunatics

00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:19.960 align:middle line:90%
that you're trying to do.

00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And they'll tell come
up with all kinds

00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:24.290 align:middle line:90%
of mud slinging at you.

00:48:24.290 --> 00:48:27.250 align:middle line:84%
It's always pedophilia,
pornography, or something

00:48:27.250 --> 00:48:28.234 align:middle line:90%
like that, right?

00:48:28.234 --> 00:48:29.900 align:middle line:84%
So they'll try and
turn your little town

00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:31.910 align:middle line:84%
into this devilish,
demonish place

00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:35.295 align:middle line:84%
where you're torturing children
or something like that.

00:48:35.295 --> 00:48:36.670 align:middle line:84%
So you have to be
ready for that,

00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:39.240 align:middle line:84%
and you've got to make sure
that your publicity goes out

00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:40.040 align:middle line:90%
every day.

00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:42.414 align:middle line:84%
That you're telling the people
of the world the good news

00:48:42.414 --> 00:48:44.710 align:middle line:84%
and showing them the
good news, so no amount

00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:47.700 align:middle line:84%
of bad PR from the
elite will undo what

00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:49.630 align:middle line:90%
you're doing in your community.

00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:53.250 align:middle line:84%
These are all very important
strategic considerations.

00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:55.010 align:middle line:84%
This is something
big we doing here.

00:48:55.010 --> 00:48:56.910 align:middle line:90%
This is not a little thing.

00:48:56.910 --> 00:49:00.580 align:middle line:84%
It's going to take one little
town somewhere in the world

00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:04.550 align:middle line:84%
to destroy and collapse the
entire global capitalist model.

00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:06.400 align:middle line:84%
That's how powerful
this is, and I

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:08.450 align:middle line:84%
hope you can start
seeing how simple it is.

00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:11.000 align:middle line:84%
Three hours a week,
that's all it takes.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.410 align:middle line:90%
But it takes working together.

00:49:13.410 --> 00:49:17.354 align:middle line:84%
It takes cooperation
and collaboration.

00:49:17.354 --> 00:49:19.020 align:middle line:84%
So we're coming to
the end of this hour.

00:49:19.020 --> 00:49:22.800 align:middle line:90%
It felt like five minutes.

00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:25.440 align:middle line:90%
Any comments or questions?

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:26.540 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you, Michael.

00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:29.222 align:middle line:84%
Can you elaborate a little
bit on where you came up

00:49:29.222 --> 00:49:30.870 align:middle line:90%
with the three hours a week?

00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:35.140 align:middle line:84%
I know several people that put
in 40, 50, 60, 80 hours a week,

00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:37.740 align:middle line:84%
and at the week
they're still behind.

00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:40.600 align:middle line:84%
So can you just share
a little bit more

00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:44.110 align:middle line:84%
on how-- the three hours--
how you came up with that?

00:49:44.110 --> 00:49:46.360 align:middle line:84%
>>Thanks very much for
asking that question.

00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:49.300 align:middle line:84%
It's really just holy
trinity number, right?

00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:52.120 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned earlier that all
the numbers and the structure

00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:55.830 align:middle line:84%
we work with has to flow with
the natural flow of nature--

00:49:55.830 --> 00:49:57.650 align:middle line:90%
sacred geometry.

00:49:57.650 --> 00:49:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't do
that we're constantly

00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:01.840 align:middle line:84%
at odds with the
natural flow of energy

00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:03.340 align:middle line:90%
through the natural process.

00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:06.320 align:middle line:84%
So everything we do
has to keep bringing

00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:08.740 align:middle line:84%
that into consideration,
and three hours a week

00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:11.860 align:middle line:84%
is just a number that
I started working with.

00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:13.770 align:middle line:84%
I started working with
much larger numbers,

00:50:13.770 --> 00:50:17.110 align:middle line:84%
and then I realized that
it's completely unnecessary.

00:50:17.110 --> 00:50:19.360 align:middle line:84%
We're still thinking
from a capitalist model.

00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:22.844 align:middle line:84%
The reason we work for 40, 50,
60 hours of 70 hours a week

00:50:22.844 --> 00:50:24.760 align:middle line:84%
is because that's how
the capitalist model has

00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:25.931 align:middle line:90%
been structured.

00:50:25.931 --> 00:50:26.930 align:middle line:90%
Remember, it's scarcity.

00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:28.720 align:middle line:84%
It's all about
scarcity, and it's

00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:31.190 align:middle line:84%
you working for
yourself to earn money.

00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:34.790 align:middle line:84%
You're not working
mostly for corporations,

00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:36.930 align:middle line:84%
even if you work as
a plumber and you're

00:50:36.930 --> 00:50:39.190 align:middle line:84%
working for yourself, you're
still working for money.

00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:40.860 align:middle line:84%
You're not working
to great abundance

00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:42.590 align:middle line:90%
for a whole community.

00:50:42.590 --> 00:50:45.210 align:middle line:84%
So if you think about
the amount of energy

00:50:45.210 --> 00:50:48.050 align:middle line:84%
that we waste on a
daily basis because

00:50:48.050 --> 00:50:50.430 align:middle line:84%
of the capitalist
model, it's spectacular.

00:50:50.430 --> 00:50:54.620 align:middle line:84%
90% of what we do
is wasted energy.

00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:58.520 align:middle line:84%
When you start breaking it down
from the moment you wake up

00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:02.220 align:middle line:84%
in the morning and your open
your eyes, the things you do,

00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:07.760 align:middle line:84%
where you go, where you travel,
where you drive, who you phone,

00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:10.820 align:middle line:84%
the time you spend doing things,
most of it is wasted energy.

00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:12.070 align:middle line:90%
It's chasing money.

00:51:12.070 --> 00:51:14.980 align:middle line:90%
It is not creating abundance.

00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you start
realizing how completely upside

00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:19.730 align:middle line:90%
down the entire system is.

00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:23.130 align:middle line:84%
We need to spend a fraction
of the time working together

00:51:23.130 --> 00:51:25.500 align:middle line:84%
to create the abundance,
and this is where we start,

00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:28.330 align:middle line:84%
as I mentioned,
replicating or recreating

00:51:28.330 --> 00:51:32.570 align:middle line:84%
the laws of abundance we
find around us in nature.

00:51:32.570 --> 00:51:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And the three hours a week-- you
could do the numbers yourself.

00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:37.290 align:middle line:90%
It's spectacular.

00:51:37.290 --> 00:51:40.810 align:middle line:84%
A town of 5,000 people,
15,000 hours a week.

00:51:40.810 --> 00:51:42.550 align:middle line:84%
You need a lot of
community projects

00:51:42.550 --> 00:51:47.070 align:middle line:84%
to put the people to work,
so you see how fruitful

00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:48.690 align:middle line:90%
it becomes so quickly.

00:51:48.690 --> 00:51:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And I'll talk more
about examples,

00:51:50.570 --> 00:51:54.710 align:middle line:84%
how we incorporate companies,
existing factories, existing

00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:57.230 align:middle line:84%
businesses-- how those
are incorporated in this.

00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:58.890 align:middle line:90%
No one is ever excluded.

00:51:58.890 --> 00:52:02.740 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it becomes so lucrative
for companies and corporations

00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:05.570 align:middle line:84%
and factories that are
currently in your town

00:52:05.570 --> 00:52:07.200 align:middle line:84%
and outside of
your town, everyone

00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:08.850 align:middle line:84%
will be migrating
to your community

00:52:08.850 --> 00:52:12.010 align:middle line:84%
to become one of your community
project because of the benefits

00:52:12.010 --> 00:52:13.760 align:middle line:90%
that we've created.

00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:15.080 align:middle line:90%
It is spectacular.

00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:18.250 align:middle line:84%
The energetic explosion
of the abundance

00:52:18.250 --> 00:52:20.190 align:middle line:84%
we create and how
we attract everyone

00:52:20.190 --> 00:52:23.900 align:middle line:84%
around us is beyond
belief because we've never

00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:25.450 align:middle line:90%
experienced it.

00:52:25.450 --> 00:52:27.630 align:middle line:84%
We are so poisoned
by this capitalists

00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:31.610 align:middle line:84%
system for so many hundreds
and thousands of years.

00:52:31.610 --> 00:52:33.160 align:middle line:90%
There was a question here?

00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:36.990 align:middle line:84%
>>I can totally see how this
would work after it's working.

00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:37.790 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:41.030 align:middle line:84%
>>And how much
abundance there would be

00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:42.810 align:middle line:90%
created in a very short time.

00:52:42.810 --> 00:52:44.800 align:middle line:84%
For one reason, because
when you take out

00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:47.900 align:middle line:84%
everything that is
related to money

00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:50.890 align:middle line:84%
there's not that much left to
do, because so much that we do

00:52:50.890 --> 00:52:53.720 align:middle line:84%
is to make the money, to protect
the money, to save the money,

00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:57.240 align:middle line:84%
to count the money, to ensure
the money, all of that.

00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of
been a hobby of mine

00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:00.850 align:middle line:84%
since I read your book
a couple years ago.

00:53:00.850 --> 00:53:04.009 align:middle line:84%
It was like, looking at all the
people's jobs and saying, well,

00:53:04.009 --> 00:53:05.050 align:middle line:90%
they don't need that job.

00:53:05.050 --> 00:53:06.050 align:middle line:90%
We wouldn't need that job.

00:53:06.050 --> 00:53:07.200 align:middle line:90%
We wouldn't need that job.

00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:09.310 align:middle line:84%
So many things wouldn't
need to be done,

00:53:09.310 --> 00:53:11.180 align:middle line:90%
but that's after we get there.

00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm wondering if
you could clarify for me--

00:53:14.350 --> 00:53:19.690 align:middle line:84%
I imagine you made this point,
but I need more clarification--

00:53:19.690 --> 00:53:22.410 align:middle line:84%
where does the
initial money come

00:53:22.410 --> 00:53:25.910 align:middle line:84%
from when we've got
this mayor and we've

00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:28.890 align:middle line:84%
got this Council of Elders
and we've got this project.

00:53:28.890 --> 00:53:31.150 align:middle line:84%
But in order to get the
supplies for the project,

00:53:31.150 --> 00:53:32.210 align:middle line:90%
even the labor is free.

00:53:32.210 --> 00:53:35.690 align:middle line:84%
I understand that,
but the goods are not.

00:53:35.690 --> 00:53:41.180 align:middle line:84%
We pay to buy the stuff to
put the generator together

00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:42.850 align:middle line:90%
and to distribute it.

00:53:42.850 --> 00:53:44.580 align:middle line:84%
So where does the
initial money come

00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:49.110 align:middle line:84%
from before we have this
abundance that we're selling

00:53:49.110 --> 00:53:50.860 align:middle line:90%
to our communities around us?

00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:51.805 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you.

00:53:51.805 --> 00:53:55.990 align:middle line:84%
A very important question,
so let me recap on that.

00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:59.690 align:middle line:84%
The municipality gets
money from government.

00:53:59.690 --> 00:54:01.850 align:middle line:84%
We get a lump sum of
money every month.

00:54:01.850 --> 00:54:04.350 align:middle line:84%
That money is for
social services,

00:54:04.350 --> 00:54:07.430 align:middle line:84%
to keep the town clean,
to remove the rubble,

00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:12.230 align:middle line:84%
to upgrade the sports fields,
to run the town hall, to provide

00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:15.056 align:middle line:84%
services to the community,
including electricity for which

00:54:15.056 --> 00:54:16.750 align:middle line:90%
they will then charge us.

00:54:16.750 --> 00:54:19.180 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of money
that comes into the town,

00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:21.810 align:middle line:84%
but that money is used in
a way that doesn't really

00:54:21.810 --> 00:54:23.000 align:middle line:90%
benefit the people.

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.140 align:middle line:84%
Most of that money
is used in a way

00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:28.930 align:middle line:84%
to uphold the structures
that keep the municipality

00:54:28.930 --> 00:54:30.810 align:middle line:90%
in control, right?

00:54:30.810 --> 00:54:32.070 align:middle line:90%
So we're going to change that.

00:54:32.070 --> 00:54:34.060 align:middle line:84%
We're going to use
the money to create

00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:37.210 align:middle line:84%
the structures that great
abundance for the people.

00:54:37.210 --> 00:54:40.010 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
community projects

00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:42.520 align:middle line:90%
don't need a lot of money.

00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:45.790 align:middle line:84%
So if you say, for example,
breakdown three million

00:54:45.790 --> 00:54:51.180 align:middle line:84%
Rand month in to 20
community projects.

00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:54.820 align:middle line:84%
20 community projects
at 50,000 Rand

00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:57.530 align:middle line:84%
per project as an injection
so they can operate,

00:54:57.530 --> 00:54:59.020 align:middle line:90%
that's one million Rand.

00:54:59.020 --> 00:55:00.670 align:middle line:90%
That's 20 community project.

00:55:00.670 --> 00:55:03.570 align:middle line:84%
50,000 Rand a month is a lot
of money where I come from.

00:55:03.570 --> 00:55:06.150 align:middle line:84%
You can run a very
successful community project

00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:07.880 align:middle line:90%
with that kind of money.

00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:09.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's just
one third of what

00:55:09.590 --> 00:55:11.590 align:middle line:84%
are we getting from
government right now.

00:55:11.590 --> 00:55:14.050 align:middle line:84%
Three million Rand and
one million Rand that

00:55:14.050 --> 00:55:16.770 align:middle line:84%
can fund 20 projects,
so I hope that gives you

00:55:16.770 --> 00:55:19.830 align:middle line:84%
some indication of where the
money is going to come from.

00:55:19.830 --> 00:55:21.490 align:middle line:84%
Every town, every
country will have

00:55:21.490 --> 00:55:23.780 align:middle line:84%
their own set of
challenges obviously

00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:25.940 align:middle line:84%
and set of
circumstances, but what

00:55:25.940 --> 00:55:30.000 align:middle line:84%
it also does the moment we
become the political authority

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:36.420 align:middle line:84%
and I as the mayor can go out
to the global crowd-funding

00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:38.930 align:middle line:84%
or conscious
billionaires and say hey,

00:55:38.930 --> 00:55:41.200 align:middle line:84%
this is the kind of community
we're creating here.

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:42.230 align:middle line:90%
We need your help.

00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:43.260 align:middle line:90%
We need your funding.

00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:44.880 align:middle line:90%
We need your input.

00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:47.130 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to take
long before the conscious

00:55:47.130 --> 00:55:49.110 align:middle line:84%
billionaires to
come out and say,

00:55:49.110 --> 00:55:51.930 align:middle line:84%
wow, I want to be part
of making this a success,

00:55:51.930 --> 00:55:54.560 align:middle line:84%
even if there's not enough
money coming from government.

00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:57.800 align:middle line:84%
As the political authority
you have much more clout

00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:01.230 align:middle line:84%
to invite the money and
funding in from other sources,

00:56:01.230 --> 00:56:03.220 align:middle line:84%
much more clout then I
would as an individual

00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:05.864 align:middle line:84%
running a little
nonprofit company.

00:56:05.864 --> 00:56:07.030 align:middle line:90%
And that changes everything.

00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:09.130 align:middle line:84%
That's why the
political aspect of it

00:56:09.130 --> 00:56:12.606 align:middle line:84%
is so important that we have
to win on a political level.

00:56:12.606 --> 00:56:13.605 align:middle line:90%
That changes everything.

00:56:13.605 --> 00:56:18.040 align:middle line:90%


00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:22.235 align:middle line:90%
>>Hi, Patrick-- or Michael.

00:56:22.235 --> 00:56:23.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm Patrick.

00:56:23.350 --> 00:56:30.460 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to say in the slide
earlier about one third,

00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:32.710 align:middle line:84%
one third, one
third, I know this

00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:38.130 align:middle line:84%
is a really practical applied
equation to manufacturing

00:56:38.130 --> 00:56:40.190 align:middle line:90%
and any kind of an industry.

00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:45.380 align:middle line:84%
If you allow one third for the
house, a third for the future,

00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:50.930 align:middle line:84%
and a third for those people
that produce that in my opinion

00:56:50.930 --> 00:56:54.010 align:middle line:84%
it's an excellent and
very successful premise.

00:56:54.010 --> 00:56:54.810 align:middle line:90%
>>Wow.

00:56:54.810 --> 00:56:55.830 align:middle line:90%
Thanks very much.

00:56:55.830 --> 00:57:01.705 align:middle line:84%
And I'll talk more about this in
the next episode how the three

00:57:01.705 --> 00:57:05.110 align:middle line:84%
thirds get broken up in when
you start inviting existing

00:57:05.110 --> 00:57:10.750 align:middle line:84%
factories and farmer and
manufacturers into the equation

00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:13.970 align:middle line:84%
how incredible it is
because it literally

00:57:13.970 --> 00:57:17.390 align:middle line:84%
becomes like a magnet for anyone
who's doing anything right now.

00:57:17.390 --> 00:57:19.482 align:middle line:84%
And I speak from
experience here.

00:57:19.482 --> 00:57:21.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm not thinking that
they want to participate.

00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:23.980 align:middle line:84%
I've already had these
discussions with farmers.

00:57:23.980 --> 00:57:25.669 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the farmers
around our town

00:57:25.669 --> 00:57:27.210 align:middle line:84%
have already offered
us they're land.

00:57:27.210 --> 00:57:28.750 align:middle line:90%
They want to participate.

00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:32.282 align:middle line:84%
They want to feel part of
this new way of doing things.

00:57:32.282 --> 00:57:34.240 align:middle line:84%
They want to know that
their land is being used

00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:35.740 align:middle line:90%
for the good of the community.

00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:37.230 align:middle line:84%
That's not even a
problem, but I've

00:57:37.230 --> 00:57:42.150 align:middle line:84%
spoken to others farmers unions
like one of the wine farmers

00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:43.380 align:middle line:90%
unions from the Western Cape.

00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And you know, wine farmers
can be I guess quite arrogant

00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:48.520 align:middle line:84%
because they produce a high
end product and a lot of them

00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:51.350 align:middle line:84%
make a lot of money, when
I shared the idea with them

00:57:51.350 --> 00:57:54.000 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't even a matter
of debate or discussion,

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.470 align:middle line:90%
it's like when can we start?

00:57:56.470 --> 00:57:58.340 align:middle line:84%
That's normally the
standard answer,

00:57:58.340 --> 00:58:00.500 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to go
into a bit more detail

00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:01.540 align:middle line:90%
in the next episode.

00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:03.940 align:middle line:84%
So thanks very much for
being here once again,

00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:06.820 align:middle line:84%
and we'll continue
this exciting story

00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:09.330 align:middle line:84%
to take it to its
final conclusion

00:58:09.330 --> 00:58:10.714 align:middle line:90%
in the next two episodes.

00:58:10.714 --> 00:58:11.630 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for being here.

00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:17.035 align:middle line:90%


00:58:17.035 --> 00:58:20.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm Michael Tellinger,
and thanks for watching.

00:58:20.350 --> 00:58:24.426 align:middle line:90%
