00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.200 align:middle line:10%
>>Hello, this is
Michael Tellinger,

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.260 align:middle line:10%
and I'd like to take
a journey of discovery

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.840 align:middle line:10%
with you to look
into the ancient past

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.480 align:middle line:10%
and see what kind of
wisdom we can pick up

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.790 align:middle line:10%
from the ancient civilizations,
wisdom and information

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.910 align:middle line:10%
and knowledge that
we can possibly

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.890 align:middle line:10%
put to the use of humankind
today and into the future.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.630 align:middle line:84%
I've been traveling
around the world

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.120 align:middle line:84%
and doing these lectures
on the origins of humankind

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.260 align:middle line:84%
and a new social
structure called UBUNTU

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.560 align:middle line:90%
and contributionism since 2006.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And what I find is that there is
a 100% level of dissatisfaction

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.430 align:middle line:84%
with the people that I
come face to face with.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.650 align:middle line:84%
I've been asking the same
question over and over

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.375 align:middle line:84%
again to all the
people in 10 years

00:00:59.375 --> 00:01:02.930 align:middle line:84%
that I've been talking
to and connecting with.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.269 align:middle line:84%
And that question
is, how many of you

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.000 align:middle line:84%
are happy with the way
the world is going?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.080 align:middle line:84%
How many of you are
happy with your life?

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.610 align:middle line:84%
How many of you
believe that you're

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.100 align:middle line:90%
fulfilling your life's dreams?

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.430 align:middle line:84%
How many of you believe
that the governments are

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.550 align:middle line:84%
doing a great job and serving
the people that they're

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.350 align:middle line:90%
supposed to serve?

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And in 10 years, I can tell you
that not one person has ever

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.360 align:middle line:84%
put up their hand to say that
they are happy with what's

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.040 align:middle line:90%
going on in the world.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.380 align:middle line:84%
So clearly we have
a big problem,

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.190 align:middle line:84%
and we need to find
solutions for this problem.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And in this series, we're
going to look into the past,

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.000 align:middle line:84%
learn from the
ancient civilizations,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.440 align:middle line:84%
discover some phenomenal
and fascinating knowledge

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.470 align:middle line:84%
and information, and
find a way to put

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.110 align:middle line:84%
that ancient knowledge to use
for humanity into the future.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.110 align:middle line:84%
While some of the
knowledge and information

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.820 align:middle line:84%
we're going to find
and discover might

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.620 align:middle line:84%
seem dark and sinister and
depressing and quite scary

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.520 align:middle line:84%
at times, I'd like you
to see it differently.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.720 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to see it as
liberating and enlightening

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.100 align:middle line:84%
information that will give us
the platform and the foundation

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.030 align:middle line:84%
to build a new social structure
for humanity, a new foundation

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.270 align:middle line:84%
into the future based on real
knowledge and information

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.530 align:middle line:84%
about the human race and the
true history of this planet.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.734 align:middle line:10%
So let's start this journey.

00:02:29.734 --> 00:02:31.650 align:middle line:10%
What are we going to
talk about in the series?

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.025 align:middle line:10%
We're going to
talk about origins

00:02:33.025 --> 00:02:36.260 align:middle line:10%
of humankind, ancient
vanished civilization.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.070 align:middle line:10%
We're going to talk about their
advanced technology, which

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.140 align:middle line:10%
truly boggles the mind and shows
us how little we really know.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.230 align:middle line:10%
We're going to talk about
gold and this fascination

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.130 align:middle line:10%
that humanity has had with gold
for so many thousands of years,

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.130 align:middle line:10%
where that fascination
comes from,

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.550 align:middle line:10%
and that we actually inherited
this fascination from the gods,

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.030 align:middle line:10%
that it's not actually
our obsession,

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.540 align:middle line:10%
that it's an obsession
of the so-called gods

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.210 align:middle line:10%
that we inherited
as the human race.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.010 align:middle line:10%
We're going to talk
about astronomy.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.830 align:middle line:10%
We're going to talk about
geology, archaeology, physics,

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.940 align:middle line:10%
mathematics, geophysics.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.700 align:middle line:10%
We're going to talk
about quantum physics

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.910 align:middle line:10%
and this thing
called laws of nature

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.330 align:middle line:10%
and this other interesting
area of research

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.010 align:middle line:10%
called the nature of reality,
if we can actually call it

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.460 align:middle line:10%
that because we find
out how little we really

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.510 align:middle line:10%
know about the laws of nature
and this nature of reality

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.540 align:middle line:10%
that we find ourselves in.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.210 align:middle line:84%
But the key thing
that we need to do

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.720 align:middle line:84%
is, what are we going to
do with this information?

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.130 align:middle line:84%
Because it's very
good getting all

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.900 align:middle line:84%
this knowledge and information,
but what do we do with this?

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.170 align:middle line:84%
If we don't put it to any good
use for humanity and our planet

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.890 align:middle line:84%
and our future, it's all
a bloody waste of time.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.510 align:middle line:84%
So I suggest that we
learn from the ancients,

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.930 align:middle line:84%
create this platform,
and find a solution

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.740 align:middle line:84%
for this terrible situation
that every single one of us

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.100 align:middle line:90%
finds ourselves in.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.300 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to start this
journey by connecting the dots

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.380 align:middle line:84%
and going back into
the ancient past,

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.780 align:middle line:84%
looking back into history, like
these famous statues on Easter

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.250 align:middle line:84%
Island are looking back into
the past and into the future,

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.399 align:middle line:84%
and gain critical
information that will allow

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:23.230 align:middle line:90%
us to build this platform.

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.010 align:middle line:84%
When we encounter these
ancient civilizations,

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.470 align:middle line:84%
we find that they seem to
have so much more knowledge

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.250 align:middle line:84%
and information about
who we are as a species

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.780 align:middle line:84%
and our murky ancient history
and the origins of humankind.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.160 align:middle line:84%
And the one common
denominator that I have found

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.390 align:middle line:84%
is that pretty much
all ancient cultures

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.350 align:middle line:84%
that I've studied all tell us
that we come from the stars.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And yet that is not
what our history books,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.860 align:middle line:90%
our modern textbooks tell us.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.680 align:middle line:84%
They will deny it until
they are blue in the face.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.140 align:middle line:84%
So let's learn
from the ancients.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.850 align:middle line:84%
Let's absorb this
knowledge and information,

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.070 align:middle line:84%
and let's give our
ancient civilizations

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.460 align:middle line:84%
the credit they deserve
by learning from them.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.020 align:middle line:84%
What seems to have
become of humanity

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.720 align:middle line:84%
is that we've become
a species with amnesia

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.930 align:middle line:84%
because we know nothing about
who we are, where we come from,

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.610 align:middle line:90%
and why we are here.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And this species
of amnesia seems

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.520 align:middle line:84%
to have spread right
across the world.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.250 align:middle line:84%
No matter where you are, the
modern civilization today

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.020 align:middle line:84%
seems to suffer from
the same disease.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, how do you create
a species with amnesia?

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:35.300 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me that this
final assault on humanity

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.510 align:middle line:84%
to create a species with amnesia
started around 500 years ago

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.050 align:middle line:84%
when what I call the
thugs from Europe

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.920 align:middle line:84%
started invading the free
lands, the free world,

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.100 align:middle line:84%
invading the Americas,
invading Africa

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:54.430 align:middle line:84%
and Asia and the Australias,
and started taking control

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.710 align:middle line:84%
of the land, of the native
people, invading the land,

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.550 align:middle line:84%
planting their
flags, and destroying

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.580 align:middle line:84%
all the knowledge that was
held by those native people

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.530 align:middle line:84%
around the world,
replacing their books,

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.890 align:middle line:84%
replacing their literature
with Eurocentric history

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:14.190 align:middle line:84%
books, Eurocentric religions,
and Eurocentric belief systems,

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:19.430 align:middle line:84%
and over a 500-year period
very smoothly, very gently,

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:24.750 align:middle line:84%
very subtly, and very cunningly
created a species with amnesia,

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.310 align:middle line:84%
of whom we are all
members of today.

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.120 align:middle line:90%
So who are we?

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.370 align:middle line:90%
Where do we come from?

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:31.640 align:middle line:90%
Why are we here?

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.010 align:middle line:84%
The great human puzzle, the
three questions that most of us

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.580 align:middle line:84%
have asked ourselves,
and we find

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.365 align:middle line:84%
that when we look
into the ancient past,

00:06:39.365 --> 00:06:41.970 align:middle line:84%
the ancient cultures
and civilizations have

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:46.290 align:middle line:84%
a lot of critical information
for us on those subjects.

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:50.570 align:middle line:84%
Because if we don't know who
we are and where we come from,

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:54.850 align:middle line:84%
how could we possibly think
we know where we are going?

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing when
you start peeling away

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.660 align:middle line:84%
the layers of information
and the deception

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.640 align:middle line:84%
through the millennia
and the hundreds of years

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:08.110 align:middle line:84%
that preceded our current
state of disinformation.

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:11.200 align:middle line:84%
The Gospel of Thomas is
a phenomenal example.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And in the Gospel
of Thomas, there's

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.730 align:middle line:84%
an account of the disciples
asking Jesus a question.

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And they ask him, tell
us how our end will be.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.990 align:middle line:10%
And Jesus replies, a
fascinating answer, he says,

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.710 align:middle line:10%
have you discovered
then the beginning

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:29.400 align:middle line:10%
that you look for the end?

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.840 align:middle line:84%
For where the beginning
is, there will be the end.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:36.880 align:middle line:84%
Blessed is he who will take
his place in the beginning.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.910 align:middle line:10%
He will know the end and
will not experience death.

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:43.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we realize
how little we

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:47.990 align:middle line:84%
know about our human history,
certain things come to mind,

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:51.050 align:middle line:84%
and we start to
remember that history

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:53.010 align:middle line:90%
is written by the victors.

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:56.390 align:middle line:84%
The fact that our history
books that we are presented

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:59.030 align:middle line:84%
with at school and
at universities

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:02.320 align:middle line:84%
are not really filled with
knowledge and information

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.850 align:middle line:84%
but is really an agenda that
has been written by those that

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:08.150 align:middle line:84%
have won the conflicts
and won the wars

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:11.150 align:middle line:84%
and taken control of our
countries and our governments,

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:14.950 align:middle line:84%
so if you talk to
somebody that spews forth

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:17.610 align:middle line:84%
what they believe is knowledge
and information from history

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:19.420 align:middle line:90%
books, just ask them.

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:22.610 align:middle line:84%
How much do you really know
about our human history?

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you that we know
less about our human origins

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:28.960 align:middle line:84%
than is permissible by
the laws of physics.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.600 align:middle line:90%
This is a spectacular statement.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.830 align:middle line:90%
How can we prove this?

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And there's a very simple
mathematical equation

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:35.880 align:middle line:90%
that I'll share with you.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.880 align:middle line:84%
But if history is written
by the victors, how much do

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.530 align:middle line:84%
we really know about
certain historic events,

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:44.440 align:middle line:90%
like Alexander the Great?

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.640 align:middle line:90%
Who was he?

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:46.890 align:middle line:90%
What did he really do?

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:49.890 align:middle line:84%
All we know about Alexander is
that he conquered the world,

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:52.740 align:middle line:84%
and he invaded countries,
raped and pillaged

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.690 align:middle line:84%
and took over people's
lands and homes.

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:57.196 align:middle line:90%
And we call him great?

00:08:57.196 --> 00:08:58.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't think
that's a label that

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:00.770 align:middle line:90%
deserves to be called great.

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:03.750 align:middle line:84%
And for example, the event with
the Tower of Babel, how much

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:05.860 align:middle line:84%
do we really know
about the events

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:07.670 align:middle line:84%
that surrounded
the Tower of Babel,

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:09.810 align:middle line:90%
this famous historic event?

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.110 align:middle line:90%
We know very little.

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:17.660 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the biblical event that
talks about the Tower of Babel

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:19.570 align:middle line:84%
is completely out of
place and out of time

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:24.010 align:middle line:84%
because during the time when
Babylon was already an empire

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:26.130 align:middle line:84%
and the Tower of
Babel was being built,

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:28.940 align:middle line:84%
people had already been
speaking many languages

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:29.980 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:32.450 align:middle line:84%
So the concept
of, let us go down

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:35.860 align:middle line:84%
and destroy their language
for if they can do this

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:38.980 align:middle line:84%
they can become like us,
is a nonsensical statement

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:40.770 align:middle line:84%
because at that stage
the people were not

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:42.200 align:middle line:90%
just speaking one language.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.390 align:middle line:84%
They were already
speaking many languages.

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:46.940 align:middle line:84%
So clearly, there is a
deep deception encoded

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.650 align:middle line:90%
into that historic event.

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:52.560 align:middle line:84%
So let's continue with
this historic expose.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And when we go back in history
and look at our history books,

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.240 align:middle line:90%
we learn from recent history.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.950 align:middle line:90%
Then we go further back in time.

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, at
one point in time,

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:07.330 align:middle line:84%
we stumble upon this
very strict dividing line

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:09.930 align:middle line:84%
where our history
becomes mythology.

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:13.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, who decides when
history becomes mythology?

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.240 align:middle line:84%
When does history
become mythology?

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.040 align:middle line:10%
Suddenly, we find that
ancient cultures have

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.060 align:middle line:10%
these gods and these beings
that they are fearful of

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:24.830 align:middle line:10%
and that they worship
and they bring food to.

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:27.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, I can tell you that
the Roman gods are not

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:28.370 align:middle line:90%
imaginary beings.

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:29.990 align:middle line:84%
They were very
real to the Romans.

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:31.080 align:middle line:90%
They feared them.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.310 align:middle line:90%
They worshipped them.

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:35.580 align:middle line:84%
They fed them, and
they obeyed them.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:37.580 align:middle line:10%
The Greeks didn't
think or believe

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:42.424 align:middle line:10%
that their gods were
mythical or imaginary beings.

00:10:42.424 --> 00:10:43.840 align:middle line:84%
They were very
real to the Greeks,

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.720 align:middle line:84%
and so were the Sumerians and
all other ancient cultures.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And we realized that there's a
very, very murky dividing line

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.420 align:middle line:84%
between where history
ends and mythology begins.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:58.640 align:middle line:84%
So let's go back some 6,000
years to what we perceive

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.890 align:middle line:84%
to be the beginning of the
current, modern civilization,

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:05.050 align:middle line:84%
to the Sumerians and those
that just came before them

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:07.510 align:middle line:84%
or that murky period
in human history.

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And let's believe that at
that point in human history

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:14.520 align:middle line:84%
we had 100% knowledge and
information about who we are,

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.490 align:middle line:84%
where we come from, and why
we are here as a species

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:20.690 align:middle line:84%
and that every year
we have one war.

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:23.940 align:middle line:84%
So one war per annum that has
been very kind and generous

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:29.020 align:middle line:84%
to history, and we only
lose 50% of the information

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:31.720 align:middle line:84%
and knowledge by those
that win the wars.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And they only remove
50% of the knowledge,

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:38.540 align:middle line:84%
so there's only a 50% loss
of knowledge and information.

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:41.710 align:middle line:84%
So if we go back 6,000 years,
we start with 100% knowledge.

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:45.800 align:middle line:84%
One year later, 5,999
years ago, we already

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:50.430 align:middle line:84%
know 50% of what we knew the
year before, and so we go.

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:53.010 align:middle line:10%
Knowledge and information
gets degraded so quickly

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:55.160 align:middle line:10%
that by the time we
get seven or eight

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:59.530 align:middle line:10%
years into this degradation
of knowledge and information,

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:04.430 align:middle line:10%
we already know less than
1% of the original truth.

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:08.910 align:middle line:10%
By the time we get to 124
years into civilization,

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:15.090 align:middle line:10%
we know less than 10 to the
minus 34 of the original truth.

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:16.540 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's a big number.

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:19.250 align:middle line:84%
It's often referred to
as Planck's constant,

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:23.510 align:middle line:84%
and possibly the smallest
number in existence.

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:25.450 align:middle line:90%
Arguably, let's say that.

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:28.330 align:middle line:84%
And so what this really
tells us is that 124

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:32.660 align:middle line:84%
years into civilization, we know
less about our human origins

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:35.530 align:middle line:84%
than is permissible by
the laws of physics.

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:39.830 align:middle line:84%
So if anybody tells you
that they know about history

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:41.560 align:middle line:84%
because they've read
the history books

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.640 align:middle line:90%
are barking up the wrong tree.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.020 align:middle line:90%
We've all been lied to.

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:48.090 align:middle line:84%
We've all been deceived,
and basically everything

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:50.240 align:middle line:84%
we've been told and
taught is a lie.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And we have to start
from a clean slate.

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:55.480 align:middle line:84%
We have to start
from a belief that we

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:59.350 align:middle line:84%
need to acquire a new body of
knowledge and new information

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:01.140 align:middle line:84%
with a clean slate
and start putting

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:04.770 align:middle line:84%
the pieces of the puzzle of
our new knowledge, new body

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:06.690 align:middle line:84%
of information,
that will give us

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:10.130 align:middle line:84%
a direction into the
future for humanity

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:12.010 align:middle line:90%
and this planet of ours.

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:14.240 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
we find when we

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.810 align:middle line:84%
start looking at
the ancient history

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:20.290 align:middle line:84%
and ancient civilizations
is that human history

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:24.730 align:middle line:84%
and the history of this planet
is a lot older, a lot stranger,

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:28.200 align:middle line:84%
and far more exciting than
most of us could ever imagine.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.090 align:middle line:84%
It's like living our
own sci-fi movie,

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:33.920 align:middle line:84%
living in our own horror
movie, to some extent,

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:37.480 align:middle line:84%
but it's not what most
of us believe it is.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And the ancient sites that
many of us are familiar with

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:42.420 align:middle line:84%
are much older than
we can imagine.

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:44.720 align:middle line:84%
Stonehenge is one of
the greatest examples.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.380 align:middle line:84%
And if you just
look at the erosion

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:48.580 align:middle line:84%
on the stones of
Stonehenge, it'll

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:50.170 align:middle line:90%
give you a very clear hint.

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:53.070 align:middle line:84%
First of all, very few
people are aware of the fact

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:57.010 align:middle line:84%
that Stonehenge was actually
reconstructed in 1954.

00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:59.690 align:middle line:84%
I personally believe it
was a malicious attempt

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:03.910 align:middle line:84%
to make Stonehenge appear a lot
more recent than it really is.

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:07.230 align:middle line:84%
But by simply looking at the
stones, the giant megaliths

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:10.520 align:middle line:84%
that stand there, and the
erosion on these stones,

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:14.540 align:middle line:84%
it clearly tells us that
these are very ancient stones,

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:16.000 align:middle line:90%
an ancient site.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.360 align:middle line:90%
The erosion is very, very old.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:23.410 align:middle line:84%
You cannot have sarsen stone
erode to such an extent

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:24.990 align:middle line:90%
in a few thousand years.

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And the example is
the one tall stone

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.710 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of Stonehenge
that fell over at some stage

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:31.670 align:middle line:90%
and broke.

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:34.360 align:middle line:84%
The erosion on that
break is about 2 feet,

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:39.840 align:middle line:84%
or 50 centimeters, of erosion on
a clean break of sarsen stone.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:44.690 align:middle line:84%
It's impossible for sarsen stone
to erode 50 centimeters of 2

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:46.940 align:middle line:90%
feet in a few thousand years.

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:49.520 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm telling you is
that Stonehenge is most likely

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:53.090 align:middle line:84%
more than a million years old
and that the reconstruction

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:58.010 align:middle line:84%
of Stonehenge in 1954 was a
malicious attempt to confuse us

00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:01.590 align:middle line:84%
and to make us believe that
human history is a lot younger

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:03.770 align:middle line:90%
than most of us can realize.

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:07.000 align:middle line:84%
One of the most popular books
in the world, the Bible,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.427 align:middle line:84%
tells us that when the gods
were on Earth, they were giants.

00:15:10.427 --> 00:15:12.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you go down to
the pub and you strike up

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:14.530 align:middle line:84%
a conversation with
the guy next to you

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:16.464 align:middle line:84%
and you say, hey, how
about those giants,

00:15:16.464 --> 00:15:18.880 align:middle line:84%
they probably think you're
talking about some sports team,

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:19.440 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.800 align:middle line:84%
But no, you'd be talking about
the giants in human history.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And this, when you bring
it up in conversation,

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:28.840 align:middle line:84%
normally brings up, you know,
laughter and people giggling

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.050 align:middle line:90%
and thinking you're joking.

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And yet, the Bible
is full of references

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:34.880 align:middle line:90%
of giants in our history.

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:38.440 align:middle line:84%
In the Book of Numbers, it says,
"but the people who live there

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:42.290 align:middle line:84%
are powerful, and the cities
are fortified and very large.

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And we even saw the
descendants of Anak there."

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And it continues
in Numbers 13:33.

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:50.630 align:middle line:84%
It says, "we saw
the Nephilim there.

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:53.680 align:middle line:84%
The descendants of Anak
come from the Nephilim.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.620 align:middle line:84%
We seemed like grasshoppers
in our own eyes,

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.680 align:middle line:90%
and we looked the same to them."

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:02.890 align:middle line:84%
What they're telling us is
that we look like grasshoppers

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:04.750 align:middle line:90%
next to the giants.

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:08.590 align:middle line:84%
So how large would a
giant be so that we looked

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:10.580 align:middle line:90%
like grasshoppers next to them?

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:12.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, before I show you
the evidence of that,

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:16.140 align:middle line:84%
let's first analyze what
the Jewish Encyclopedia

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:19.270 align:middle line:84%
has to say about
giants in the Bible.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:22.500 align:middle line:84%
It says, "according to
rabbinical tradition,

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:26.230 align:middle line:84%
the Anakim are of
the same titanic race

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:30.610 align:middle line:84%
as the Rephaim, the Nephilim,
the Gibborim, the Zamzummim,

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:32.310 align:middle line:90%
and the Emim."

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:34.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, most people will say, well,
I've heard of the Nephilim.

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:36.300 align:middle line:90%
I've heard of the Anakim.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:39.350 align:middle line:84%
But that's where
they normally fall

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:43.690 align:middle line:84%
short of understanding who
the Zamzummim, the Emim

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:45.160 align:middle line:90%
and the Gibborim are.

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And yet the Bible speaks
openly about these beings,

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:51.540 align:middle line:84%
these titanic races
that were giants,

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:54.860 align:middle line:84%
as if they knew exactly who they
were, the way we would refer

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:56.760 align:middle line:84%
to the French, the
Polish, and the Germans

00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:00.180 align:middle line:84%
today without defining
who these people were.

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And these were giants
in human history.

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:07.550 align:middle line:84%
The giants in human history go
back thousands and thousands

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:09.569 align:middle line:84%
of years, and all
ancient cultures

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:11.780 align:middle line:84%
talk about giants
in our history.

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:15.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, very close to where
I live in South Africa,

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:17.660 align:middle line:84%
close to the Swaziland
border, there

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:19.940 align:middle line:84%
is this phenomenal
giant footprint,

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:21.910 align:middle line:90%
left in rough granite.

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:24.970 align:middle line:84%
How the footprint can
appear in rough granite

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:29.600 align:middle line:84%
is a deep mystery, and we will
cover that later in the series

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.050 align:middle line:84%
because most people
will tell you

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:33.120 align:middle line:84%
it's impossible to leave
a footprint in granite.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, they would be
wrong, and they would just

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:38.600 align:middle line:84%
show their lack of
understanding and the very

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.860 align:middle line:84%
little we know about
geology and the formation

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:43.800 align:middle line:90%
of materials on this planet.

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:47.070 align:middle line:84%
So we'll cover that later,
but this giant footprint is

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:49.770 align:middle line:84%
spectacular because my
good friend, Klaus Dona,

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:52.950 align:middle line:84%
from Austria, who is an
expert in ancient artifacts

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:56.990 align:middle line:84%
and mysterious objects actually
found the remains of a giant,

00:17:56.990 --> 00:18:00.480 align:middle line:84%
about 7 and 1/2 meters
tall, probably about 23,

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.140 align:middle line:90%
25 foot tall, in Ecuador.

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:07.030 align:middle line:84%
He found a nose bone, a heel
bone, and a skull fragment that

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:09.690 align:middle line:84%
were analyzed and
genetically analyzed

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:12.380 align:middle line:84%
and confirmed that this was
a humanoid that would've been

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:14.960 align:middle line:90%
about 7 and 1/2 meters tall.

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:18.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, this clearly is a
beautiful example of how little

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:21.090 align:middle line:90%
we know about our human history.

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:24.480 align:middle line:84%
The giants in history carry
on, and at the University

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.340 align:middle line:84%
of Witwatersrand in
Johannesburg, South Africa,

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:30.760 align:middle line:84%
where I graduated in
1983 with pharmaceutics,

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:35.490 align:middle line:84%
there is a fragment of a giant,
a bone that is left behind.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:38.250 align:middle line:84%
Originally, it was
discovered in 1960

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:40.510 align:middle line:90%
in an ancient mine in Namibia.

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And they found entire skeletons
and many more bone fragments,

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:46.590 align:middle line:84%
but this is the only
remaining piece.

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's kept in the vaults
of the Anthropological

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:52.310 align:middle line:84%
Department of the
University of Witwatersrand.

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:55.710 align:middle line:84%
It just shows you how these
spectacular examples of giants

00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:57.760 align:middle line:84%
are not on display
for people to see,

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.580 align:middle line:84%
and they keep them away
from sight to the public.

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:03.810 align:middle line:10%
The other famous
ancient artifact

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:06.910 align:middle line:10%
that is kept in South
Africa is at the museum

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:09.200 align:middle line:10%
in Port Elizabeth, the
city of Port Elizabeth,

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.510 align:middle line:10%
and this is the
famous Boskop skull.

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:14.400 align:middle line:10%
I had the privilege of actually
seeing the Boskop skull

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:17.300 align:middle line:10%
next to a normal
human skull, and it

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:21.030 align:middle line:10%
is estimated that these
people were about 25% to 30%

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:23.580 align:middle line:10%
larger than normal human beings.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:27.750 align:middle line:10%
And once again, these
fragments of this Boskop skull

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.780 align:middle line:10%
are kept in a box in the
basement of the museum,

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:33.510 align:middle line:10%
not on display
for public to see,

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:36.970 align:middle line:10%
the famous elongated skulls
that we find all over the world

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:39.640 align:middle line:10%
now, just in South
America or Mexico.

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.050 align:middle line:90%
We find them in the East.

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:44.295 align:middle line:84%
We've been found them in
Europe, and these kind

00:19:44.295 --> 00:19:46.790 align:middle line:84%
of mysterious discoveries
keep coming out

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:49.820 align:middle line:84%
of the woodwork on
a regular basis,

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:52.070 align:middle line:84%
clearly indicating that
the history of our planet

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:55.410 align:middle line:84%
is far more mysterious than
most of us can realize.

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:58.600 align:middle line:84%
The famous discussion about
Akhenaten and Nefertiti

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:02.920 align:middle line:84%
and who they really were, and
were they part of the Nephilim?

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And all these speculations
about who they really were,

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:07.860 align:middle line:84%
and then other
strange-looking creatures that

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:11.350 align:middle line:84%
just make no sense in the
history of this planet based

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:14.570 align:middle line:84%
on our current understanding,
on the timelines, who we are,

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:16.920 align:middle line:84%
and the chronology of the
evolution of humanity,

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.650 align:middle line:90%
it just doesn't make any sense.

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:21.020 align:middle line:84%
Like this creature here,
this humanoid with horns

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.850 align:middle line:84%
coming out of its skull,
what's going on here?

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:27.290 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, we have a history here
that we know nothing about.

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:30.120 align:middle line:84%
The giant gene seems to
be encoded in our DNA,

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.870 align:middle line:84%
and every now and
then, giants just

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:34.120 align:middle line:90%
pop out when least expected.

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:38.240 align:middle line:84%
Here are some famous photographs
from more recent times,

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:41.830 align:middle line:84%
from the mounds of
Ohio and a giant found

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:44.850 align:middle line:84%
in the bog of
Ireland, just very,

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:49.680 align:middle line:84%
very large humanoids that will
just be very swiftly removed

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:53.710 align:middle line:84%
from prying human eyes
when they were discovered,

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:55.210 align:middle line:90%
never to be seen again.

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:57.860 align:middle line:84%
And at the heart of this
seems to be the Smithsonian.

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:00.220 align:middle line:84%
The Smithsonian seems
to be the culprit

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:03.980 align:middle line:84%
in removing all of this evidence
of giants around the world.

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:05.410 align:middle line:84%
When you follow
the trail, you'll

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:08.980 align:middle line:84%
see that they seem to always
arrive on site and location

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:12.140 align:middle line:84%
and remove all the evidence,
never to be found again.

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:16.580 align:middle line:84%
So giants in human history
go back thousands of years.

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:19.240 align:middle line:84%
They are great
examples that you can

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.700 align:middle line:84%
find when you start
examining this,

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:25.730 align:middle line:84%
and it's not a hidden secret
in alternative circles.

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:28.680 align:middle line:84%
But in mainstream history,
mainstream archaeology,

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:31.870 align:middle line:84%
it is a taboo subject,
not to be discussed.

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:34.190 align:middle line:84%
This is a great example
of a giant, probably

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:37.370 align:middle line:90%
about 5 meters or 15 feet tall.

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:40.370 align:middle line:84%
This bone was found by an
American archaeologists

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:42.950 align:middle line:84%
in the '30s, somewhere
in the Middle East,

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:45.210 align:middle line:90%
and then brought to the USA.

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:49.120 align:middle line:84%
This is a finger of a giant
that was seen and photographed

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:52.880 align:middle line:84%
by a tourist by the name
of Gregor Sporri in 1988.

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.940 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, he paid $300 to see
this giant mummified finger.

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:58.050 align:middle line:90%
How big is it?

00:21:58.050 --> 00:21:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, have a look
at the giant finger

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:02.460 align:middle line:84%
next to a 20-pound
Egyptian note,

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:05.260 align:middle line:84%
to give you an idea how
large this individual would

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:06.210 align:middle line:90%
have been.

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:08.580 align:middle line:10%
And then we have the
Egyptian paintings

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:10.990 align:middle line:10%
that showed us the
very large beings

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:12.680 align:middle line:10%
next to the very small beings.

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.070 align:middle line:10%
Some people say
it's perspective.

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:16.170 align:middle line:90%
Well, I claim it's not.

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:17.790 align:middle line:84%
I believe that it's
really showing us

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:19.920 align:middle line:84%
that there were very
large beings and then very

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:23.480 align:middle line:84%
small beings, or normal
beings, next to the giants that

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.020 align:middle line:84%
used to live in Egypt in
that part of the world.

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And then the tiny
humanoids that have

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:31.910 align:middle line:84%
been found around the world that
clearly boggle our mind, just

00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:35.100 align:middle line:84%
to highlight the fact how
mysterious the history

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:39.090 align:middle line:84%
of this planet truly is, but
some of the greatest mystery

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:43.090 align:middle line:84%
we find in ancient texts, the
mystery that relates to who we

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:46.290 align:middle line:84%
are and where we come from and
why we are here as a species.

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And then many of these texts
are also filled with deceptions.

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:52.050 align:middle line:84%
I believe that one of the
greatest deceptions that

00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:54.290 align:middle line:84%
has been imposed
on humanity comes

00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:58.040 align:middle line:84%
in the most popular book on this
planet, and that is the Bible.

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:02.340 align:middle line:84%
The opening phrase of the Bible
has clearly been manipulated.

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:05.230 align:middle line:84%
We all believe that the
opening phrase of the Bible

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:07.600 align:middle line:84%
says, "In the
beginning, God created

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.270 align:middle line:90%
the heavens and the Earth."

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:12.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, that is no longer the
case because this man here,

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:14.970 align:middle line:84%
Michael Ledwith,
who, as you can see,

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:16.560 align:middle line:84%
kept some very
interesting company

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:19.640 align:middle line:84%
for 17 years of his
life, he was the adviser

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:21.470 align:middle line:90%
to the popes at the Vatican.

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:23.990 align:middle line:84%
Michael is a
walking encyclopedia

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:26.920 align:middle line:84%
and one of the wisest
men I've ever met,

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:30.130 align:middle line:84%
and he knows so much about
this ancient history.

00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:33.760 align:middle line:84%
He's a scholar of the Bible,
scholar of the Hebrew language,

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.860 align:middle line:84%
and he found while
he was studying

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:39.120 align:middle line:84%
that the opening text
of the Hebrew Bible

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:42.160 align:middle line:84%
does not start with the
first letter of the Hebrew

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:45.830 align:middle line:84%
alphabet, aleph, or the
A in the Hebrew alphabet.

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:50.730 align:middle line:84%
All sacred texts must begin with
the first letter of the Hebrew

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:53.260 align:middle line:90%
alphabet, which is A, or aleph.

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:58.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, at the moment, the
current reading in Hebrew

00:23:58.150 --> 00:24:07.290 align:middle line:84%
says [HEBREW], which doesn't
even make grammatical sense

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:09.060 align:middle line:90%
if you break it down.

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And we clearly see that the
first statement in the Hebrew

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:16.840 align:middle line:84%
Bible starts with beth,
the second letter, or B,

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.980 align:middle line:84%
second letter of the alphabet,
and that should not happen.

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:26.540 align:middle line:84%
When Michael inserted A, or
aleph, it suddenly says, abba.

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:30.280 align:middle line:84%
Abba means father, and suddenly
it changes that opening

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:31.920 align:middle line:90%
statement completely.

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:35.230 align:middle line:10%
It now says, "the
father of the beginnings

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:38.780 align:middle line:10%
created the Elohim, the
heavens, and the Earth."

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:40.070 align:middle line:10%
What does that do?

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:41.850 align:middle line:90%
It changes everything.

00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:44.970 align:middle line:84%
It suddenly brings Judeo
Christianity in line

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:47.850 align:middle line:84%
with all ancient cultures
and ancient civilizations

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:52.030 align:middle line:84%
when we know there is a father
of the beginnings, a source

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:54.820 align:middle line:84%
for all creation,
and that source seems

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:56.870 align:middle line:90%
to be sound and resonance.

00:24:56.870 --> 00:25:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And this resonates with
all ancient civilizations

00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:02.960 align:middle line:84%
when they tell us
that everything

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:06.800 align:middle line:84%
was brought into creation
by sound and resonance.

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And the common denominator
in this sound and resonance

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:13.280 align:middle line:84%
had brought things
into existence.

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:15.460 align:middle line:84%
The common denominator
on planet Earth

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:17.990 align:middle line:84%
and the common denominator
between humanity

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:21.760 align:middle line:84%
and all ancient cultures
is our obsession with gold.

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.680 align:middle line:84%
This brings us to the
end of this episode.

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:27.790 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode, we'll
explore this obsession

00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:31.430 align:middle line:84%
with gold, human history,
human origins, and the reason

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:35.210 align:middle line:84%
for our obsession with gold,
why we have this obsession,

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:39.490 align:middle line:84%
and that it is almost
impossible to separate humanity,

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:43.660 align:middle line:84%
our origins, and our obsession
for this thing called gold.

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:47.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm Michael Tellinger,
