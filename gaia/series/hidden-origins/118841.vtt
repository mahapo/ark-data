00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.900 align:middle line:10%
>>Hello, this is
Michael Tellinger.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.040 align:middle line:10%
And we continue our
journey of discovery

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.610 align:middle line:10%
through southern Africa through
millions of stone circles,

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.910 align:middle line:10%
trying to find a flagship
ruin amongst this vast number

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.250 align:middle line:10%
of stone structures
and stone circles.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.520 align:middle line:84%
Is there a flagship
ruin then we can

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.920 align:middle line:84%
find that'll give us something
special in our research?

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.330 align:middle line:90%
And yes there is.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.440 align:middle line:90%
It's called Adam's Calendar.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And this is truly
a phenomenal story,

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.180 align:middle line:84%
one of the greatest
discoveries of an ancient site

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.830 align:middle line:90%
in the 21st century.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.080 align:middle line:84%
It was discovered
by a chap called

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.630 align:middle line:84%
Johan Heine, who I've
become good friends

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.340 align:middle line:90%
with over the years, in 2003.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.990 align:middle line:84%
It was a fluke discovery,
when he flew over

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:02.010 align:middle line:84%
the site in a helicopter trying
to find one of his pilots

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.710 align:middle line:84%
who happened to crash
land in that area.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And his airplane went
over the edge of a cliff

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.780 align:middle line:84%
and got stuck in the thick
bushes and the sink trees

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.860 align:middle line:84%
and shrubs growing on
the edge of a cliff,

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.880 align:middle line:90%
dropped down about 300 meters.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.654 align:middle line:84%
And his pilot survived
the crash and was sitting

00:01:18.654 --> 00:01:19.820 align:middle line:90%
there waiting to be rescued.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.600 align:middle line:84%
When they came looking
for him the next morning,

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.540 align:middle line:84%
Johan flew over the site
of Adam's Calendar--

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.862 align:middle line:84%
or the calendar site, as it
was called at that stage--

00:01:29.862 --> 00:01:31.570 align:middle line:84%
and he looked down
and realized, hold on,

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.210 align:middle line:84%
that is not just an
accumulation of stones, that is

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.680 align:middle line:90%
a highly significant structure.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And he came back and he
started measuring the site,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.090 align:middle line:84%
and five years later
met up with me.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.930 align:middle line:90%
And our research continued.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, Johan discovered
that this site

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.170 align:middle line:84%
had all the important
encoding in it that we

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.110 align:middle line:90%
in all ancient structures.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.120 align:middle line:84%
But the most important
thing about this

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.700 align:middle line:84%
is that this not
a new discovery.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.690 align:middle line:84%
This has been well known
by ancient knowledge

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.680 align:middle line:90%
keepers in southern Africa.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.220 align:middle line:84%
The shamanic knowledge
keepers, the wisdom keepers

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.575 align:middle line:84%
of African ancient
knowledge, and stories

00:02:11.575 --> 00:02:14.180 align:middle line:84%
that have been handed down
for thousands of years

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.540 align:middle line:84%
have known about this site
for a long, long time.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.640 align:middle line:84%
One of these is
Baba Credo Mutwa,

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.910 align:middle line:84%
the Zulu shaman that has
become very well known

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.050 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.920 align:middle line:84%
And Credo Mutwa
well told me that he

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.960 align:middle line:84%
was initiated as a young shaman
at Adam's Calendar, or Inzalo

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.660 align:middle line:84%
Ye Langa, as he
calls it, in 1937.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.550 align:middle line:84%
Now I gave the place
the name Adam's Calendar

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.660 align:middle line:84%
shortly after we found it and
I had to write a book about it.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.630 align:middle line:84%
I instinctively knew that
it was somehow connected

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.470 align:middle line:90%
to the origins of humankind.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, I had no idea how
close to the truth I was.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.840 align:middle line:84%
So when I met Credo
Mutwa, what he told me

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.900 align:middle line:84%
that this is known as Inzalo
Ye Langa, or "birthplace

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.340 align:middle line:84%
of the Sun," and not necessarily
the S-U-N, but the S-O-N,

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.940 align:middle line:90%
as the sons of the gods.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.230 align:middle line:84%
Because this is the
site that is apparently

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.440 align:middle line:84%
where humanity was created
by the gods, as has

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.960 align:middle line:84%
been handed down by the
African knowledge keepers.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't just any god
that created humanity here,

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.350 align:middle line:84%
because this is,
once again, where

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.900 align:middle line:84%
we find the connection between
ancient African knowledge

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.650 align:middle line:84%
and wisdom and the
Sumerian texts.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.660 align:middle line:84%
Because it was
the same Enki that

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.560 align:middle line:84%
was responsible for the
vast gold mining empire

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.190 align:middle line:90%
at the southern tip of Africa.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.680 align:middle line:84%
This site was initiated
and constructed by Enki,

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.640 align:middle line:84%
known in African
tradition as Ngai,

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.910 align:middle line:90%
the creator of the human race.

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.140 align:middle line:84%
So this is what
Adam's Calendar looks

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.760 align:middle line:90%
like from a helicopter shot.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.240 align:middle line:84%
To describe it briefly to you,
the tree on the right is north,

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.630 align:middle line:84%
the tree on the left is south,
and we have east, west moving

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.520 align:middle line:90%
away from us into the distance.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.210 align:middle line:84%
The edge of the cliff
that you see here

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.860 align:middle line:84%
is really the edge that drops
down about 200 or 300 meters

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.710 align:middle line:90%
into the Barberton valley.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.820 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we find
the sediment of sea sand

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.630 align:middle line:84%
that stretches right
across the area

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.330 align:middle line:84%
where we also find Sheba gold
mine, one of the wealthiest

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:23.780 align:middle line:90%
gold mines in the world.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And it is my belief that
this Barberton valley

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.750 align:middle line:84%
in ancient times was
covered and filled

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.260 align:middle line:84%
with hundreds of
ancient gold mines

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.370 align:middle line:84%
that have been covered by the
flood and the sea sand sediment

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.940 align:middle line:90%
that came from the flood.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.850 align:middle line:84%
This is the view looking out
into the Barberton valley

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:40.920 align:middle line:90%
from Adam's Calendar.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.510 align:middle line:84%
This is a reconstructed
3D reconstruction

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.330 align:middle line:84%
that I had done of
the ancient site.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Because it's so badly
broken down and so

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.490 align:middle line:84%
destroyed that only when you
re-erect it like this can

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.300 align:middle line:84%
you really see the
significance of the site.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's spectacular,
because there

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.500 align:middle line:84%
are so many amazing discoveries
once you start exploring it.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And my journey of discovery
of the ancient sites

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.520 align:middle line:84%
really began with
exploring Adam's Calendar

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.310 align:middle line:84%
and then connecting it to my
research in the stone circles.

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.190 align:middle line:84%
First of all, north
and south run directly

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.840 align:middle line:84%
between the two central
calendar stones.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.520 align:middle line:84%
These are some of
the early discoveries

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.320 align:middle line:84%
that Johan Heine made when he
started mapping out the site

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.710 align:middle line:84%
and realizing that it was
aligned with the solstices

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.460 align:middle line:84%
and equinoxes, north,
south, east, west,

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.870 align:middle line:84%
the cardinal points,
and all the key elements

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.460 align:middle line:84%
that are always encoded in
most of the ancient sites

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.690 align:middle line:90%
that we discover on this planet.

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.000 align:middle line:84%
This is a view looking south
between the two calendar

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.030 align:middle line:84%
stones, seeing
that the line goes

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:48.080 align:middle line:84%
from the northern to the
southern marker stones right

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.910 align:middle line:90%
through the middle.

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And here Johan points
out where the wooden pole

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.620 align:middle line:84%
is that there was something
missing-- a stone was removed

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.880 align:middle line:90%
from that particular position.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And we found what that stone
was through a sequence what

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.370 align:middle line:84%
was pretty much like a
criminal investigation.

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.940 align:middle line:84%
We discovered that there was
a stone, which we ended up

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.560 align:middle line:84%
calling the "stone man," which
is to stand in this position,

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:18.020 align:middle line:84%
and was removed around 1992
out of this particular site.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.090 align:middle line:84%
The reason for this still
remains very mysterious.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.120 align:middle line:84%
We don't know why they
removed the stone,

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.500 align:middle line:84%
if they did this consciously,
or just ignorantly

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.230 align:middle line:84%
because it was an
interesting looking stone.

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And we ended up calling
it the "stone man".

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:36.810 align:middle line:84%
In 1994 the stone
man was returned

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:40.350 align:middle line:84%
from the workshop of
the forestry department

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.370 align:middle line:84%
in the nearby town
of Kaapschehoop.

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.260 align:middle line:84%
It was returned
from the workshop

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.650 align:middle line:84%
and brought into the
Blue Swallow Nature

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.530 align:middle line:84%
Reserve, in which Adam's
Calendar is located today,

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:56.710 align:middle line:84%
and put up at the entrance to
the Blue Swallow Nature Reserve

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.020 align:middle line:90%
to carry a plaque.

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:04.440 align:middle line:84%
So it a sequence of
unbelievable coincidences

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:09.810 align:middle line:84%
that brought the stone man
back much closer to the site

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.290 align:middle line:90%
from which it was removed.

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And it ended up standing
there-- it still stands there

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.250 align:middle line:84%
today-- bearing the
plaque commemorating

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:20.470 align:middle line:84%
the launching and the opening
of the Blue Swallow Nature

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:20.980 align:middle line:90%
Reserve.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:25.450 align:middle line:84%
I think it's ironic that they
desecrated one of the oldest

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:29.270 align:middle line:84%
sites on planet Earth
to put a plaque on it

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.970 align:middle line:90%
to commemorate a nature reserve.

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:33.490 align:middle line:90%
This is quite spectacular.

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:36.170 align:middle line:84%
What I must tell you as
well is that this stone man

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:40.970 align:middle line:84%
is referred to by Credo Mutwa
as the clitoris of Mother Earth.

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And it was a tool that
vibrated and resonated.

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:48.220 align:middle line:84%
And it is also at this
point that he told me

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.690 align:middle line:84%
that this calendar site
or Inzalo Ye Langa,

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:56.440 align:middle line:84%
is not only where humanity
was created by the gods

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.210 align:middle line:84%
but where heaven mated with
Mother Earth-- and this

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:05.450 align:middle line:84%
is very, very important--
where the genetic material

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:09.920 align:middle line:84%
and the genetic DNA was
mixed and blended with that

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.760 align:middle line:84%
of some primordial being that
was found on this planet.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:17.420 align:middle line:84%
Whether it was already an
advanced species or a lesser

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:21.880 align:middle line:84%
advanced species, that still
remains open to be discussed.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:26.300 align:middle line:84%
But it is where heaven mated
with Mother Earth and humanity

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:31.180 align:middle line:84%
was brought forth in a
genetic manipulation of DNA.

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.980 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot more to
be said about this,

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:36.669 align:middle line:84%
because the sister
site-- if you can call it

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:41.260 align:middle line:84%
that-- to Adam's Calendar,
where gross genetic manipulation

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:46.270 align:middle line:84%
happened, was at Tsodilo
Hills in northern Botswana,

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:48.930 align:middle line:84%
northwestern Botswana,
Tsodilo Hills, which

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:52.610 align:middle line:84%
is strangely enough
and incidentally called

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:54.270 align:middle line:90%
"mountain of the gods".

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:57.060 align:middle line:84%
It used to be a mountain
surrounded by water

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.910 align:middle line:90%
many thousands of years ago.

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I
previously referred to

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:05.140 align:middle line:84%
as most likely the original
island of Doctor Moreau.

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.870 align:middle line:84%
Because this is where
some rogue Annunaki,

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:11.120 align:middle line:84%
if you can call them
that, went into hiding.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And they started experimenting
with genetic manipulations,

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.890 align:middle line:84%
crossing different
species and creating

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:22.020 align:middle line:84%
a whole lot of
cross-species breeds

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:26.710 align:middle line:84%
that were just really not
meant to be cross-bred.

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And the energetic
impact on that was

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:33.470 align:middle line:84%
felt in that part of
the world for thousands

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:35.006 align:middle line:90%
and thousands of years.

00:09:35.006 --> 00:09:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
more to be said

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:39.090 align:middle line:84%
about the cleansing of
that site energetically

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:42.510 align:middle line:84%
and spiritually that happened
by the Bushman people

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:45.990 align:middle line:84%
for thousands of years,
that burned fires

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:48.410 align:middle line:84%
for many thousands
of years, to clean

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:51.860 align:middle line:84%
the energy, the dark energy,
that was created there

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.300 align:middle line:84%
by these Annunaki
geneticists that

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:58.090 align:middle line:84%
manipulated species and created
cross-breeds that should never

00:09:58.090 --> 00:09:59.390 align:middle line:90%
have been created.

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.540 align:middle line:84%
But let's carry on looking
at Adam's Calendar,

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:04.330 align:middle line:84%
because this really remains
one of the most important

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.890 align:middle line:84%
discoveries because of
the further research

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:10.220 align:middle line:90%
that we found as time went by.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.780 align:middle line:84%
This is the view from
where the stone man would

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:16.940 align:middle line:84%
have stood in its original
place looking due east

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:19.630 align:middle line:90%
at the sunrise on the equinox.

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is the discovery
that John Heine made.

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:25.630 align:middle line:84%
Spectacular initial
pioneering work,

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:28.000 align:middle line:84%
realizing that
this is a calendar,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.720 align:middle line:84%
aligned with the movement
of the sun, the solstices,

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.880 align:middle line:90%
and equinoxes.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.420 align:middle line:90%
Why is it a calendar?

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:38.350 align:middle line:84%
Here's Johan showing us that the
tall stone, the tall of the two

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:41.130 align:middle line:84%
calendar stones in the
center of the calendar,

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:43.690 align:middle line:84%
casts a shadow on
the second stone.

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And that shadow
moves from the left

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:48.890 align:middle line:84%
to the right of the
screen, casting a shadow

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:51.370 align:middle line:90%
for every day of the year.

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:54.720 align:middle line:84%
So you could really mark every
day of the year, if you wanted,

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.200 align:middle line:90%
and use it as a calendar.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.000 align:middle line:84%
It still works reasonably
accurately today,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.670 align:middle line:84%
although the stones are leaning
towards edge of the cliff.

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:05.340 align:middle line:84%
And through soil shift
towards the edge of the cliff,

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:08.140 align:middle line:84%
they've moved and have
lost their focus a bit.

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:10.730 align:middle line:84%
But it's still reasonably
accurate today.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:14.760 align:middle line:84%
However, this calendar
effect is just one

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.960 align:middle line:84%
of the encoded
benefits of the site.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:21.730 align:middle line:84%
It is not the main reason
why the site was constructed.

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:24.690 align:middle line:84%
The reason for the site
is far more important

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:27.190 align:middle line:90%
than just the calendar.

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And again, once
again, we can say

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:33.510 align:middle line:84%
that it is consistent with
what these ancient sites were,

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:36.510 align:middle line:84%
and why they were constructed,
and how they were manipulated

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:38.840 align:middle line:84%
and controlled by the
movement of the sun

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:42.550 align:middle line:84%
and also possibly the movement
of the stars and the moon.

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:45.750 align:middle line:84%
So this is a view
once again looking out

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:47.390 align:middle line:90%
east at the sunrise.

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And we find some very
interesting and important

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.550 align:middle line:84%
structures that make
up Adam's Calendar.

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:56.640 align:middle line:84%
So let's have a look what
else the site exposed

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.340 align:middle line:90%
when we started researching it.

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, we discovered
an ancient workshop

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:04.130 align:middle line:84%
where many of the
giant megalithic rocks

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:07.390 align:middle line:84%
seem to have been worked, and
manipulated, and chiseled,

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:11.750 align:middle line:84%
and weird marks that we
found on these stones.

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:14.840 align:middle line:10%
We found a Sphinx-like
carved stone

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.970 align:middle line:10%
that clearly was manipulated
and carved into a Sphinx.

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:21.130 align:middle line:10%
A smallest Sphinx, nevertheless,
but very impressive

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:24.260 align:middle line:10%
ancient structures
that were carved out

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.580 align:middle line:10%
of the stone that was
brought from somewhere else.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.430 align:middle line:84%
Another important discovery
made at Adam's Calendar

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:33.810 align:middle line:84%
was what seems to be an
ancient statue of a Horus,

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:36.760 align:middle line:84%
a Horus stone, a
Horus bird right

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.380 align:middle line:84%
on the edge of the
outer circle of what

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:41.840 align:middle line:84%
used to be the circular
structure of Adam's

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.870 align:middle line:84%
Calendar-- the eastern
side of the calendar,

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.830 align:middle line:90%
right on the edge of a cliff.

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:50.940 align:middle line:84%
We find an ancient grave
north of Adam's Calendar

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:53.410 align:middle line:84%
that is highly
significant in connection

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:56.390 align:middle line:90%
to Enki and his son Dumuzi.

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:59.750 align:middle line:84%
We find the first
pyramids, or quite arguably

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:02.010 align:middle line:84%
some of the oldest
pyramids on planet Earth

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:04.280 align:middle line:90%
connected to the calendar.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And we found links to Orion, as
we find in many ancient sites.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:10.420 align:middle line:90%
So let's continue.

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.200 align:middle line:84%
Here is an example
of what we refer

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.090 align:middle line:84%
to as the ancient
giant workshop.

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:18.890 align:middle line:84%
And these are dolerite
rocks, giant monoliths

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:21.930 align:middle line:84%
that are scattered along
the edge of the cliff that

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:28.420 align:middle line:84%
run between the calendar
site and the stone altar

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:32.890 align:middle line:84%
about 700 meters north,
exactly north of the calendar.

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And there are a number of
these giant dolerite stones

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:40.350 align:middle line:84%
that show clear marks of being
worked and chiseled or shaped

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:41.560 align:middle line:90%
in some form.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And there is a processional
path, a ritual path,

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:48.570 align:middle line:84%
that Credo Mutwa
confirmed was used

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:53.020 align:middle line:84%
for undergoing these shamanic
rituals in the ancient times,

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:56.600 align:middle line:90%
right up to as recent as 1937.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And there seems to be
another humanoid kind stone

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.150 align:middle line:84%
man that's lying
on its side that

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:06.360 align:middle line:84%
used to stand upright and be a
guardian for this ritual path

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:10.180 align:middle line:84%
that drugs between the calendar
and the stone altar, which

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:12.750 align:middle line:90%
we believe is also a grave.

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:16.540 align:middle line:84%
This is the view from
Adam's Calendar due north.

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:20.630 align:middle line:84%
And right on the horizon,
you see a tree sticking out.

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:23.400 align:middle line:84%
And when we first
saw that tree--

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.050 align:middle line:84%
and it was a late afternoon
when Johan and I were there

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:31.230 align:middle line:84%
exploring the site, and I
think it was 2008-- and Johan

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:32.800 align:middle line:84%
looked up and he
saw this tree right

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.270 align:middle line:90%
on the edge of the horizon.

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:37.715 align:middle line:84%
And we both went, no,
this is just too strange,

00:14:37.715 --> 00:14:39.980 align:middle line:90%
this is not a coincidence.

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And on the way out
we stopped, and guess

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:44.540 align:middle line:84%
what we found-- we found
the tree growing out

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:49.480 align:middle line:84%
of a beautiful arrangement of
what we call the stone altar.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.120 align:middle line:84%
And there are about three trees
that are growing out of this.

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And it seems that these
trees have been planted there

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:58.810 align:middle line:84%
on purpose for specific
ritualistic purposes.

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And the story gets even more
bizarre and more amazing

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:09.110 align:middle line:84%
the deeper you dig, deeper
you delve into the history.

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:12.300 align:middle line:84%
Enki had a young
son called Dumuzi.

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:14.500 align:middle line:84%
This was Enki's
youngest son, who

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:19.260 align:middle line:84%
died, according to the Sumerian
texts, just after the flood.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.370 align:middle line:84%
Now for some
reason, the Annunaki

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:24.240 align:middle line:84%
decided not to bring
Dumuzi back to life.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.710 align:middle line:84%
Because when you read
the Sumerian texts,

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:28.710 align:middle line:84%
every time one of
the Annunaki died

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:30.350 align:middle line:90%
they brought him back to life.

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:32.710 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting that
in Sitchin's work

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:36.650 align:middle line:84%
he refers in the translations
to the rods or the tools

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:40.450 align:middle line:84%
that they used that pulsed and
vibrated with which they would

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:42.690 align:middle line:90%
bring the people back to life.

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:46.300 align:middle line:84%
Pulsed and vibrated, sound,
resonance, frequency,

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.210 align:middle line:84%
I think you follow
my drift here, right?

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:52.390 align:middle line:84%
So they for some reason didn't
bring Dumuzi back to life.

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:56.910 align:middle line:84%
Now Dumuzi and Inanna is like
the "Romeo and Juliet" story

00:15:56.910 --> 00:16:00.100 align:middle line:84%
in the Sumerian texts--
they were inseparable.

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:03.910 align:middle line:84%
When Dumuzi died,
Inanna was devastated,

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:06.090 align:middle line:90%
and she took his body.

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:09.130 align:middle line:84%
And in one of
Sitchin's books there

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:12.260 align:middle line:84%
is a translation
that reads something

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.070 align:middle line:84%
to this extent-- it
says that Inanna took

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:18.620 align:middle line:90%
Dumuzi's body to the deep Abzu.

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And we now know that the
Abzu is in southern Africa

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.720 align:middle line:84%
where the gold mining
empire was set up.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And she took Dumuzi's
body to the deep Abzu,

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:30.350 align:middle line:84%
which she buried him near
his father's special place

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:34.810 align:middle line:84%
beneath a pile of stones, facing
east so that his soul would

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:36.670 align:middle line:90%
be everlasting.

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And this is
fantastic-- and then it

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:42.400 align:middle line:84%
says "in the land all
of the black people".

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.200 align:middle line:84%
This is phenomenal, because
our history books tell us

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.950 align:middle line:84%
that black people did not
live in southern Africa

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:51.070 align:middle line:90%
until about 3,000 years ago.

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And clearly the Sumerian
texts tell us the contrary.

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:57.260 align:middle line:84%
They tell us that black
people, or Africans,

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.750 align:middle line:84%
were already living
in southern Africa,

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:03.380 align:middle line:84%
and in the deep Abzu
around 12,000 years ago,

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:05.500 align:middle line:90%
or after the so-called flood.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.460 align:middle line:84%
So there's a
phenomenal story here.

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:12.900 align:middle line:84%
So is it possible that this
site 700 meters north of Adam's

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.630 align:middle line:84%
Calendar, or Enki's
Calendar, could possibly

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:17.109 align:middle line:90%
be Dumuzi's grave?

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:19.619 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is, most likely.

00:17:19.619 --> 00:17:23.920 align:middle line:84%
Because we did some phenomenal
ground penetrating radar there

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.800 align:middle line:84%
that suggests that
there's a cavity there

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:31.010 align:middle line:84%
about three meters deeper
right below the stone altar.

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And we also did
infrared photography

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:38.620 align:middle line:84%
that clearly shows there is a
disturbance beneath the stone

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:40.530 align:middle line:84%
altar and beneath
the trees growing out

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:41.940 align:middle line:90%
of that stone altar.

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:47.400 align:middle line:84%
I suggest that if we took
some clippings from the trees

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.340 align:middle line:84%
and we had them analyzed,
we would probably

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:51.930 align:middle line:84%
find some human
remains or minerals

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:57.140 align:middle line:84%
that we find in
human bone caught up

00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:00.700 align:middle line:84%
in the trees that are growing
out of this stone altar.

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:04.440 align:middle line:84%
So I suggest that this is
most likely the resting place

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.690 align:middle line:90%
of Enki's youngest son, Dumuzi.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And we may have a
very strong case

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:13.990 align:middle line:84%
of a real Annunaki being buried
right here on Earth very close

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:15.770 align:middle line:90%
to Adam's Calendar.

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:18.400 align:middle line:84%
Only time will tell, when
we start to excavate this,

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.490 align:middle line:84%
if ever we get
permission to do so,

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:23.970 align:middle line:84%
which under current
conditions is highly unlikely.

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:27.660 align:middle line:84%
Because, as you may know,
I'm not on good standing

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:30.410 align:middle line:84%
with the South African
historical authorities

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:32.360 align:middle line:84%
and those that
control the permits

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.070 align:middle line:90%
for archaeological digs.

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:36.950 align:middle line:84%
They don't seem to like,
for some reason, the stories

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:40.260 align:middle line:84%
that I tell about
ancient African history

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:43.140 align:middle line:84%
and the information
that has been withheld

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:44.530 align:middle line:90%
from all of our history books.

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:47.750 align:middle line:84%
And this takes us to the
discovery of our little Sphinx.

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:50.940 align:middle line:84%
Halfway between Dumuzi's
grave-- or the stone

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:54.050 align:middle line:84%
altar-- we find this
beautiful carving out

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:57.860 align:middle line:84%
of dolerite stone that
clearly resembles a Sphinx.

00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:59.780 align:middle line:90%
It is very badly eroded.

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And I must also
state at this stage

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.310 align:middle line:84%
that the dolerite
stone has a tendency

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:08.830 align:middle line:84%
to peel, to peel off,
and in little layers.

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:11.260 align:middle line:84%
So some of these
ancient structures

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:15.110 align:middle line:84%
or these ancient statues and
carvings made out of dolerite

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:18.500 align:middle line:84%
may have had facial
features in ancient times,

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:21.390 align:middle line:84%
but because they're so
old, these facial features,

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:24.160 align:middle line:84%
and the more detailed features,
would have eroded and probably

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.000 align:middle line:90%
peeled off.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And I find this is possibly
the case with the Sphinx.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.750 align:middle line:84%
Not only with the
Sphinx, but also

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:34.100 align:middle line:84%
with the head of a Sphinx-like
statute inside of Adam's

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:38.980 align:middle line:84%
Calendar, which is clearly a
head that fell off or broke off

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:43.030 align:middle line:84%
one of the bodies that we
find at that particular point.

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:47.140 align:middle line:84%
Here is a beautiful example
of an early Horus bird

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:50.440 align:middle line:84%
or a Horus stone right on
the edge of Adam's Calendar.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.320 align:middle line:84%
This I discovered
one early morning

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:55.160 align:middle line:84%
when I went out there
to have a quick look

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:58.920 align:middle line:84%
at some other things, and
mysterious and by accident

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:02.160 align:middle line:84%
discovered that there's a
Horus stone right on the edge.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.950 align:middle line:90%
It's got a big fat belly.

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:06.620 align:middle line:84%
It's about three meters
tall, so if you stood it up,

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.150 align:middle line:90%
it's quite imposing.

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:10.480 align:middle line:84%
Was about nine
feet, 10 feet tall.

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.570 align:middle line:90%
And nice big fat belly.

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And the head comes around into
the beak of the stone, which

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:16.160 align:middle line:90%
is broken off.

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And you can clearly
see that this

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:23.300 align:middle line:84%
was a very, very old carving of
a Horus or a bird-like statute.

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:26.510 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the layout
of Adam's Calendar,

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:28.790 align:middle line:84%
you can see the Horus
bird right there

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:32.500 align:middle line:84%
marking the rise of the
sun, looking at the three

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:36.240 align:middle line:84%
stones that mark the
rise of Orion's belt.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And this is consistent with so
many ancient sites and so many

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:41.960 align:middle line:84%
of these ancient
structures, when

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.110 align:middle line:84%
we start studying
ancient civilizations

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:47.000 align:middle line:84%
and their obsession with
the stars, and specifically

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.465 align:middle line:84%
Orion's belt, Sirius,
and also the Pleiades.

00:20:50.465 --> 00:20:53.290 align:middle line:84%
And the Pleiades play
a very important part

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:56.010 align:middle line:84%
in ancient African
history and also

00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:58.360 align:middle line:84%
in the history of the
original people of Australia,

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:01.290 align:middle line:84%
the Pleiades are very
important in all of this.

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:04.200 align:middle line:84%
So how do we date the site,
how do we date the stones?

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is where it
becomes really fun,

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:07.560 align:middle line:90%
because you can't date stones.

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:11.120 align:middle line:84%
You can't do carbon dating,
although carbon dating has

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.830 align:middle line:84%
been shown to be most
likely highly inaccurate.

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:16.490 align:middle line:84%
But we look at every
possible angle.

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to share some of
these angles that we looked at

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.130 align:middle line:90%
and the arguments.

00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:23.180 align:middle line:90%
And the first one is geology.

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:26.140 align:middle line:84%
First of all, all the
stones at Adam's Calendar

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:29.120 align:middle line:84%
that make up the actual
site are not from there--

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:33.110 align:middle line:84%
they were brought from somewhere
else to build the actual site.

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:35.340 align:middle line:84%
So that is already a
very strong argument

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:39.600 align:middle line:84%
that the site was created
and built by intent,

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:43.770 align:middle line:84%
and it is not just a natural
formation of stones, which

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:45.960 align:middle line:84%
I must admit that
some archaeologists

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:50.390 align:middle line:84%
and some geologists will hold
onto that nonsensical notion,

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:52.980 align:middle line:84%
even in the face of all
the electronic measurements

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:56.790 align:middle line:84%
that we've done and everything
else that we've presented.

00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:59.860 align:middle line:84%
So the dolerite stones were
brought from somewhere else

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:01.310 align:middle line:90%
to construct the site.

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:05.370 align:middle line:84%
It is right on the edge of the
Transvaal Escarpment, which

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:07.870 align:middle line:84%
is a well-recognized
geological feature.

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:11.740 align:middle line:84%
It is known as black reef
quartzite, rich in gold.

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:12.920 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that funny?

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:14.130 align:middle line:90%
Rich in gold.

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:16.600 align:middle line:84%
As I said before, in
front of Adam's Calendar

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.260 align:middle line:84%
in the Barberton
valley is where you

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:23.780 align:middle line:84%
find Sheba gold mine and
many, many old ancient gold

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:26.640 align:middle line:84%
mines that have been covered
by the sand from the flood.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:28.665 align:middle line:84%
The next evaluation we
looked at is the lichen

00:22:28.665 --> 00:22:29.910 align:middle line:90%
that grows on the rocks.

00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:32.380 align:middle line:84%
Now the lichen in
that you find growing

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:35.240 align:middle line:84%
on this particular stone, the
different types of lichen,

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:39.480 align:middle line:84%
it's that fine material
that grows on the rock.

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And some of it is a specific
kind that grows very,

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:45.270 align:middle line:84%
very slowly-- It grows
one millimeter per annum.

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:47.550 align:middle line:84%
Now these stones are
covered in the lichen.

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And the wide calendar stone
is about two meters wide.

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:55.780 align:middle line:84%
So for the lichen to
cover that stone from side

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:59.900 align:middle line:84%
to side completely-- not just
one layer, but several layers

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.990 align:middle line:84%
of lichen upon lichen growing
on top of each other--

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:06.440 align:middle line:84%
would take thousands
and thousands of years.

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:09.190 align:middle line:84%
So the lichen alone
tells us that the site

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:11.850 align:middle line:84%
is many, many
thousands of years old.

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And the evaluation carries on--
we look further at erosion.

00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:19.190 align:middle line:10%
And this particular stone
really tickled my fancy

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:22.140 align:middle line:10%
when I first found it, because
the erosion on this stone

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:25.790 align:middle line:10%
was so extreme that
it made me concerned

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:29.820 align:middle line:10%
about the age of the site.

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:31.880 align:middle line:84%
Because the other
stones are not nearly as

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:33.770 align:middle line:90%
eroded as this particular one.

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:36.000 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, well,
maybe the stone

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.870 align:middle line:84%
does erode a lot
quicker than we imagine.

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:40.940 align:middle line:84%
Until I met with
Baba Credo Mutwa,

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:42.770 align:middle line:84%
and he told me that
he was initiated

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:44.725 align:middle line:84%
at this particular
site and that it

00:23:44.725 --> 00:23:46.820 align:middle line:90%
is a very special sacred site.

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And then he told
me on their path

00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:52.790 align:middle line:84%
this stone happens to lie
right next to this ritual path

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:56.530 align:middle line:84%
from the calendar to the stone
altar, or Dumuzi's grave.

00:23:56.530 --> 00:24:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And they used to stop on
their walk during the ceremony

00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:05.760 align:middle line:84%
and they had to urinate
on this particular stone.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:08.160 align:middle line:84%
So it was the urinating
on the stone that

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:11.910 align:middle line:84%
made it erode a lot quicker than
all the other stores around it.

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:14.100 align:middle line:84%
So that brought a
lot of relief to me,

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:17.580 align:middle line:84%
because it explains why this
one eroded a lot quicker

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:21.220 align:middle line:84%
and took the erosion
argument a lot deeper.

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:23.880 align:middle line:84%
Patina is a
fascinating argument.

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:27.070 align:middle line:84%
Now patina grows on
these particular stones.

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And these are the
stones that we find

00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:33.420 align:middle line:84%
in the stone ruins scattered
throughout this whole area.

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And these are stones
that have very

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:38.460 align:middle line:84%
strong acoustic
properties, which

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:40.090 align:middle line:90%
I'll talk about some more.

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:41.940 align:middle line:84%
But you can see in
this particular image

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:43.960 align:middle line:84%
that the natural
color of the stone

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.760 align:middle line:90%
is black-- it's a black color.

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And then as it breaks,
the patina starts to grow.

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's a combination
of calcification

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:54.300 align:middle line:90%
and crystallization.

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And the patina grows
both from the outside

00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:57.860 align:middle line:90%
and also from the inside.

00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:00.190 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like
it consumes a bit

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:02.160 align:middle line:90%
of the stone from the outside.

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.830 align:middle line:84%
But this patina, this
brownish-reddish color

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:06.960 align:middle line:90%
grows very, very slowly.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.910 align:middle line:84%
The crystal substance,
or the crystal formation

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:12.950 align:middle line:84%
of the patina, happens
within milliseconds

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:17.090 align:middle line:84%
if you break the rock-- it
starts to grow immediately.

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:21.550 align:middle line:84%
But the thicker the patina
grows, the slower it grows.

00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:24.610 align:middle line:84%
Now by the time you can
see this patina grows

00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:27.700 align:middle line:84%
with your naked eye,
when it starts to come up

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:32.640 align:middle line:84%
as a very light
brownish-reddish sort of image,

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:35.990 align:middle line:84%
or it's like a shade that
starts to appear on the rock,

00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:39.050 align:middle line:84%
that particular patina growth
is already a few thousand years

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:41.390 align:middle line:90%
old, because it grows so slowly.

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:43.780 align:middle line:84%
So when you find
stones like this one

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:47.080 align:middle line:84%
inside the walls of one
of the stone circles--

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:49.110 align:middle line:84%
this was one of the
standing monoliths.

00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:50.960 align:middle line:90%
And clearly it had a tip.

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:53.350 align:middle line:84%
That particular tip
broke off at some stage.

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:56.190 align:middle line:84%
After it broke off-- it's
still standing in place right

00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:58.860 align:middle line:84%
now-- after it broke
off, the patina

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:02.670 align:middle line:84%
has grown back on top of that
stone about two millimeters.

00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:05.530 align:middle line:84%
Now what I can tell
you is for this patina

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:10.510 align:middle line:84%
to grow back two millimeters
suggests that that stone,

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:13.200 align:middle line:84%
after the tip had
broken off, that stone

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.810 align:middle line:84%
has been standing
there for probably

00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:16.620 align:middle line:90%
more than 100,000 years.

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:18.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very
clear indicator

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:20.610 align:middle line:84%
how old some of
these structures are.

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:23.500 align:middle line:84%
So patina growth is
very, very important.

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:26.930 align:middle line:84%
This is another argument for
the patina growth indicating

00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:29.710 align:middle line:84%
how old some of
these structures are.

00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:33.700 align:middle line:84%
There are hundreds of carvings
in rock similar to this one

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:37.640 align:middle line:84%
showing the stone circles
with no doors and entrances.

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And I've photographed
probably 200

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:44.580 align:middle line:84%
of these on rocks and stones
in the vicinity of the stone

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:45.480 align:middle line:90%
circles.

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:49.110 align:middle line:84%
It seems that they-- I'm not
quite sure whether they carved

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:52.450 align:middle line:84%
the stone circles or the
structure of them first,

00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:54.280 align:middle line:84%
or they built the
stone circles and then

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:58.970 align:middle line:84%
they carved the images
into nearby stones to

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:01.880 align:middle line:84%
imitate the structure
of the stone circle.

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:04.420 align:middle line:84%
This is still
puzzling me-- I'm not

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:05.900 align:middle line:90%
quite sure which came first.

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:09.190 align:middle line:84%
But this particular
carving on this flat rock

00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:11.980 align:middle line:84%
is a very important
indicator of how old

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:16.350 align:middle line:84%
this carving most likely is, and
how old the stone circles are.

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:19.120 align:middle line:84%
Because whoever created
this carving would not

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:21.200 align:middle line:84%
have called it over
a crack-- there

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.730 align:middle line:84%
are enough beautiful
flat stones for you

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:27.400 align:middle line:84%
to make a beautiful fresh
carving into a flat surface

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.460 align:middle line:90%
without a crack through it.

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:31.660 align:middle line:84%
So we have to assume
that the crack occurred

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:33.550 align:middle line:90%
after the carving was made.

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:37.120 align:middle line:84%
Now this is the same kind of
rock, black on the inside.

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And the patina,
the reddish patina,

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:42.150 align:middle line:84%
grows over the break
when it breaks.

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:45.030 align:middle line:84%
Now when you look at the
crack through this carving,

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:48.260 align:middle line:84%
you cannot see any
black rock at all--

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:51.930 align:middle line:84%
no evidence of the colors
of the rock on the inside,

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:56.070 align:middle line:84%
which means that the patina had
grown back into the crack after

00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:57.480 align:middle line:90%
the crack had formed.

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And this means that
this carving must

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:03.380 align:middle line:84%
be way more than 50,000 years
old for that patina to fill

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:05.570 align:middle line:90%
that crack so completely.

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:09.040 align:middle line:84%
So once again, simple
observations like this

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:13.370 align:middle line:84%
just defy any logic
why our historians

00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:15.430 align:middle line:84%
and our archaeologists
do not take

00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:20.440 align:middle line:84%
this kind of clear indication
into consideration.

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:23.090 align:middle line:90%
It boggles the mind, truly.

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:27.790 align:middle line:84%
Here is just a curiosity
how thick-skinned historians

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:30.010 align:middle line:84%
and archaeologists
are when it comes

00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:34.100 align:middle line:84%
to the dating of these stone
structures and Adam's Calendar.

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:36.970 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
ruins in Zimbabwe

00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:39.650 align:middle line:84%
and one of the
famous baobab trees

00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:42.890 align:middle line:84%
that is estimated to be
about 3,000 years old.

00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:45.970 align:middle line:84%
This baobab tree happens
to be growing out

00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:47.840 align:middle line:90%
of one of the walls.

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.980 align:middle line:84%
Now clearly it
must have happened

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:54.360 align:middle line:84%
when a seed from a nearby
baobab tree fell into the wall,

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:56.140 align:middle line:84%
and then it took
root and started

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:58.950 align:middle line:90%
to grow, pushing the wall aside.

00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:02.120 align:middle line:84%
But this is not what our
historians will tell us.

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:03.890 align:middle line:84%
They tell us that
the people that

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:06.050 align:middle line:84%
built this particular
structure had

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:10.620 align:middle line:84%
a particular habit of building
the walls into the tree.

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:13.150 align:middle line:84%
This is how
thick-skinned they are

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:17.030 align:middle line:84%
and how determined they are to
make these ancient sites not

00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:17.590 align:middle line:90%
so old.

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:20.750 align:middle line:84%
Because it's impossible for
it to be more than 3,000 years

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:24.920 align:middle line:84%
old, so they had to come up with
a nonsensical idea as to how

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:29.390 align:middle line:84%
the baobab tree could
possibly grow out of the wall.

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:35.140 align:middle line:84%
It's just a lighthearted
moment in this research journey

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:36.370 align:middle line:90%
that we take.

00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:40.510 align:middle line:84%
But by far the most
mind boggling discovery

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:45.330 align:middle line:84%
about the age of Adam's Calendar
is the archaeoastronomy.

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:48.140 align:middle line:84%
Because when you look
at the Google shots,

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:52.390 align:middle line:84%
you can clearly see the ancient
site was a circular structure,

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:54.230 align:middle line:84%
and the blob at
the top was north,

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:56.090 align:middle line:84%
and the blob at the
bottom is south.

00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:58.530 align:middle line:84%
But you can see that
the north-south does not

00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:02.330 align:middle line:84%
run at 12 o'clock, and that
doesn't make any sense.

00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:04.210 align:middle line:90%
These guys didn't make mistakes.

00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:07.430 align:middle line:84%
They didn't accidentally
build it off north, south,

00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:08.630 align:middle line:90%
east, west.

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And when we measured
this out, we

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:15.300 align:middle line:84%
found that the misalignment
was about three degrees, 17

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:20.940 align:middle line:84%
minutes, and 43 seconds or
42 seconds counter-clockwise.

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And this just doesn't
make any sense.

00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And remember that
this has got nothing

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:27.542 align:middle line:84%
to do with the precessional
wobble of the earth, the fact

00:30:27.542 --> 00:30:31.251 align:middle line:84%
that the earth wobbles on
its axis every 25,000, 26,000

00:30:31.251 --> 00:30:31.750 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:33.291 align:middle line:84%
This has got nothing
to do with that.

00:30:33.291 --> 00:30:36.000 align:middle line:84%
These are the cardinal points
of planet Earth-- north,

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:36.970 align:middle line:90%
south, east, west.

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:39.930 align:middle line:84%
That does not move,
that should stay fixed.

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:43.090 align:middle line:84%
This is not magnetic
north, this is true north.

00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:48.670 align:middle line:84%
So what this tells us is that
Adam's Calendar was constructed

00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:52.600 align:middle line:84%
at a time when north,
south, east, west

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:56.350 align:middle line:84%
are not or were not
where they are today.

00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:58.360 align:middle line:90%
We just don't know when this is.

00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And there's some
researchers and scientists

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:04.760 align:middle line:84%
in the past that have speculated
about giant catastrophes

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:08.530 align:middle line:84%
and cataclysms that would've
been so dramatic that would

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:12.760 align:middle line:84%
have actually shifted the
north-south alignment away

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:14.170 align:middle line:90%
from where it is today.

00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:17.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, Adam's Calendar
is proof that we've

00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:22.530 align:middle line:84%
had such a cataclysm, such a
dramatic event in our history

00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:26.710 align:middle line:84%
and the history of this planet,
that shifted north-south away

00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:28.810 align:middle line:90%
from where it is today.

00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And this takes us to another
discovery of Adam's Calendar,

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:34.780 align:middle line:90%
that is the stellar alignment.

00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:36.430 align:middle line:84%
Many ancient
cultures are obsessed

00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:39.050 align:middle line:84%
with the rise of
Orion, and there's

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:41.560 align:middle line:84%
no greater example
than what was shown

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:44.570 align:middle line:84%
by Robert Bauval and the
Great Pyramids of Giza,

00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:46.340 align:middle line:84%
that it aligned with
the rise of Orion.

00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:49.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, the same can be
said for Adam's Calendar,

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:52.240 align:middle line:84%
except it seems that Adam's
Calendar is a lot older

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:54.290 align:middle line:90%
than the pyramids at Giza.

00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to come
to that very soon.

00:31:56.370 --> 00:31:58.850 align:middle line:84%
Here we have the
Horus stone, which

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:02.275 align:middle line:84%
marks the rise of the sun,
consistent with what we learn

00:32:02.275 --> 00:32:06.650 align:middle line:84%
at Egypt, looking at the
rise of Orion-- everything

00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:09.390 align:middle line:84%
is very similar to
what we find in Egypt.

00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And then we discovered
something even more spectacular.

00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And you know, at this stage I've
been going to Adam's Calendar

00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:19.720 align:middle line:84%
for probably about a
year or maybe a bit more

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:22.610 align:middle line:84%
and looking down
into the valley.

00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's like not seeing
the wood for the trees,

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:26.790 align:middle line:84%
until I took a
guy out on a tour.

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And he pointed at these
two structures down there

00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:31.650 align:middle line:84%
and he said, those look
just like pyramids.

00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And from that moment on,
the moment you see it,

00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:35.760 align:middle line:90%
you cannot see it.

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And we realize
that we are looking

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:41.300 align:middle line:84%
at what is most likely two
pyramidal structures right

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:42.060 align:middle line:90%
in the valley.

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:45.400 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the-- and
this is right in the middle

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:47.960 align:middle line:84%
of the Barberton
valley-- and this

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:50.270 align:middle line:84%
is one of the early
photographs of Johan Heine

00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:52.260 align:middle line:84%
when he was doing the
early evaluations,

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:55.250 align:middle line:84%
and the measurements, and the
alignments at Adam's Calendar.

00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:58.750 align:middle line:84%
You can just see the top of
the stones at the calendar,

00:32:58.750 --> 00:33:01.560 align:middle line:84%
and in the distance the
two pyramidal structures

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:04.560 align:middle line:84%
right in the center of
the Barberton valley

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:06.900 align:middle line:84%
as Johan is walking
away from it.

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:10.660 align:middle line:84%
So I asked myself, what is
the statistical probability

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:14.620 align:middle line:84%
that these stone structures,
or these pyramids,

00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:17.490 align:middle line:84%
are connected to
Adam's Calendar?

00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And I thought about
this for a while,

00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:23.890 align:middle line:84%
and I realize that these ancient
civilizations did everything

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:26.510 align:middle line:90%
based on sacred geometry.

00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:33.270 align:middle line:84%
So I said, let's see if we draw
a golden spiral will it somehow

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:35.870 align:middle line:84%
connect the pyramids
to the calendar.

00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:39.910 align:middle line:84%
And if it does, we have a very
good statistical probability

00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:42.290 align:middle line:84%
argument that the
two are connected

00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:44.460 align:middle line:84%
and that they affect
each other, or they

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:46.230 align:middle line:90%
come from the same period.

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:47.740 align:middle line:90%
And guess what we found?

00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:51.670 align:middle line:84%
I drew a golden mean spiral
from Adam's Calendar.

00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And guess where it ends,
right between the pyramids.

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:59.470 align:middle line:84%
And the statistical probability
of this happening by accident

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:02.360 align:middle line:84%
is several million, if not
several billion, to one.

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:06.440 align:middle line:84%
So the probability argument
is that they're connected.

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And somehow it seems that these
pyramidal structures may have

00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:11.780 align:middle line:90%
been carved out of the bedrock.

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:16.570 align:middle line:84%
Today that destroyed,
they no longer

00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:19.600 align:middle line:84%
look like pyramids, they're
not built from pyramid blocks.

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:24.550 align:middle line:84%
But they still have very
strange energetic anomalies.

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:29.460 align:middle line:84%
For example, just like we found
in the early days of taking

00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:31.670 align:middle line:84%
tourists to Adam's
Calendar, the moment you

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:36.050 align:middle line:84%
walk into that structure
you lose satellite,

00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:38.139 align:middle line:90%
you lose your GPS connection.

00:34:38.139 --> 00:34:39.989 align:middle line:90%
And this is just unbelievable.

00:34:39.989 --> 00:34:43.460 align:middle line:84%
You literally step a meter
in and your GPS connection

00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:44.320 align:middle line:90%
is gone.

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, the same
effect happens when

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:48.300 align:middle line:84%
you stand between
the pyramids down

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:51.090 align:middle line:84%
in the valley-- your
GPS connection simply

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:52.250 align:middle line:90%
goes out of the window.

00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And your GPS starts going
crazy and it keeps changing.

00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:59.570 align:middle line:84%
It's not as if it's wrong-- it
keeps changing its position.

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:02.620 align:middle line:84%
It's like it keeps losing its
connection to the satellite

00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:05.040 align:middle line:84%
and giving you a
different position where

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.550 align:middle line:90%
you're supposed to be.

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:10.630 align:middle line:84%
So what else have we got
about Adam's Calendar?

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:13.620 align:middle line:84%
The mystery just gets
deeper and deeper.

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:16.310 align:middle line:84%
When you connect Adam's
Calendar, or actually

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:20.640 align:middle line:84%
the pyramids of Adam's
Calendar, to Great Zimbabwe,

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:24.340 align:middle line:84%
or what I believe is Enki's
house, or the headquarters

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:27.940 align:middle line:84%
of this vast gold mining
operation of the Annunaki,

00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:29.660 align:middle line:90%
guess where it takes you?

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:32.300 align:middle line:84%
Right to the Great
Pyramid of Giza.

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And this is all along
the Nilotic meridian,

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:39.530 align:middle line:84%
or the ancient 31 degrees
east longitudinal line,

00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:44.550 align:middle line:84%
which I believe was the ancient
GMT-- Greenwich Mean Time--

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:46.980 align:middle line:90%
line was 31 degrees east.

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:49.380 align:middle line:84%
It connects the
Great Pyramid of Giza

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:52.710 align:middle line:84%
with Great Zimbabwe
and Adam's Calendar?

00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:55.030 align:middle line:90%
What is the coincidence of that?

00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:56.940 align:middle line:90%
You make up your own mind.

00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:58.950 align:middle line:84%
But one of the most
important discoveries

00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:03.600 align:middle line:84%
I made in terms of dating Adam's
Calendar, or Enki's Calendar,

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:07.020 align:middle line:84%
comes from one of Zecharia
Sitchin's translations.

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And I must admit, I
nearly fell on my back

00:36:09.310 --> 00:36:10.790 align:middle line:90%
when I first read this.

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Because it is as if
he had completely

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:18.190 align:middle line:84%
predicted the discovery
of this ancient site.

00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:19.920 align:middle line:10%
And this is what it says.

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:22.650 align:middle line:10%
"40 shar often
arriving on Earth, Enki

00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:25.850 align:middle line:10%
built a special place of
observing in the deep Abzu

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:28.400 align:middle line:10%
on the edge of a cliff
aligned with his abode

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.700 align:middle line:10%
in the north and the peaks."

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:33.510 align:middle line:84%
Now I suggest this
his abode in the north

00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:36.340 align:middle line:84%
is Great Zimbabwe-- it's
aligned, as we know.

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:38.320 align:middle line:84%
And the peaks-- I
don't think they're

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:40.070 align:middle line:84%
referring to the
Great Pyramid of Giza

00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:42.970 align:middle line:84%
here, because I think
this site was established

00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:45.190 align:middle line:84%
before the pyramid
of Giza was built.

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:47.110 align:middle line:84%
But I think they're
referring to the pyramids

00:36:47.110 --> 00:36:50.500 align:middle line:84%
in the valley that are aligned
with the actual calendar--

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:53.760 align:middle line:84%
as we've shown, it's connected
with a golden spiral.

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:56.960 align:middle line:84%
If you do the numbers
on this, if one shar is

00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:01.570 align:middle line:84%
3,600 years-- as Zecharia
Sitchin suggests-- and you take

00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:09.830 align:middle line:84%
40 shar multiplied by 3,600, and
you subtract that from 435,000,

00:37:09.830 --> 00:37:13.580 align:middle line:84%
or around that number-- which
Zecharia Sitchin suggests

00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:15.650 align:middle line:84%
is the time when
the Annunaki arrived

00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:18.050 align:middle line:84%
on Earth-- the number
you come up with

00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:21.470 align:middle line:90%
is around 285,000 years.

00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:24.930 align:middle line:84%
So what this tells us,
that Adam's Calendar

00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:29.500 align:middle line:84%
was built around
285,000 years ago.

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And much of this is consistent
with the creation of humanity

00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:37.012 align:middle line:84%
and the sudden appearance of
Homo sapiens on this planet.

00:37:37.012 --> 00:37:38.970 align:middle line:84%
We're going to end the
story of Adam's Calendar

00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:41.800 align:middle line:84%
here, although I could go
on for a long, long time.

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And in the next
episode, we're going

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:46.210 align:middle line:84%
to pick up with the significance
of the millions of stone

00:37:46.210 --> 00:37:50.600 align:middle line:84%
circles in southern Africa
and what they really are.

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:53.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm Michael Tellinger,
