00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.800 align:middle line:10%
>>Hello, I'm Michael
Tellinger and our journey

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.790 align:middle line:10%
continues exploring the miracle
of sound and its application

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.240 align:middle line:10%
as a tool and technology
and a device that

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.980 align:middle line:10%
can be used in so many
ways to benefit humanity.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.120 align:middle line:84%
We ended off last time
by looking at Peter Davey

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.750 align:middle line:84%
from New Zealand who
boiled water with sound

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.180 align:middle line:84%
and could have actually helped
the world in cleaning up

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.370 align:middle line:84%
the pollution created by
the coal mining activities

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.500 align:middle line:84%
and using coal to power so many
power plants around the world.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.490 align:middle line:84%
That takes us to one of the
most critical areas of sound

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.540 align:middle line:84%
as a healer and the fact
that the cure for all disease

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.870 align:middle line:84%
has been discovered
so many times

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.990 align:middle line:84%
by so many people around the
world through ancient times

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.020 align:middle line:84%
and always removed from society
because curing disease is not

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.220 align:middle line:90%
good for business.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And this is really important
for us to internalize.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.170 align:middle line:84%
That as long as we have
pharmaceutical companies

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.050 align:middle line:84%
and drug cartels running the
world and managing disease,

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.690 align:middle line:84%
anyone who comes up
with a cure for disease

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.690 align:middle line:90%
will simply be removed.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.020 align:middle line:84%
So we need to find ways of
bypassing this control system,

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.810 align:middle line:84%
and we'll be discussing those
ways further on and later on

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.900 align:middle line:90%
in this series of programs.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.910 align:middle line:10%
So this takes us to
Royal Raymond Rife, one

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.510 align:middle line:10%
of the most famous
individuals in 1931,

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.490 align:middle line:10%
was called the man who found
the cure for all disease.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.180 align:middle line:84%
His universal
microscope could see

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.250 align:middle line:84%
living cells for the
first time, and we

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.000 align:middle line:84%
could see how the effect
of sound and resonance

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.230 align:middle line:84%
affected the cells and
not just the cells,

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.470 align:middle line:84%
but viruses and
bacteria, as well.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.160 align:middle line:84%
So what Royal Rife
actually did is show us

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.960 align:middle line:84%
how using the prime
resonance frequency and sound

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.750 align:middle line:84%
and resonance he could
manipulate and control disease.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.170 align:middle line:90%
It's well-documented.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.030 align:middle line:84%
Much has been written about
him, many documentaries

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.030 align:middle line:90%
have been made.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And what's critical
to understand

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.930 align:middle line:90%
is he's not the only one.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.645 align:middle line:84%
What I found was a book
in a beautiful library

00:02:28.645 --> 00:02:30.760 align:middle line:90%
in Sedona, Arizona.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.640 align:middle line:90%
One of Rife's handwritten books.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.510 align:middle line:84%
It's got about 800
pages, I guess, in it.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.720 align:middle line:90%
Each one is handwritten.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.520 align:middle line:84%
Every page specifically
talks about the treatment

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.240 align:middle line:90%
for all kinds of diseases.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.900 align:middle line:84%
I was astounded
to find this book

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.650 align:middle line:84%
because I was under
the impression

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.240 align:middle line:84%
that very little of Rife's
research and evidence

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.900 align:middle line:84%
is there for people to
scrutinize and look at.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And yet, here we have one
of these books handwritten

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.540 align:middle line:90%
for everyone to see.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.650 align:middle line:84%
This page, for example,
shows us the treatment

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.930 align:middle line:90%
of a number of cancers.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.970 align:middle line:84%
This one deals with
diphtheria, and this page

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.180 align:middle line:90%
deals with tuberculosis.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.210 align:middle line:84%
I think I photographed
about 100 pages in this book

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.570 align:middle line:90%
until I got tired.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.640 align:middle line:84%
But it just shows us that
this information is out there.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.420 align:middle line:84%
But this is not the only
information out there.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.850 align:middle line:84%
There are other
more recent examples

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.980 align:middle line:84%
of using sound and resonance to
cure disease and specifically,

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.050 align:middle line:90%
cancer.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.640 align:middle line:84%
A music professor from
Skidmore University

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.830 align:middle line:84%
showed us during
a Ted Talk in 2011

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.140 align:middle line:84%
how sound can be
used to cure cancer.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.860 align:middle line:84%
I thought that by now we would
have much more information

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.800 align:middle line:84%
and knowledge out
there about it,

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.930 align:middle line:84%
and how certain
companies would be

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.880 align:middle line:84%
getting onto this information
and doing something with it.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And yet, just like
old previous times,

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.210 align:middle line:84%
this information
has simply vanished

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.630 align:middle line:84%
and you have to go
looking for it to find it.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.900 align:middle line:84%
So take a look at this little
video clip that shows us

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.560 align:middle line:84%
how sound frequencies
and specifically,

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.500 align:middle line:84%
between, as he mentions, between
100,000 and 300,000 hertz that

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.399 align:middle line:84%
seem to really be effective
in destroying cancer cells.

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:19.329 align:middle line:10%
>>These are the
first videos taken.

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.910 align:middle line:10%


00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.850 align:middle line:10%
We showed these
videos to our friends

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.950 align:middle line:10%
in the biology department.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.830 align:middle line:10%
They said they hadn't seen
anything quite like it.

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.560 align:middle line:10%
Seems to be a new phenomenon.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.470 align:middle line:90%


00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.300 align:middle line:84%
These organisms
are being shattered

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.520 align:middle line:90%
by our electronic signals.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.620 align:middle line:84%
This is a harmless
organism, almost friendly,

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.480 align:middle line:90%
a little Blepharisma.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.700 align:middle line:84%
And normally they're
very fast swimmers,

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.270 align:middle line:84%
but when you approach a
frequency to which they

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.520 align:middle line:84%
are vulnerable, they
begin to slow down,

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.680 align:middle line:84%
then they stop, and then
they begin to disintegrate

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.270 align:middle line:90%
within about three minutes.

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.080 align:middle line:84%
So first, we attacked
pancreatic cancer.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.250 align:middle line:10%
Take a good look at this
slide because the next one

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.090 align:middle line:10%
will look quite different.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.460 align:middle line:10%
After we treat these cells,
they change their shape and size

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.760 align:middle line:10%
and they begin to grow
long rope-like structures

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.850 align:middle line:10%
out the sides.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.520 align:middle line:84%
They look something
like antennas.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.230 align:middle line:84%
I call them bioantennas
for biological antennas.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:31.310 align:middle line:84%
It's as if the cancer cells are
trying to tune into our signal.

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.070 align:middle line:84%
We now know that
cancer is vulnerable

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.970 align:middle line:84%
between the frequencies of
100,000 hertz and 300,000

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.010 align:middle line:90%
hertz.

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.610 align:middle line:90%
So now we attack leukemia cells.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.630 align:middle line:90%


00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.310 align:middle line:84%
Leukemia cell number one tries
to grow a copy of itself,

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.280 align:middle line:84%
but the new cell is shattered
into dozens of fragments

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.660 align:middle line:90%
and scattered across the slide.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.590 align:middle line:84%
Leukemia cell number two then
hyperinflates and also dies.

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.340 align:middle line:84%
Leukemia cell number
three then tries

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.390 align:middle line:90%
to make another cancer cell.

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:13.195 align:middle line:84%
The new cell is shattered
and the original cell dies.

00:06:13.195 --> 00:06:18.390 align:middle line:90%


00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:22.070 align:middle line:10%
Now we attack
ovarian cancer cells.

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.950 align:middle line:10%
This is a more distant shot.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.810 align:middle line:10%
Here you see brackets
coming up around the cells

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.750 align:middle line:10%
showing groups of
ovarian cancer cells

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.040 align:middle line:10%
which are being destroyed.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:51.270 align:middle line:90%


00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.490 align:middle line:10%
You can see by the
end of the video

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:57.390 align:middle line:10%
that a great many ovarian
cancer cells were destroyed

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:01.650 align:middle line:10%
>>So where else do we use sound
in modern advanced technology?

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:05.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, the magnetron
is a famous example

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.310 align:middle line:90%
of how resonance is used.

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:11.080 align:middle line:84%
A magnetron is a resonance
energy generating device,

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.150 align:middle line:84%
and magnetrons are
found in laser beams.

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.970 align:middle line:84%
Magnetrons are
found in microwaves.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And a tiny little magnetron
can create so much energy

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.150 align:middle line:84%
that a laser beam that
comes out of that magnetron

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.350 align:middle line:84%
can actually cut metal
in a split second.

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:31.040 align:middle line:84%
So magnetrons are really
high-energy generating devices

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.500 align:middle line:90%
using resonance as a source.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:35.160 align:middle line:84%
So once again,
sound and resonance

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.170 align:middle line:90%
creating huge amounts of energy.

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:41.030 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine how far
we can take this thing using

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:43.060 align:middle line:90%
magnetron-like structures.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.340 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see when
we get to South Africa

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.790 align:middle line:84%
and the ancient stone ruins
how this is all connected,

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:52.040 align:middle line:84%
in case you're wondering
where I'm going with this.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.950 align:middle line:10%
One of the recent
discoveries that

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:58.500 align:middle line:10%
was released just
recently in 2014,

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:02.670 align:middle line:10%
on the 5th of August 2014,
Lawrence Berkeley National

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:05.190 align:middle line:10%
Laboratory announced
that sound can

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:08.450 align:middle line:10%
act as a cloak of
invisibility, and

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:12.080 align:middle line:10%
that under specific conditions
and specific frequencies,

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.980 align:middle line:10%
you can use sound to
make things invisible.

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:17.760 align:middle line:84%
In a related article,
they also talk

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:21.190 align:middle line:84%
about this weird
pyramid-like structure,

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:26.020 align:middle line:84%
or a weird roof-like structure
that's in a pyramid shape

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:27.970 align:middle line:90%
can make things invisible.

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:31.310 align:middle line:84%
When you expose the structure
to certain frequencies,

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:34.950 align:middle line:84%
anything you put underneath
it seems to disappear,

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:36.620 align:middle line:90%
become invisible.

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.980 align:middle line:84%
I find this really fascinating
because if you think

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:43.440 align:middle line:84%
about ancient
architecture in the east,

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.480 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the monasteries
and what the monks do

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:52.560 align:middle line:84%
in monasteries they get together
and they chant and they hum.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that the
ancient Eastern architecture

00:08:56.430 --> 00:09:02.990 align:middle line:84%
and the monasteries are somehow
creations in specific shapes

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:06.760 align:middle line:84%
to aid the monks in making
themselves invisible.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:12.030 align:middle line:84%
Is it possibly a tool
against enemies or armies

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:14.010 align:middle line:90%
marching against the monks?

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:17.400 align:middle line:84%
All they do is get together,
sit around in a circle,

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.510 align:middle line:84%
and hum and chant and create
a specific resonant frequency

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:24.500 align:middle line:84%
and make themselves and the
whole monastery disappear,

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:25.820 align:middle line:90%
become invisible.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:29.090 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a great defensive
tactic and mechanism.

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's certainly a nonviolent
approach towards aggression,

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:36.460 align:middle line:84%
just making yourself
invisible from those

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:37.910 align:middle line:90%
who want to do you harm.

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:38.970 align:middle line:90%
And so it goes.

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:41.950 align:middle line:84%
But one of my most
startling discoveries

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:45.350 align:middle line:84%
in the past few
years is the fact

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:51.000 align:middle line:84%
that it is the sound of the
air we breathe that actually

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.470 align:middle line:84%
energizes the oxygen.
Keep in mind that oxygen

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.560 align:middle line:84%
is the common denominator
in the three most

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.700 align:middle line:84%
abundant elements
and the three things

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.990 align:middle line:90%
that are part of our lives.

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:06.030 align:middle line:84%
The air we breathe
is the oxygen,

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:09.950 align:middle line:84%
H2O and the water we
drink, and silicon dioxide

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:13.820 align:middle line:84%
or the crystals, crystalline
structure around us

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.490 align:middle line:84%
in the sandstone,
in the quartzes,

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:20.830 align:middle line:84%
the quartzites, the
dolerites, and so forth.

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:23.630 align:middle line:84%
All the sand, the
beaches around the world,

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:26.440 align:middle line:84%
there is so much sand and
so much silicon dioxide

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.330 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.140 align:middle line:84%
Between water and silicon
dioxide and the oxygen

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:33.080 align:middle line:84%
we breathe, we have
a common denominator

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.560 align:middle line:84%
of oxygen in all three
of these elements.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that we
need to take cognizance of,

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:41.550 align:middle line:84%
the importance of
this thing called

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:46.360 align:middle line:84%
oxygen and its manipulation
and how it works in our lives.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.580 align:middle line:90%
So what happens when we breathe?

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:50.730 align:middle line:84%
I spent five years
at medical school

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:53.760 align:middle line:84%
at Wits University
in Johannesburg

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:58.510 align:middle line:84%
and not once were we ever
taught or explained what happens

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:01.200 align:middle line:90%
to the oxygen when we breathe.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:05.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, it just so happens
that as you breathe,

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:06.980 align:middle line:90%
it makes a lot of sound.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.230 align:middle line:84%
We don't hear ourselves
breathe, but if you actually

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:12.760 align:middle line:84%
just put your hand to your ear
and listen to your breathing,

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:16.070 align:middle line:84%
you realize that it's a lot
of noise that gets created.

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:18.840 align:middle line:84%
A very specific sound
that gets created

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:24.970 align:middle line:84%
by your windpipe, your
trachea, all the pipes

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:30.120 align:middle line:84%
that get smaller and smaller
as they go into the alveoli.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:33.090 align:middle line:84%
So by the time the
sound and the air

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:36.920 align:middle line:84%
moves through your
windpipes into your lungs,

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:41.450 align:middle line:84%
it keeps speeding up and the
sound becomes more intense.

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:45.040 align:middle line:84%
By the time the sound
of the air you breathe

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.540 align:middle line:84%
reaches your alveoli
in your lungs,

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:51.180 align:middle line:84%
it's moving at
hypersound speeds.

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:54.980 align:middle line:84%
It's most likely moving
beyond the speed of light,

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:58.400 align:middle line:84%
and this is creating a
huge amount of energy.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And it is this sound
and the energy generated

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:05.000 align:middle line:84%
by the sound of
the air we breathe

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.640 align:middle line:84%
that energizes the oxygen
in the air we breathe.

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:15.220 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it makes no sense
because we breathe oxygen in

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:17.330 align:middle line:90%
and we breathe oxygen out.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:20.320 align:middle line:84%
We don't consume the
oxygen. We don't use it

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.770 align:middle line:84%
up because if we did we'd
be in a whole lot of trouble

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:27.060 align:middle line:84%
on this planet because there'd
be no bloody oxygen left.

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:30.600 align:middle line:84%
So keep in mind,
oxygen in, oxygen out.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.830 align:middle line:84%
We breathe it out as carbon
dioxide or carbon monoxide,

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:35.160 align:middle line:90%
all depends how sick you are.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.320 align:middle line:84%
So it's the sound of
the air we breathe

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:42.620 align:middle line:84%
that plays a critical
role in us staying alive.

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:46.180 align:middle line:84%
And the oxygen, as it
moves from our lungs

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:50.290 align:middle line:84%
into our bloodstream, taken
to the cells of our bodies,

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:53.640 align:middle line:84%
the oxygen then gets stripped
of the energy and the charge

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:57.620 align:middle line:84%
created by the sound and
is expelled from our bodies

00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:59.760 align:middle line:90%
again just to be reused again.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.810 align:middle line:84%
This is a critical
bit of information

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:04.850 align:middle line:84%
that I believe is going
to serve us well as we

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:07.630 align:middle line:84%
explore and discover
how to use sound

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:11.230 align:middle line:84%
for the benefit of humanity
in months and years to come.

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:13.570 align:middle line:90%
And so we move further.

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:16.970 align:middle line:10%
The structure of the
alveoli become critical

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:20.530 align:middle line:10%
because I'm going to point to
you the fact that the alveoli

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:26.060 align:middle line:10%
are hexagonal shapes connected
to the bronchi and the trachea

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:29.620 align:middle line:10%
and the different pipes that
come from your windpipe that

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:32.080 align:middle line:10%
get smaller and smaller
eventually ending up

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:35.080 align:middle line:10%
in the alveoli and the
hexagonal structure.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:37.040 align:middle line:84%
Very important
shape for us to take

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:41.120 align:middle line:84%
note of when we start comparing
this to some of the structures

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.600 align:middle line:84%
we find in the ancient
ruins of Southern Africa.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm preparing you for
some of this information

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:50.470 align:middle line:84%
so that it makes sense
when we get there later on.

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:52.810 align:middle line:90%
Sound creates hurricanes.

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:53.800 align:middle line:90%
This is spectacular.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.780 align:middle line:84%
Just by looking at photographs
of hurricanes and the spirals,

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:00.340 align:middle line:84%
it's a dead giveaway
what's going on here.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.560 align:middle line:84%
Remember, everything in
our existence, everything

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.980 align:middle line:84%
to do with sound
and energy is always

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:07.390 align:middle line:84%
to do with vortex
fields and spirals.

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:11.280 align:middle line:84%
Everything in our reality
is a spiral activity.

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:14.400 align:middle line:84%
Our sun, our solar
system doesn't just

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:18.360 align:middle line:84%
move through space, it
spirals through space.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:23.780 align:middle line:84%
The whole sun moves throughout
space in a spiral shape

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.960 align:middle line:84%
and the planets
seem to be dragged

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:30.430 align:middle line:84%
by the sun and the gravity it
creates in a spiral fashion.

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:33.900 align:middle line:84%
So think about it, the
way that the electrons

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:37.872 align:middle line:84%
move around the atom,
the center of the atom,

00:14:37.872 --> 00:14:40.070 align:middle line:90%
the nucleus of the atom.

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:46.810 align:middle line:84%
The way that water spirals
down the drain and the spirals

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:48.520 align:middle line:84%
differ in the
northern hemisphere

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:51.890 align:middle line:84%
and southern hemisphere
based on the Coriolis forces.

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And in the south
it moves clockwise,

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:56.900 align:middle line:84%
in the north it
moves anti-clockwise.

00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:58.400 align:middle line:84%
That's always a
dead giveaway for me

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.250 align:middle line:84%
when I travel
across the equator.

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:02.000 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I get to the
northern hemisphere

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.292 align:middle line:84%
and I go to the toilet for the
first time and I flush the loo,

00:15:05.292 --> 00:15:07.000 align:middle line:84%
I go, oh, I'm in the
northern hemisphere,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.940 align:middle line:84%
just by seeing the way the
water goes down the drain.

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:12.840 align:middle line:84%
It's always a little
curiosity, I find.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.930 align:middle line:90%
So sound creates hurricanes.

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:19.030 align:middle line:84%
This is a phenomenal discovery
that I made just recently

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:24.290 align:middle line:84%
when I found out that there
were guys in 2003 that actually

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:31.940 align:middle line:84%
lodged a patent to create
hurricanes and to create rain.

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And here is a copy
of the patent.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.040 align:middle line:84%
So this is an example of
some of their drawings

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:41.170 align:middle line:84%
in their patent to create
hurricanes and to create rain.

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And that makes me
wonder about some

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.480 align:middle line:84%
of the hurricanes
that we've encountered

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.240 align:middle line:90%
and so-called disasters.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:50.230 align:middle line:84%
Is this just another
false flag event

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:55.010 align:middle line:84%
that was man made to use as
an excuse to control humanity

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:58.910 align:middle line:84%
and to put humanity under
more pressure and stress.

00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And this takes us to
another spectacular example

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:04.820 align:middle line:84%
of sound manifesting
in physical form

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:08.970 align:middle line:84%
on a huge, unimaginably
huge scale.

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:12.130 align:middle line:84%
Remember when we looked at
the sand on a metal plate

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:15.710 align:middle line:84%
and how every sound frequency
creates very specific

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:17.070 align:middle line:90%
and a unique shape?

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:20.240 align:middle line:84%
Its prime resonance frequency
in that specific shape

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.850 align:middle line:90%
for that frequency.

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:23.600 align:middle line:84%
The higher the
frequency, the more

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.570 align:middle line:84%
complex the sound and the
more complex the shapes.

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:30.730 align:middle line:84%
The lower the frequency,
the sparser and the larger

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:32.920 align:middle line:90%
the shapes and the patterns.

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:37.720 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at very,
very large objects in space

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:41.630 align:middle line:84%
that create or give off
very low frequencies,

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:45.010 align:middle line:84%
they'll give off very
large cymatic patterns.

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:48.970 align:middle line:84%
Remember the science of sound
manifesting in physical form

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:50.920 align:middle line:90%
is known cymatics.

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:56.330 align:middle line:84%
So NASA, in 2003,
shared with the world

00:16:56.330 --> 00:17:00.180 align:middle line:84%
that they detected
supercluster galaxies being

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:02.920 align:middle line:90%
formed by sound frequencies.

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:06.690 align:middle line:84%
It's fascinating that they
say that this is the lowest

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:11.349 align:middle line:84%
frequency ever measured by
NASA, which basically tells us

00:17:11.349 --> 00:17:14.150 align:middle line:84%
if they've measured sound
frequencies coming out

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:18.510 align:middle line:84%
of supercluster galaxies or
objects in space in the past.

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:21.720 align:middle line:84%
So what they told
us in this expose

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:25.369 align:middle line:84%
is that they measured in
the Perseus supercluster

00:17:25.369 --> 00:17:29.980 align:middle line:84%
of galaxies, billions of
galaxies thrown together

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:34.300 align:middle line:84%
about 250 million light
years away from us here.

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:38.850 align:middle line:84%
They measured that this center
of the supercluster galaxy

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:44.600 align:middle line:84%
resonates at a frequency
of B flat in musical terms.

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:48.870 align:middle line:84%
This is a spectacular
discovery because if we

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:53.700 align:middle line:84%
think of source creation as
being the point of everything

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:56.260 align:middle line:84%
coming into creation
and if we take

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:59.700 align:middle line:84%
that as A, the letters
of the alphabet

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:04.850 align:middle line:84%
starts with A. The next
letter, or the next frequency

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:08.060 align:middle line:84%
in the musical scale
would be B flat.

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:11.860 align:middle line:84%
It goes A, B and B flat
is between A and B.

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:13.880 align:middle line:84%
So in there we
can actually start

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:19.740 align:middle line:84%
reading a connection between God
or the creation, or the abba,

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:23.170 align:middle line:84%
or the father that brought
forth everything into creation

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:24.720 align:middle line:90%
being the source.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly we see the
manifestation in the form

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:31.630 align:middle line:84%
of supercluster
galaxies ringing at B

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:36.910 align:middle line:84%
flat, a semitone above
the source code of A.

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:39.940 align:middle line:84%
In there somewhere, lies some
very important information

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:43.640 align:middle line:84%
that will still be understood
by us as we get deeper

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:47.520 align:middle line:84%
into this primary source
coding and unraveling

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:48.940 align:middle line:90%
the meaning of all of this.

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:51.660 align:middle line:10%
All you have to do is look at
some of the images from NASA

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:53.170 align:middle line:10%
and what does it remind us of?

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:56.720 align:middle line:10%
It reminds us of that
lycopodium powder

00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:01.440 align:middle line:10%
on a metal plate in Hans
Jenny's beautiful documentary

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.020 align:middle line:10%
showing the lycopodium
powder moving around

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:08.020 align:middle line:10%
like a jelly kind of substance
or a liquid slow moving.

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:11.570 align:middle line:10%
And this looks just like that
lycopodium powder creating

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:16.270 align:middle line:10%
gigantic supercluster galaxies
on an unimaginable scale,

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:18.590 align:middle line:10%
creating billions
of galaxies out

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:20.450 align:middle line:10%
of this conglomerate
of galaxies.

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:24.860 align:middle line:84%
Cymatic patterns on a
very, very large scale

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:27.450 align:middle line:84%
because the sound
frequency is so

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:32.840 align:middle line:84%
low it's described to be several
million billion times lower

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:35.640 align:middle line:84%
than the audio
frequencies that we

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:38.580 align:middle line:90%
can hear with our naked ears.

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:41.580 align:middle line:84%
Just some more examples
of the photographs of NASA

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:44.840 align:middle line:84%
taken of the supercluster
Perseus galaxy showing

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:47.870 align:middle line:84%
these sound waves and
these energy waves

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:51.240 align:middle line:84%
moving from the center
creating the cymatic patterns

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:54.910 align:middle line:84%
that we can pick up and actually
view with the naked eye.

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:59.790 align:middle line:10%
One of my most favorite events
and achievements using sound

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:04.980 align:middle line:10%
happened in 2011 when Dr.
Luc Montagnier spontaneously

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:09.680 align:middle line:10%
generated DNA using sound,
exposing an empty test

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:13.540 align:middle line:10%
tube with what was
called the essence of DNA

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:15.740 align:middle line:10%
in there to sound frequencies.

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:18.650 align:middle line:84%
And within a certain
period of time,

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:21.690 align:middle line:90%
DNA spontaneously materialized.

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:23.800 align:middle line:84%
Now what we've got
to ask ourselves

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.680 align:middle line:90%
is, what does DNA contain?

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:29.750 align:middle line:84%
We know that DNA is
the blueprint for who

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:31.790 align:middle line:90%
we are, what our bodies are.

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:35.640 align:middle line:84%
Every aspect of creation,
every aspect of our body,

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:39.730 align:middle line:84%
the physical form of our
body, is encoded in the DNA.

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:45.200 align:middle line:84%
So if you spontaneously
manifest DNA

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.750 align:middle line:84%
that means you're also
spontaneously manifesting

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:52.570 align:middle line:84%
the billions and trillions
of sub frequencies

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:55.650 align:middle line:84%
encoded in that DNA
that hold the knowledge

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:58.210 align:middle line:84%
and the information
for the human body

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:03.060 align:middle line:84%
or whatever else that DNA
encodes or is meant to encode.

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:06.150 align:middle line:84%
So understand the
incredible achievement here.

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:09.190 align:middle line:84%
That by manifesting
DNA with sound,

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:13.210 align:middle line:84%
we can pretty much understand
how we can manifest everything

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:15.700 align:middle line:84%
and anything with
sound because it

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:19.310 align:middle line:84%
is the infinite number
of sub frequencies,

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:23.700 align:middle line:84%
the fractals of the primary
resonance of the frequency that

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:27.000 align:middle line:84%
manifests that specific
DNA that is encoded

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.550 align:middle line:84%
in that primary resonance
of the mother molecule that

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:34.860 align:middle line:84%
holds all the other
information encoded in it.

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:37.290 align:middle line:90%
It is a spectacular achievement.

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:40.050 align:middle line:84%
So what do we do with
all this information?

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:41.830 align:middle line:90%
What does it really mean?

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:46.600 align:middle line:84%
Well the take out that
I have is that sound

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:50.560 align:middle line:84%
is a primary source of
everything in creation, sound

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.040 align:middle line:90%
and resonance.

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, sound is also the
primary source of free energy

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:02.560 align:middle line:84%
and this becomes a very
important topic of discussion

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:05.990 align:middle line:84%
as we move into the
future of humanity trying

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:09.810 align:middle line:84%
to liberate humanity from
the draconian enslavement

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:14.290 align:middle line:84%
of the global elite and
the torturous system that

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:20.150 align:middle line:84%
has been imposed on everyone
born into the slavery system.

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:24.550 align:middle line:84%
What we do know now is that
the Earth rings like a bell.

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:27.190 align:middle line:84%
It is the source
for the mountains

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:29.470 align:middle line:90%
and the landscapes around us.

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:33.810 align:middle line:84%
It is the source that drives
most of the activities

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:38.000 align:middle line:84%
that we see manifesting on
the surface of planet Earth.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.450 align:middle line:84%
And it is the source
of free energy

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:42.850 align:middle line:90%
that comes out of the planet.

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:45.370 align:middle line:84%
Nikola Tesla seems
to have known this.

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:50.370 align:middle line:84%
And Nikola Tesla used Mother
Earth as a source of energy

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:53.210 align:middle line:84%
for what he wanted to
share with the world.

00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:56.060 align:middle line:10%
He remains, just like
Royal Rife remained

00:22:56.060 --> 00:23:03.030 align:middle line:10%
one of the primary proponents
of bringing cures for disease,

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:06.260 align:middle line:10%
Nikola Tesla was going to
give free energy to the world

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:08.730 align:middle line:10%
and liberate the world
from the enslavement

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:11.170 align:middle line:10%
of the global elite,
but we all know

00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:13.070 align:middle line:10%
what happened to Nikola Tesla.

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:16.510 align:middle line:84%
I believe that he used the sound
and the resonance of Mother

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:21.960 align:middle line:84%
Earth, and he converted it into
a transmittable form of energy

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:25.700 align:middle line:84%
that could be used anywhere
on this planet and anywhere

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:29.810 align:middle line:84%
in space using the
resonance of sound

00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:32.610 align:middle line:84%
as a connector and
a source of energy.

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And we'll be talking a lot more
about this in future episodes.

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:40.900 align:middle line:84%
So what does this all have
to do with ancient cultures

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:43.320 align:middle line:90%
and ancient civilizations?

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:47.310 align:middle line:84%
Everything because, as
we see, ancient cultures

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:50.540 align:middle line:84%
and ancient civilizations
had a very good understanding

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:55.120 align:middle line:84%
of sound and resonance,
the source of all things.

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:57.510 align:middle line:84%
The fact that
everything in creation

00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:01.750 align:middle line:84%
came from a primordial sound
and a source of resonance.

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And they used this as a
tool and an energy source

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:08.630 align:middle line:90%
for everything that they did.

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And we'll be discovering
and exposing and exploring

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:16.760 align:middle line:84%
the tools and the artifacts
used by the ancient cultures

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.470 align:middle line:90%
in the next episode.

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:21.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm Michael Tellinger,
and thanks for watching.

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:26.050 align:middle line:90%
