00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.410 align:middle line:10%
>>Hello, this is
Michael Tellinger.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.415 align:middle line:10%
And our journey of
discovery continues.

00:00:18.415 --> 00:00:20.040 align:middle line:84%
This episode, we're
going to be dealing

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.670 align:middle line:84%
with gold, our
obsession with gold,

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:28.140 align:middle line:84%
and one of the great untold
stories of the last 120 years

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.210 align:middle line:84%
that deals with gold and
its mysterious origins,

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.490 align:middle line:84%
the control of gold
on a global scale

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.680 align:middle line:84%
and a train filled with
gold that vanished,

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.060 align:middle line:84%
mysteriously vanished
out of sight.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.700 align:middle line:84%
But before we start, let's
just recap to the story that

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.330 align:middle line:90%
brought us to this point.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.800 align:middle line:84%
We ended off with the
opening phrase of the Bible.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.610 align:middle line:84%
Most of us believe that the
Bible says "in the beginning,

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.610 align:middle line:84%
God created the
heavens and the Earth."

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.000 align:middle line:10%
Well, we now know that
is no longer the truth,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.780 align:middle line:10%
that the original opening
statement of the Bible

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.380 align:middle line:10%
says "the father of the
beginnings created the Elohim,

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.870 align:middle line:10%
the heavens, and the Earth."

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.460 align:middle line:10%
And that has
profound implications

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.460 align:middle line:10%
of who the creator of
everything in existence

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.150 align:middle line:10%
is, who the Elohim are, that
the Elohim are not actually god,

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.250 align:middle line:10%
or that they are the
gods of the Bible--

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.940 align:middle line:10%
the plural of is el is Elohim--
and that somehow, humanity

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.870 align:middle line:10%
fits into the equation, and that
the father of the beginnings

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.240 align:middle line:10%
is closely related to the sound
and the source of resonance

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.640 align:middle line:10%
that brought everything
into creation.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.850 align:middle line:84%
It also takes us to
Chapter 2 of the Bible

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.950 align:middle line:84%
and Genesis 2, where we first
encounter the mention of gold.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.200 align:middle line:84%
What I find fascinating
is that gold in the Bible

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.470 align:middle line:84%
is mentioned before Eve
even comes into creation.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.400 align:middle line:84%
Yes, that's how important gold
is in all of human history.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.670 align:middle line:84%
Before Eve has
even been fashioned

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.010 align:middle line:84%
from Adam's rib, the
narrator of the Bible--

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.560 align:middle line:84%
whoever the narrator
may be-- tells us

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.060 align:middle line:84%
about the land of Havilah,
where the land is good,

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.170 align:middle line:84%
the water is good, and by
the way, there is gold.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.740 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to ask yourself,
why is gold so important?

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.520 align:middle line:84%
And as we work through
these episodes,

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.930 align:middle line:84%
you realize that gold is at
the center of our appearance

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:23.900 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.430 align:middle line:84%
Homo sapiens, human beings,
as we know ourselves today,

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.720 align:middle line:84%
are inextricably
connected to the obsession

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.800 align:middle line:84%
and the manipulation and the
use of gold on this planet.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.350 align:middle line:84%
This takes us to the southern
tip of Africa in 1898,

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.360 align:middle line:84%
when the British
Empire-- the largest

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.860 align:middle line:84%
empire that has ever existed
and still controls the world

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.710 align:middle line:84%
today-- launched the
most expensive war

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.600 align:middle line:90%
in its entire history.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.870 align:middle line:84%
It's when they
send 470,000 troops

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.470 align:middle line:84%
to the southern tip
of Africa to find

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.040 align:middle line:84%
60,000 farmers on
horseback and about

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.190 align:middle line:84%
another 60,000 native Africans
with shields and spears.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:12.080 align:middle line:84%
It became known as the South
African War from 1899 to 1902,

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.950 align:middle line:84%
when two independent of Boer
Republics-- Boer means farmer,

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.590 align:middle line:84%
for those who don't know,
B-O-E-R, Boer Republics--

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.420 align:middle line:84%
when two independent Boer
Republics resisted the British

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.190 align:middle line:84%
occupation and stood up against
the might of the British

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.930 align:middle line:90%
Empire.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.070 align:middle line:10%
The question we have
to ask ourselves,

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.760 align:middle line:10%
what was so important that the
British Empire would mobilize

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:42.680 align:middle line:10%
such a dramatic onslaught by
sending 470,000 troops so far

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.250 align:middle line:10%
away by ship or the horses,
the food, the kitchens,

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.990 align:middle line:10%
the hospitals, the support
systems for such a large army

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.120 align:middle line:10%
to go by ship all the
way down to South Africa

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.430 align:middle line:10%
to occupy a piece of the
world that is so far removed

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:59.890 align:middle line:10%
from Mother England?

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.760 align:middle line:90%
It truly boggles the mind.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.086 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, there had to be a very,
very serious reason for this.

00:04:07.086 --> 00:04:10.280 align:middle line:84%
This era in our history
and the foundation for this

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.150 align:middle line:84%
was laid by this man here, Cecil
John Rhodes, who in his life

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.310 align:middle line:84%
was probably, and during
this period of our history,

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.240 align:middle line:84%
was probably the most
powerful man in the world.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.250 align:middle line:84%
Many of you will know him
for the Rhodes Scholarship.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.050 align:middle line:84%
And he was at that stage the
wealthiest man most likely

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.330 align:middle line:84%
and a very, very
influential human being that

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.400 align:middle line:84%
had an ear of the Queen
and the British Royalty,

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.370 align:middle line:84%
the royal bloodlines pretty
much at his fingertips,

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.680 align:middle line:84%
and was an instrument
of the royal bloodlines

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.800 align:middle line:84%
to secure Southern
Africa for the Crown.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And it was, pretty much,
all about the gold.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.450 align:middle line:84%
And it was all about securing
Southern Africa for the Crown.

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And when I say the
Crown, I don't mean

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.280 align:middle line:90%
the Queen or the royal throne.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.500 align:middle line:10%
I'm talking about
the Crown Temple--

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.440 align:middle line:10%
the Crown Temple in
the city of London,

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.630 align:middle line:10%
one of the three independent
states that exists on our Earth

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.320 align:middle line:10%
today, which are the City
of London, which many of you

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.730 align:middle line:10%
will know is a
private corporation,

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.960 align:middle line:10%
just like everything
else in our reality--

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.200 align:middle line:10%
but we'll get back to that
later-- City of London,

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.860 align:middle line:10%
together with the
Vatican, and also

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.000 align:middle line:10%
Washington DC-- the
three independent states

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000 align:middle line:10%
that exist in countries that
pretty much around the world

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.870 align:middle line:10%
today.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.870 align:middle line:84%
So this war in
Southern Africa was

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:34.260 align:middle line:84%
mobilized to secure Southern
Africa and the future exports

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.100 align:middle line:84%
of gold, platinum, diamonds,
and all the mineral

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.030 align:middle line:84%
wealth of Southern
Africa for the Crown.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And what became very evident
to me in recent times

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.490 align:middle line:84%
is that this South African
War from 1899 to 1902

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.530 align:middle line:84%
pretty much laid the
foundation for what

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.060 align:middle line:84%
was going to happen in the
20th century between Great

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.440 align:middle line:84%
Britain and North America and
the colonization of the world

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.480 align:middle line:84%
and taking control of
the world by the royals

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.710 align:middle line:84%
and the British might from
Britain right across the world.

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.000 align:middle line:84%
And that then brings us
to the phenomenal story

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.580 align:middle line:90%
of Paul Kruger.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.070 align:middle line:84%
Most of you will
know Paul Kruger

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.560 align:middle line:84%
as the guy that
started the Kruger

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.280 align:middle line:84%
Park in South Africa, where
we keep all the animals today.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.180 align:middle line:84%
And the other are the
Krugerrands, the Kruger gold

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.440 align:middle line:90%
and coins.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And he was the president of
the Transvaal Boer Republic

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.990 align:middle line:84%
together with
President Steyn, who

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.440 align:middle line:84%
was the president of
the Orange Free State.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.980 align:middle line:84%
Those two Boer Republics
resisted the might

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.320 align:middle line:90%
of the British Empire.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can imagine
how serious this was.

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And we find that the British
were losing this battle.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.990 align:middle line:84%
Even though they
had 470,000 troops

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.170 align:middle line:84%
against a bunch of
farmers on horseback,

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:51.960 align:middle line:84%
they were losing this
battle really badly,

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.410 align:middle line:84%
until they employed
what they referred to

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:58.100 align:middle line:90%
as the scorched earth policy.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And what this meant is
they burned down the farms.

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:04.380 align:middle line:90%
They killed all the animals.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And they took the
women and the children

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.770 align:middle line:84%
of the Boer farmers
and the Boer fighters,

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:10.980 align:middle line:90%
they took them hostage.

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:12.550 align:middle line:90%
And what did they do with them?

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.080 align:middle line:84%
They put them into
concentration camps.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.830 align:middle line:84%
Yes, concentration
camps are an invention

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.890 align:middle line:84%
of the British Empire
and not of Nazi Germany,

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:22.330 align:middle line:90%
as most may think.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:27.470 align:middle line:84%
It is estimated that about
35,000 Boer women and children

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:29.720 align:middle line:84%
died in these
concentration camps.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.710 align:middle line:84%
There about 45 of these
concentration camps

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:34.740 align:middle line:84%
scattered throughout
South Africa.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And they were pretty
much starved to death

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:38.850 align:middle line:90%
by the British.

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:40.900 align:middle line:90%
And it was an absolute massacre.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And an unknown number
of black South Africans

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.660 align:middle line:84%
died in black
concentration camps

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:50.040 align:middle line:84%
that very little is known about,
because this was obviously

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.270 align:middle line:90%
a well-kept secret.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:54.540 align:middle line:84%
There are some books and some
literature written about it.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:59.760 align:middle line:84%
But it remains a very dark part
of our most recent history.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.840 align:middle line:84%
What is fascinating
about this particular war

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:06.730 align:middle line:84%
is one particular day
on the 26th of January,

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:10.330 align:middle line:84%
1900, which became known
as the Battle of Spion Kop,

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:14.780 align:middle line:84%
because on this one fateful
day, on this one little mountain

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:19.210 align:middle line:84%
known Spion Kop, three
world leaders were present.

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And if any one of these
three world leaders

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:24.790 align:middle line:84%
caught a bullet on that
day in this battle,

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:27.860 align:middle line:84%
it would have changed the
20th century completely

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:31.060 align:middle line:84%
from what it became and
what we know it today.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:34.970 align:middle line:84%
It became known as the
bloodiest battle since.

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And more men apparently
died in one hectare of land

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:42.000 align:middle line:90%
than any other war since then.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.230 align:middle line:84%
Arguably, the most
prominent world leader

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:47.970 align:middle line:84%
present on this mountain and
in this battle on this day

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:50.060 align:middle line:90%
was Winston Churchill.

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:54.200 align:middle line:84%
He was a young war correspondent
for the British media, who was

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:58.730 align:middle line:90%
then captured by the Boer Army.

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:01.320 align:middle line:84%
But the little bugger
escaped, and he became

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.980 align:middle line:90%
known as the Brit who got away.

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:05.730 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine if
he didn't escape

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:08.510 align:middle line:84%
and maybe he was strung
up by the Boer Army,

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:11.160 align:middle line:84%
how the British history would
have changed in the years

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.750 align:middle line:84%
to come and how the First World
and Second World Wars would

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:17.150 align:middle line:90%
have changed after this event?

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:20.090 align:middle line:84%
The second critical
world leader that

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:23.550 align:middle line:84%
was present on that same
mountain and that same battle

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:26.520 align:middle line:84%
on that day was a
young Mahatma Gandhi,

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.440 align:middle line:84%
who was a stretcher bearer
for the British troops.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.940 align:middle line:10%
You can just imagine
what would have happened

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.380 align:middle line:10%
to the history of
the future of India

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.510 align:middle line:10%
if Mahatma Gandhi had
caught a bullet on that day.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And then finally,
General Louis Botha,

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:42.510 align:middle line:84%
who was the general
of the Boer Army.

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:44.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, many of you would
not have heard of him.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.640 align:middle line:84%
But it is important to realize
that only 8 years after he

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.850 align:middle line:84%
surrendered to
the British Empire

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:54.720 align:middle line:84%
in 1902, 8 years
later in 1910, he then

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.290 align:middle line:84%
became the first prime minister
of the union of South Africa.

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:00.750 align:middle line:84%
It was like the United
States of Southern Africa--

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:04.220 align:middle line:84%
the union of South Africa--
and the Boer Army general

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:07.460 align:middle line:84%
that fought against the British
became the prime minister

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.390 align:middle line:90%
of the Union of South Africa.

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:12.430 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, something
strange was going on here.

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And a foundation was
being laid for what

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.000 align:middle line:84%
was to come in manipulating
the future wealth

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.850 align:middle line:84%
and the mineral wealth that
came to the British Empire

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:24.140 align:middle line:90%
from this part of the world.

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.920 align:middle line:84%
Another important event
during the South African War

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:30.360 align:middle line:84%
happened on the
4th of June, 1900,

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.130 align:middle line:84%
when a train filled
with gold left

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:36.780 align:middle line:84%
Pretoria, the capital of
the Transvaal Republic,

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:40.830 align:middle line:84%
headed for Mozambique--
the port of Mozambique.

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:45.740 align:middle line:84%
It went due East and estimated
that this train was filled

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.450 align:middle line:84%
with gold averaging
from-- well, the estimates

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:51.770 align:middle line:84%
go between 30 tons
to 3,000 tons.

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:55.360 align:middle line:84%
These all speculations,
because nobody really knows.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:00.480 align:middle line:84%
The point is that it was
a train filled with gold,

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.020 align:middle line:84%
not just one carriage
filled with gold.

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
gold on this train

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:08.090 align:middle line:84%
was some of these
well-known Veld Pond.

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:10.840 align:middle line:84%
Veld means field,
and these gold coins

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:14.400 align:middle line:84%
were minted by the Boer
Republic in the field.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.180 align:middle line:90%
So they were known as Veld Pond.

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:21.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, today, one of these Veld
Ponds is worth about $90,000.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:25.750 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine the value
of that golden train today.

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:29.630 align:middle line:84%
I guess, it probably would
be worth the Kruger trillions

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:31.480 align:middle line:90%
and not the Kruger millions.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:35.720 align:middle line:84%
So this famous golden
train made its way East

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:39.000 align:middle line:84%
through a number of well-known
South African towns.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.190 align:middle line:84%
And they are Belfast,
Machadodorp, Waterval Boven,

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:46.510 align:middle line:84%
which is the town that I
live in today, which is also

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:50.100 align:middle line:84%
famous for its thousands
of stone circles,

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.260 align:middle line:90%
and then Waterval Onder.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:56.020 align:middle line:84%
These are Dutch words for
Waterval Boven means waterfall

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:56.790 align:middle line:90%
above.

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And Waterval Onder
means waterfall below.

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:02.440 align:middle line:84%
So there's obviously
a steep downhill

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.430 align:middle line:84%
from Waterval Boven
to this little house,

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:08.360 align:middle line:84%
where Paul Kruger lived
for several months,

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:12.160 align:middle line:84%
where he was really
giving the British Empire

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.330 align:middle line:90%
a rough go for their money.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:20.080 align:middle line:84%
What's fascinating is that when
the train got too Machadodorp,

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.220 align:middle line:84%
something very
strange and mysterious

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:27.490 align:middle line:84%
happened, because after
Machadodorp, the golden train

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:32.550 align:middle line:84%
mysteriously disappeared,
never to be seen again.

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:35.650 align:middle line:84%
And it remains one
of the great treasure

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:38.710 align:middle line:90%
mysteries of the 20th century.

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:41.430 align:middle line:84%
Every year, thousands
of treasure hunters

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:44.750 align:middle line:84%
come to South Africa and
to this part of the world--

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:47.910 align:middle line:84%
Waterval Boven, Waterval
Onder, Machadodorp--

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:52.160 align:middle line:84%
and that part of what we
call the escarpment, where

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.260 align:middle line:84%
they come looking for
the Kruger millions.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, I suggest it's the
Kruger trillions today.

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And what I find
fascinating is when

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:05.150 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing explorations and
exploring these stone circles

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:08.830 align:middle line:84%
and walk through the
mountains and thinking what

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:12.000 align:middle line:84%
the hell's going on here,
every now and then, I come

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.130 align:middle line:84%
across a big hole in the
ground, thinking why would there

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:19.810 align:middle line:84%
be a hole in the middle of
a mountain, when suddenly I

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:22.600 align:middle line:84%
remember, ah-ha, it's
the Kruger millions.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.500 align:middle line:84%
Somebody's been
here digging for it.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:28.000 align:middle line:84%
I find it amazing that people
would put a map together,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.010 align:middle line:84%
figure out that it was
in this specific place,

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:33.160 align:middle line:84%
that they would find
the Kruger gold.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.180 align:middle line:84%
And they come there in
the middle of the night,

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:36.200 align:middle line:90%
and they dig holes.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.170 align:middle line:84%
I must tell you that some of
these holes are really large.

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And people go to
a lot of trouble

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:45.320 align:middle line:84%
to dig these big holes
only to find nothing.

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.384 align:middle line:84%
Well, who knows, maybe
they did find something

00:13:47.384 --> 00:13:48.300 align:middle line:90%
and they took it away.

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:51.740 align:middle line:84%
But what's left behind is
a big hole in the ground.

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:54.510 align:middle line:84%
So I might be mistaken
actually thinking

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:55.830 align:middle line:90%
that they're finding nothing.

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:56.630 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:59.240 align:middle line:84%
But it remains a big
mystery and remains

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:02.700 align:middle line:84%
one of the great treasures for
treasure hunters in the world

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:03.980 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:09.740 align:middle line:10%
The fascinating thing about
this is, however, that in 1900,

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:14.170 align:middle line:10%
the gold production of South
Africa wasn't that big yet,

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:18.610 align:middle line:10%
because the gold mines on
the reef in Johannesburg--

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:22.070 align:middle line:10%
what's known as the reef,
or the [SPEAKING DUTCH]--

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:25.600 align:middle line:10%
were only discovered in 1896.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.830 align:middle line:10%
So the gold production
from the Johannesburg area

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:31.430 align:middle line:10%
wasn't that big yet in 1900.

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:34.050 align:middle line:84%
And most of the original
mines in South Africa

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:36.430 align:middle line:90%
were in the eastern part.

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:38.540 align:middle line:84%
And there were several
dozen mines there

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:40.710 align:middle line:84%
that weren't producing
that much gold.

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:45.670 align:middle line:10%
The gold rush in South
Africa really started in 1864

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:50.700 align:middle line:10%
in a town called Kaapschehoop,
when a 5.2-kilogram--

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:57.090 align:middle line:10%
that's about 10 and 1/2 pounds--
so 10 and 1/2 pound gold nugget

00:14:57.090 --> 00:14:59.800 align:middle line:10%
was found at Kaapschehoop.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.900 align:middle line:10%
This resulted in
the whole gold rush

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:05.230 align:middle line:10%
that we saw in California
and also in Australia

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:06.590 align:middle line:10%
at the same time.

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:10.820 align:middle line:84%
So it's fascinating just to
see how this gold rush started

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:14.540 align:middle line:84%
in three different continents--
the North America's,

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:18.520 align:middle line:84%
Southern Africa, and Australia
at about the same time.

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:21.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, the interesting
thing about Kaapschehoop,

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:26.040 align:middle line:84%
this little town, right on
the edge of the Transvaal

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:29.410 align:middle line:84%
Escarpment-- that's where the
Highveld ends and the Lowveld

00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:33.440 align:middle line:84%
begins, it's not as a Transvaal
Escarpment-- Kaapschehoop

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:37.210 align:middle line:84%
is also famous for a very
important ancient site.

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And that one is known
as Adam's Calendar.

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:42.940 align:middle line:84%
Here is a view from
Kaapschehoop from the lookout

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:46.090 align:middle line:84%
point in the little town
that became a real frontier

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:50.070 align:middle line:84%
gold-mining town with bars
and saloons and dancing girls

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:54.210 align:middle line:84%
and the typical kind of town
that you see in Western movies.

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing and remains a
great tourist attraction today.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.120 align:middle line:84%
It's a tiny little
village today.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:04.090 align:middle line:84%
But at one stage, it
had about 15,000 people

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:07.390 align:middle line:84%
that lived today in this little
gold-mining frontier town.

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:10.980 align:middle line:84%
So this also happens to be
the home of Adam's Calendar.

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And this is a critical
bit of information.

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:15.910 align:middle line:84%
This is a view from the
lookout point of Kaapschehoop,

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:19.910 align:middle line:84%
as I mentioned, overlooking
the Barberton Valley, which

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:25.500 align:middle line:84%
is most likely an impact crater
from about 3 billion years ago.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And this Barberton
Valley is also

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.710 align:middle line:84%
known for some of the
oldest rock formations

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:32.270 align:middle line:84%
that geologists go crazy
about and come from all

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:34.200 align:middle line:90%
over the world to study.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:38.150 align:middle line:84%
But the Barberton Valley is
also known for two other things,

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:41.330 align:middle line:84%
which is the town of Barberton,
another gold-mining frontier

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:47.440 align:middle line:84%
town, and what remains arguably
the most wealthiest gold mine

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:51.030 align:middle line:84%
in the world today, known
as Sheba Gold Mine, which

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:53.220 align:middle line:90%
is just outside of Barberton.

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:56.090 align:middle line:84%
So Kaapschehoop overlooks
the Barberton Valley,

00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:59.530 align:middle line:84%
which incidentally is filled
with about 50 meters of sea

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:01.150 align:middle line:90%
sand sediment.

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'll get back
to that later when

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:05.910 align:middle line:84%
we talk about what
really happened

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:07.810 align:middle line:90%
to this ancient civilization.

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:10.900 align:middle line:84%
But I'm giving you a clue
and hint at this stage.

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And further down
about four kilometers

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:17.020 align:middle line:84%
along the same escarpment,
we find Adam's Calendar,

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:20.480 align:middle line:84%
looking out at the same
Barberton Valley and Sheba Gold

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.319 align:middle line:90%
Mine.

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:23.940 align:middle line:84%
What I can tell you is that
the same Barberton Valley

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:25.440 align:middle line:84%
would have been
filled with hundreds

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.770 align:middle line:90%
of gold mines in ancient times.

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:30.950 align:middle line:84%
The question we should
be asking ourselves

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:35.060 align:middle line:84%
is not what happened to
the train and the gold.

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.340 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
people get stuck on this,

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:39.690 align:middle line:84%
because they get so obsessed
with the gold and the train

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:42.040 align:middle line:84%
and, where did it disappear,
where is the gold,

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.249 align:middle line:84%
where is the train,
and let's go find it.

00:17:44.249 --> 00:17:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And this is why so many
people come looking

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:47.164 align:middle line:90%
for the gold and the train.

00:17:47.164 --> 00:17:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And we get obsessed about
what happened to the gold.

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.690 align:middle line:90%
That's not really important.

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:55.510 align:middle line:84%
The critical question
is, where did Paul Kruger

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:57.580 align:middle line:90%
get all the gold from?

00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:02.230 align:middle line:84%
Because in 1900, there wasn't
enough gold in South Africa

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:04.070 align:middle line:90%
to fill a whole train.

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:06.330 align:middle line:84%
Because it wasn't
just one carriage,

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:10.760 align:middle line:84%
it was a train filled with gold
that left Pretoria on its way

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.090 align:middle line:90%
to Mozambique.

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:16.560 align:middle line:84%
So once again, this brings
us to gold and the links

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:20.270 align:middle line:84%
to ancient civilizations
and our obsession with gold.

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:25.250 align:middle line:84%
So if Africa is supposed to
be the cradle of humankind,

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:30.650 align:middle line:84%
can we find the origins of
gold mining in Southern Africa?

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:33.290 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is absolutely.

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:35.990 align:middle line:84%
There are never-ending
tales and stories

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:38.990 align:middle line:84%
about ancient gold mines
in Southern Africa,

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:41.470 align:middle line:84%
just like they are
all over the world.

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:44.640 align:middle line:84%
In South Africa, we have
some classic examples

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:48.080 align:middle line:84%
of ancient gold mines
that mysteriously

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:52.100 align:middle line:84%
lie hidden from modern
gold-mining companies.

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And yet, there is
so much that has

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:59.200 align:middle line:84%
being exposed over the last few
decades and the last 100 years.

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.310 align:middle line:84%
In the town of
Lydenburg, for example,

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:04.590 align:middle line:84%
that is famous for what are
called the Lydenburg Heads,

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:07.660 align:middle line:84%
these strange-looking
ceramics heads,

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:11.520 align:middle line:84%
masks that have been
discovered in the 1930s, just

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:15.000 align:middle line:84%
outside the town of
Lydenburg, that clearly show

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.030 align:middle line:84%
some strange humanoid features
that are not of Earthling

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:24.220 align:middle line:84%
origin, that suggests some sort
of alien intervention here--

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:26.960 align:middle line:90%
the Lydenburg Heads.

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.680 align:middle line:84%
Just around the
time of Lydenburg,

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:32.440 align:middle line:84%
a survey was conducted,
a geological survey

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:37.350 align:middle line:84%
between the year 2005 and
2010, where they explored

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:40.260 align:middle line:84%
and counted as
many as they could

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:43.200 align:middle line:90%
of these ancient gold mines.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.180 align:middle line:84%
They're known as adit
mines, because they go

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.480 align:middle line:90%
into the side of the mountains.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And they started
the count in 2005.

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And I believe this was under the
instruction of Anglo American

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:58.170 align:middle line:84%
to try and stop people
from illegally mining gold,

00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:01.380 align:middle line:84%
because many of these mines
are just abandoned but still

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:02.840 align:middle line:90%
contain lots of gold.

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:05.480 align:middle line:84%
It's not easy to get it out
and not easy to process it,

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.370 align:middle line:90%
but you can if you want to.

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:09.960 align:middle line:84%
So by the time they
finished counting

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:13.960 align:middle line:84%
these ancient adit gold mines--
and I can also tell you,

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:17.820 align:middle line:84%
incidentally, that these
mines were not initiated

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:21.940 align:middle line:84%
in the gold rush of
1864-- these were

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:25.940 align:middle line:84%
rediscovered by the gold miners
that created the gold rush

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:30.210 align:middle line:84%
and reused from ancient times--
I believe these mines have

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:32.590 align:middle line:84%
been there for thousands
and thousands of years--

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:36.850 align:middle line:84%
and just rediscovered and
reused by the gold miners that

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:39.510 align:middle line:84%
started the gold rush in
this part of the world.

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:43.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, by the time they
finished this geological survey

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:49.070 align:middle line:84%
and stopped counting,
they counted around 75,000

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:51.090 align:middle line:84%
of these gold
mines, which made it

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:55.320 align:middle line:84%
a little difficult to close
them all up to prevent gold

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:59.130 align:middle line:84%
mining or illegal gold mining,
even by the mighty Anglo

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:00.320 align:middle line:90%
American.

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:03.510 align:middle line:84%
There are many
mysterious tunnels

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:07.820 align:middle line:84%
that were discovered by miners
and gold miners in the '30s.

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:11.300 align:middle line:84%
What's fascinating about
the story is that--

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:14.060 align:middle line:84%
and I've had at least
two of these stories told

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:20.010 align:middle line:84%
to me by the sons of the gold
miners in the '20s and '30s

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:23.350 align:middle line:84%
in the northern part of
South Africa-- when suddenly

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:25.760 align:middle line:84%
at about 100 feet
deep, they came

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.920 align:middle line:90%
across these mysterious tunnels.

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:31.017 align:middle line:84%
What they then did is they
called the authorities,

00:21:31.017 --> 00:21:31.975 align:middle line:90%
the mining authorities.

00:21:31.975 --> 00:21:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And in those days, it
was the Mariinsky Company

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:38.380 align:middle line:84%
that was the mining
authority in South Africa.

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And they had all the rights
to all the gold mining

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:44.660 align:middle line:84%
and controlled everything,
together with Anglo American

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:50.080 align:middle line:84%
and the whole legacy of Cecil
John Rhodes and the De Beers

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:53.440 align:middle line:84%
empire that was emerging in
Southern Africa at that stage

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.190 align:middle line:90%
already.

00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:57.190 align:middle line:84%
But when the Mariinsky
authorities came,

00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:00.730 align:middle line:84%
they found these mysterious
tools and artifacts

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:02.820 align:middle line:84%
in these tunnels that
shouldn't be there.

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:05.490 align:middle line:84%
They confiscated the
tools and artifacts.

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:08.410 align:middle line:84%
They told the miners,
thank you for calling us.

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And their words were,
we are aware of this.

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:13.570 align:middle line:84%
Now that, I find,
very mysterious

00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:16.100 align:middle line:84%
that they were aware of
the tools and artifact

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:19.340 align:middle line:84%
and aware all of
these ancient tunnels.

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:21.410 align:middle line:90%
And they disappeared.

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:24.590 align:middle line:84%
In the Wolkberg Mountain,
Northern South Africa,

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:26.930 align:middle line:84%
there are accounts
of dozens and dozens

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:30.060 align:middle line:84%
of kilometers of underground
tunnels, ancient gold

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:33.380 align:middle line:84%
mines that show
evidence of gold mining.

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And strangely enough, they
left behind the platinum slag.

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:40.970 align:middle line:84%
They were clearly not
interested in the platinum.

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:43.320 align:middle line:84%
They were only
interested in the gold.

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And these mines, I've being told
by people that actually walk

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.850 align:middle line:84%
through these tunnels
for kilometers upon end,

00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:54.420 align:middle line:84%
and they claim that this is
spectacular ancient evidence

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:55.910 align:middle line:90%
of ancient gold mining.

00:22:55.910 --> 00:23:01.060 align:middle line:84%
In the 1990s, De Beers
claims to have discovered--

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:03.810 align:middle line:84%
or should I say,
De Beers confessed

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:07.330 align:middle line:84%
to having discovered an
ancient mine shaft that

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:10.530 align:middle line:90%
was 22,000 feet deep.

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:13.800 align:middle line:84%
They said it was cut with
such absolute precision

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.890 align:middle line:84%
and technology that
they didn't understand.

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And this clearly indicates
an ancient civilization

00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:22.490 align:middle line:84%
with advanced tools
and technology

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:25.370 align:middle line:84%
that we are going to
get to in this series.

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Anglo American confessed to me
through their chief geologist

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:31.870 align:middle line:84%
over a beer at a pub,
believe it or not,

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:33.510 align:middle line:84%
when he told me
that they often come

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:38.250 align:middle line:84%
across ancient vanished
civilizations and ancient mines

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:40.810 align:middle line:90%
and tunnels and mine shafts.

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And their instructions
are very simply,

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:45.150 align:middle line:84%
when you come across
ancient mines,

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:47.310 align:middle line:90%
cover it up and move right on.

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:49.530 align:middle line:84%
When I met this guy, who
was a chief geologist

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:52.320 align:middle line:84%
at a pub at a friend of
mine's birthday party,

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.990 align:middle line:84%
he volunteers this
information to me.

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And he told me that
just recently-- this

00:23:57.060 --> 00:24:00.830 align:middle line:84%
was in 2006-- just recently
they found an ancient mine

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:03.100 align:middle line:84%
shaft near the town
of Bloemfontein, which

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:06.140 align:middle line:84%
is the capital of the Orange
Free State in South Africa.

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:07.290 align:middle line:90%
And that blew my mind.

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him, so did you
find anything, any remains?

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And he said, yeah, there
was some skeletal remains

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:14.910 align:middle line:90%
at the bottom of the shaft.

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:18.180 align:middle line:84%
It was about 500 meters
deep, I recall he told me.

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And I said, so what did
you do, what did you do?

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:23.430 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, we just
close it up and moved right on.

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And the file sits in a secret
file at Anglo American's head

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:30.040 align:middle line:84%
office, where they must
have thousands of accounts

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.650 align:middle line:90%
of ancient gold mines.

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:33.210 align:middle line:90%
But the mystery continues.

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:38.330 align:middle line:84%
In very recent times, in
2014, in a modern mine,

00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:40.200 align:middle line:84%
on the West Strand
in South Africa,

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.940 align:middle line:84%
where a lot of the gold
mines are found today,

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:46.400 align:middle line:84%
one of the sides are
the mine passage,

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:50.500 align:middle line:84%
the mine tunnel opened up and
exposed an ancient gold mine

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:53.210 align:middle line:84%
and a tunnel that was
cut with precision

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:55.090 align:middle line:84%
that they could not
understand and clearly

00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:56.730 align:middle line:90%
was not their doing.

00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:58.420 align:middle line:84%
When they called the
mine authorities,

00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:00.550 align:middle line:84%
that whole section of
the mine was closed up.

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:03.220 align:middle line:84%
Everyone was evacuated,
never to go back

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:05.060 align:middle line:84%
into that part of
the mine again.

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:06.900 align:middle line:84%
So you can clearly
see an agenda here

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:10.810 align:middle line:84%
that, whenever this kind of
information gets exposed,

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:14.970 align:middle line:84%
they just close it up, cover
it up, and move right along.

00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:18.460 align:middle line:84%
There is a great example
of ancient gold mining

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:21.040 align:middle line:84%
in the Northeast
province of Zimbabwe,

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:24.800 align:middle line:84%
in the so-called slave
pits, or the Nyanga pits.

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:29.979 align:middle line:84%
Now, modern historians and
archaeologists call these pits

00:25:29.979 --> 00:25:31.520 align:middle line:84%
in the ground made
out of stone, they

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.100 align:middle line:84%
call them slave pits,
animal pits, or grain pits.

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:36.914 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's laughable,
if you try and call it

00:25:36.914 --> 00:25:39.080 align:middle line:84%
slave pits, because obviously,
if you put slaves in,

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:41.020 align:middle line:84%
there they're going to
climb out and get out.

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:43.440 align:middle line:84%
There's no way you're going
to keep them in there.

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.410 align:middle line:90%
So it's nonsensical.

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:48.657 align:middle line:84%
It's nonsensical to think that
you can put grain in there

00:25:48.657 --> 00:25:49.490 align:middle line:90%
or animals in there.

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:50.950 align:middle line:84%
How're you going
to get them out?

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:54.090 align:middle line:84%
So a brilliant
Zimbabwe geologist,

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:57.180 align:middle line:84%
by the name of Ann Kritzinger
at Zimbabwe University,

00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:59.070 align:middle line:84%
started doing some
research on this.

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And she found
something startling.

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:04.020 align:middle line:84%
She found that all of
these so-called slave pits

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:07.120 align:middle line:84%
had inlet valves and
they had outlet valves.

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.430 align:middle line:84%
The outlet valves were
normally slightly lower

00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:10.800 align:middle line:90%
than the inlet valves.

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:14.180 align:middle line:84%
But what she found was
that in the outlet valves,

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:17.360 align:middle line:84%
there was sedimentation
of up to 2 grams

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:20.310 align:middle line:84%
per ton of gold in
the outlet valves,

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:22.990 align:middle line:84%
leading her to the
conclusion that these must've

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:26.010 align:middle line:84%
been some sort of
gold processing tanks

00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:28.220 align:middle line:84%
in ancient times
for the purification

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:30.350 align:middle line:84%
or the extraction
of gold, leading

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:33.450 align:middle line:84%
to the sedimentation of
gold in the outlet valves

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:34.470 align:middle line:90%
to these tanks.

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:37.230 align:middle line:84%
But one of the most
exciting discoveries for me

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:39.160 align:middle line:84%
about ancient gold
mining in South Africa

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.210 align:middle line:84%
comes from the town
of Carletonville.

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:45.660 align:middle line:84%
When a team of mine
rescuers or a mine rescue

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:48.890 align:middle line:84%
team around 1975--
because the man

00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:51.930 align:middle line:84%
that told me this story who
died a few months after he told

00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:55.060 align:middle line:84%
me this story a few
years ago now, told me

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:56.900 align:middle line:84%
he'd never told
the story to anyone

00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:59.340 align:middle line:84%
before he told me, because
he thought they would just

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:01.230 align:middle line:90%
think he was crazy.

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:05.450 align:middle line:84%
So in about 1975, they were
testing their equipment.

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:07.520 align:middle line:90%
And they went down a sinkhole.

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And these sinkholes around
this part of South Africa

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:12.230 align:middle line:90%
are common occurrence.

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:14.160 align:middle line:84%
They keep appearing every
now and then because

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:16.810 align:middle line:84%
of the draining of
the water by the mines

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:19.750 align:middle line:84%
and creating these
sudden sinkholes that

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:20.747 align:middle line:90%
appear out of nowhere.

00:27:20.747 --> 00:27:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And they were testing
their equipment.

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:23.670 align:middle line:90%
They went down the sinkhole.

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And at the bottom
of the sinkhole,

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:27.620 align:middle line:84%
about 20 or 30 meters
deep, they found one

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:29.270 align:middle line:90%
of the sides that was caved in.

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:33.640 align:middle line:84%
When they opened it up and moved
into a tunnel that they found,

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:35.110 align:middle line:90%
what did they find?

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:37.330 align:middle line:84%
They found an
ancient tunnel that

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:39.130 align:middle line:90%
was paved all the way around.

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:41.190 align:middle line:84%
The bottom and the
sides was paved.

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:43.070 align:middle line:90%
They will absolutely amazed.

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And they walked into the
darkness several meters

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:48.510 align:middle line:84%
to be confronted
by a statue, which

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:52.050 align:middle line:84%
refers to-- that resembles
something like Viracocha,

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:57.840 align:middle line:84%
or the pre-Inca creator, the
pre-Inca deity that is closely

00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:01.050 align:middle line:84%
associated with gold
and the mining of gold

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:04.610 align:middle line:84%
and the obsession of gold
in ancient civilizations.

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:07.270 align:middle line:84%
This just highlights
how the mining

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:10.400 align:middle line:84%
of gold across
ancient civilizations

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:13.480 align:middle line:84%
can be connected from
all over the world.

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And they seem to be
a connecting point

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:19.400 align:middle line:84%
and evidence of all
ancient cultures

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:21.220 align:middle line:90%
at the southern tip of Africa.

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be dealing
with this in the next episode.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm Michael Tellinger,
