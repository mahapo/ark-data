00:00:13.473 --> 00:00:13.990 align:middle line:90%
>>Hello.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.480 align:middle line:10%
I'm Michael Tellinger.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And our journey continues
where we last left off,

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.130 align:middle line:84%
exploring sound and the
properties of sound,

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.120 align:middle line:84%
and the use of sound in
ancient civilizations

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.270 align:middle line:84%
and how we can use it today
for the benefit of humanity.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.780 align:middle line:84%
What we saw last time was
the properties of sound

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.930 align:middle line:84%
as it manifests
into physical form.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And the amazing
ability that our voices

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.340 align:middle line:84%
have to produce
an infinite number

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.380 align:middle line:84%
of physical manifestations
of sound, making us

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.250 align:middle line:84%
understand that we are
creators of our own reality.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.880 align:middle line:84%
By simply speaking, we're
bringing forth into existence

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.110 align:middle line:84%
our thoughts and
our spoken words

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.560 align:middle line:84%
into physical form that manifest
in front of us and around us

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.750 align:middle line:90%
as we speak.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And later again in
this series, I'll

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.330 align:middle line:84%
talk about how our
thoughts and the words

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.890 align:middle line:84%
we speak go into
the resonance field

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.200 align:middle line:84%
and affect everything
in creation instantly.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.950 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't take light years
for our thoughts and our words

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.390 align:middle line:84%
to reach everything in
creation, it happens instantly.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.390 align:middle line:84%
And therein lies some
very important secrets

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.680 align:middle line:84%
and the properties of
sound and resonance

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.020 align:middle line:84%
that connect
everything in creation.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.260 align:middle line:84%
So let's continue
exploring this thing called

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.940 align:middle line:84%
sound and the sound creations
and the inventions around us.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And let's just recap some of
the things we touched upon

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.980 align:middle line:90%
in the previous episode.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.890 align:middle line:10%
So sound levitates, it boils
water, it creates light,

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.600 align:middle line:10%
it creates DNA, it heals
and destroys pathogens,

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.720 align:middle line:10%
it moves beyond
the speed of light.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.840 align:middle line:10%
Sound can create saser
beams as saser technology.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.640 align:middle line:10%
It makes things invisible.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.060 align:middle line:10%
It energizes the water we
drink and the air we breathe.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.420 align:middle line:10%
And sound can create
hurricanes and bring rain

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.080 align:middle line:10%
onto a dry planet.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.580 align:middle line:90%
So let's move on to sound heals.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And many people will already
be familiar with the fact

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.010 align:middle line:84%
that the cures for all
disease have been discovered,

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.680 align:middle line:90%
and sound was always behind it.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.780 align:middle line:84%
But even in the Native
American medicine wheel,

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.420 align:middle line:84%
it comes to us in the
shape of a circle.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.060 align:middle line:10%
Remember we touched
upon the fact

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.050 align:middle line:10%
that sound is represented
as a cross in a circle

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.450 align:middle line:10%
being the primary
source of all things.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And here once again, the
Native American medicine wheel,

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.110 align:middle line:84%
the medicine men, the
cross in a circle,

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.520 align:middle line:84%
giving us a clear indication
that they understood that sound

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.230 align:middle line:90%
can be used as a healer.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And that the prime
resonance frequency

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.680 align:middle line:84%
can be used as a healing
frequency to heal all disease

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.080 align:middle line:84%
and to bring relief
to people that suffer

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.580 align:middle line:90%
from all kinds of ailments.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.050 align:middle line:84%
The original people of Australia
have a phenomenal story

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.210 align:middle line:84%
that brings sound as
a tool of creation,

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.830 align:middle line:84%
bringing into creation
the mountains and valleys

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.620 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of planet Earth.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And this is what the
creation story tells us.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.970 align:middle line:84%
It says, "time began when
the supernatural beings awoke

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.700 align:middle line:84%
and broke through the
surface of the Earth.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.160 align:middle line:84%
They moved about
the Earth bringing

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.800 align:middle line:84%
into being the physical
features of the Earth,

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.020 align:middle line:84%
and they did this all
with three sacred songs."

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.980 align:middle line:90%
This is phenomenal.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.930 align:middle line:84%
There's so many parallel
connections to the Bible

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.500 align:middle line:84%
and other ancient civilizations
and their creation stories.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.500 align:middle line:84%
But in this particular
instance, we

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.830 align:middle line:84%
have a beautiful
example with the work

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:44.430 align:middle line:84%
of Hans Jenny from his
1960s beautiful introduction

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.020 align:middle line:84%
to the science of cymatics
in his classic documentary

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.090 align:middle line:90%
on cymatics.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And the little excerpt
from this shows us

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.940 align:middle line:84%
how if you take
lycopodium powder--

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.040 align:middle line:84%
it's a very, very fine
powder from a plant.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.440 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at this
video clip, remember,

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.620 align:middle line:84%
you're looking at
powder on a metal plate.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.960 align:middle line:84%
You're not looking at
a jelly, or a liquid,

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.070 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.410 align:middle line:84%
It is powder on a metal plate
behaving like a jelly type,

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.620 align:middle line:90%
or a liquid kind of substance.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.980 align:middle line:84%
So imagine this powder
on this metal plate

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.220 align:middle line:84%
being the soil and the
surface of planet Earth

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.230 align:middle line:84%
that echoes the sentiments
of the original people

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.010 align:middle line:84%
of Australia's story of
creation and the manifestation

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.860 align:middle line:90%
of the surface of planet Earth.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.870 align:middle line:84%
The sound frequencies coming out
of the center of planet Earth--

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.610 align:middle line:84%
we all know that the planet and
the Earth rings like a bell,

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:37.800 align:middle line:90%
it gives off.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.030 align:middle line:84%
It never stops giving
off sound resonance

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.760 align:middle line:90%
from the core of the planet.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And these frequencies
and these resonance field

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.200 align:middle line:84%
hit the surface of the Earth,
resonating and vibrating

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.530 align:middle line:84%
the surface soil on the
surface of the planet

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.920 align:middle line:84%
just like the
lycopodium powder is

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.740 align:middle line:90%
vibrated on this metal plate.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And imagine you're seeing
the surface of the Earth,

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.170 align:middle line:84%
but over millions
of years, that have

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.580 align:middle line:90%
been compressed into seconds.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.790 align:middle line:84%
And this is how the
surface of the Earth

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:12.350 align:middle line:84%
was formed as shown in
this Aboriginal story,

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.290 align:middle line:84%
and by Hans Jenny in his
classic cymatics documentary

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.880 align:middle line:90%
from 1960s.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:17.546 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:05:17.546 --> 00:05:20.280 align:middle line:84%
>>Circular shapes
appear, but these

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.530 align:middle line:84%
are in a state of
continuous upheaval.

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.870 align:middle line:84%
The particles are pushed
outwards from the center

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.448 align:middle line:84%
and inwards again
from the outside.

00:05:30.448 --> 00:05:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And at the same
time, they pulsate.

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:42.280 align:middle line:90%


00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.890 align:middle line:84%
We can recognize
the various patterns

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.400 align:middle line:90%
of the vibratory fields.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.570 align:middle line:84%
They move to and fro,
unite and separate again

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.180 align:middle line:84%
according to the vibratory
state of the surface formed

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.040 align:middle line:90%
by the membrane.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And we can, as it
were, move over

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:06.200 align:middle line:84%
a landscape which is in
a state of vibration.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.210 align:middle line:84%
If we intensify the
note, if we produce

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:14.460 align:middle line:84%
a crescendo for the ear, the
masses are hurled outwards.

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:20.230 align:middle line:84%
We see fountains, eruptions,
explosions almost.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:24.420 align:middle line:84%
But invariably, the particles
return to the center

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:28.630 align:middle line:84%
so that here again, even
under these violently dynamic

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.650 align:middle line:84%
conditions, we find
there is circulation.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.690 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.830 align:middle line:84%
>>So, can you see this
beautiful yellow powder

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.890 align:middle line:84%
moving across the
surface of the Earth?

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:43.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, it just so happens that
this is an original people

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.360 align:middle line:90%
of Australia's creation story.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And I just recently flew over
the Australian Outback down

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:53.740 align:middle line:84%
in Northern South Australia and
took these aerial photographs

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:58.489 align:middle line:84%
that very closely resembles
this lycopodium powder moving

00:06:58.489 --> 00:06:59.280 align:middle line:90%
on the metal plate.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And we can see the
features of Mother Earth

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:06.490 align:middle line:84%
just the same way we saw the
lycopodium powder creating it

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:09.070 align:middle line:84%
from the resonance
under the metal plate.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.460 align:middle line:84%
It is spectacular when we start
recognizing and connecting

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.610 align:middle line:84%
these dots and seeing how
sound and resonance is

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:18.520 align:middle line:84%
behind everything
in our reality.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.630 align:middle line:84%
And that brings us
to the question,

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:22.920 align:middle line:90%
can sound be used as a tool?

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.800 align:middle line:90%
Can sound be used as technology?

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.760 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is obviously yes.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.430 align:middle line:84%
If sound is a primordial
source of all things,

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:33.750 align:middle line:90%
sound can be used as a tool.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.690 align:middle line:90%
Sound can be used as a weapon.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:37.910 align:middle line:90%
Sound can be used as technology.

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And there are some
spectacular ancient examples

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:45.390 align:middle line:84%
of using sound and tools
and resonance as technology.

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:48.470 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian ankh is one
of the most famous symbols

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:49.920 align:middle line:90%
in the world today.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.790 align:middle line:10%
And it is very clear
from some of the images

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:55.710 align:middle line:10%
and the paintings left
behind by the Egyptians

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:58.400 align:middle line:10%
that they used the ankh
as a tool, and a tool

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.920 align:middle line:10%
for all kinds of things--
tool for levitating,

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.060 align:middle line:10%
tool for healing.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And clearly it was a resonating
tool, like a tuning fork.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:10.400 align:middle line:84%
What I find fascinating is,
when you look at the fact

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.200 align:middle line:84%
that every king
and every pharaoh

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.340 align:middle line:84%
had his or her
own personal ankh,

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:20.000 align:middle line:84%
it tells us that there was
something very special.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And the personal relationship
between the individual

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.030 align:middle line:84%
and the ankh-- they
didn't share their ankhs,

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:28.850 align:middle line:84%
like we don't share
our toothbrushes today.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.390 align:middle line:84%
It seems that every
ankh was calibrated

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:35.679 align:middle line:84%
to the body or the energy field
of that individual's body.

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And I found a critical
bit of information

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:41.429 align:middle line:84%
and connecting these
dots when I was studying

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:45.760 align:middle line:84%
the work of John Keely,
who in 1888 in Philadelphia

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.270 align:middle line:84%
was already doing amazing
experiments with levitating

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:51.820 align:middle line:84%
with sound, and doing all
kinds of things with sound.

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And he found that the sound
technology he was using

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.240 align:middle line:84%
had to be calibrated
to his body.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And the tools and
implements he was using

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:03.056 align:middle line:84%
were calibrated to the
energy in his body.

00:09:03.056 --> 00:09:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And when friends
and other people

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:08.340 align:middle line:84%
came around and wanted to use
the same tools to levitate

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.490 align:middle line:84%
the objects he was
working with, they

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:14.160 align:middle line:84%
couldn't do it until their
bodies were calibrated

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.440 align:middle line:84%
to the tools and implements that
brought forth the levitation.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.760 align:middle line:84%
So suddenly you see a
very important reason

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:25.220 align:middle line:84%
by studying John Keely to
the ancient Egyptians why

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:30.370 align:middle line:84%
each pharaoh and each king or
ruler had his or her own ankh.

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:33.810 align:middle line:84%
It was specifically calibrated
to their body's energy

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:36.900 align:middle line:84%
to perform whatever tasks
they had to perform.

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.770 align:middle line:84%
We also know, by the
way, that the Egyptians

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:42.480 align:middle line:84%
were using sound to heal and
cure all kinds of diseases.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.210 align:middle line:84%
That they would regrow organs
in their special sound healing

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:49.740 align:middle line:84%
chambers and cure
all kinds of disease

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:53.570 align:middle line:84%
that certain researchers have
shared with us over the years.

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:55.410 align:middle line:84%
The Ark of the
Covenant is probably

00:09:55.410 --> 00:10:00.280 align:middle line:84%
one of the most famous tools
and examples of technology

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.670 align:middle line:90%
and a weapon in ancient times.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:06.960 align:middle line:84%
The fact that God
gave Moses and Aaron

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.720 align:middle line:84%
such very specific
instructions as how

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.990 align:middle line:84%
to build the Ark
of the Covenant,

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:16.510 align:middle line:84%
you can't get more specific
than what you read in the Bible.

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:18.140 align:middle line:90%
It's quite spectacular.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:22.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, first of all,
the weight of the ark

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:23.870 align:middle line:84%
would have been
between one and a half

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:28.100 align:middle line:84%
and three tons, so the fact
that it's got these two carrying

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.690 align:middle line:90%
poles is nonsensical.

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:33.360 align:middle line:84%
The ark would not have been
carried by four, or six,

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.680 align:middle line:90%
or eight guys.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.620 align:middle line:90%
It's too heavy to be carried.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And those poles are
probably too thin to carry

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:40.950 align:middle line:90%
the ark in any case.

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:42.930 align:middle line:90%
So what is the ark all about?

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:46.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, the ark is clearly
a communication device.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:50.520 align:middle line:84%
The Bible tells us that Moses
must sit on top of the ark,

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.150 align:middle line:90%
on the "mercy" seat.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:54.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why it's
called a mercy seat,

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:55.610 align:middle line:90%
but that's what it's called.

00:10:55.610 --> 00:11:01.760 align:middle line:84%
Sit in the mercy seat, and I
will talk to you from there.

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.670 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you the
instructions as to what

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:05.610 align:middle line:90%
you must tell the Israelites.

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:08.380 align:middle line:84%
So the mercy seat was
on top of the ark,

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:11.060 align:middle line:84%
underneath the wings
of the cherubim.

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:14.190 align:middle line:84%
So it was the wings of
the cherubim over Moses.

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:17.230 align:middle line:84%
He would sit there and get
instructions or a message

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:18.090 align:middle line:90%
from God.

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:20.549 align:middle line:84%
So clearly it was a
communication device.

00:11:20.549 --> 00:11:22.340 align:middle line:84%
The other important
thing is that the Bible

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:26.310 align:middle line:84%
does tell us that the ark never
really touched the ground.

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:28.540 align:middle line:84%
It always hovered
above the ground.

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:31.810 align:middle line:84%
So the poles that we
think were carrying

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:35.890 align:middle line:84%
poles were probably antennae
and not carrying poles.

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:38.790 align:middle line:84%
And again, there's a bit
of deception going on here.

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:40.440 align:middle line:90%
So it was being pushed along.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.310 align:middle line:90%
It levitated.

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:43.210 align:middle line:90%
It was a levitation device.

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:46.380 align:middle line:84%
It was always moving
and being pushed along

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.200 align:middle line:90%
above the surface of the ground.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.550 align:middle line:90%
What else did the ark do?

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:51.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, the ark
destroyed large armies.

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.010 align:middle line:84%
It was put down, it
would spark and give off

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:55.420 align:middle line:90%
sparks and lightning bolts.

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And it killed thousands, and it
killed those that handled it.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:03.870 align:middle line:84%
It had to be stored behind
specific veils and curtains

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:05.860 align:middle line:90%
and protection devices.

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most famous
things that the ark did was it

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.430 align:middle line:84%
brought down the
walls of Jericho.

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:14.340 align:middle line:84%
And once again, there are
very specific instructions

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.470 align:middle line:84%
as to what they had
to do with the ark.

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:20.000 align:middle line:84%
They had to march around
the walls of Jericho,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.600 align:middle line:84%
around the town, holding the
ark, or carrying the ark,

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.560 align:middle line:84%
or pushing the ark and
the ark would vibrate.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And they had to do this a
specific number of times.

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, with a shout
and the blast from a trumpet,

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.530 align:middle line:90%
the walls came tumbling down.

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:40.290 align:middle line:84%
A shout and a blast
from a trumpet?

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:42.470 align:middle line:90%
Both are sounds.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:47.290 align:middle line:84%
So it tells us that it was
some sort of a sound pressure

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:50.250 align:middle line:84%
wave that brought down
the walls of Jericho.

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:53.710 align:middle line:84%
So it seems that the
ark was putting out

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:57.450 align:middle line:84%
a resonance of some sort
that destabilized the walls.

00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And then with some sort of
an electromagnetic pulse,

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.230 align:middle line:84%
or a shout and a
blast from a trumpet,

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:04.160 align:middle line:90%
the walls came tumbling down.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.150 align:middle line:84%
The Ark of the
Covenant remains one

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:11.920 align:middle line:84%
of the most spectacular examples
of ancient advanced technology

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.620 align:middle line:90%
that we can find.

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And we continue with John
Keely, who I mentioned already,

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:21.230 align:middle line:84%
who used sound in ways that
very few people are aware of.

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And John Keely's interaction
with the government

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:27.840 align:middle line:84%
and with using sound
on many other levels

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.960 align:middle line:84%
remains a great secret
and a great mystery.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:34.560 align:middle line:84%
He did things that very
few people will ever know,

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:38.270 align:middle line:84%
because much of his information,
most of his information,

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:41.150 align:middle line:84%
was removed from the
global knowledge pool

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:44.590 align:middle line:84%
very swiftly after his death so
it would never be discovered.

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:48.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, John Keely is famous
for his musical dynasphere

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:51.810 align:middle line:84%
and the fact that he could
levitate objects with sound,

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:55.810 align:middle line:84%
that he could drill holes into
rock with absolute precision

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:57.100 align:middle line:90%
using sound.

00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:00.450 align:middle line:84%
With millimeter
precision and accuracy,

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:04.030 align:middle line:84%
he could crush giant
blocks of stone

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:07.840 align:middle line:84%
into the finest powder
with sound in minutes.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.750 align:middle line:90%
We can't do that today.

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:12.150 align:middle line:84%
The mining industry
today struggles

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:15.150 align:middle line:84%
to crush the ore that they
get out of the ground.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:20.050 align:middle line:84%
It takes a great deal of effort
to crush the ore into a powder

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:23.630 align:middle line:84%
so they can extract the minerals
that they are looking for.

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:28.740 align:middle line:84%
I used to work in one of these
giant crusher rooms, crusher

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:31.610 align:middle line:84%
warehouses on
Rustenburg Platinum Mine

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:32.910 align:middle line:90%
while I was studying.

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And during my VAC holidays, I
used to go and work at the mine

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.080 align:middle line:84%
and earn some
extra pocket money.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And I used to walk into one
of these giant warehouses

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:49.250 align:middle line:84%
where they had these huge
drums filled with metal balls.

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And they would fill these
giant steel drums with the ore

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:55.960 align:middle line:84%
and then they would spin
them and rotate them

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.950 align:middle line:84%
and the balls would
rotate and crush the ore.

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:01.710 align:middle line:84%
That's how our modern
mining industry does it.

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:05.480 align:middle line:84%
John Keely was doing it
with sound in minutes.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:08.060 align:middle line:84%
That just shows you how
we've regressed in the way

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:10.440 align:middle line:84%
we use technology,
and that we could

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:14.690 align:middle line:84%
be using sound instead of
metal balls to get things done.

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:16.320 align:middle line:90%
Sound creates light.

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:20.740 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Bible tells us
God said "let there be light,"

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:22.260 align:middle line:84%
so there's no
argument with that.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And with that, I
need to remind you

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:26.960 align:middle line:84%
that it is the sound
that is the precursor

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.860 align:middle line:84%
to the electromagnetic
universe-- sound, light,

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.240 align:middle line:90%
electromagneticism.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.570 align:middle line:84%
So it's the sound first,
keep that in mind.

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:36.090 align:middle line:84%
Many people have
done experiments

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:39.130 align:middle line:84%
by attaching an LED
light to a big speaker.

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:43.330 align:middle line:84%
You expose the speaker to a loud
noise and the light comes on.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:46.120 align:middle line:84%
Some people do it with their
Christmas lights at Christmas.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's a fascinating
little experiment to do,

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:51.060 align:middle line:84%
so you can try
that for yourself.

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:52.300 align:middle line:90%
Sound levitates?

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.080 align:middle line:90%
Can we show and prove this?

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.130 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:57.630 align:middle line:84%
There's some beautiful
examples on the internet how

00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:02.010 align:middle line:84%
sound levitates little objects,
but there's a trick in this.

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:04.260 align:middle line:84%
This is not the way
that the ancients

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:08.570 align:middle line:84%
would levitate giant stones
and 20 ton, or 300 ton,

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:13.130 align:middle line:84%
or 1,000 ton giant
megalithic blocks.

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:17.720 align:middle line:84%
This is just a little trick
by trapping very light objects

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.810 align:middle line:84%
between two standing sound
waves and using the pressure

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:24.450 align:middle line:84%
waves in these to levitate
very light objects.

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:28.250 align:middle line:84%
It does, however, show us
that sound can levitate

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:32.200 align:middle line:84%
and it gives us an indication
and an understanding how sound

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.230 align:middle line:90%
can be used as such a tool.

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:38.100 align:middle line:84%
So it allows us that freedom to
imagine how sound can levitate,

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:42.680 align:middle line:84%
even in such a simple example
as David Deak did here

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:46.340 align:middle line:84%
in a little cubicle, a little
chamber which is a square foot

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:49.480 align:middle line:84%
chamber, using three
sources of sound,

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.856 align:middle line:84%
levitating light
polystyrene objects.

00:16:51.856 --> 00:17:11.416 align:middle line:90%


00:17:11.416 --> 00:17:13.404 align:middle line:90%
>>No strings attached, eh?

00:17:13.404 --> 00:17:25.369 align:middle line:90%


00:17:25.369 --> 00:17:28.700 align:middle line:84%
>>One of my favorite
stories of what sound can do

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:32.000 align:middle line:84%
is the story of Peter
Davey from New Zealand.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.370 align:middle line:84%
In 1940, Peter tried to
register a patent to boil water

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:38.590 align:middle line:90%
with sound.

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:41.160 align:middle line:84%
He spent his entire
life trying to get

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.850 align:middle line:84%
his device and his invention
to the people of the world.

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:47.810 align:middle line:84%
His problem was that he wanted
to sell it to the world,

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:51.090 align:middle line:84%
and there we have the
common denominator

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:54.410 align:middle line:84%
of why many of these
discoveries and devices

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:58.060 align:middle line:84%
never reach the
population because most

00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:00.890 align:middle line:84%
of the time we get
caught by this notion

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:03.340 align:middle line:84%
that we have to sell
things, and it's always

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:05.080 align:middle line:90%
the money that gets in the way.

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:08.360 align:middle line:84%
We'll be talking a lot more
about that in future episodes.

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:11.850 align:middle line:84%
But Peter Davey started
boiling water with sound

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:18.400 align:middle line:84%
in 1940 already, showing an
incredible new phenomenon that

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:22.260 align:middle line:84%
could really save the world
from an incredible pollution

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:22.940 align:middle line:90%
problem.

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:25.790 align:middle line:84%
The fact that we
have to burn coal to

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:29.390 align:middle line:84%
boil the water, to
create the steam,

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:32.750 align:middle line:84%
to drive the turbines,
to give us electricity.

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:35.820 align:middle line:84%
If only we could boil
water with sound,

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:38.540 align:middle line:84%
we can create clean
electricity by boiling

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:40.540 align:middle line:90%
the water creating the steam.

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And the steam
doesn't get used up--

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:45.370 align:middle line:84%
it gets reused over
and over again.

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:49.250 align:middle line:84%
So it is a clean way of creating
electricity for the world.

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:53.010 align:middle line:84%
So it is a huge step forward,
or it could be a huge step

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:55.800 align:middle line:84%
forward, for the world
and for communities

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:59.070 align:middle line:84%
to take control of their own
electricity and energy supply

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:02.240 align:middle line:84%
when we find the way to
boil water with sound.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.310 align:middle line:84%
This is one of my
favorite subjects.

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And what I find fascinating
is that when Peter Davey first

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.390 align:middle line:90%
brought this out in the '40s.

00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:16.120 align:middle line:84%
Before he turned his device into
an electrically powered source

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:20.190 align:middle line:84%
and a electrically
powered gadget,

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:22.750 align:middle line:84%
he used what seems
to be two bicycle

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:25.180 align:middle line:84%
bells-- normal, tring
tring bicycle bells,

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:27.990 align:middle line:84%
one smaller one
inside a bigger one.

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And by simply ringing the
bell, the water would boil.

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.040 align:middle line:84%
Now that is the
kind of technology

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.630 align:middle line:84%
I would like to
have in my house.

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure you,
too, would like

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:39.480 align:middle line:90%
to have that in your house.

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.280 align:middle line:90%
Run out of hot water?

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.140 align:middle line:90%
Just ring the bell.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:45.280 align:middle line:84%
Ring, ring, you got a geyser
full of hot water again.

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:46.750 align:middle line:90%
So this is phenomenal.

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And just to show you how
Peter Davey did this,

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:52.080 align:middle line:84%
here's a little
video of him actually

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.380 align:middle line:84%
doing this on a news
channel in New Zealand.

>>It looks like a disc
lamp, is cool to the touch

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:03.200 align:middle line:10%

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.380 align:middle line:10%

92-year-old former
Spitfire pilot Peter Davey

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:13.910 align:middle line:84%
claims his invention uses the
power of sound to boil water.

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:19.300 align:middle line:84%
>>Davey believes high
frequency sonic vibrations

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:21.380 align:middle line:84%
are measured from
within the silver bulb

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:23.290 align:middle line:90%
cause the water to boil.

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:26.290 align:middle line:84%
He says the idea came
to him 50 years ago

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:28.990 align:middle line:84%
when he noticed different
saxophone notes caused

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:33.300 align:middle line:84%
different household
items to rattle.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:37.555 align:middle line:84%
The man's powered gizmo
has experts intrigued.

it in my life, as they say.

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:51.670 align:middle line:84%
>>And if he does get
it on the shelves,

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:54.160 align:middle line:84%
he's already got one
interested customer.

>>If I saw one in a
shop, I'd buy one,

00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:59.750 align:middle line:84%
because I think there's
an interesting little bit

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:00.770 align:middle line:90%
of technology.

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:03.150 align:middle line:84%

work, they work.

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:06.690 align:middle line:84%

savoring his gizmo's success

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:09.587 align:middle line:84%
and sticking to his own
unique theory on how it works.

the end of this episode

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:14.440 align:middle line:84%
and our look at how
sound can be used

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:17.810 align:middle line:84%
in so many incredible
ways, and tools,

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:21.120 align:middle line:84%
and applications that
can benefit humanity.

And in the next
episode, we'll pick up

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:27.080 align:middle line:84%
one of the most critical and
important aspects and parts

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.630 align:middle line:90%
of our human endeavor.

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:30.920 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
cure for a disease

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:34.010 align:middle line:84%
and using sound and
resonance in finding

00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:37.040 align:middle line:84%
the cure for all disease
through our understanding

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.420 align:middle line:84%
of the prime
resonance frequency.
