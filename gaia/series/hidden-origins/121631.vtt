00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.260 align:middle line:90%


00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:15.480 align:middle line:90%
>>Hello.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.160 align:middle line:84%
My name is Michael
Tellinger, and

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.480 align:middle line:84%
welcome to the first in
studio recording of the UBUNTU

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.630 align:middle line:90%
Contributionism workshop.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.040 align:middle line:10%
We're here at Gaiam
TV, or which is now

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.710 align:middle line:10%
Gaia TV, in Boulder, Colorado.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.650 align:middle line:10%
Very privileged to be
given this opportunity

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.870 align:middle line:10%
to shoot the knowledge,
and information, and wisdom

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.400 align:middle line:10%
captured by the ancient UBUNTU
philosophy with a live studio

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.200 align:middle line:10%
audience.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.035 align:middle line:84%
This has never been
done before, so

00:00:43.035 --> 00:00:47.347 align:middle line:84%
a very special opportunity for
me and for everyone here today.

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:48.930 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining
us in the studio

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.110 align:middle line:84%
to be part of this two
day recording process

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.320 align:middle line:84%
that will ultimately become
an eight hour workshop.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.750 align:middle line:84%
The way we're going to do
this is in one hour segments,

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.730 align:middle line:84%
and at the end of
every hour, we'll

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.209 align:middle line:84%
have a 10 minute
debate, Q&A, whatever

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:06.630 align:middle line:84%
you want to call it to
throw some ideas around.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.030 align:middle line:84%
So let's keep it loose, and
as friendly, and as warm

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.330 align:middle line:90%
as possible.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And as we were saying before
we started rolling the cameras,

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.770 align:middle line:84%
remember that we are here
creating and bringing

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.910 align:middle line:84%
into reality a new future or
a new reality for ourselves,

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.780 align:middle line:84%
and just by being
in this room, we've

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.630 align:middle line:84%
already put in this energetic
message and resonance

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.430 align:middle line:90%
into the morphogenetic field.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.920 align:middle line:84%
So let's keep visualizing
that and reminding ourselves

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.790 align:middle line:84%
of what it is that
we're doing here

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.050 align:middle line:84%
is really being the activators
of this new resonance that

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.120 align:middle line:84%
is already reaching everyone
and everything in creation.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.710 align:middle line:90%
So why are we here?

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.680 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we are
in the age of prophecy,

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.220 align:middle line:84%
that we are the ones
we've been waiting for,

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.290 align:middle line:84%
and I keep reminding
people about this.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.250 align:middle line:84%
No one's going to
change the world for us.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.700 align:middle line:84%
No one is going to
project the future.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.030 align:middle line:84%
It's up to us to do
something about our reality,

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.000 align:middle line:84%
our existence, and it's
with these workshops

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.820 align:middle line:84%
and this UBUNTU message, this
ancient African philosophy,

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.610 align:middle line:84%
which is echoed by all ancient
cultures around the world--

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.620 align:middle line:84%
the same message of
unity consciousness

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.590 align:middle line:84%
that we start to relearning
the ancient knowledge

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.250 align:middle line:84%
and the ancient wisdom
of ancient civilizations,

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.630 align:middle line:84%
and discarding the shackles
and the chains of enslavement

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.420 align:middle line:84%
that have been imposed on us by
the so-called modern society.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.040 align:middle line:90%
You are not here by accident.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.040 align:middle line:90%
None of us here by accident.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.900 align:middle line:84%
This is all a
predetermined activation.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.900 align:middle line:84%
Somehow we've chosen to be
here, and every one at home that

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.770 align:middle line:84%
is actually watching this, or
wherever you may be watching

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.230 align:middle line:84%
this recording and
this documentation

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.090 align:middle line:84%
of this philosophy at this
stage, or this message,

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.600 align:middle line:84%
you're not watching
this by accident either.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.890 align:middle line:84%
So keep reminding
yourself of this,

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:03.210 align:middle line:84%
and let's utilize this
knowledge and information

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.390 align:middle line:84%
to keep reactivating our
own inner knowledge that

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.740 align:middle line:84%
is encoded in our DNA, this
infinite knowledge and wisdom

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.950 align:middle line:84%
that we carry in
ourselves in our bodies

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.190 align:middle line:84%
as co-creators of own reality,
and that really takes me

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.830 align:middle line:90%
to the next point.

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.380 align:middle line:84%
The whole story of quantum
physics is a phenomenal one.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.720 align:middle line:84%
Quantum physics is more
than 100 years old already.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.220 align:middle line:84%
The study of quantum physics
is more than 100 years old,

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.320 align:middle line:84%
and at that stage,
they already discovered

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.270 align:middle line:84%
and started telling
us that we are

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.090 align:middle line:90%
the makers of our own reality.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.620 align:middle line:84%
We can create our own
reality and our own future,

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.000 align:middle line:84%
and yet this is the last
thing they teach us at school.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.750 align:middle line:84%
So it just shows
you the moment you

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.520 align:middle line:84%
start thinking about what kind
of education are we getting,

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.910 align:middle line:84%
and what is that they're
teaching us at school,

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.900 align:middle line:84%
and teaching us to
practice on a daily bases

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.460 align:middle line:84%
is complete opposite of
this deep understanding

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.030 align:middle line:84%
of the quantum
world and the fact

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.410 align:middle line:84%
that we are the makers
of our own reality.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.520 align:middle line:84%
So again, let's remind
ourselves of this all the time,

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.467 align:middle line:84%
and let's project
the future that we'd

00:04:10.467 --> 00:04:12.300 align:middle line:84%
like to see for ourselves,
and our children,

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.750 align:middle line:84%
and everyone around us
on this beautiful planet.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.420 align:middle line:84%
So what we are going to do over
the next eight hours, or eight

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.930 align:middle line:84%
episodes, or two days in
the studio here-- so let's

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.990 align:middle line:84%
just quickly go through
the points of discussion.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.370 align:middle line:84%
First of all, what is
UBUNTU, this weird word

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.630 align:middle line:90%
that I keep throwing around?

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.240 align:middle line:84%
What is UBUNTU and
what are its origins?

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And then this other word that
I've been using for about 10

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.140 align:middle line:90%
or 11 years-- Contributionism.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.920 align:middle line:84%
Where does that word come
from and what does it mean?

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.710 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk about
the socio-political structure

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.000 align:middle line:90%
that we find ourselves in.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.480 align:middle line:84%
We're going to explore
capitalism and democracy,

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.400 align:middle line:84%
and that leads us to
the origins of money.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.280 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk and learn
more about central banks,

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.070 align:middle line:84%
and our banking system,
and the financial systems,

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.520 align:middle line:90%
and the global banking control.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.230 align:middle line:10%
Then we're going to talk about
the UBUNTU plan of action,

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.760 align:middle line:10%
which deals with both community
and political activation,

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.550 align:middle line:10%
political participation.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And that is a very important
part of this workshop

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.590 align:middle line:84%
actually-- is to make people
realize why the marrying

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.670 align:middle line:84%
of the two is so critical and
why we cannot keep discarding,

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.540 align:middle line:84%
or circumventing, or avoiding
this political activation

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.790 align:middle line:90%
or the political field.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.850 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk about
a new social structure

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.470 align:middle line:84%
and a blueprint for human
prosperity, which is a subtext

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.640 align:middle line:84%
that I've been
using for my book,

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.030 align:middle line:84%
"UBUNTU Contributionism,
a Blueprint for Human

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:41.460 align:middle line:90%
Prosperity."

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.450 align:middle line:84%
UBUNTU around the world-- how
this philosophy has started

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.940 align:middle line:84%
spreading around the world,
and how miraculously we

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.540 align:middle line:84%
now have members-- if you
want to call them that,

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:55.230 align:middle line:84%
or supporters, or
resonators-- in virtually

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.170 align:middle line:90%
every country of the world.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.620 align:middle line:84%
I cannot think of a country that
does not have somebody that is

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.260 align:middle line:84%
subscribed to our newsletter
or following what we are doing

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.700 align:middle line:90%
with UBUNTU.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.900 align:middle line:10%
And then we'll continue
with community projects, how

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.130 align:middle line:10%
we activate this philosophy
with community projects

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.930 align:middle line:10%
and creating abundance, and
the one leads to the other.

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.890 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about this
very fascinating subject

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:25.450 align:middle line:84%
of free electricity as
a unifying tool, which

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.120 align:middle line:84%
is really critical and
one of the cornerstones

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.330 align:middle line:84%
and foundations of
what we're dealing

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:34.250 align:middle line:84%
with on a daily day to day basis
in our lives in the community

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.200 align:middle line:84%
that I come from and the
other communities that I'm

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.050 align:middle line:84%
activating in South Africa
and around the world.

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.090 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk
about education,

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:47.040 align:middle line:84%
very important and a
critical part of who we are

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.610 align:middle line:84%
as a species, and how higher
education is being used

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.750 align:middle line:84%
to shape our perception
of the world around us,

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:58.170 align:middle line:84%
and what we can and cannot do,
and how changing the education

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.640 align:middle line:84%
system will create a whole
new society around us very,

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:02.900 align:middle line:90%
very quickly.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.700 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about industry,
mining, manufacturing,

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:10.040 align:middle line:84%
and technology-- all the things
that we've been indoctrinated

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.530 align:middle line:84%
to believing are necessary
and how we can utilize

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:15.850 align:middle line:84%
the change and the
shift in those areas

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:19.060 align:middle line:84%
to bring forth
abundance into our lives

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.100 align:middle line:84%
and onto this beautiful
planet, and that also

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.860 align:middle line:90%
obviously includes farming.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.080 align:middle line:84%
I will discuss the event
of UBUNTU warehouses.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:27.970 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:29.720 align:middle line:90%
We'll get to later.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And that ultimately leads
to alternative currencies

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:34.850 align:middle line:84%
and how an alternative
currency is

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.320 align:middle line:84%
an interim step
towards emancipation

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.120 align:middle line:84%
and liberating us from
this economic slavery

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:44.140 align:middle line:84%
that we find ourselves in is
a necessary step that we're

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:46.150 align:middle line:84%
most likely going
to have to embrace.

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going
to also discuss

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:51.740 align:middle line:84%
tribal leaders and how tribal
and traditional leaders

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.440 align:middle line:84%
around the world, whether it's
in South Africa, or Africa,

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.970 align:middle line:84%
or the Americas, or
Canada, Australia,

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:59.360 align:middle line:84%
wherever there may still
be tribal leaders that

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.630 align:middle line:84%
carry the respect
of their people--

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:06.190 align:middle line:84%
how they play and are already
playing a critical role in some

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:08.730 align:middle line:84%
of the work that we've been
doing with the UBUNTU movement.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And then once again, although
I have been in contact

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:14.620 align:middle line:84%
with several tribal leaders in
the United States and Canada,

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.780 align:middle line:84%
my connection there is
not yet that strong,

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:20.530 align:middle line:84%
although it's growing
rapidly, but in South Africa,

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:24.250 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you that there are
at least 12 tribal leaders that

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:28.310 align:middle line:84%
have asked-- that I've either
made contact with or about

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:32.419 align:middle line:84%
to make contact with who
are very keen to reembrace

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:34.090 align:middle line:90%
this philosophy.

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:36.380 align:middle line:84%
That is, they own
African philosophy

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.210 align:middle line:84%
that has been stolen from
them by the government

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:41.530 align:middle line:84%
and the legal systems that
have been imposed on them.

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:43.700 align:middle line:84%
So many of the
tribal leaders are

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.220 align:middle line:84%
very keen to bring back
this ancient philosophy

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:49.130 align:middle line:84%
into their tribal lands
to start implementing it

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:51.140 align:middle line:84%
for the benefit of
their people, and this

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:53.510 align:middle line:84%
is very, very good
news for everyone

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:55.680 align:middle line:84%
that is involved in this
movement around the world.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:00.650 align:middle line:90%
So why are we here today?

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:03.380 align:middle line:84%
We're obviously here
because we believe

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.740 align:middle line:84%
that something is
wrong with the system,

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:07.090 align:middle line:90%
and we don't just believe it.

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:09.200 align:middle line:84%
We know that something
is wrong with the system.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.567 align:middle line:84%
So just what I've been
doing for nearly 10 years

00:09:11.567 --> 00:09:13.900 align:middle line:84%
around the world now-- I'm
going to do this in this room

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:17.930 align:middle line:84%
just to show hopefully--
I hope I'm right-- just

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:23.060 align:middle line:84%
to show for the people
watching this workshop-- how

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.210 align:middle line:84%
many of you, by
show of hands, are

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:27.560 align:middle line:84%
happy with the way
the world is going?

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.070 align:middle line:84%
Are happy with what the
government is doing for us?

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:32.540 align:middle line:84%
Are happy with the health
services we're getting?

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:35.880 align:middle line:84%
Are happy with what the armies
are doing around the world?

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.320 align:middle line:84%
Just raise your hand if you're
happy with-- if you believe

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.151 align:middle line:84%
that you're fulfilling
your life's dreams,

00:09:41.151 --> 00:09:42.650 align:middle line:84%
that this is what
you were born for.

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:43.608 align:middle line:90%
Please raise your hand.

00:09:43.608 --> 00:09:47.160 align:middle line:90%


00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.581 align:middle line:90%
So it's always the same.

00:09:48.581 --> 00:09:50.580 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing this work
for more than 10 years

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:52.750 align:middle line:84%
around the world,
and not once has

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:55.690 align:middle line:84%
anyone ever raise their
hand-- always in jest.

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:59.750 align:middle line:84%
Somebody's always making a
joke and lifting their hand,

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:00.610 align:middle line:90%
but this is it.

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:05.300 align:middle line:84%
So we have a 100%
dissatisfaction

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.710 align:middle line:84%
with what's happening
to us in our lives, what

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:11.210 align:middle line:84%
our governments are doing,
how our lives are unfolding,

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:14.740 align:middle line:84%
and yet so few people out there
are actually doing anything

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.010 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:18.260 align:middle line:84%
So it is this
message that I want

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.652 align:middle line:84%
to leave with you right from
the beginning-- is to say,

00:10:21.652 --> 00:10:23.360 align:middle line:84%
if we're the ones
we've been waiting for,

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.068 align:middle line:84%
then we're the ones
that need to initiate

00:10:25.068 --> 00:10:26.610 align:middle line:90%
and activate this change.

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And it starts with us
here in this room today

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:30.780 align:middle line:84%
and those that are
watching this at home

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:34.090 align:middle line:84%
to go out there and become the
messengers of this information

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:36.640 align:middle line:84%
and this knowledge-- the
sharing of the good news.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.420 align:middle line:84%
Become the seed of
consciousness in your own area,

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.140 align:middle line:90%
in your own community.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.080 align:middle line:84%
Do whatever it is
you need to do.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.040 align:middle line:90%
Start up meet up groups.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.910 align:middle line:90%
Meet up as often as you can.

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:48.790 align:middle line:90%
Get out the book.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:50.310 align:middle line:84%
Get whatever
information you have,

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:51.737 align:middle line:90%
but start discussing this.

00:10:51.737 --> 00:10:53.070 align:middle line:90%
Go out there and tell everybody.

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:54.430 align:middle line:90%
Don't be quiet.

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:56.620 align:middle line:84%
Don't be silent, and
most importantly,

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:59.410 align:middle line:84%
don't be afraid about the
knowledge and the information

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:01.730 align:middle line:84%
that you have, that you've
gathered for yourself

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:04.260 align:middle line:84%
over the years of your
own introspection,

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.130 align:middle line:84%
your own research, your
own time that you've

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:10.750 align:middle line:84%
informed yourself and
filled your own body

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:14.724 align:middle line:84%
and your own energetic field
with knowledge and information.

00:11:14.724 --> 00:11:16.390 align:middle line:84%
Go out there and share
that with people.

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:18.140 align:middle line:84%
Don't worry about it
whether they're ready

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:19.890 align:middle line:90%
or not to hear the message.

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:21.940 align:middle line:84%
That's their problem,
not your problem.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.930 align:middle line:84%
Tell them what you know, and
let it resonate with them,

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:26.970 align:middle line:90%
and you know why I say this.

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:28.970 align:middle line:84%
Again, I've been saying
this in my presentations

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:30.940 align:middle line:84%
when I talk about
ancient civilizations,

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.100 align:middle line:84%
because my work
there research shows

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:34.530 align:middle line:84%
about the sound
and the resonance.

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:37.250 align:middle line:84%
And so I always tell people,
go out there and tell everyone,

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:41.340 align:middle line:84%
because once they've heard
it, they can never unhear it.

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And it forever resonates
in their hearts,

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:46.540 align:middle line:84%
and while they may not
understand it when they first

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:49.940 align:middle line:84%
receive the message, it is
in there subconsciously,

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:52.090 align:middle line:84%
working away at them
until the penny drops,

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:54.750 align:middle line:84%
until they hit their
critical point, until they

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:57.850 align:middle line:84%
hit their own little
tipping scale and something

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:00.580 align:middle line:90%
happens, and their life changes.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.790 align:middle line:90%
And they then become like we.

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:04.660 align:middle line:84%
They want to run out
and tell everybody,

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.510 align:middle line:90%
because that's what happens.

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Become like reborn
Christians in many way,

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:13.820 align:middle line:84%
and it is that kind of
crazy euphoric feeling

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.230 align:middle line:84%
that fills you,
and you just want

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:16.800 align:middle line:84%
to share the good
news with everyone.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.380 align:middle line:90%
So there is a way out.

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:22.210 align:middle line:84%
There is a simple
way out of this mess,

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:26.470 align:middle line:84%
and while I'm on that
subject, on that thought,

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:28.890 align:middle line:84%
is that this really
is that simple.

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:31.220 align:middle line:84%
And what we're going
to work through

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:35.310 align:middle line:84%
over the next several hours
is the message, and the plan,

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:39.080 align:middle line:84%
and the way forward is
so easy and so simple.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:42.850 align:middle line:84%
We become our own worst
enemies in most cases.

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:46.320 align:middle line:84%
We become the obstacles
to our own emancipation.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.420 align:middle line:90%
So let's not do that.

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:49.770 align:middle line:84%
Let's not throw any
obstacles in our own way.

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:51.800 align:middle line:84%
Let's just visualize
the outcome,

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:55.710 align:middle line:84%
visualize that we live on a
planet of absolute abundance

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:59.110 align:middle line:84%
and freedom, that everyone
shares everything with everyone

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:02.080 align:middle line:84%
else because that's
just the way we do it.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.170 align:middle line:84%
So this is why we
are here today,

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:07.160 align:middle line:84%
is to start this process,
and since none of you

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:11.670 align:middle line:84%
raised your hand when
we asked that question,

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:15.010 align:middle line:84%
I think we're in
resonant company here.

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:17.480 align:middle line:84%
So first we're going to
start with some revision,

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:20.540 align:middle line:90%
and I'd like to just remind you.

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:23.380 align:middle line:84%
Don't see this as dark
and sinister information,

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:24.180 align:middle line:90%
because it is.

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.840 align:middle line:90%
We have to deal with the facts.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.900 align:middle line:84%
We have to first
unpack the reality that

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:32.890 align:middle line:84%
face us on a day to day
basis, and it's not good.

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:36.202 align:middle line:84%
It can be gloomy, and
dark, and depressing,

00:13:36.202 --> 00:13:37.410 align:middle line:90%
but let's not see it as that.

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:40.680 align:middle line:84%
Let's see it as information
as a knowledge base

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:44.470 align:middle line:84%
that we have to first
absorb to create

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:47.030 align:middle line:84%
the foundation of knowledge
from which we then

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:51.450 align:middle line:84%
use to spring forward and bring
in this new way of thinking,

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:54.670 align:middle line:84%
the new way of
unity, consciousness,

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:56.230 align:middle line:90%
and abundance for all.

00:13:56.230 --> 00:14:00.610 align:middle line:10%
So we must fully comprehend
the cause of the problems.

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:02.880 align:middle line:10%
To know what we should
do to free ourselves,

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.840 align:middle line:10%
we have to embrace
the problems first,

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:09.940 align:middle line:10%
and we must deal with the cause
and not just the symptoms,

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:11.730 align:middle line:10%
and we all know
what the cause is.

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:13.990 align:middle line:84%
We're going to deal with
that in great detail.

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:17.140 align:middle line:84%
It is the financial
systems of the world.

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:20.750 align:middle line:84%
It is the money, and remember,
until we deal with the money

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:25.150 align:middle line:84%
issue, we will never,
ever change the reality

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:27.100 align:middle line:90%
that we find ourselves in.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:31.460 align:middle line:84%
This is something I was probably
going to leave for a little bit

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.550 align:middle line:84%
later, but I might as well
bring it out right now.

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:38.510 align:middle line:84%
Until we deal with the
money issue and change that,

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:40.770 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be going
around and round in circles

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:43.170 align:middle line:84%
and never get ourselves
out of this trap.

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:45.490 align:middle line:84%
It is a maze that
we've been caught in,

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:50.100 align:middle line:84%
and some people call it the
Babylonian magic money slavery

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:50.930 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:53.138 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get back
to that, because it seems

00:14:53.138 --> 00:14:58.090 align:middle line:84%
like this financial system has
been imposed on us has somehow

00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:00.130 align:middle line:84%
been encoded with some
sort of black magic,

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:02.560 align:middle line:84%
because look what it's done
to people around the world.

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.000 align:middle line:90%
Look what is doing to us.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.690 align:middle line:84%
Many times I've been
guilty of being sucked

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:08.610 align:middle line:84%
into that-- many, many
times in my life--

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:13.210 align:middle line:84%
and I try and remind myself
of that all the time whenever

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:16.530 align:middle line:84%
I go through that craziness when
you start thinking about money

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:20.490 align:middle line:84%
and how it destroys
everything in our existence.

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:24.691 align:middle line:84%
So let's have a look at
where we stand today--

00:15:24.691 --> 00:15:26.810 align:middle line:90%
at our beautiful planet.

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:29.740 align:middle line:84%
From a distance, it looks
so beautiful, and peaceful,

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:31.590 align:middle line:90%
and totally united.

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:34.330 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, that's
not the case, is it?

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.300 align:middle line:84%
We're a deeply divided
species, and the closer

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:40.510 align:middle line:84%
you get to this planet,
the more obvious

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:43.630 align:middle line:84%
the divisions become, and
it is quite spectacular.

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:49.180 align:middle line:84%
We're divided by religion, by
country, by race, by what job

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:52.810 align:middle line:84%
we do, what school we go to,
what brand of clothes we wear,

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:55.350 align:middle line:90%
what car we drive.

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:57.680 align:middle line:84%
It's just the
divisions are endless.

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:01.210 align:middle line:84%
It's insane, and it's these
divisions that prevent us

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:03.760 align:middle line:90%
from talking to each other.

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:05.410 align:middle line:84%
This morning I was
having breakfast

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:07.600 align:middle line:84%
at the hotel I was
staying at, and this guy

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:08.790 align:middle line:90%
sat down in front of me.

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And I looked up,
and I said, hello.

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:12.850 align:middle line:84%
I looked straight at him,
and he completely ignored me.

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:15.490 align:middle line:90%


00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:16.950 align:middle line:84%
He was three meters
away from me.

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:18.870 align:middle line:84%
I looked at him, and
I said, good morning.

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:20.703 align:middle line:84%
And he stared right at
me, right through me,

00:16:20.703 --> 00:16:21.850 align:middle line:90%
as if I wasn't there.

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:23.080 align:middle line:90%
It's like we fear each other.

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:23.880 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:25.560 align:middle line:84%
We live in fear
of our neighbors.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:28.150 align:middle line:84%
We're too scared to say
hello to a stranger on a bus,

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:30.822 align:middle line:84%
or a subway, or
even on an airplane.

00:16:30.822 --> 00:16:32.530 align:middle line:84%
You sit down next to
somebody when you're

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:34.470 align:middle line:90%
traveling on an airplane.

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:36.520 align:middle line:84%
Often people don't even
talk to each other,

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.780 align:middle line:84%
and there's a reason
for that, because most

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:42.070 align:middle line:84%
of the time when a
stranger comes up

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:44.410 align:middle line:84%
to you on the street they
normally want something.

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:46.579 align:middle line:84%
So we just don't
want deal with that,

00:16:46.579 --> 00:16:48.870 align:middle line:84%
whether it's somebody that's
needy, who wants something

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:50.110 align:middle line:90%
from you.

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:53.551 align:middle line:84%
Often we feel needy
ourselves, so I don't have

00:16:53.551 --> 00:16:54.800 align:middle line:90%
much to share with you, buddy.

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Don't talk to me, and it's
just this weird kind of energy,

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:00.450 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:02.074 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we
need to get out of.

00:17:02.074 --> 00:17:05.359 align:middle line:84%
So the more we look at
this divided world of ours,

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:07.040 align:middle line:84%
the more we realize,
and the more you

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:11.050 align:middle line:84%
study this, the more you realize
that it's not by accident.

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:15.359 align:middle line:84%
It's by design, and it's the
divide and conquer principle

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:21.960 align:middle line:84%
that has really taken total and
utter control of our planet.

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And those that
enforce it upon us

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:25.480 align:middle line:90%
know exactly what they're doing.

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:29.740 align:middle line:84%
They know that this is
a tool of mass control.

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:34.470 align:middle line:84%
It's a spectacular tool
of controlling people

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:37.150 align:middle line:84%
without them really knowing
that they're being controlled.

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:41.820 align:middle line:84%
So let's recognize
it, and deal with it,

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:45.300 align:middle line:84%
and let that knowledge and
information resonate within us

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:51.070 align:middle line:84%
as we move through this
processing of this information.

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:53.770 align:middle line:90%
So I asked you this already.

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:56.830 align:middle line:84%
How many of you are happy with
the way the world is going?

00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:58.660 align:middle line:90%
Very few.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:03.750 align:middle line:84%
I guess we have an
interesting situation

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:09.930 align:middle line:84%
that, by the time that people
start watching this workshop,

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:15.300 align:middle line:84%
we could have created not
just an exponential explosion

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:17.240 align:middle line:84%
of this information,
but a quantum

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.320 align:middle line:90%
explosion of this information.

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:22.880 align:middle line:84%
So let's realize, people, that
happiness comes from within,

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.010 align:middle line:84%
and you've got to decide
if you're happy or not.

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:27.130 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter if
you're rich or poor.

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:28.500 align:middle line:90%
I've seen some poor people.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.041 align:middle line:84%
The poorest people in the world
are often the happiest people

00:18:31.041 --> 00:18:32.670 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:34.520 align:middle line:84%
It's like the less
you have to lose,

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:37.745 align:middle line:84%
the less you have to worry,
and you look at the rich people

00:18:37.745 --> 00:18:39.870 align:middle line:84%
out there, and we're going
to talk about that later

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:42.470 align:middle line:84%
when we talk about living
in a world without money.

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:43.610 align:middle line:90%
How is that possible?

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:46.040 align:middle line:84%
How are the wealthy people
going to deal with that?

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:47.154 align:middle line:90%
And it's amazing.

00:18:47.154 --> 00:18:49.070 align:middle line:84%
You find that the rich
people are actually not

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:52.390 align:middle line:84%
often the problem, because
they know how fine that line is

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:54.910 align:middle line:90%
between all or nothing.

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:58.672 align:middle line:84%
And the very poor
people are OK with it.

00:18:58.672 --> 00:19:00.380 align:middle line:84%
They just know that
they have very little

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:01.450 align:middle line:84%
and they would
love to have more,

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:02.990 align:middle line:84%
but they don't necessarily
always want money.

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:04.390 align:middle line:90%
They just want to be happy.

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:06.460 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, we all
want to be happy.

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:10.090 align:middle line:84%
We want to live beautiful
lives, and enjoy lives, fulfill

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:14.350 align:middle line:84%
our dreams, give
expression to the talents

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:21.910 align:middle line:84%
and the creative forces that
are trapped inside these bodies.

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And that is what we are
prevented from doing,

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:26.810 align:middle line:90%
and it's not about the money.

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:28.800 align:middle line:84%
It's not about
how much you have.

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.710 align:middle line:84%
The rich people stay up
at night because they're

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:34.739 align:middle line:84%
worried about how they are
going to protect their money,

00:19:34.739 --> 00:19:36.280 align:middle line:84%
because once you
make a lot of money,

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.470 align:middle line:84%
everybody wants to
take it away from you.

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And so they're
equally miserable.

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:43.730 align:middle line:84%
The challenges are very
different from what many of us

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:47.840 align:middle line:84%
realize and how many is at
the cause and the root of all

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:48.670 align:middle line:90%
of this.

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:51.010 align:middle line:84%
The other important thing we
need to remind ourselves of

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:54.210 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that we live
on a planet of abundance.

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:56.660 align:middle line:84%
We don't live on a
planet of scarcity.

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:59.770 align:middle line:84%
There is so much
abundance on this planet,

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:03.250 align:middle line:90%
an abundance of everything.

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:07.440 align:middle line:84%
If you just think about water,
one of the big scare tactics

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.380 align:middle line:90%
today is water.

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:09.700 align:middle line:90%
Oh, water is very scare.

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:11.380 align:middle line:90%
Oh, there's not enough water.

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:14.190 align:middle line:90%
Are you insane?

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:17.690 align:middle line:84%
Who are these people that
are saying this to us?

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is that many
people out there are buying it.

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.820 align:middle line:84%
They're allowing that
energy and that knowledge

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:28.210 align:middle line:84%
to infiltrate their
being, and they

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:31.210 align:middle line:84%
start believing that there's
not enough water in the world.

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:33.470 align:middle line:84%
It is the most abundant
element on this planet--

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:37.100 align:middle line:90%
is water-- the number one.

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:40.900 align:middle line:84%
Water, and silica, quartzite,
sand, the rocks around us--

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:42.680 align:middle line:84%
between water, and
silica, and quartzite,

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:47.460 align:middle line:84%
we got the two most abundant
elements in the world.

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:50.160 align:middle line:84%
You also know-- I don't want
to go into this too deeply.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.860 align:middle line:84%
That's in my other
presentations where

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:55.850 align:middle line:84%
I talk about the importance
in water, and silica dioxide,

00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:57.880 align:middle line:84%
and quartzite-- how
those two elements is

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:02.615 align:middle line:84%
so vital for our energetic
survival and so forth.

00:21:02.615 --> 00:21:05.715 align:middle line:84%
So the most abundant element
on earth-- we are being told,

00:21:05.715 --> 00:21:07.960 align:middle line:84%
oh, there's not enough
water in the world.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.100 align:middle line:90%
It's like, no.

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:10.230 align:middle line:90%
That's part of the lie.

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:13.360 align:middle line:84%
Those are part of the lies
and deceptions that they

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.590 align:middle line:90%
keep shoving down our throats.

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:18.060 align:middle line:84%
What we have a problem
with is the fact

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:21.630 align:middle line:84%
that they're controlling the
supply of drinking water.

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:23.720 align:middle line:90%
And this is the problem.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:27.610 align:middle line:84%
So we need to overcome
that, and the fact

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:29.550 align:middle line:84%
that the industry and
the mining is poisoning

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:32.830 align:middle line:84%
the water in the ground,
that's a problem, not the fact

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:35.100 align:middle line:84%
that there's not enough
water in the world-- the fact

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:38.020 align:middle line:84%
that the industry
and the global elite

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:41.030 align:middle line:84%
are destroying and
poisoning our water

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:43.060 align:middle line:84%
that we should have
freely available

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:45.710 align:middle line:84%
for us to drink to
energize our bodies.

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:48.470 align:middle line:84%
Once again, like the
solutions for everything

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:52.200 align:middle line:84%
else are very, very
simple, and the solutions

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.599 align:middle line:84%
for our poisoned and dirty
water are equally simple,

00:21:55.599 --> 00:21:57.140 align:middle line:84%
and again, we'll
deal with that as we

00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:59.000 align:middle line:90%
go through this presentation.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.590 align:middle line:84%
So we live on a planet of
abundance, infinite abundance

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:07.700 align:middle line:84%
of everything we could
possibly imagine,

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:13.150 align:middle line:84%
and yet today there
is more starvation

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:15.990 align:middle line:84%
than at any other
time in human history.

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:20.140 align:middle line:84%
There are more people going
hungry than at any other time

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:21.740 align:middle line:90%
in human history.

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:26.690 align:middle line:84%
That's just too
incredible to deal with.

00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:30.380 align:middle line:84%
I certainly don't even
want to contemplate

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:33.170 align:middle line:84%
living on a planet like this,
and this is why, I guess,

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:37.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing what I'm doing-- is
helping people internalize this

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:38.670 align:middle line:90%
and say, we've had enough.

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:43.780 align:middle line:84%
We can't continue doing this,
and it's up to us to change it.

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:48.240 align:middle line:84%
How is it possible that we can
have so many hungry people, so

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:51.840 align:middle line:84%
many children and people--
not just children--

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.330 align:middle line:84%
people of all ages and sizes
dying every day because

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:57.450 align:middle line:90%
of starvation?

00:22:57.450 --> 00:22:59.900 align:middle line:84%
That is a crime
against humanity,

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.380 align:middle line:90%
and that is not by accident.

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.630 align:middle line:90%
Once again, that is by design.

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:08.940 align:middle line:84%
The UN Food Agency tells
us that about one third

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:14.780 align:middle line:84%
of the global food supply
goes to waste every year, not

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:18.030 align:middle line:84%
because there are no
hungry people to eat it,

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:20.960 align:middle line:84%
because they don't have
any money to buy the food.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.910 align:middle line:90%
So they throw it away.

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:27.150 align:middle line:84%
So our governments
are causing people

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:30.260 align:middle line:84%
to die because they're
preventing access

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:33.980 align:middle line:84%
to food and people to
get their hands on food.

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:36.450 align:middle line:84%
That's a crime against humanity,
and these are the things

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:39.070 align:middle line:90%
we need to deal with.

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:43.350 align:middle line:84%
The current situation
is very, very clear.

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:47.400 align:middle line:84%
Our socio-economic or
socio-political system

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:51.550 align:middle line:84%
that we have has failed us
dramatically on every level.

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:53.170 align:middle line:84%
Humans everywhere
live in misery.

00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:56.080 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter which country
you're in-- some more, some

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:59.680 align:middle line:84%
less, some for
different reasons.

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And there seems to
be no happy outcome

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:04.980 align:middle line:84%
to the political and
economic mess of the planet.

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:06.689 align:middle line:84%
You hear politicians
all the time saying,

00:24:06.689 --> 00:24:08.479 align:middle line:84%
oh, we're going to do
this, and we're going

00:24:08.479 --> 00:24:09.780 align:middle line:90%
to find more money to do that.

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:10.999 align:middle line:90%
It's like, really?

00:24:10.999 --> 00:24:12.790 align:middle line:84%
Where are you going to
find the money from?

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:15.240 align:middle line:84%
What, are you going to borrow
it from the private banks?

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:16.760 align:middle line:90%
How is this going to work?

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.640 align:middle line:84%
And for people that
are new to this,

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:22.630 align:middle line:84%
we're going to deal with this in
much greater detail about this

00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:25.250 align:middle line:84%
money issue and how our
governments keep making us

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:28.400 align:middle line:84%
promises that they cannot
deliver on because the whole

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.620 align:middle line:84%
economic structure
is nonsensical,

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:35.160 align:middle line:84%
and it is just a synthetically
upheld Ponzi scheme that keeps

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.380 align:middle line:90%
us all enslaved.

00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:38.860 align:middle line:90%
So we need to work through this.

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:40.930 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
undoing and unlearning

00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:42.960 align:middle line:84%
that we have to go
through in this process,

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:45.820 align:middle line:84%
and that's really why
the first day today we're

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:49.510 align:middle line:84%
going to really deal with
revisiting and revising

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:51.940 align:middle line:84%
the reasons why the
world is in such a mess,

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:53.920 align:middle line:84%
because once we understand
it, then it's very

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:55.980 align:middle line:90%
easy to find the solutions.

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:58.469 align:middle line:84%
So again, don't get
too dark, and down,

00:24:58.469 --> 00:24:59.510 align:middle line:90%
and depressed about this.

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:02.370 align:middle line:84%
See this as liberating
information,

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:06.280 align:middle line:84%
although it is really
dark and horrible,

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:08.320 align:middle line:84%
but we've got to work
through this, right?

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:11.360 align:middle line:84%
So every year and every
month it gets worse.

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:12.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, every year
you go-- you've

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:16.540 align:middle line:84%
got a little less money to deal
with, and more things to buy,

00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:18.860 align:middle line:84%
and more laws, and
more taxes to pay,

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:21.070 align:middle line:84%
and it's just more
road tolls to pay.

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:22.910 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly our roads no
longer belong to us.

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:24.740 align:middle line:84%
They belong to some
private corporation.

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:25.847 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:25:25.847 --> 00:25:28.305 align:middle line:84%
Why do we suddenly have to pay
a toll to drive on this road

00:25:28.305 --> 00:25:30.770 align:middle line:84%
while I've been driving this
road since I was a child?

00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:33.217 align:middle line:84%
And all of these
things around us

00:25:33.217 --> 00:25:34.550 align:middle line:90%
suddenly get taken away from us.

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:37.100 align:middle line:84%
Less rights for us, more
rights for corporations

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:39.830 align:middle line:84%
and governments, and
you start seeing where

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:41.509 align:middle line:90%
the balance of power lies.

00:25:41.509 --> 00:25:42.800 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't lie with the people.

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:44.500 align:middle line:84%
It lies with the
governments and those

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:47.070 align:middle line:84%
that we've appointed
as our servants.

00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:48.580 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that ironic?

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:51.080 align:middle line:84%
That the servants have
enslaved the masters,

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:53.190 align:middle line:84%
that our governments
have appointed them

00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:56.270 align:middle line:84%
as the slave masters and those
that just make the rules up

00:25:56.270 --> 00:26:00.860 align:middle line:84%
as they go, and we
have to toe the line?

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:03.550 align:middle line:84%
So, many people believe of
the global economic collapse

00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:04.790 align:middle line:90%
is imminent.

00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:08.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, that is not
so easy to answer,

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:11.070 align:middle line:84%
because the global economic
system is completely

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:13.110 align:middle line:90%
manipulated and controlled.

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And remember, because
the bankers make money

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:16.984 align:middle line:84%
out of thin air--
and again, for those

00:26:16.984 --> 00:26:18.774 align:middle line:84%
that don't understand
that yet, we're going

00:26:18.774 --> 00:26:20.210 align:middle line:90%
to talk about in more detail.

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:22.420 align:middle line:84%
Just because the bankers
make money out of thin air,

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:25.040 align:middle line:84%
they can play this game
for as long as they want.

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.185 align:middle line:84%
They can keep generating
money out of thin air

00:26:27.185 --> 00:26:30.490 align:middle line:84%
and keep enslaving countries
until the cows come home,

00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:34.200 align:middle line:84%
and we'll keep nodding our heads
and going along with this Ponzi

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.120 align:middle line:84%
scheme, because we're
the ones that have

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:38.120 align:middle line:90%
to keep repaying the money.

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:41.200 align:middle line:84%
So the economic
collapse is always

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:44.050 align:middle line:84%
orchestrated by those that
control the money supply.

00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:47.030 align:middle line:84%
So when people tell you that the
economic collapse is imminent,

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:49.990 align:middle line:84%
well, it depends on those
that control the money supply.

00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:52.530 align:middle line:84%
They'll decide when the
economy is going to collapse,

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:55.330 align:middle line:84%
and they'll make it collapsed
when it suits them most,

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:57.430 align:middle line:84%
when they want to benefit
from the stock markets

00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:59.890 align:middle line:84%
or whatever global
control they want to--

00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:02.140 align:middle line:84%
or country that want to
invade, or whatever it is they

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:02.940 align:middle line:90%
want to do.

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:05.700 align:middle line:84%
There's always an
agenda behind it,

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:10.830 align:middle line:84%
and this is a very, very
liberating realization,

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:14.470 align:middle line:84%
because in there lies a
solution-- the fact that they

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:18.010 align:middle line:84%
can control this and
manipulate it gives us--

00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:20.810 align:middle line:84%
if we think about this
cleverly and strategically,

00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:24.780 align:middle line:84%
gives us a way out,
gives us an edge that

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:30.880 align:middle line:84%
can bypass this
exploitative slavery system.

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And since I used
the word bypass,

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:35.550 align:middle line:84%
I also need to make
it very, very clear

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:38.260 align:middle line:84%
that we are not here--
and specifically

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:41.460 align:middle line:84%
the UBUNTU movement,
and UBUNTU party,

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:44.330 align:middle line:84%
and UBUNTU philosophy
is not there

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:49.440 align:middle line:84%
to confront anybody, or any
system, or any government.

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.890 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to
confront anyone.

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:52.600 align:middle line:90%
We don't want to fight anybody.

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:56.040 align:middle line:84%
It's not about confrontation,
or fighting, or violence,

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:57.780 align:middle line:90%
or picking up arms.

00:27:57.780 --> 00:27:59.690 align:middle line:90%
Those days are over.

00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:04.520 align:middle line:84%
We can't fight or confront
the global elite, those that

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:07.060 align:middle line:90%
have imposed the system on us.

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:10.630 align:middle line:84%
They control every
aspect of our existence.

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:13.780 align:middle line:84%
It's not possible for us to
confront them and fight them.

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:17.630 align:middle line:84%
What is possible is to
create an alternative.

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:21.450 align:middle line:84%
Simply bypass the system
that they're imposing on us,

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:25.200 align:middle line:84%
and you'll see by the time we
finish here you will not only

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.700 align:middle line:84%
have a very clear
understanding of how easy it

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:31.510 align:middle line:84%
is to bypass the system,
how quickly we can do it,

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:35.260 align:middle line:84%
and how quickly we can liberate
ourselves from this enslavement

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:38.130 align:middle line:84%
that we all find
ourselves in, that is

00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:40.680 align:middle line:84%
the most liberating thing that
we're going to all walk away

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:41.490 align:middle line:90%
from here.

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And those watching
this recording

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:46.219 align:middle line:84%
are going to find at the
end of these eight hours,

00:28:46.219 --> 00:28:48.260 align:middle line:84%
you're going to not only
know that it's possible.

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.660 align:middle line:84%
You're going to realize
we're already doing it

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:53.470 align:middle line:84%
and that it can happen
very, very quickly.

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:55.640 align:middle line:84%
It's just up to us
to start implementing

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.740 align:middle line:90%
these very simple philosophies.

00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:59.070 align:middle line:90%
No confrontation.

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:00.270 align:middle line:90%
No violence.

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:03.480 align:middle line:84%
No more submitting to your
lies, and control, and abuse.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:06.260 align:middle line:84%
Simply standing together,
working together,

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:10.380 align:middle line:84%
and creating a whole new
reality and a new alternative

00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:14.120 align:middle line:84%
that provides for
everything that we need.

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's so beautiful
and so simple I

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:20.450 align:middle line:84%
find that, at the end
of these workshops,

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:23.680 align:middle line:84%
it becomes like a group
therapy session, where there's

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:28.080 align:middle line:84%
this huge relief and release of
stress, and anxiety, and fear.

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.740 align:middle line:90%
It's like, oh my goodness.

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:30.540 align:middle line:90%
We can do it.

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:34.120 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we can do it, and
if you don't feel it yet,

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:36.170 align:middle line:84%
you will feel it by the
time we finish here.

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:37.670 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing
this for long enough

00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:41.390 align:middle line:84%
now to know that this is always
the outcome without exception.

00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:44.807 align:middle line:84%
When that penny drops,
there's no turning back,

00:29:44.807 --> 00:29:45.640 align:middle line:90%
and you know by now.

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:48.360 align:middle line:84%
The reason you're here-- when
you open this door to start

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.151 align:middle line:84%
researching this
knowledge and information,

00:29:50.151 --> 00:29:52.550 align:middle line:90%
it's like opening Pandora's box.

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:54.462 align:middle line:84%
There is no turning
back, and it's

00:29:54.462 --> 00:29:55.670 align:middle line:90%
the same with the philosophy.

00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:57.435 align:middle line:84%
Once you know that
there is a way out,

00:29:57.435 --> 00:29:59.310 align:middle line:84%
once you know that
there's an alternative way

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:02.740 align:middle line:84%
that we can do this, and we can
do it quickly and effectively,

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:05.430 align:middle line:84%
and create this
unimaginable abundance

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:08.410 align:middle line:84%
that, in most of our
lives, most of our minds,

00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:12.060 align:middle line:84%
we can't imagine because of
the system we're all born into.

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:13.740 align:middle line:84%
We can't imagine the
kind of abundance

00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:14.950 align:middle line:90%
we're going to be creating.

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:16.590 align:middle line:84%
We're already
starting that process.

00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:17.923 align:middle line:90%
We're not just talking about it.

00:30:17.923 --> 00:30:19.850 align:middle line:90%
We're doing it already.

00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:22.490 align:middle line:84%
When that penny drops, it
becomes that euphoric feeling

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:24.448 align:middle line:84%
that you just want to go
out and tell everyone.

00:30:24.448 --> 00:30:27.730 align:middle line:84%
So if we continue doing
this or allowing the system

00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:31.330 align:middle line:84%
to enslave us for any
longer, we are all insane.

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And I love this statement
by Albert Einstein.

00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:39.780 align:middle line:84%
It says insanity is doing the
same thing over and over again

00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:42.170 align:middle line:90%
and expecting different results.

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:45.597 align:middle line:84%
So we've been doing this
for 6,000 years at least,

00:30:45.597 --> 00:30:47.930 align:middle line:84%
and we still think we're going
to get different results.

00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:51.970 align:middle line:84%
And the clever wise asses on
television, the economists,

00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:54.599 align:middle line:84%
and all these clever people that
they keep shoving in our faces

00:30:54.599 --> 00:30:56.640 align:middle line:84%
from Harvard and all these
universities-- they've

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:59.730 align:middle line:90%
got these economic degrees.

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:02.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the word economy
should say it all.

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:05.450 align:middle line:84%
We've got to economize
on a planet of abundance.

00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:06.630 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:08.490 align:middle line:84%
Why should we
economize anything?

00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:11.610 align:middle line:84%
We should never ever have
to economize anything

00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:15.690 align:middle line:84%
in any area of our
lives that we engage in

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:18.230 align:middle line:84%
because of the planet of
abundance that we live in.

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:20.122 align:middle line:84%
So they shove
these clever people

00:31:20.122 --> 00:31:21.830 align:middle line:84%
in our face on
television, because that's

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:23.780 align:middle line:84%
the medium they use,
and they tell us

00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:24.980 align:middle line:84%
how they're going to
solve the problems.

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:26.270 align:middle line:90%
Oh, we're going to budget here.

00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:27.645 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
change the budget,

00:31:27.645 --> 00:31:31.470 align:middle line:84%
and they show you these very
complicated charts and numbers,

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:32.720 align:middle line:90%
and they throw numbers around.

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:35.310 align:middle line:84%
They use language that most
people don't understand

00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:37.360 align:middle line:84%
because they come
from economic school

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:40.190 align:middle line:90%
and bachelor of commerce.

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:40.990 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:42.680 align:middle line:90%
That's really impressive, buddy.

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:45.425 align:middle line:84%
And they share these big words,
and everybody just looks them

00:31:45.425 --> 00:31:46.225 align:middle line:90%
and go, wow.

00:31:46.225 --> 00:31:47.520 align:middle line:90%
They sound very intelligent.

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:48.880 align:middle line:84%
They must know what
they're talking about.

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:49.680 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:53.000 align:middle line:84%
We cannot continue doing this
and think we're going to solve

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.560 align:middle line:84%
the problems with the tools
that created the problems,

00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:58.680 align:middle line:84%
and money is the tool
that created the problem.

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:03.710 align:middle line:84%
So we have deal with
this issue of money.

00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:06.560 align:middle line:84%
We can't use money
to solve the problem.

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:09.970 align:middle line:84%
We have to get rid of the
money to solve the problem,

00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:12.340 align:middle line:84%
and how we're going to do
that is going to come out

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:14.820 align:middle line:90%
in the next few hours.

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:20.850 align:middle line:84%
So we have to recognize
that the system may not

00:32:20.850 --> 00:32:26.110 align:middle line:84%
collapse because it's upheld
by these magicians that run,

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:30.450 align:middle line:84%
and they create magic with
the economic policies.

00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:32.720 align:middle line:84%
So we've got to realize
that the system is broken.

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:34.110 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:35.570 align:middle line:90%
It cannot be fixed.

00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:39.370 align:middle line:84%
Certainly not be fixed with the
tools that created the problem.

00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:42.040 align:middle line:84%
So we have to find a
new system, and that's

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:44.440 align:middle line:84%
what this is all about--
finding a new system that

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:46.100 align:middle line:90%
can replace the system.

00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:50.520 align:middle line:84%
Not confront, just put
alongside of it and say,

00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:52.000 align:middle line:90%
OK, we're no longer doing this.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.592 align:middle line:90%
We're going to now do that.

00:32:53.592 --> 00:32:55.050 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
confront anybody.

00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:58.410 align:middle line:84%
Just start doing the new thing,
going in the new direction.

00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:02.130 align:middle line:84%
So once again, let's
quote our friend Albert.

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:05.380 align:middle line:10%
"We cannot solve our problems
with the same thinking used

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:09.470 align:middle line:10%
when we created the problem,"
and that gets to this thing

00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:14.380 align:middle line:10%
called UBUNTU and
Contributionism,

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:18.350 align:middle line:10%
because in this system
this ancient knowledge,

00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:21.570 align:middle line:10%
ancient wisdom lie all the
answers we're looking for.

00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:24.310 align:middle line:84%
So we're going back thousands
and thousands of years

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:27.560 align:middle line:84%
to relearn from the ancients
what we have forgotten

00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:30.920 align:middle line:84%
and what's been beaten out of
us over the last 6,000 years,

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:32.560 align:middle line:90%
especially.

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:34.530 align:middle line:84%
The foundation and
the fundamentals

00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:39.090 align:middle line:84%
of this information
I put into the book

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:41.610 align:middle line:84%
called UBUNTU
Contributionism," which

00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:44.930 align:middle line:84%
was subtitled "A Blueprint
for Human Prosperity."

00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:48.610 align:middle line:10%
And to my surprise,
this book has now

00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:52.660 align:middle line:10%
been translated into
a number of languages.

00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:57.560 align:middle line:10%
Spanish, French, and Zulu are
in translation at the moment,

00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:01.480 align:middle line:10%
and more languages are
coming-- Chinese, and Russian,

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:06.850 align:middle line:10%
and who knows what-- I
forget the other languages.

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:09.219 align:middle line:84%
So it's completely
out of control.

00:34:09.219 --> 00:34:12.690 align:middle line:84%
I certainly did not set
out to start a movement.

00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:15.870 align:middle line:84%
So if you think I'm sitting here
because I've planned this, no.

00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:17.389 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea why
I'm sitting here,

00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:19.030 align:middle line:90%
why I'm sharing this with you.

00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:20.739 align:middle line:90%
Somehow it just happened.

00:34:20.739 --> 00:34:24.600 align:middle line:84%
I just realized that we don't
need money a long time ago,

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:27.606 align:middle line:84%
and I started talking about
a world without money in 2005

00:34:27.606 --> 00:34:29.955 align:middle line:84%
while I was writing
"Slow Species of God"

00:34:29.955 --> 00:34:31.580 align:middle line:84%
when I suddenly
realized in my research

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:33.699 align:middle line:84%
into origins of human
kind-- I realize

00:34:33.699 --> 00:34:36.060 align:middle line:84%
that we lived without
money for much longer

00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:37.551 align:middle line:90%
than we've lived with money.

00:34:37.551 --> 00:34:39.300 align:middle line:84%
So that's what when I
started saying, wow,

00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:40.687 align:middle line:90%
how is that possible?

00:34:40.687 --> 00:34:42.520 align:middle line:84%
Because everybody thinks,
oh, we need money.

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:43.949 align:middle line:84%
Without money, how are
we going to survive?

00:34:43.949 --> 00:34:45.199 align:middle line:90%
How are we going to buy stuff?

00:34:45.199 --> 00:34:47.730 align:middle line:90%


00:34:47.730 --> 00:34:51.630 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's that
knee jerk reaction,

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:53.440 align:middle line:84%
and I realized that
for thousands of years

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:55.980 align:middle line:84%
people lived very happily,
and they lived well,

00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:57.150 align:middle line:90%
and they were knowledgeable.

00:34:57.150 --> 00:34:59.820 align:middle line:84%
They could do things, and they
built incredible structures

00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:03.120 align:middle line:84%
like the pyramids and
ancient structures,

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:06.170 align:middle line:84%
and they did all
this without money.

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:09.280 align:middle line:84%
And so I started thinking
about what would it

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:12.660 align:middle line:84%
be if we removed
money from the system?

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And slowly but surely
it started evolving,

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:18.500 align:middle line:84%
and the more solutions I
found for the basic questions,

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:22.200 align:middle line:84%
the easier it became to answer
more complicated questions.

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:24.680 align:middle line:84%
How is this going to work
in a world without money?

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you, within the
first three to six months,

00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:31.050 align:middle line:84%
it became like a
drug where I couldn't

00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:32.250 align:middle line:90%
stop thinking about it.

00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:34.169 align:middle line:84%
It was consuming me
completely, and I

00:35:34.169 --> 00:35:35.960 align:middle line:84%
couldn't stop thinking,
well-- so I started

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:37.900 align:middle line:84%
thinking about this, and that,
and how would prostitution

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:39.220 align:middle line:90%
work in a world without money.

00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:40.020 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:43.416 align:middle line:84%
And all these different
kind of things.

00:35:43.416 --> 00:35:45.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm not kidding you, because
then your brain starts

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:48.400 align:middle line:84%
to play all these tricks
on you, and you realize

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.290 align:middle line:84%
that the more questions
you've answered

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:53.480 align:middle line:84%
the easier it is to answer
the following questions.

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And before you know,
it's so simple.

00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:58.660 align:middle line:84%
People can throw
anything at you.

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Any problem that we have
in the world today gets

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:06.250 align:middle line:84%
answered and solved
virtually instantly

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:08.270 align:middle line:84%
if you just remove
money from the system.

00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:13.140 align:middle line:84%
So this is why, I
guess, I started

00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:15.700 align:middle line:84%
formulating this philosophy,
and it just grew, and grew,

00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:18.410 align:middle line:84%
and grew, and the UBUNTU
movement came out of it,

00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:20.390 align:middle line:84%
because I realized that
this ancient knowledge

00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:23.280 align:middle line:84%
and philosophy is
enshrined and encoded

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:25.920 align:middle line:90%
in this word called UBUNTU.

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:28.560 align:middle line:84%
So what is UBUNTU and
what does it mean?

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, like I
mentioned earlier, it

00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:32.700 align:middle line:84%
is an ancient
African philosophy,

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:34.910 align:middle line:84%
but it's not just an
ancient African philosophy.

00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:37.250 align:middle line:84%
It's an ancient
global philosophy.

00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:40.880 align:middle line:84%
All ancient cultures
have the same philosophy,

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:43.940 align:middle line:84%
and in a nutshell, it means
unity within community.

00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:46.570 align:middle line:84%
That's probably
the best definition

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:51.460 align:middle line:84%
that I've been able to find
for this word, UBUNTU-- unity

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:54.530 align:middle line:84%
within community where everybody
works towards the greatest

00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:56.990 align:middle line:84%
benefit of all in
their community

00:36:56.990 --> 00:37:01.190 align:middle line:84%
by contributing their
talents and their skills

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:03.770 align:middle line:84%
to be used and
available to everyone.

00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:07.630 align:middle line:84%
Not just for you, or you, or
you a one to one exchange.

00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:09.370 align:middle line:90%
It's a one to many exchange.

00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:12.100 align:middle line:84%
Whatever I do is
available to everyone

00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:16.070 align:middle line:84%
to benefit from, and therein
lies the fundamental difference

00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:19.010 align:middle line:84%
about many of the
other ideas of barter,

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:21.990 align:middle line:84%
and trade, and exchange
that some people are

00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:23.590 align:middle line:90%
out there sharing.

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:25.920 align:middle line:84%
So the Contributionism
philosophy

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:30.030 align:middle line:84%
is just a modern word
that I came up with

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:34.170 align:middle line:84%
to try and describe this ancient
philosophy called UBUNTU,

00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:37.070 align:middle line:84%
and I've made up this
word because of the fact

00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:40.300 align:middle line:84%
that you're contributing
your skills.

00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:42.130 align:middle line:90%
It's your contribution.

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:46.480 align:middle line:84%
So although in the
beginning there

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:48.450 align:middle line:90%
was many debates about the ism.

00:37:48.450 --> 00:37:52.194 align:middle line:84%
It's another Contributionism,
and I was quite opposed to it

00:37:52.194 --> 00:37:53.860 align:middle line:84%
to start out with,
but somehow it stuck.

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:55.234 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't come
up with a better

00:37:55.234 --> 00:37:57.370 align:middle line:90%
word than Contributionism.

00:37:57.370 --> 00:37:59.780 align:middle line:84%
So the way I'd like
to describe it--

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:01.700 align:middle line:84%
it is like no other
ism we've ever

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:05.830 align:middle line:84%
had before, because
all the other isms have

00:38:05.830 --> 00:38:07.540 align:middle line:90%
money attached to them.

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:10.460 align:middle line:84%
This is the only ism that I
know of where we remove money

00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:14.070 align:middle line:84%
from the system, so it
becomes a Contributionism,

00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:17.870 align:middle line:84%
a whole new way of looking at
how we co-exist, and share,

00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:20.930 align:middle line:84%
and create abundance
for ourselves,

00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:22.760 align:middle line:90%
and abundance beyond belief.

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:27.120 align:middle line:84%
So it is really proposing
a world without money.

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:28.760 align:middle line:90%
This is what it's all about.

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:30.620 align:middle line:90%
We have to get rid of the money.

00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:33.180 align:middle line:84%
We cannot beat about the
bush, or be nice about it,

00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:34.810 align:middle line:90%
or be polite about it.

00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:36.150 align:middle line:90%
Money is the problem.

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:38.210 align:middle line:84%
We've got to get rid
of it, because those

00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:40.460 align:middle line:84%
that control the
money will continue

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:43.520 align:middle line:84%
using that tool as a
tool of enslavement,

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:45.380 align:middle line:84%
and as long as they've
got the controlling

00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:47.110 align:middle line:84%
power over this
tool, there's very

00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:49.380 align:middle line:84%
little we're going to
be able to do about it.

00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:53.000 align:middle line:84%
So if we don't use
the money, they

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.210 align:middle line:90%
have no more control over us.

00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:57.120 align:middle line:90%
It really is that simple.

00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:00.950 align:middle line:84%
If we don't need their money,
how can they control us?

00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:04.770 align:middle line:84%
So just let me plant
that seed with you.

00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:07.730 align:middle line:84%
If you don't need their
money to get on with anything

00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:10.230 align:middle line:84%
you do in life, whether it's
creating technology, or growing

00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:14.490 align:middle line:84%
food, or building your
homes, or creating healing.

00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:16.780 align:middle line:84%
If we don't need their
money-- I say their

00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:18.996 align:middle line:84%
because the money
we use is not ours.

00:39:18.996 --> 00:39:20.870 align:middle line:84%
The money in your bank
doesn't belong to you.

00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:22.434 align:middle line:90%
It belongs to the bank.

00:39:22.434 --> 00:39:24.100 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones that
created the money.

00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:26.030 align:middle line:84%
Even the pieces of paper
don't belong to you.

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:27.500 align:middle line:84%
You think it belongs to you
because it's in your wallet.

00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:28.940 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't belong to you.

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:31.770 align:middle line:84%
It's always belongs to
the bank, and the moment

00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:34.140 align:middle line:84%
you deposit it in the
bank it's no longer yours.

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:35.480 align:middle line:90%
It's the bank's money.

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.020 align:middle line:90%
They're holding it for you.

00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:39.990 align:middle line:84%
We're moving from a
money driven society

00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:43.010 align:middle line:84%
to a society driven by
people, their talents,

00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:46.240 align:middle line:84%
and their passion for life
where everyone contributes

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:50.250 align:middle line:84%
their natural talents or their
acquired skills to the greatest

00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:53.070 align:middle line:84%
benefit of all in
their community.

00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:55.710 align:middle line:84%
That's what we are
laying out here today.

00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:57.640 align:middle line:84%
This is the foundation
we're building

00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:03.180 align:middle line:84%
and the simple steps towards
this new world of abundance.

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:08.760 align:middle line:84%
So the five point mantra of
Contributionism something

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:09.560 align:middle line:90%
that evolved.

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's something that
evolved over a 10 year period

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.570 align:middle line:90%
or maybe a few lesser years.

00:40:16.570 --> 00:40:17.670 align:middle line:90%
No money.

00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:18.830 align:middle line:90%
No barter.

00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:20.270 align:middle line:90%
No trade.

00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:23.860 align:middle line:84%
No value attached to anything
greater than anything else,

00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:25.710 align:middle line:84%
and a system where
everyone contributes

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:27.860 align:middle line:84%
their natural talents
or their acquired

00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:31.890 align:middle line:84%
skills for the greatest benefit
of all in their community.

00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:35.010 align:middle line:84%
Some people say, oh, what
happens when people first

00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:37.780 align:middle line:84%
discover us on the internet,
or they hear about UBUNTU?

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:38.580 align:middle line:90%
They, say, yeah.

00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:41.030 align:middle line:84%
They get all excited, and they
get the wrong end of the stick.

00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:43.196 align:middle line:84%
They go, ah, let's go back
to bartering and trading.

00:40:43.196 --> 00:40:45.260 align:middle line:84%
You say, no, that's not
what we're talking about.

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:48.100 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking about
bartering and trading.

00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:50.520 align:middle line:84%
It's just another
form of control.

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:53.450 align:middle line:84%
Remember, he who has
more to barter or trade

00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:55.830 align:middle line:90%
will ultimately rule the roost.

00:40:55.830 --> 00:40:59.090 align:middle line:84%
If you have more chickens
than I have whatever, then

00:40:59.090 --> 00:41:01.640 align:middle line:84%
you'll start laying
down the rules

00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:04.420 align:middle line:84%
of how things are going to work
and how much I must give you

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:05.270 align:middle line:90%
for your chickens.

00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:07.000 align:middle line:84%
That's not what
we're talking about.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.400 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about something
completely different.

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.380 align:middle line:90%
So no money.

00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:13.470 align:middle line:90%
That has to go.

00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:14.930 align:middle line:90%
No barter.

00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:16.100 align:middle line:90%
No trading of anything.

00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:16.900 align:middle line:90%
No exchanging.

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:19.240 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to do any
of that to create abundance

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:22.250 align:middle line:84%
for ourselves and no value
attached to anything.

00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:25.815 align:middle line:84%
The only reason things have
value is because we have money.

00:41:25.815 --> 00:41:28.440 align:middle line:84%
The moment you remove
money from the system,

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:33.330 align:middle line:84%
how do you ascribe value
to anything, this thing

00:41:33.330 --> 00:41:34.354 align:middle line:90%
that we have value?

00:41:34.354 --> 00:41:36.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, what do I get in
return if you give me--

00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:39.640 align:middle line:84%
if I give you a sheep,
what do I get in return?

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:42.100 align:middle line:84%
If I give you my car,
what do I get in return?

00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:44.120 align:middle line:90%
The value of my car is $10,000.

00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:46.670 align:middle line:84%
I want something of
equal value in return.

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:50.500 align:middle line:84%
That kind of thing just flies
completely out of the window

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:52.380 align:middle line:84%
once we remove money
from the system,

00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:54.760 align:middle line:84%
and again, we'll
start seeing how

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:58.610 align:middle line:84%
we can make such a claim
as we go through unlearning

00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:01.550 align:middle line:84%
all the things that are
being shoved down our throats

00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:07.260 align:middle line:84%
and encoded in our brain
through our education system.

00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And remember that this whole
thing about where everyone

00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:12.930 align:middle line:84%
contributes their
natural talents

00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:16.990 align:middle line:84%
and acquired skills for the
greater benefit of all-- we're

00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:19.830 align:middle line:90%
not just born with one talent.

00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:22.330 align:middle line:84%
Most of us are born
with many talents,

00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:24.210 align:middle line:84%
and these talents
come out of us as we

00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:27.130 align:middle line:84%
grow, as we experience
life, as we interact

00:42:27.130 --> 00:42:31.050 align:middle line:84%
with others around us, and with
nature, and animals around us.

00:42:31.050 --> 00:42:37.550 align:middle line:84%
We discover and bring to
life the other talents

00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:38.850 align:middle line:90%
that we are born with.

00:42:38.850 --> 00:42:42.790 align:middle line:84%
So we're not going to
get stuck with one talent

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:45.150 align:middle line:90%
and do one thing in our lives.

00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:48.060 align:middle line:84%
Can you see how directly
in conflict that

00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:49.680 align:middle line:90%
is with the current system?

00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:54.260 align:middle line:84%
Because today at
school we're told,

00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:56.380 align:middle line:84%
what are you going
to do for a living?

00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:58.037 align:middle line:84%
Go out there, and
study something,

00:42:58.037 --> 00:43:00.120 align:middle line:84%
and go be good at that
thing, and have that career

00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:00.940 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of your life.

00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:02.650 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to
spend doing one thing

00:43:02.650 --> 00:43:03.800 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of your life.

00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:05.500 align:middle line:90%
Are you insane?

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:08.600 align:middle line:84%
That's not part of who we are as
living breathing human beings?

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:09.750 align:middle line:90%
We're creative souls.

00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:12.900 align:middle line:84%
We are born-- the first
and most important

00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:16.540 align:middle line:84%
thing that we are born
with is to create.

00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:17.830 align:middle line:90%
We are creative souls.

00:43:17.830 --> 00:43:20.020 align:middle line:84%
We want to constantly
create from the moment we

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:23.300 align:middle line:84%
are born we make noises,
and sounds, and bubbles,

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:24.850 align:middle line:90%
and shapes with our hands.

00:43:24.850 --> 00:43:28.730 align:middle line:84%
And we draw, and so we want
to create from the moment

00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:31.410 align:middle line:84%
we come out of my
mothers' wombs,

00:43:31.410 --> 00:43:33.470 align:middle line:84%
and that gets beaten out
of us as quickly as we

00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:34.920 align:middle line:90%
send our children to school.

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:35.970 align:middle line:90%
No, you can't do that.

00:43:35.970 --> 00:43:37.120 align:middle line:84%
How are you going to
survive doing that?

00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:37.920 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no.

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:39.050 align:middle line:90%
You can't do that.

00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:41.820 align:middle line:84%
Find something to do
that'll earn you a living,

00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:43.800 align:middle line:84%
and that's where the
indoctrination begins.

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:46.494 align:middle line:84%
From the earliest of
ages, our children

00:43:46.494 --> 00:43:47.910 align:middle line:84%
are made to believe
that they have

00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:52.380 align:middle line:84%
to earn a living, to earn
money to live on a planet

00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:54.814 align:middle line:84%
they're born on,
that we are born on.

00:43:54.814 --> 00:43:56.230 align:middle line:84%
We're the only
species-- remember,

00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:59.830 align:middle line:84%
the only species that has
to earn money on a planet

00:43:59.830 --> 00:44:02.980 align:middle line:90%
that we are born on.

00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:05.780 align:middle line:84%
Just that alone is
just an insane thought,

00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:08.670 align:middle line:84%
so clearly something is
wrong with this entire system

00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:11.920 align:middle line:84%
and the way how money was
injected into our reality

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:16.400 align:middle line:84%
so deeply into our subconscious
that we believe it's OK.

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:18.551 align:middle line:84%
Most of us think that
money is part of life.

00:44:18.551 --> 00:44:19.550 align:middle line:90%
It's just the way it is.

00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:21.590 align:middle line:90%
No, that's not the way it is.

00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:24.570 align:middle line:84%
That's the way that we've been
indoctrinated, and lied to,

00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:28.544 align:middle line:84%
and manipulated into believing
that that's how it is.

00:44:28.544 --> 00:44:32.030 align:middle line:10%
So we have to deal
with the issue of money

00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:37.840 align:middle line:10%
and beautiful statement from
Bob Marley. "Money is numbers,

00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:39.320 align:middle line:10%
and numbers never end.

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:41.000 align:middle line:10%
If it takes money
to make you happy,

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.930 align:middle line:10%
your search for happiness
will never end."

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:45.060 align:middle line:84%
This is when you get
beautiful statements like this

00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:47.210 align:middle line:84%
from people of
all walks of life,

00:44:47.210 --> 00:44:49.840 align:middle line:84%
and even politicians
sometimes unwittingly

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:53.830 align:middle line:84%
give us these pearls
of wisdom when they not

00:44:53.830 --> 00:44:56.985 align:middle line:84%
realize they're being filmed,
or someone is listening to them

00:44:56.985 --> 00:45:00.180 align:middle line:90%
to quote them later.

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:04.760 align:middle line:84%
So the other interesting
thing about the UBUNTU message

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:07.110 align:middle line:84%
is that, like I said,
all ancient cultures

00:45:07.110 --> 00:45:11.070 align:middle line:84%
around the world echo
the same philosophy.

00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:14.770 align:middle line:84%
And in Native
American Cherokee--

00:45:14.770 --> 00:45:17.350 align:middle line:84%
we actually use this as
part of the UBUNTU slogan

00:45:17.350 --> 00:45:20.600 align:middle line:84%
to blend the ancient
philosophy across the African

00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:22.330 align:middle line:90%
and the American continents.

00:45:22.330 --> 00:45:24.200 align:middle line:84%
So we use the
Cherokee statement,

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:27.620 align:middle line:84%
if it's not good for
everyone, it's no good at all.

00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:29.240 align:middle line:90%
Unity within community.

00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:33.660 align:middle line:84%
I do what I do for the benefit
of everyone in my community,

00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:37.190 align:middle line:90%
and let everybody do the same.

00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And you can see how
quickly this abundance just

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:44.390 align:middle line:84%
explodes beyond our current
levels of comprehension.

00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:47.790 align:middle line:84%
So what we find in
the world today,

00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:51.690 align:middle line:84%
every day we face millions
of problems daily,

00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:55.180 align:middle line:84%
and we're told by leaders
that it's not easy.

00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:57.160 align:middle line:90%
The problems are complicated.

00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:59.600 align:middle line:84%
It's not easy to
solve the problems

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:03.670 align:middle line:84%
and that our government
is doing the best I can.

00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And they constantly tell
us all this nonsense,

00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:10.700 align:middle line:84%
and most of the time most
of us-- I guess somehow we

00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:11.520 align:middle line:90%
believe it.

00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:14.522 align:middle line:84%
I don't if believe it or
we just have no other way

00:46:14.522 --> 00:46:16.980 align:middle line:84%
of responding because how do
you respond to your government

00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:18.854 align:middle line:84%
if they tell you we're
doing the best we can.

00:46:18.854 --> 00:46:19.700 align:middle line:90%
Say, no, you're not.

00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:20.950 align:middle line:90%
So how do you respond to them?

00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:22.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can't really
respond to them.

00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:24.000 align:middle line:84%
You have no access
to your government,

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.940 align:middle line:84%
and these are our
servants, so these

00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:27.860 align:middle line:84%
are the people--
politicians should

00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:30.260 align:middle line:84%
be standing on every
corner of every city

00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:32.790 align:middle line:84%
and saying to us every day
what can we do for you, sir?

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:34.520 align:middle line:84%
Or what can we do
for you, ma'am?

00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:35.620 align:middle line:90%
And that doesn't happen.

00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:39.610 align:middle line:84%
So these are the servants
we appoint into positions

00:46:39.610 --> 00:46:43.330 align:middle line:84%
of authority so that they can
serve us and do what we want,

00:46:43.330 --> 00:46:45.670 align:middle line:84%
do what's best for
us, and they've just

00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:47.365 align:middle line:90%
turned this whole thing around.

00:46:47.365 --> 00:46:49.430 align:middle line:90%
It's just spectacular.

00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:51.380 align:middle line:90%
So these are all lies.

00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:55.010 align:middle line:84%
The answers and the solutions
are very, very simple,

00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:58.520 align:middle line:84%
and you know-- and by
the time we finish here,

00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:00.894 align:middle line:84%
you will all understand,
and we will all understand,

00:47:00.894 --> 00:47:02.560 align:middle line:84%
and everyone that
watches this recording

00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:05.010 align:middle line:84%
will know how simple
the answers are.

00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:07.940 align:middle line:84%
Our farmers, our scientists, our
engineers have the solutions.

00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:11.050 align:middle line:84%
Ordinary people on the street
know what the solutions are.

00:47:11.050 --> 00:47:12.890 align:middle line:84%
They know how to
solve the problems.

00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:16.300 align:middle line:84%
The children in primary school
know how to solve the problems.

00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:17.720 align:middle line:90%
Do yourself a favor.

00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:20.260 align:middle line:84%
Ask a bunch of five-year-olds
and six-year-olds

00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:22.420 align:middle line:84%
what they would do to
solve certain problems,

00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:24.980 align:middle line:84%
and you'll get the most amazing
wisdom you've ever heard.

00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:28.320 align:middle line:84%
So we're coming to the
end of the first hour,

00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:30.780 align:middle line:84%
and I'd like to just
open it up to anybody

00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:36.760 align:middle line:84%
who wants to raise, or make
a statement, or as something.

00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:40.910 align:middle line:84%
>>When I began reading
this work and similar work

00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:45.060 align:middle line:84%
with my western American
capitalist brain,

00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:47.880 align:middle line:84%
it started screaming
this is communism.

00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:50.900 align:middle line:90%
This is bad.

00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:56.300 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that communism
is all about dividing things up.

00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:59.585 align:middle line:84%
When I turned my attention from
how do we divide things up,

00:47:59.585 --> 00:48:00.960 align:middle line:84%
and how do we get
enough, and how

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:06.080 align:middle line:84%
do wwe-- which is an enemy
based frame of reference--

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:09.000 align:middle line:90%
to how do we create?

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.770 align:middle line:84%
How the distribution happens--
it doesn't become irrelevant.

00:48:12.770 --> 00:48:14.800 align:middle line:90%
It becomes natural.

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:17.060 align:middle line:84%
Looking at it from
money is one direction.

00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:18.780 align:middle line:84%
Looking at it from
Contributionism

00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:21.420 align:middle line:90%
is, how do we create?

00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And once we start creating,
the rest of the things

00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:28.100 align:middle line:84%
happen, because we're humans,
and we're problem solvers.

00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:30.470 align:middle line:84%
>>Thanks for sharing your
experience, because that's

00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:33.030 align:middle line:84%
the same experience so
many other people have,

00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:35.360 align:middle line:84%
and hopefully that'll
give many others that

00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:37.940 align:middle line:84%
watch this recording--
give them some peace

00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:40.480 align:middle line:84%
to know that they're not the
only one's experiencing that.

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
this journey that you

00:48:43.350 --> 00:48:46.770 align:middle line:84%
enter, that you embark on
when you start embracing

00:48:46.770 --> 00:48:48.780 align:middle line:84%
and start to digest
this philosophy,

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:51.720 align:middle line:84%
because it is-- it flies
in the face of everything

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:52.730 align:middle line:90%
we've been told.

00:48:52.730 --> 00:48:53.780 align:middle line:90%
It's not communism.

00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:54.710 align:middle line:90%
It's not fascism.

00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:55.900 align:middle line:90%
It's not capitalism.

00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:57.050 align:middle line:90%
It's not socialism.

00:48:57.050 --> 00:49:00.910 align:middle line:84%
It's not like anything
else that we've been given

00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:03.540 align:middle line:84%
or that has been imposed
on us in the past.

00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:07.260 align:middle line:84%
It's a whole new ism that
we've never experienced before.

00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:08.940 align:middle line:90%
>>It's a whole new level of ism.

00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:11.100 align:middle line:90%
>>It's a humanism.

00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:14.780 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, but what changes
is that we don't have

00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:18.100 align:middle line:90%
to have all the answers now.

00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:18.960 align:middle line:90%
>>Very good.

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:20.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm so glad you said that.

00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>>There is a driver in the
money economic system that says,

00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:26.910 align:middle line:84%
and you have to know
what you can't know.

00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:31.220 align:middle line:84%
You have to know the future now,
and you have to make decisions,

00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:33.820 align:middle line:84%
and you're only OK
if you choose right,

00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:35.910 align:middle line:84%
because if you
choose wrong, then

00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:38.380 align:middle line:84%
you were wrong for
choosing at all.

00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think we
have all the answers yet.

00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:44.110 align:middle line:84%
I don't think the solutions
are somehow printed anywhere,

00:49:44.110 --> 00:49:45.350 align:middle line:90%
including the book.

00:49:45.350 --> 00:49:46.150 align:middle line:90%
>>Of course.

00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:49.920 align:middle line:84%
>>The answer is the process
that we come together and create

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:51.820 align:middle line:90%
real time and alive.

00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:53.720 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you so much for that.

00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:57.720 align:middle line:84%
I really appreciate you
raising those points.

00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:01.770 align:middle line:84%
What I'd like to add to that is
exactly that, that what we're

00:50:01.770 --> 00:50:05.770 align:middle line:84%
dealing with here today
and over this workshop--

00:50:05.770 --> 00:50:07.100 align:middle line:90%
this is just the beginning.

00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:08.840 align:middle line:90%
This is just a foundation.

00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:11.771 align:middle line:84%
I don't have all the answers,
and I'll never ever claim

00:50:11.771 --> 00:50:14.020 align:middle line:84%
to have all the answers, but
what we're doing is we're

00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:16.010 align:middle line:84%
putting into place
the cornerstones,

00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:19.630 align:middle line:84%
the foundation from which all
the other answers will come.

00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:21.390 align:middle line:84%
What we do-- by the
end of this workshop,

00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:24.700 align:middle line:84%
we're going to throw out all the
possible answers and questions

00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:27.089 align:middle line:84%
you have about a
world without money,

00:50:27.089 --> 00:50:28.380 align:middle line:90%
all the things that niggle you.

00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:29.040 align:middle line:90%
How is this going to work?

00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:30.160 align:middle line:90%
How is that going to work?

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:34.220 align:middle line:84%
Right now you'll see very soon
the frequently asked questions

00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:36.730 align:middle line:84%
that I've had thousands and
thousands from people all over

00:50:36.730 --> 00:50:37.530 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:50:37.530 --> 00:50:39.620 align:middle line:84%
You'll be able to answer each
one and one of those questions

00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:40.260 align:middle line:90%
yourself.

00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:41.718 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
answer it for you.

00:50:41.718 --> 00:50:43.231 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
answer it yourself.

00:50:43.231 --> 00:50:44.730 align:middle line:84%
It's pointless me
answer it for you.

00:50:44.730 --> 00:50:46.010 align:middle line:84%
If you can't answer
it yourself, it

00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:47.950 align:middle line:84%
means you haven't
internalized this knowledge,

00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:51.400 align:middle line:84%
or this information isn't
resonating within you yet.

00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:53.190 align:middle line:84%
It's got to come
from within you.

00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:54.440 align:middle line:90%
Then you've embraced it.

00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:55.300 align:middle line:90%
Then you understand.

00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:57.140 align:middle line:84%
Once you can answer
the questions,

00:50:57.140 --> 00:50:59.460 align:middle line:84%
then anyone can throw
anything at you.

00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:00.477 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:51:00.477 --> 00:51:02.060 align:middle line:84%
You've then undergone
the same process

00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:06.140 align:middle line:84%
that I've undergone, that
Joan has undergone, as well.

00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And it is the most liberating
process anyone can go through.

00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:11.670 align:middle line:90%
It is a rebirth.

00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:14.150 align:middle line:84%
It truly is a
rebirthing process.

00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:16.940 align:middle line:84%
You wanted to say-- somebody
wanted to say something here?

00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:20.575 align:middle line:84%
>>I want to let you know I think
I downloaded your book when

00:51:20.575 --> 00:51:24.810 align:middle line:84%
it was free off the internet,
printed it, read it,

00:51:24.810 --> 00:51:27.790 align:middle line:84%
got seriously upset
and confused by it.

00:51:27.790 --> 00:51:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very interested
in learning more and more

00:51:30.730 --> 00:51:33.030 align:middle line:84%
about what you're
sharing, because I'm

00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:35.740 align:middle line:84%
sure for everybody
else also it bangs

00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:40.680 align:middle line:84%
into our mind in so many
ways, but I would certainly

00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:43.090 align:middle line:84%
like to see a better
world, and I'd

00:51:43.090 --> 00:51:45.500 align:middle line:84%
like to see a lot more people
sharing with each other

00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:48.400 align:middle line:84%
and making the world a better
place, which is what it sounds

00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:50.720 align:middle line:90%
like you're just doing.

00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:51.520 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you.

00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:52.390 align:middle line:90%
>>UBUNTU.

00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:53.480 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you very much.

00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:54.280 align:middle line:90%
>>You're welcome.

00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:57.300 align:middle line:84%
>>And like I said, by the
time we're finished here,

00:51:57.300 --> 00:52:00.640 align:middle line:84%
I trust you'll be able to answer
all the questions that you

00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:05.570 align:middle line:84%
have, but to add to that we
don't need all the answers.

00:52:05.570 --> 00:52:07.560 align:middle line:84%
How could we possibly
think we have

00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:09.910 align:middle line:84%
the answers for
future communities

00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:12.660 align:middle line:84%
that govern themselves with
their own set of problems,

00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:15.220 align:middle line:84%
with their own
unique situations?

00:52:15.220 --> 00:52:19.670 align:middle line:84%
Those future communities
or their own future

00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:22.190 align:middle line:84%
challenges-- how could
we possibly claim

00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:24.620 align:middle line:84%
that we have all the answer
s to those future challenges

00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:25.420 align:middle line:90%
and problems?

00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:26.390 align:middle line:90%
We can't do that.

00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:28.480 align:middle line:84%
What we can do is
put it into place.

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:32.130 align:middle line:84%
The future communities will
solve their own problems,

00:52:32.130 --> 00:52:35.380 align:middle line:84%
because we are moving away
from this hierarchical central

00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:39.790 align:middle line:84%
government that shoves all
the laws, and rules, and laws

00:52:39.790 --> 00:52:41.040 align:middle line:90%
down our throats.

00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:42.280 align:middle line:90%
That flies out the window.

00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:46.150 align:middle line:84%
We're no longer going to bow
down to that kind of control.

00:52:46.150 --> 00:52:49.036 align:middle line:84%
People start living freely
in their own communities,

00:52:49.036 --> 00:52:51.160 align:middle line:84%
governing themselves in
their own communities based

00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:55.940 align:middle line:84%
on their needs on a day to
day, hour by hour basis.

00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:57.602 align:middle line:90%
Someone else?

00:52:57.602 --> 00:52:58.660 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you, Michael.

00:52:58.660 --> 00:52:59.846 align:middle line:90%
Richard Porter here.

00:52:59.846 --> 00:53:01.220 align:middle line:84%
When I was in the
doctor's office

00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:03.390 align:middle line:84%
and straightening all the
magazines on the table,

00:53:03.390 --> 00:53:08.310 align:middle line:84%
I wrote an article
about, are you OCD?

00:53:08.310 --> 00:53:10.990 align:middle line:84%
Did you just straighten
all the magazines

00:53:10.990 --> 00:53:13.520 align:middle line:84%
on the table in your
doctor's office?

00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:16.230 align:middle line:84%
At which point, I put the
magazine and went, oh crap.

00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:17.795 align:middle line:90%
>>And ruffled them all up.

00:53:17.795 --> 00:53:20.370 align:middle line:90%


00:53:20.370 --> 00:53:22.910 align:middle line:84%
>>Anecdotal, I'll
tie it together.

00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:26.290 align:middle line:84%
For a person like
myself-- and I think

00:53:26.290 --> 00:53:28.990 align:middle line:84%
what most people-- the reason
they gravitate towards money,

00:53:28.990 --> 00:53:32.640 align:middle line:84%
they gravitate towards
the current system--

00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:35.400 align:middle line:90%
is that it proposes to be neat.

00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:36.970 align:middle line:90%
It's organized.

00:53:36.970 --> 00:53:38.310 align:middle line:90%
It's clean.

00:53:38.310 --> 00:53:41.770 align:middle line:84%
The whole philosophy
of this ain't neat,

00:53:41.770 --> 00:53:44.400 align:middle line:84%
all the rules aren't written,
all the rules that you know

00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:46.819 align:middle line:84%
are true, the one thing
you can know absolutely

00:53:46.819 --> 00:53:49.110 align:middle line:84%
is that they're all wrong--
it's not going to be clean.

00:53:49.110 --> 00:53:50.068 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be messy.

00:53:50.068 --> 00:53:52.074 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
disorganized, and if you

00:53:52.074 --> 00:53:53.490 align:middle line:84%
aren't making
mistakes, you aren't

00:53:53.490 --> 00:53:55.320 align:middle line:90%
trying enough different things.

00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:58.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's really, really
tough for the average person

00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:00.439 align:middle line:84%
to get around, let
alone someone who's

00:54:00.439 --> 00:54:02.480 align:middle line:84%
been conditioned by the
society that everything's

00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:03.510 align:middle line:90%
supposed to be neat, organized.

00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:05.176 align:middle line:84%
You're supposed to
have all the answers.

00:54:05.176 --> 00:54:07.160 align:middle line:84%
You're supposed to
know the future.

00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:09.230 align:middle line:84%
You're supposed to be
able to read minds.

00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:10.430 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:12.124 align:middle line:84%
>>Richard, what I'd
like to say to you

00:54:12.124 --> 00:54:14.790 align:middle line:84%
is interesting, because what I'm
reading from what you're saying

00:54:14.790 --> 00:54:20.200 align:middle line:84%
is that what comes to mind
is that a world without money

00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:22.920 align:middle line:90%
could be seen as disorganized.

00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:24.770 align:middle line:90%
>>It is absolutely chaotic.

00:54:24.770 --> 00:54:27.520 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, and you'll find
that that is not the case

00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:28.520 align:middle line:90%
as we work through this.

00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:30.290 align:middle line:90%
It is actually the opposite.

00:54:30.290 --> 00:54:33.130 align:middle line:84%
It is far more organized
without much effort.

00:54:33.130 --> 00:54:34.544 align:middle line:90%
It's like you said.

00:54:34.544 --> 00:54:36.210 align:middle line:84%
It's because we no
longer start worrying

00:54:36.210 --> 00:54:39.260 align:middle line:84%
about how to share, and
distribute, and apportion

00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:43.490 align:middle line:84%
things to how-- the natural
order of things takes control

00:54:43.490 --> 00:54:46.450 align:middle line:84%
and takes over, and
how we automatically

00:54:46.450 --> 00:54:48.360 align:middle line:84%
step into our roles
as participants

00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:51.360 align:middle line:84%
in our communities, and
you'll find that the moment we

00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:53.440 align:middle line:84%
start talking about
the how's, how

00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:55.960 align:middle line:84%
the implementation of
this world without money,

00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:59.670 align:middle line:84%
you'll see how the
natural order sets in,

00:54:59.670 --> 00:55:03.440 align:middle line:84%
rather than the synthetically
imposed order that

00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:04.910 align:middle line:90%
controls our lives.

00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And that is, in itself, a huge
liberating thing to overcome.

00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:12.384 align:middle line:84%
It's actually one of the 13
most frequently asked questions

00:55:12.384 --> 00:55:13.800 align:middle line:84%
that you raised
there, which we're

00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:16.640 align:middle line:84%
going to deal with in great
detail so that each one of you

00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:18.860 align:middle line:84%
can answer that question
from within yourself

00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:21.550 align:middle line:84%
and not me telling you
what the answers are,

00:55:21.550 --> 00:55:26.470 align:middle line:84%
but I know that we've got one
more question or statement.

00:55:26.470 --> 00:55:27.480 align:middle line:90%
>>Selena here.

00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:30.230 align:middle line:84%
As a rather young individual, I
remember going through school,

00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:32.480 align:middle line:84%
and I remember the things
that they tried to teach us.

00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And in third grade and
even first grade even,

00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:36.890 align:middle line:84%
I remembered them showing
us videos and trying

00:55:36.890 --> 00:55:40.360 align:middle line:84%
to teach us for months at a time
that-- what would happen back

00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:42.164 align:middle line:90%
then if they didn't have money?

00:55:42.164 --> 00:55:44.580 align:middle line:84%
And they say that there was
some sort of bartering system,

00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:46.230 align:middle line:84%
that they would trade
things, and they

00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:48.870 align:middle line:84%
tried to teach us how
you would constantly

00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:50.689 align:middle line:84%
go on and on trying
to trade another thing

00:55:50.689 --> 00:55:52.980 align:middle line:84%
for another thing, and trying
to go on and on as if you

00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:54.335 align:middle line:90%
said it would be unorganized.

00:55:54.335 --> 00:55:57.024 align:middle line:84%
And they're trying to push that
on us and show us, oh, yeah.

00:55:57.024 --> 00:55:58.815 align:middle line:84%
There's no way you can
do it without money.

00:55:58.815 --> 00:55:59.970 align:middle line:90%
>>It's insane, isn't it?

00:55:59.970 --> 00:56:01.140 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, they try
to really-- they

00:56:01.140 --> 00:56:02.330 align:middle line:90%
try to teach at a young age.

00:56:02.330 --> 00:56:05.970 align:middle line:84%
So when we're young,
it's almost instinctual

00:56:05.970 --> 00:56:08.510 align:middle line:84%
to look up to our adult
figures, and when they tell us

00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:11.920 align:middle line:84%
these things, we trust
them, and we figured

00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:13.400 align:middle line:90%
that, oh, they must be right.

00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:15.567 align:middle line:84%
This must be the way I'm
probably supposed to think.

00:56:15.567 --> 00:56:17.191 align:middle line:84%
And when you try to
say it differently,

00:56:17.191 --> 00:56:19.460 align:middle line:84%
they tell you, no, that's
not right, even the way

00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:21.241 align:middle line:84%
they try to get us
to think nowadays.

00:56:21.241 --> 00:56:23.740 align:middle line:84%
With math they want us to write
it down instead of coming up

00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:25.580 align:middle line:90%
with our brain instantly.

00:56:25.580 --> 00:56:27.960 align:middle line:84%
So they're trying to take
away even radical thinking

00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:28.890 align:middle line:90%
on its own.

00:56:28.890 --> 00:56:32.530 align:middle line:84%
>>You're bringing up
one of the cornerstones

00:56:32.530 --> 00:56:34.580 align:middle line:84%
of this philosophy,
and that's education.

00:56:34.580 --> 00:56:37.450 align:middle line:84%
We're going to spend quite
a bit of time on education

00:56:37.450 --> 00:56:40.010 align:middle line:84%
and how we need to change
that dramatically as

00:56:40.010 --> 00:56:41.100 align:middle line:90%
soon as possible.

00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:45.540 align:middle line:84%
We have to unschool
and unlearn, and that

00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:47.670 align:middle line:84%
is a heavy subject
for some people

00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:50.570 align:middle line:84%
to internalize and deal with,
because so many people still

00:56:50.570 --> 00:56:52.870 align:middle line:84%
think, oh, I'm sending my
kids to a very good school.

00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:54.500 align:middle line:84%
And they think that
the more you pay

00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:56.500 align:middle line:84%
for a school, the
better the education is,

00:56:56.500 --> 00:56:57.720 align:middle line:90%
the better the child will do.

00:56:57.720 --> 00:56:58.520 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:01.200 align:middle line:84%
It is absolutely the
opposite-- in most cases,

00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:02.001 align:middle line:90%
it's the opposite.

00:57:02.001 --> 00:57:04.208 align:middle line:84%
The better the school is
that you send your child to,

00:57:04.208 --> 00:57:05.860 align:middle line:84%
the more indoctrinated
they become,

00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:08.420 align:middle line:84%
and the more they aspire to
the hierarchical structure

00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:09.580 align:middle line:90%
that we are trapped in.

00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:11.990 align:middle line:84%
So this is a very important
thing you're bringing up,

00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:15.580 align:middle line:84%
and the whole barter and
trade thing-- once again,

00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:17.120 align:middle line:84%
my research into
ancient cultures

00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:20.700 align:middle line:84%
and civilizations shows
absolutely the opposite.

00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:25.450 align:middle line:84%
Bartering and trading is
not part of human evolution.

00:57:25.450 --> 00:57:28.290 align:middle line:84%
People did not barter and
trade in ancient times.

00:57:28.290 --> 00:57:30.580 align:middle line:84%
They lived in
UBUNTU communities.

00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:32.950 align:middle line:84%
They did not need
to barter and trade.

00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:34.940 align:middle line:84%
Everything was available
for those communities

00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:37.132 align:middle line:84%
all the time because they
did it for each other.

00:57:37.132 --> 00:57:39.090 align:middle line:84%
When people started
traveling around the world,

00:57:39.090 --> 00:57:42.150 align:middle line:84%
or when somebody came
past a village, or a town,

00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:43.760 align:middle line:84%
or a settlement,
and they were given

00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:45.694 align:middle line:84%
room and food for the
night-- because that's

00:57:45.694 --> 00:57:47.610 align:middle line:84%
what people would do
because they're friendly?

00:57:47.610 --> 00:57:49.350 align:middle line:90%
>>Hospitality.

00:57:49.350 --> 00:57:51.090 align:middle line:90%
>>Hospitality.

00:57:51.090 --> 00:57:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And they would give them
room and food for the night,

00:57:53.310 --> 00:57:55.760 align:middle line:84%
and then in return,
they'd say, well, here's

00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:59.310 align:middle line:84%
one of our horses in gratitude
for your hospitality.

00:57:59.310 --> 00:58:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And then slowly but surely that
evolved into a barter and trade

00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:06.670 align:middle line:84%
system, but originally
prior to this evolving,

00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:08.430 align:middle line:90%
people did not barter and trade.

00:58:08.430 --> 00:58:11.920 align:middle line:84%
It was just a natural
sharing of everything

00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:14.250 align:middle line:84%
that we do and create
for ourselves--

00:58:14.250 --> 00:58:17.535 align:middle line:84%
a one to many exchange,
not a one to one exchange.

00:58:17.535 --> 00:58:18.910 align:middle line:84%
>>They try very
hard to make this

00:58:18.910 --> 00:58:20.390 align:middle line:90%
feel like you can't process.

00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:22.460 align:middle line:84%
You need a coin slot to
process through life,

00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:24.209 align:middle line:84%
and I'm pretty sure
none of us need a coin

00:58:24.209 --> 00:58:26.850 align:middle line:84%
slot to make science
and discoveries,

00:58:26.850 --> 00:58:29.700 align:middle line:84%
or build new roads, or make
sure that this person who's

00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:32.027 align:middle line:84%
in some sort of horrible
ill health, or in pain-- we

00:58:32.027 --> 00:58:33.610 align:middle line:84%
could just go out
there and help them.

00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:35.320 align:middle line:90%
We do not need money to act.

00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:36.160 align:middle line:90%
>>Exactly.

00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:37.590 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:58:37.590 --> 00:58:42.000 align:middle line:84%
So I think let's finish
off this first section

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.680 align:middle line:90%
by stating exactly this.

00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:49.910 align:middle line:84%
The UBUNTU Contributionism
system or new way of life is

00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:52.650 align:middle line:90%
so simple we cannot screw it up.

00:58:52.650 --> 00:58:54.890 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a really
appropriate point

00:58:54.890 --> 00:58:58.250 align:middle line:84%
the end on here,
because it follows

00:58:58.250 --> 00:59:00.160 align:middle line:90%
a natural order of things.

00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:02.450 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the sooner
we embrace it

00:59:02.450 --> 00:59:04.780 align:middle line:84%
and the deeper we
embrace it, the more

00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:07.270 align:middle line:90%
we realize how simple it is.

00:59:07.270 --> 00:59:11.020 align:middle line:84%
We can't screw it up as
much and as hard as we try.

00:59:11.020 --> 00:59:12.920 align:middle line:84%
The more problems
you throw at it,

00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:16.200 align:middle line:84%
the more it corrects
itself for the best outcome

00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:17.870 align:middle line:90%
of everyone in the community.

00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to pick up
on that when we carry on.

00:59:20.770 --> 00:59:26.220 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:26.220 --> 00:59:32.410 align:middle line:90%
