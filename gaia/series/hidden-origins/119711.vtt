[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:09.424 --> 00:00:12.920 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:13.420 align:middle line:90%
>>Hello.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.760 align:middle line:10%
This is Michael
Tellinger, and our journey

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.840 align:middle line:10%
continues looking
into the distant past

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.730 align:middle line:10%
to see what we can learn from
the ancient civilizations

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.150 align:middle line:10%
that we can put to good
use for humanity today

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.050 align:middle line:10%
and into our future.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.080 align:middle line:84%
We ended off in the
last episode looking

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.940 align:middle line:84%
at the millions of stone circles
in Southern Africa and Adam's

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.750 align:middle line:84%
Calendar to show
that these were very

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.880 align:middle line:84%
powerful, energy-generating
devices-- all

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.480 align:middle line:84%
connected together forming a
huge energy grid that gives us

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.980 align:middle line:84%
an unimaginable amount of energy
that we still can use today

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.650 align:middle line:84%
if we just figure out how to
tap into this source of energy.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.810 align:middle line:84%
This is all using the
resonance of Mother Earth,

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.080 align:middle line:84%
amplifying it, and creating
unimaginable amounts of energy

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.740 align:middle line:90%
for us that still works today.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.000 align:middle line:84%
So what else were
these stone circles

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.110 align:middle line:84%
and these stone structures
in Southern Africa used for?

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.440 align:middle line:84%
What other possible
uses were they applied?

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.740 align:middle line:84%
For what these amazing,
mysterious ancient people

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.370 align:middle line:84%
were doing, once
you start looking

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.840 align:middle line:84%
at the structures of some
of these stone circles,

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.830 align:middle line:84%
the images and the shapes
give us a thousand ideas.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And once you see
the flower shapes

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.250 align:middle line:84%
and the magnetron-like
shapes of these stone

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.490 align:middle line:84%
structures and
the stone circles,

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.670 align:middle line:84%
it gives us a very clear
indicator and a direction what

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.140 align:middle line:90%
these were possibly used for.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.670 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
flower-shape patterns connected

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.675 align:middle line:84%
by the channels and, once
again, from the channels,

00:01:46.675 --> 00:01:49.735 align:middle line:84%
it leads to a hexagonal
cluster of cells,

00:01:49.735 --> 00:01:51.760 align:middle line:84%
and what you can't
see in these images

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.940 align:middle line:84%
are the stone circles that are
on both sides of the channels.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.540 align:middle line:84%
Just from the angle,
you can see it.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And also, remember that
many of these stone

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.620 align:middle line:84%
circular structures are actually
covered by soil and sand

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.140 align:middle line:84%
from the flood, so
only the ones that

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.020 align:middle line:84%
have been re-used after the
flood seem to be visible.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.640 align:middle line:84%
The others are covered
by soil and sand.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.020 align:middle line:84%
So here, we have a
channel that runs.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And to the left of the image,
we have another cluster

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.040 align:middle line:84%
of hexagonal cells, which
just boggles the mind.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.710 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.210 align:middle line:84%
A cluster of hexagonal cells
that looks like a honeycomb,

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.790 align:middle line:90%
what would you use that for?

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.370 align:middle line:84%
Why would you possibly
build such a structure

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.000 align:middle line:84%
unless you had a very
clear intention for that?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.010 align:middle line:84%
And since they built
it, they must have had

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.770 align:middle line:90%
a very clear intention for it.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And look at these clusters
of circular stone structures.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.330 align:middle line:84%
This is way beyond
any kind of sense

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.810 align:middle line:84%
because there
aren't any passages.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.220 align:middle line:84%
There are just these weird,
short little channels

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.500 align:middle line:84%
that connect them
together, and this area

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.330 align:middle line:84%
covers about five
square kilometers.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.590 align:middle line:90%
It is insane.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.570 align:middle line:84%
The only suggestion
that I have that

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.250 align:middle line:84%
comes to mind for what these
could possibly be used for

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.190 align:middle line:84%
is to do what we discussed
in previous episodes,

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.200 align:middle line:84%
and that's to do with using
sound and energizing sound

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.190 align:middle line:84%
and the air for
specific purposes.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:19.300 align:middle line:10%
Remember that our lungs energize
the oxygen through the sound

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.740 align:middle line:10%
that we breathe,
and I'm suggesting

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.695 align:middle line:10%
that this is possibly what these
stone structures were used for.

00:03:24.695 --> 00:03:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And remember that,
as we breathe,

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.640 align:middle line:84%
the air that we breathe
goes through the track

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.990 align:middle line:84%
here, the bronchus, the bronchi,
the bronchioles, the alveoli.

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.640 align:middle line:90%
And the air speeds up.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.190 align:middle line:84%
And the sound of the
air that we breathe

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.700 align:middle line:84%
keeps speeding up to the point
that, by the time it reaches

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.800 align:middle line:84%
the alveoli in our lungs, it's
moving at hypersound speeds--

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.230 align:middle line:84%
generating huge
amounts of energies.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you look
at the structure

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.956 align:middle line:84%
of alveoli in our lungs,
they're hexagonal clusters.

00:03:54.956 --> 00:03:56.330 align:middle line:84%
Cross-sections of
them shows that

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.930 align:middle line:84%
these a hexagonal clusters--
very strongly resembling

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.360 align:middle line:84%
the stone clusters connected
to the channels in the stone

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.370 align:middle line:90%
circles of Southern Africa.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'm suggesting that these
stone structures were actually

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.760 align:middle line:84%
used like you-- here, you see
the flower-shaped stone circle.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.329 align:middle line:84%
That would be the
energy source channeling

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.094 align:middle line:84%
the energy, the sound,
the resonance that it

00:04:19.094 --> 00:04:21.019 align:middle line:84%
amplifies from the
Earth, channeling it

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.320 align:middle line:90%
down the passages.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And from the passage, it
goes into the clusters--

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.390 align:middle line:90%
the hexagonal clusters of cells.

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:30.980 align:middle line:90%
Something was going on.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm suggesting
that some of these

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.160 align:middle line:84%
could have been used for
cloning human beings-- cloning

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.470 align:middle line:84%
this first species that
was genetically created

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.230 align:middle line:84%
to be the slave race to
work in the gold mines.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.250 align:middle line:84%
And we've had some interesting
past life regressions

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.030 align:middle line:84%
and channelings that
have confirmed this--

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.880 align:middle line:84%
that these were, in fact, the
very original cloning chambers

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.070 align:middle line:84%
for the first humans
that were created

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.894 align:middle line:84%
to be slaves in the gold mines
for the gods or the Anunnaki.

00:04:57.894 --> 00:04:59.810 align:middle line:84%
Just in case you haven't
figured this out yet,

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.980 align:middle line:84%
that's exactly the
way bees and ants

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.490 align:middle line:84%
and wasps grow their
babies, plant their eggs

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.760 align:middle line:84%
in-- these hexagonal structures
that we call "honeycombs."

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing that
this particular area

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.180 align:middle line:84%
could have been used for--
which, to me, doesn't make

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.180 align:middle line:84%
any sense unless
you start looking

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.700 align:middle line:84%
at this possible scenario--
is that maybe these people,

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.940 align:middle line:84%
in ancient times-- and this
may be beyond the Anunnaki.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.560 align:middle line:84%
This may be an earlier
seeding on this planet.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.410 align:middle line:84%
We're actually
generating an atmosphere

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:32.990 align:middle line:90%
or energizing an atmosphere.

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.330 align:middle line:84%
Because if you look at the
structure of these stone ruins,

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.450 align:middle line:84%
the only thing I
can compare it to

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.600 align:middle line:84%
is to the cross-section of
the lungs in the human body.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And if you look carefully at
the cross-section of the lung

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.270 align:middle line:84%
tissue and, again, these
structures, so either they

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.430 align:middle line:84%
were energizing or generating
oxygen and energizing

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.330 align:middle line:84%
in the atmosphere or
something to that extent

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.820 align:middle line:84%
because that is the only
thing that I can find

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.230 align:middle line:90%
resembles these stone circles.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.410 align:middle line:84%
And then we get to the
famous Torus Stones,

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.650 align:middle line:84%
and this is just a
spectacular story.

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.449 align:middle line:84%
Because there are many, many
thousands of these so-called

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:13.990 align:middle line:84%
"Torus Stones"-- well, actually,
what they're called in South

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.550 align:middle line:84%
Africa by South African
historians and archaeologists,

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.720 align:middle line:84%
they known as weights
for digging sticks

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.050 align:middle line:84%
because, obviously, our poor
historians and archaeologists

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.810 align:middle line:84%
weren't able to put this
together from a scientific

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:26.450 align:middle line:90%
perspective.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.310 align:middle line:84%
So the story that
they came up was

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.990 align:middle line:84%
that the people in ancient
times made these stones

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.330 align:middle line:84%
with holes in them so they
could use them as weights

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:34.820 align:middle line:90%
around a digging stick.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.550 align:middle line:84%
When they went
foraging and looking

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.430 align:middle line:84%
for food and roots
in the field, they

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.100 align:middle line:84%
would use this around the
stick as an extra weight

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.070 align:middle line:84%
to make their digging
more efficient.

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can clearly see
how nonsensical that idea is.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.690 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to spend your
life making one of these stones

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.890 align:middle line:84%
if you can just use different
ways of weighing down

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:52.640 align:middle line:90%
your stick.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.190 align:middle line:84%
What they did do
is, when they did

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:57.330 align:middle line:84%
find these stones with holes
in them, they used them.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Just like the fact that you're
using a tool or an artifact

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:03.110 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean you made
it, the same rule

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.720 align:middle line:84%
applies-- that when
you occupy a ruin,

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.300 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't mean
that you built it.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.901 align:middle line:84%
You just occupied it and used
it for your own purposes,

00:07:09.901 --> 00:07:11.400 align:middle line:84%
and that's really
what we're dealing

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.090 align:middle line:84%
with here with
these ancient stone

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:14.820 align:middle line:90%
structures in Southern Africa.

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:17.860 align:middle line:84%
We started measuring very
powerful energy fields

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.670 align:middle line:84%
around these stone
circles, and there

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:24.850 align:middle line:84%
started becoming a huge
question as to what

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:28.990 align:middle line:84%
were these weird stones
with holes in them used for.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.080 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, it all
started to make sense.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.550 align:middle line:84%
These are just toroid
vortex energy generators.

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:39.070 align:middle line:84%
They take on the same shape
as pretty much everything

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:40.260 align:middle line:90%
in creation.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.310 align:middle line:84%
If we look at the structure
of our solar system,

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:47.580 align:middle line:84%
the structure of our galaxy,
and larger clusters down

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:53.200 align:middle line:84%
to the atom-- everything in our
nature of reality that we find

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.570 align:middle line:84%
is based on this
accumulation of energy

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:59.659 align:middle line:84%
in this Torus kind of
shape and structure.

00:07:59.659 --> 00:08:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly what
we started finding.

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:04.120 align:middle line:84%
We started measuring very
powerful energy fields

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.550 align:middle line:84%
coming out of these stones,
and it boggled my mind.

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:09.780 align:middle line:84%
What were these stones
possibly used for?

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:13.000 align:middle line:84%
Then I got an email
from a German scientist

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.440 align:middle line:84%
by the name of
Reiner Gebbensleben,

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.910 align:middle line:84%
and he told me that he measured
the energies coming out

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:19.590 align:middle line:90%
of these stones.

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And they go up to--
just even leaving

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:26.750 align:middle line:84%
them lying in an ambient
room, the amount of energy

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:31.010 align:middle line:84%
that they generate is up
to 3,500 decibels of sound.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.559 align:middle line:84%
So what the stones
seem to do is they

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:36.480 align:middle line:84%
seem to suck in the ambient
air, the ambient noise,

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:41.370 align:middle line:84%
and amplify it in some sort
of a scalar way, a scalar

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:45.640 align:middle line:84%
technology, and push out this
amplified sound and resonance

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:46.920 align:middle line:90%
right around it.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.510 align:middle line:84%
And then we started
experimenting

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:50.520 align:middle line:84%
with some of these
stones, and we put one

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.880 align:middle line:90%
in a bucket of water.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.320 align:middle line:90%
This happened by accident.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.760 align:middle line:90%
And guess what happened.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.840 align:middle line:84%
The next morning,
I woke up and there

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:00.140 align:middle line:84%
were thousands of tiny little
bubbles moving around, swirling

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.570 align:middle line:84%
around, going into the
center of the stone--

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:05.940 align:middle line:84%
clearly indicating that there
is an energy field that is going

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:09.385 align:middle line:84%
into the middle of the stone
and then somehow, obviously, it

00:09:09.385 --> 00:09:10.440 align:middle line:90%
would be amplifying out.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
you start measuring

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:15.080 align:middle line:84%
this very highly-amplified
energy source-- sound

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.430 align:middle line:90%
energy in decibels.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:17.730 align:middle line:90%
Very powerful.

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And then the most
amazing thing happened.

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:22.840 align:middle line:84%
We were on our way
to Nassim Haramein,

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:27.280 align:middle line:84%
to visit Nassim in Hawaii at
his residence research institute

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.990 align:middle line:90%
laboratories and offices.

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:31.730 align:middle line:84%
And I put this
particular stone--

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:33.900 align:middle line:84%
that I hold in this
picture-- in my bag.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And Louise and I
left for Hawaii,

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.750 align:middle line:84%
and we went via
Doha International

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:43.150 align:middle line:84%
Airport in the Arab Emirates
and then on to Chicago.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.590 align:middle line:84%
I wrapped the stone
in bubble wrap

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:49.560 align:middle line:84%
and chucked it in my bag--
not thinking much about it.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:50.640 align:middle line:90%
We got to Doha.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.950 align:middle line:84%
I had a layover for a
few hours, and then we

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:56.270 align:middle line:84%
got into the airplane for
Chicago at which point

00:09:56.270 --> 00:10:00.800 align:middle line:84%
my bag must have gone through
the TSA Homeland Security check

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.020 align:middle line:90%
and scan.

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're sitting
in the airplane,

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.660 align:middle line:84%
and the plane just
wasn't taking off--

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:08.960 align:middle line:84%
even after the captain said
close the doors and cross-check

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.410 align:middle line:90%
and whatever.

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:14.050 align:middle line:84%
15, 20 minutes later, we're
still sitting on the runway.

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:17.400 align:middle line:90%
And suddenly, we heard a voice.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.550 align:middle line:84%
Louise Clarke, please
identify yourself.

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at Louise,
and I said, "Well,

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:22.920 align:middle line:90%
what have you done?"

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't know, so
she put their hand up.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.607 align:middle line:84%
And the air hostess
came running along,

00:10:27.607 --> 00:10:29.940 align:middle line:84%
and she said, "You must follow
me off the plane, ma'am."

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "I'm not letting
you off the plane on your own."

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:33.760 align:middle line:84%
So I went with
Louise to the edge

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:37.120 align:middle line:84%
of the plane and the stairs
going down onto the tarmac,

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.842 align:middle line:90%
and there was my bag.

00:10:38.842 --> 00:10:39.800 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't Louise's bag.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:44.120 align:middle line:84%
My bag, with five guys with guns
around my bag, and I went, "Oh,

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:44.840 align:middle line:90%
my goodness.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.450 align:middle line:90%
It's the stone in my bag."

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:48.380 align:middle line:84%
They cross-labeled
our bags, so they

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:49.970 align:middle line:90%
thought it was Louise's bag.

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:51.590 align:middle line:84%
So eventually, a
lot of confusion.

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:54.960 align:middle line:84%
I make my way down, go
to my bag, and they say,

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:55.850 align:middle line:90%
"Open your bag, sir.

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:57.732 align:middle line:84%
There's a security
threat in your bag."

00:10:57.732 --> 00:10:58.690 align:middle line:90%
And I'm thinking, "Wow.

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:00.896 align:middle line:90%
This is the Torus stone."

00:11:00.896 --> 00:11:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And what am I
going to tell them?

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:04.670 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell them this is
ancient advanced technology.

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:07.440 align:middle line:84%
This is not going to go
down well with TSA Homeland

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.450 align:middle line:90%
Security.

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:11.400 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, well,
I'll tell them it's arts

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.010 align:middle line:84%
and crafts-- African
arts and crafts.

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:14.509 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's got one
of these stones.

00:11:14.509 --> 00:11:15.625 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:11:15.625 --> 00:11:17.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's a present from
our friend in Hawaii.

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:23.130 align:middle line:84%
So eventually, I opened the
bag and after sweating quite

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:25.700 align:middle line:84%
anxiously, trying to open
this stone because it's

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:28.120 align:middle line:84%
wrapped in packing
tape and bubble wrap,

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:31.345 align:middle line:84%
which is not easy to open with
your bare fingers, eventually,

00:11:31.345 --> 00:11:33.570 align:middle line:84%
I somehow managed to
pop the stone out.

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:36.632 align:middle line:84%
And lots of confusion
by these guys, and there

00:11:36.632 --> 00:11:38.590 align:middle line:84%
was a tall African guy
that was standing there.

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:40.506 align:middle line:84%
And he recognized the
stone, and he said, "Oh,

00:11:40.506 --> 00:11:41.810 align:middle line:90%
I've seen those before."

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:43.450 align:middle line:90%
And he started to walk away.

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:46.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's only months later that
I realized that he actually

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:49.210 align:middle line:84%
diffused the tension, and I
didn't realize how serious it

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:51.030 align:middle line:90%
was at that particular stage.

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:53.470 align:middle line:84%
Only probably a year
or two afterwards,

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:56.620 align:middle line:84%
I started processing this
event to realize how serious

00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:00.230 align:middle line:90%
that specific incident was.

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:03.620 align:middle line:84%
So I put the stone
back in the bag,

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:05.280 align:middle line:90%
and they take the bag away.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And they ushered me back
on the plane at which point

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:11.390 align:middle line:84%
the captain had come out, and
he was standing next to Louise.

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And they had a
little discussion.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.470 align:middle line:84%
So when we sat down
back in our seats

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:19.924 align:middle line:84%
and the doors closed and
we started taking off,

00:12:19.924 --> 00:12:21.590 align:middle line:84%
Louise turned to me
and said, "You know,

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:23.310 align:middle line:84%
the captain came
out of the cockpit,

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:27.350 align:middle line:84%
and he said that whatever is
in that bag crashed the TSA

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:29.880 align:middle line:90%
security system."

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And I just couldn't
believe my ears

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:37.020 align:middle line:84%
because we can now thank
Homeland Security and airport

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:41.520 align:middle line:84%
TSA security for giving us the
scientific proof and evidence

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.580 align:middle line:84%
that we are actually,
in fact, dealing

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:45.770 align:middle line:84%
with advanced
ancient technology.

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:49.090 align:middle line:84%
Why they allowed us to
take off with our stone

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:51.950 align:middle line:84%
back in the bag
still blows my mind.

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, this
is the full story.

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And so the stone is
now being evaluated,

00:12:57.770 --> 00:13:01.072 align:middle line:84%
and a number of scientists
are doing a variety

00:13:01.072 --> 00:13:02.030 align:middle line:90%
of experiments with it.

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it's going to
provide us with very, very

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:09.385 align:middle line:84%
interesting information as to
how we can use sound and use

00:13:09.385 --> 00:13:13.100 align:middle line:84%
these kind of shapes-- these
Torus Stone shapes-- to amplify

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:15.980 align:middle line:84%
energy and create
energy out of the vortex

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:18.920 align:middle line:84%
or out of the ether
and the vacuum.

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:22.250 align:middle line:84%
So let's move on, and this
brings us to saser technology.

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:24.980 align:middle line:84%
We've already spoken
about saser technology

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:27.950 align:middle line:84%
amplifying sound and
turning it into a saser

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:31.250 align:middle line:84%
beam-- as opposed to a laser
beam-- where sound is speeded

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:36.810 align:middle line:84%
up into the cones-- the cone
tips, the cone-shaped tools.

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I believe the
stones may have been used for.

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:44.170 align:middle line:84%
The Torus Stones in conjunction
with the cone-shaped tools,

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:46.970 align:middle line:84%
which were the tips for
the saser beam technology,

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:49.020 align:middle line:84%
amplifying huge
amounts of energy,

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:50.750 align:middle line:90%
pushing it through the cones.

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:55.330 align:middle line:84%
It speeds up the sound until
it forms a coherent sound beam,

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:58.280 align:middle line:84%
and you've got yourself some
very advanced technology.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And once you start putting two
and two together and seeing

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.380 align:middle line:90%
the signs on the wall.

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:07.100 align:middle line:84%
Ed Leedskalnin, using ice cream
cones or cone-shaped tools

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:10.640 align:middle line:90%
to levitate these very blocks.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.950 align:middle line:84%
We have these Mayan deities
using cone-shaped tools

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:16.370 align:middle line:84%
to do some kind of
weird stuff with.

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And we start to
imagine how you can

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:22.840 align:middle line:84%
use cone-shaped tools and
this saser beam technology

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:25.590 align:middle line:84%
to move things around
and levitate things.

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:30.580 align:middle line:84%
And that brings us to a very
important consideration--

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:33.370 align:middle line:84%
the fact that these ancient
sites are not just randomly

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:35.260 align:middle line:90%
scattered around the world.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:39.240 align:middle line:84%
The ancients seem to have had a
very specific plan as to where

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:42.180 align:middle line:84%
they put these ancient
sites-- from the pyramids

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:45.180 align:middle line:84%
to Borobudur, Adam's
Calendar, and so forth--

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.260 align:middle line:84%
and they seem to
be placed on very

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:52.600 align:middle line:84%
powerful energetic nodal points,
crossings of energy lines

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.560 align:middle line:90%
and ley lines and so much more.

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:58.270 align:middle line:84%
They're not just
scattered accidentally

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:00.470 align:middle line:84%
and build wherever
they felt they wanted

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:04.160 align:middle line:84%
to build these sites, and
that obviously becomes

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.000 align:middle line:84%
a very important
consideration for us

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.340 align:middle line:84%
to figure out what these
ancient sites really are.

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:12.160 align:middle line:84%
We already know that the
pyramids and the stone circles

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.790 align:middle line:84%
in Stonehenge were
energy-generating devices using

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:18.970 align:middle line:84%
sound and resonance to generate
huge amounts of energy.

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:22.740 align:middle line:84%
The Bosnian pyramid uses sound
in the tunnels underneath

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:25.850 align:middle line:84%
to activate the pyramid
to make it perform

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:27.520 align:middle line:90%
whatever it's supposed to do.

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And so we look at
this crystalline grid

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:32.300 align:middle line:84%
that the Russians
have, for example,

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:36.250 align:middle line:84%
that the earth is structured as
a crystalline energetic grid.

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And then I found this
spectacular Sumerian

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:42.350 align:middle line:84%
translation, and
this is unbelievable.

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:44.720 align:middle line:84%
When I found this, I
couldn't believe my luck.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that
goes back probably 4,000 years,

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:51.880 align:middle line:84%
and it tells us exactly what we
are looking at and discovering

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.180 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:57.220 align:middle line:84%
This is what it says-- "In
distant days, in those days,

00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:00.830 align:middle line:84%
after destinies had been
decreed, after An"--

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:04.490 align:middle line:84%
that was "Anu"-- "and Enlil
had set up the regulations

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:06.010 align:middle line:90%
for heaven and earth."

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:07.361 align:middle line:90%
These guys were powerful dudes.

00:16:07.361 --> 00:16:07.860 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:10.180 align:middle line:84%
They set up the regulations
for heaven and earth?

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:12.190 align:middle line:90%
Who were these people.

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:15.460 align:middle line:84%
"Enki, the exulted,
knowing god, by the rules

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:19.360 align:middle line:84%
for heaven and earth, the
fixed rules, he set up cities."

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.866 align:middle line:84%
So what do we get out
of this ancient text?

00:16:21.866 --> 00:16:23.240 align:middle line:84%
They're telling
us that there was

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:26.740 align:middle line:84%
some sort of fixed rules in
heaven, fixed rules of heaven

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:30.480 align:middle line:84%
and earth-- some sort of an
energetic grid above the earth

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.800 align:middle line:84%
and around the earth
that seems to be echoed

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.550 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of the earth.

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:37.540 align:middle line:84%
Energetic grids--
as above, so below.

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And according to
these energetic grids

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:42.770 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of the earth,
they built their cities.

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:44.380 align:middle line:90%
And that's exactly what we find.

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:47.120 align:middle line:84%
All these ancient sites
are built on very specific

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.730 align:middle line:90%
energetic points.

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is where David
Wilcock, several years ago,

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:54.170 align:middle line:84%
broke this very critical
information-- not knowing

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:56.680 align:middle line:84%
that this ancient
tablet in Sumerian form

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.810 align:middle line:84%
actually exists--
where he showed us

00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:02.880 align:middle line:84%
that many of the logos of
space command and the Air Force

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.740 align:middle line:84%
actually have encoded
in them these rules

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:09.010 align:middle line:84%
or these fixed rules of heaven
and earth, where, in the logo,

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:11.680 align:middle line:84%
it shows these white bands
going around the earth.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And these white
bands are referred

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:17.640 align:middle line:84%
to as "the rules" by the space
command and the Air Force--

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.060 align:middle line:90%
those in "the know."

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:22.490 align:middle line:84%
They say, apparently, that it's
some sort of an energetic grid

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:23.569 align:middle line:90%
around the earth.

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:25.270 align:middle line:84%
They don't know
where it comes from,

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:27.099 align:middle line:90%
but it's always been there.

00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly what
I find when you start

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:32.040 align:middle line:90%
researching this information.

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.970 align:middle line:10%
So I was right in the
middle of researching

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:38.420 align:middle line:10%
this fascinating new
area of discovery

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:40.240 align:middle line:10%
when my friend, Paul
Greyvensteyn, who

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.710 align:middle line:10%
is a South African
farmer, who, many years,

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:45.790 align:middle line:10%
ago had a dream
and, in the dream,

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:48.250 align:middle line:10%
he was shown how to
make specific devices.

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:51.410 align:middle line:10%
And it seems that many inventors
go through the same process,

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:53.840 align:middle line:10%
that they get their
information from dreams.

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.540 align:middle line:84%
Just like Nikola
Tesla apparently

00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:59.396 align:middle line:84%
did and many other great
minds of the past and present.

00:17:59.396 --> 00:18:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And Paul Greyvensteyn
has found the cure

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.700 align:middle line:84%
for all kinds of disease just
with resonance and frequencies

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:05.620 align:middle line:90%
and sound.

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:09.560 align:middle line:84%
He's been working with farmers--
resonating and activating

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.440 align:middle line:84%
the soil so it
makes the crops grow

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.240 align:middle line:90%
better and bigger and faster.

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:15.420 align:middle line:84%
It prevents bugs from
eating the crops.

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:17.970 align:middle line:84%
He's negating all the ill
effects and negative effects

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:21.900 align:middle line:84%
of Monsanto that they've
imposed on our poor farmers.

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And what I find
fascinating as well

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:26.730 align:middle line:84%
is that Monsanto is aware
of what he is doing,

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:29.950 align:middle line:84%
and they are, in turn, putting
out energies and frequencies

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:31.550 align:middle line:90%
to negate what he is doing.

00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:34.270 align:middle line:84%
So unbeknown to us, there's
this invisible battle

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:37.140 align:middle line:84%
going on between the farmer
and the mighty Monsanto.

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:38.130 align:middle line:90%
This is spectacular.

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:41.830 align:middle line:84%
But just a little background
on my friend, Paul.

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:43.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, he phoned
me out of the blue

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.170 align:middle line:84%
because I seem to
be one of the guys

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:48.140 align:middle line:84%
that he can talk to without
thinking he's crazy,

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:51.280 align:middle line:84%
and he told me that he's been
measuring because this guy can

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:53.390 align:middle line:84%
measure all kinds of
energies in fields

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:55.600 align:middle line:84%
that most people
don't know how to do.

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And he said that he started
measuring this weird energy

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.440 align:middle line:84%
field around the
earth-- just like we

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.830 align:middle line:90%
read in the Sumerian texts.

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:06.290 align:middle line:84%
The energy grid around the
earth and the fixed rules

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:10.160 align:middle line:84%
around the earth that are
encoded in the Air Force logos.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.980 align:middle line:10%
And he said that this
is a binary code.

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:13.355 align:middle line:10%
It's some sort of
an energy field

00:19:13.355 --> 00:19:17.270 align:middle line:10%
that's made up of 1s and 0s,
and he said that he broke it up.

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:19.480 align:middle line:10%
He sent up some sort
of an energy field

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.400 align:middle line:10%
to break it up to see
what would happen.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And he said, as soon as it broke
up, it grew together again.

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:28.000 align:middle line:84%
It comes back together
immediately and reforms.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.060 align:middle line:84%
He says it's almost
indestructible based

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:33.220 align:middle line:84%
on his current findings,
and this is unimaginable

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:36.000 align:middle line:84%
that this kind of thing can
actually be going on around us.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.400 align:middle line:84%
Most of us haven't
got the foggiest idea

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.390 align:middle line:90%
that this could be going on.

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:41.990 align:middle line:90%
We think we know everything.

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:43.261 align:middle line:90%
We think we're born free.

00:19:43.261 --> 00:19:45.510 align:middle line:84%
We think, because we've gone
to school and university,

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:47.230 align:middle line:84%
we're well-informed
and well-educated

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:48.400 align:middle line:90%
and we read the papers.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:48.900 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:50.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, really, that's
a bunch of BS.

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:51.030 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:53.170 align:middle line:84%
We all know that this
doesn't really work.

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:55.490 align:middle line:84%
We should know by now that
everything we've been told

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:57.910 align:middle line:84%
is a lie, and Paul
Greyvensteyn gave us

00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:01.530 align:middle line:84%
a very clear indication how much
is going on without us actually

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:02.490 align:middle line:90%
seeing this.

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:04.810 align:middle line:90%
So where does this take us?

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:07.640 align:middle line:84%
It takes us to the ancient
sites and the placement

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:11.220 align:middle line:84%
of these ancient sites
around the world on very

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:14.310 align:middle line:84%
specific energetic points,
and this takes us to Egypt

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:17.310 align:middle line:84%
just to demonstrate this
incredible breakthrough

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:18.720 align:middle line:90%
discovery.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.920 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
temples in Egypt,

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:24.670 align:middle line:84%
there are just too many
pillars and not enough space.

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:27.670 align:middle line:90%
The obelisks ring like bells.

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:30.300 align:middle line:84%
And if you put your ear
against this particular piece--

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:33.700 align:middle line:84%
it blew my mind-- and you tap
on the one side, it goes dong.

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:36.170 align:middle line:84%
Just like the stones
in the stone circles

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:39.740 align:middle line:84%
of Southern Africa, these
obelisks vibrate and resonate

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:40.880 align:middle line:90%
unbelievably.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.510 align:middle line:90%
They ring like bells.

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:44.830 align:middle line:84%
So there's too many
pillars, not enough space.

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:47.380 align:middle line:84%
These so-called
"temples" were not

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:51.000 align:middle line:84%
built for worshipping, offering
food, or kissing butt here,

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.280 align:middle line:90%
or kissing butt over there.

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And if you do it wrong, then
you get smited for seven years

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:56.800 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.740 align:middle line:84%
This is all part of the
disinformation and part

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:02.720 align:middle line:84%
of the lies and the tactics
that have been imposed

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.540 align:middle line:90%
on us for thousands of years.

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:06.800 align:middle line:84%
These are very
different structures.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:09.370 align:middle line:84%
These have been placed here
for very specific reasons.

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:10.610 align:middle line:90%
What are they made of?

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:11.700 align:middle line:90%
They're made of stone.

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:12.860 align:middle line:90%
What does stone contain?

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:15.510 align:middle line:90%
Stone contains silica, quartz.

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:17.220 align:middle line:90%
What does quarts and silica do?

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:19.420 align:middle line:84%
It's used in the most
advanced technology.

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:21.770 align:middle line:84%
Just by looking at some of
these aerial photographs

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:24.730 align:middle line:84%
of these temples, you realize
that these are not dwellings.

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:26.820 align:middle line:84%
These are not places
for people to gather.

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.820 align:middle line:84%
This is something
very, very different.

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And now that we know that
the stone circles in Southern

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.220 align:middle line:84%
Africa and the
pyramids in Stonehenge

00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:35.280 align:middle line:84%
are all energy-generating
devices,

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.290 align:middle line:84%
we should be looking
in that direction.

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:39.010 align:middle line:90%
And that's exactly what we find.

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:41.050 align:middle line:84%
Even at the Parthenon
in Greece, you

00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:44.920 align:middle line:84%
see this huge resonant chamber
on top of the mountain--

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:47.630 align:middle line:84%
a mountain of the gods-- where
people weren't allowed to go.

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:49.900 align:middle line:84%
All around it are
the remains of what

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:53.000 align:middle line:84%
used to be-- a much bigger
structure all connected

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:53.690 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:55.210 align:middle line:90%
And we carry on.

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:58.940 align:middle line:84%
These giant resonant chambers
with pillars around them

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.210 align:middle line:84%
that, once you know we're
dealing with resonance,

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:03.470 align:middle line:84%
it all starts to make
a lot more sense.

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And this is a-- you see in
this image, for example,

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:10.785 align:middle line:84%
you go to two concentric
circles in front of a platform--

00:22:10.785 --> 00:22:13.310 align:middle line:84%
a stone platform
with too many pillars

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:16.360 align:middle line:84%
and a big resonant
chamber right next to it.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And we realize that
these are not temples.

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.010 align:middle line:90%
These are templates.

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:21.170 align:middle line:90%
Templates for what?

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:24.500 align:middle line:84%
Templates for giant circuit
boards made out of stone,

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:26.610 align:middle line:84%
made out of silica,
made out of quartz.

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:29.710 align:middle line:84%
We're dealing with giant
energy circuit boards

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:35.040 align:middle line:84%
and advanced ancient technology
beyond our wildest imagination.

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:38.510 align:middle line:84%
These were built on
such a gigantic scale

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:41.100 align:middle line:84%
that it took us so
many thousands of years

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:43.170 align:middle line:84%
to figure out what
was going on here.

00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:45.620 align:middle line:84%
When I first presented this
at Contact in the Desert

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:48.720 align:middle line:84%
and we came outside, there was
a guy that came out and said,

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.690 align:middle line:84%
oh, I built circuit
boards and you're spot on.

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:52.850 align:middle line:84%
And he started
explaining to me what

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:55.580 align:middle line:84%
parts of these ancient
circuit boards would do

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:57.320 align:middle line:84%
and how they would
actually work.

00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:59.160 align:middle line:84%
It really blew my
mind, and we're

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.830 align:middle line:84%
looking at microprocessors
that actually become

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:03.960 align:middle line:90%
gigantic macroprocessors.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And this one just blows
my mind, and so it goes.

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:11.080 align:middle line:84%
The pyramids are no different--
giant energy-generating

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:12.050 align:middle line:90%
devices.

00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:15.310 align:middle line:84%
The rules around the
earth were held up.

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:17.110 align:middle line:84%
The energy field
around the earth

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:19.310 align:middle line:84%
seems to have been
held up by some

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:22.420 align:middle line:84%
of these ancient
powerful circuit boards--

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:25.120 align:middle line:84%
generating energies and
generating all kinds of stuff

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:28.860 align:middle line:84%
that we can't even imagine right
now-- holding up this energy

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:30.670 align:middle line:90%
matrix around the earth.

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to be
that human sound was

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:36.490 align:middle line:84%
used to keep up this energy
grid around the earth.

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:38.090 align:middle line:84%
When you look at
some of these sites,

00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:39.630 align:middle line:84%
they give us very
clear indicators

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:44.010 align:middle line:84%
there was probably human sound
that held up and still holds up

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:46.100 align:middle line:84%
this energy grid
around the earth-- that

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:51.220 align:middle line:84%
becomes our own prison or matrix
in which we find ourselves in.

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:54.400 align:middle line:84%
The amphitheaters that
are built perfectly

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.390 align:middle line:84%
with perfect
acoustic properties.

00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:58.360 align:middle line:84%
You can whisper in
that amphitheater,

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:00.190 align:middle line:84%
and you can hear
it amplified right

00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:02.250 align:middle line:84%
throughout that
entire amphitheater.

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
they would put people

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:07.420 align:middle line:84%
in these amphitheaters,
fill them with fear

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:08.560 align:middle line:90%
or get them excited.

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And you know how
much noise people

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:12.650 align:middle line:84%
make in a stadium
and an amphitheater?

00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:15.630 align:middle line:84%
That energy gets channeled
into the circuit board.

00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:18.790 align:middle line:84%
It activates it, and it sends
the signal up into the sky--

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:21.900 align:middle line:84%
upholding this energy
grid and energizing

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:26.050 align:middle line:84%
this energy grid or the
fixed rules around the earth.

00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:30.720 align:middle line:10%
Here's another amphitheater
connected to the circuit board

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:37.010 align:middle line:10%
by a long line of vibrating
pillars-- vibrating crystal

00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:40.800 align:middle line:10%
pillars-- carrying the solid and
resonance and the information

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:43.470 align:middle line:10%
of the sound into the circuit
board, which, in this instance,

00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:44.990 align:middle line:10%
is badly broken down.

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:46.420 align:middle line:90%
Here's another example.

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:48.970 align:middle line:84%
There's the amphitheater
on the side of the mountain

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:50.340 align:middle line:90%
and on top of the mountain.

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:53.370 align:middle line:84%
You've got the badly eroded
and broken-down circuit board.

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:56.560 align:middle line:84%
Here is a giant circuit
board where the ampitheater--

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:59.445 align:middle line:84%
the source of the sound--
is right in the middle

00:24:59.445 --> 00:25:00.320 align:middle line:90%
of the circuit board.

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:02.180 align:middle line:90%
This is in Algeria.

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:04.240 align:middle line:84%
Sacsayhuaman in Peru
is no different.

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:07.540 align:middle line:84%
We get told that these big
walls-- these very famous

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:08.830 align:middle line:90%
walls-- are defensive walls.

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:10.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we're going to
build defensive walls,

00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:12.154 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to
put corners in them

00:25:12.154 --> 00:25:15.100 align:middle line:84%
so that you can climb up very
easily up in the corners.

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:17.240 align:middle line:84%
You'd try and make them
as smooth as you can.

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And when you look
at Sacsayhuaman,

00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:22.030 align:middle line:84%
it's no different to all
these other ancient temples.

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:25.520 align:middle line:84%
What those defensive
walls seem to be

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:28.820 align:middle line:84%
is they create two channels
that-- and the zigzag

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:30.880 align:middle line:84%
shape of these
walls seem to create

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:34.400 align:middle line:84%
a specific frequency of the
air and the sound the air makes

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:37.540 align:middle line:84%
as it travels between
those walls and channels

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:40.800 align:middle line:84%
that sound and the energy
into the circuit board, which

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:42.080 align:middle line:90%
sits on top of the mountain.

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And you can clearly see
the circuit board structure

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:45.600 align:middle line:90%
on top of that mountain.

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.240 align:middle line:84%
Here's a beautiful
example of what

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:50.870 align:middle line:84%
that zigzag shape of the energy
that channels into the circuit

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:53.220 align:middle line:84%
board would look like
if you lit it up.

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And we realize that nothing
has changed in 2015.

00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:00.220 align:middle line:84%
The ancient temples have
simply become churches,

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:03.390 align:middle line:84%
and the obelisks
have become steeples.

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:06.750 align:middle line:84%
Why do we have churches, or
why do churches have steeples?

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:08.620 align:middle line:90%
Who came up with this design?

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:11.440 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, this has
been imposed on us

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:15.260 align:middle line:84%
because of those that harvest
the sound of the human race.

00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And once you know that the
cone-shaped technology creates

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:25.480 align:middle line:84%
the spiral vortexes and
pushes out the sound in saser

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:29.360 align:middle line:84%
technology or hypersound
out of the point and the tip

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:32.800 align:middle line:84%
of the cone, you realize what
all these church steeples

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.280 align:middle line:84%
are all about-- harvesting
the energy of the people

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:38.100 align:middle line:84%
in the church, filled with
fear, filled with excitement,

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:40.205 align:middle line:84%
filled with hope,
singing, making a noise,

00:26:40.205 --> 00:26:41.080 align:middle line:90%
clapping their hands.

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:44.600 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is they do,
it harvests the sound.

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And especially in my
recent trip through Bosnia,

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:50.350 align:middle line:84%
some of the mosques
in Bosnia actually

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:55.230 align:middle line:84%
have these little balls on top
of the cone facing the sky.

00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:56.960 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me that
they're actually

00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:00.370 align:middle line:84%
pulsing the sound or
the saser technology

00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:03.540 align:middle line:84%
into the air based on the number
of spherical balls they have.

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:06.770 align:middle line:84%
So if there are five balls,
then it would pulse five times.

00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:07.772 align:middle line:90%
So they'd shoot it up.

00:27:07.772 --> 00:27:08.980 align:middle line:90%
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:10.481 align:middle line:84%
Bang, bang, bang,
bang bang, bang.

00:27:10.481 --> 00:27:10.980 align:middle line:90%
Or twice.

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:11.479 align:middle line:90%
Bang, bang.

00:27:11.479 --> 00:27:12.330 align:middle line:90%
Bang, bang.

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:13.070 align:middle line:90%
Bang, bang.

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:17.480 align:middle line:84%
So they're sending out different
pulse waves of sound energy

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:18.305 align:middle line:90%
into the sky.

00:27:18.305 --> 00:27:20.530 align:middle line:84%
Our ignorance and
our enslavement

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:24.090 align:middle line:84%
regarding all this information
is absolutely stupefying.

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:26.440 align:middle line:84%
But now, we know this,
and we can move on.

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And we no longer believe
that places like this

00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:29.700 align:middle line:90%
are holy places.

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:32.940 align:middle line:84%
We know that this is just
there to harness our energy

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:36.540 align:middle line:84%
and feed it to those that
are using our energy.

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:39.130 align:middle line:84%
Nothing has changed
in today's world.

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:41.120 align:middle line:90%
We no longer need churches.

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.654 align:middle line:84%
Fewer people seem to be
going to churches these days,

00:27:43.654 --> 00:27:45.320 align:middle line:84%
but we don't need to
go to the churches.

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:48.080 align:middle line:84%
Or the temples in Egypt
are no longer necessary

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:51.760 align:middle line:84%
because our cities have
become the grids that

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:53.220 align:middle line:90%
generate so much energy.

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:56.910 align:middle line:84%
All these tall buildings that
face the sky-- we live in them,

00:27:56.910 --> 00:27:57.770 align:middle line:90%
we work in them.

00:27:57.770 --> 00:28:01.170 align:middle line:84%
Remember, these are
"busy-ness" centers.

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:02.370 align:middle line:90%
The phones ring.

00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:03.410 align:middle line:90%
The people are anxious.

00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:04.090 align:middle line:90%
They're excited.

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:05.964 align:middle line:84%
They're filled with fear
of losing their jobs

00:28:05.964 --> 00:28:06.840 align:middle line:90%
or getting a deal.

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:10.760 align:middle line:84%
All this energy being created in
these tall buildings resonating

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:13.646 align:middle line:84%
into the sky, putting all
this energy into the sky.

00:28:13.646 --> 00:28:16.490 align:middle line:84%
Our city grids are
giant circuit boards.

00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:18.910 align:middle line:84%
They have replaced
the ancient temples,

00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:21.540 align:middle line:84%
and they're all
connected to each other.

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:23.550 align:middle line:84%
Just like the stone
circles in Southern Africa

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:26.140 align:middle line:84%
are connected together
by these channels,

00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:28.470 align:middle line:84%
well, our cities are
connected to each other

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:31.640 align:middle line:84%
by these channels that
never stop making a noise.

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:32.720 align:middle line:90%
It goes on.

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.650 align:middle line:90%
We make a lot of noise.

00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:36.020 align:middle line:90%
We never stop.

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And now, I understand
what Morpheus

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:42.010 align:middle line:84%
was trying to tell us in the
movie The Matrix when he said,

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:44.150 align:middle line:84%
"People are the
source of energy."

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:46.710 align:middle line:84%
Here, we have the
physical evidence

00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:49.020 align:middle line:84%
breaking down the
ancient temples

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:51.430 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient
civilizations and realizing

00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:54.190 align:middle line:84%
that this has really been
going on for much longer

00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:55.500 align:middle line:90%
than we realized.

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:58.190 align:middle line:84%
So the question as we're going
to ask ourselves is-- what have

00:28:58.190 --> 00:28:59.750 align:middle line:90%
we learned from all of this?

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:02.950 align:middle line:84%
Because if we don't take this
knowledge and information

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:05.400 align:middle line:84%
and use it for the
benefit of humanity,

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.401 align:middle line:90%
it's all a bloody waste of time.

00:29:07.401 --> 00:29:07.900 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it?

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:10.060 align:middle line:84%
We are enslaved
on our own planet.

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:11.870 align:middle line:90%
We live on a prison planet.

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:13.570 align:middle line:84%
We now know that
there is an energy

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:16.130 align:middle line:84%
grid-- some sort of
matrix energy grid

00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:18.840 align:middle line:84%
made of a binary code--
around our planet

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:22.170 align:middle line:84%
and probably many layers
of other grids around us

00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:24.160 align:middle line:90%
that we're not even aware of.

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.790 align:middle line:84%
We know that we are not
born free on this planet.

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:28.820 align:middle line:90%
We can't move around freely.

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:30.870 align:middle line:84%
We can't live
where we choose to.

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:33.360 align:middle line:84%
We need passports
and work permits.

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:36.690 align:middle line:84%
We have to follow rules and
laws that we didn't agree to

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:38.050 align:middle line:90%
at birth.

00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:40.880 align:middle line:84%
We have to work to survive to
earn this thing called "money."

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.420 align:middle line:90%
We have to pay taxes.

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:44.370 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, we go to jail.

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:45.480 align:middle line:90%
This is not freedom.

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.120 align:middle line:90%
What is this called?

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.790 align:middle line:84%
This is called "slavery,"
and this slavery

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:53.860 align:middle line:84%
has been imposed to us
by a tool called "money."

00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:55.620 align:middle line:84%
What are we going
to do about this?

00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we get to
the good part, the good news,

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:02.400 align:middle line:84%
and the release from
this prison system

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:06.210 align:middle line:84%
because we start embracing
the true ancient knowledge

00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:08.990 align:middle line:84%
and wisdom of the
ancient civilizations

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:13.360 align:middle line:84%
and bringing back what we can
put to the greatest of use

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:15.690 align:middle line:84%
and the benefit of
humanity today--

00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:19.710 align:middle line:84%
ancient African knowledge
wisdom systems, which

00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:22.950 align:middle line:84%
has been echoed throughout the
world in all ancient cultures.

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:25.270 align:middle line:84%
They have their own systems,
their own names for it.

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:28.750 align:middle line:84%
In Africa, we call
it "Ubuntu," and this

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:31.240 align:middle line:84%
is what we're going to carry
on with in the next episode.

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:33.450 align:middle line:84%
