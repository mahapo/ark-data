00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.800 align:middle line:10%
>>Hello, this is
Michael Tellinger.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.110 align:middle line:10%
And we continue our exploration
into the ancient, murky past,

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.490 align:middle line:10%
the origins of
humankind, the mystery

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.530 align:middle line:10%
of vanished civilizations,
human obsession with gold,

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:31.030 align:middle line:10%
and many other mysterious
questions that don't always

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.130 align:middle line:10%
have obvious answers.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.340 align:middle line:84%
One of the important
things we covered

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.960 align:middle line:84%
in the past few episodes
is the story of gold.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.090 align:middle line:84%
Until a few years
ago, South Africa

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.140 align:middle line:84%
was the largest exporter
of gold in the world,

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.280 align:middle line:84%
and many other precious
minerals for a long, long time.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And this seems to go back
into antiquity thousands

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.300 align:middle line:84%
and thousands of years ago,
where much of the world's gold

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.280 align:middle line:84%
was provided by this
part of the world.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.270 align:middle line:84%
We explored the Anglo
Boer War, or what

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:10.140 align:middle line:84%
is now called the South
African War from 1899 to 1902.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And the mysterious story behind
Paul Kruger and the missing

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.910 align:middle line:84%
train, and the train filled
with gold that vanished,

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.420 align:middle line:90%
never to be found again.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.150 align:middle line:84%
The question we
asked was not where

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.960 align:middle line:84%
did the train and the
gold disappear to.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.740 align:middle line:84%
But the question
more important, is

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.630 align:middle line:84%
where did Paul Kruger
get all the gold from

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.660 align:middle line:90%
to fill the train?

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:40.280 align:middle line:84%
Now that we've had a look at the
mysterious, Annunaki activity,

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.110 align:middle line:84%
the vast gold mining empire
started by the Annunaki

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:51.100 align:middle line:84%
and Enki and the unimaginable
number of gold mines,

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.000 align:middle line:84%
the underground
tunnels, I think we're

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.330 align:middle line:84%
getting closer to
an answer to that

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.550 align:middle line:84%
question-- why did the
British Empire send 470,000

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.480 align:middle line:84%
troops to Southern
Africa to fight

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.360 align:middle line:84%
60,000 farmers on horseback and
another 60,000 native Africans

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.180 align:middle line:90%
with spears and shields.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.070 align:middle line:84%
I believe the question
is answered by looking

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.300 align:middle line:90%
at what Paul Kruger discovered.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.480 align:middle line:84%
We have an interesting story
about a pre-Inca statue,

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.650 align:middle line:84%
a Viracocha kind of
deity, being found

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:33.640 align:middle line:84%
in a paved tunnel in the town
of Carletonville around 1975.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And this statue was in
a tunnel that was fully

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.670 align:middle line:84%
paved all the way around,
clearly indicating

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.180 align:middle line:84%
an advanced ancient civilization
that left behind the statue.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Boer fighters were
well known for digging tunnels

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.930 align:middle line:90%
to hide from the British troops.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it was in one
of these episodes of digging

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.780 align:middle line:84%
a tunnel to hide from
the troops that they

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.480 align:middle line:90%
came across another tunnel.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.550 align:middle line:84%
And this time it was most
likely paved all the way around,

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.790 align:middle line:84%
just like the one
in Carletonville,

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.610 align:middle line:84%
except this time there wasn't
a statue of Viracocha in there.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.610 align:middle line:84%
This time the tunnel
was filled with gold--

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.510 align:middle line:90%
finished, complete gold.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.840 align:middle line:84%
I believe that Paul
Kruger accidentally

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.140 align:middle line:84%
discovered the Annunaki
tunnels and the Annunaki gold.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And this made him,
overnight, the most dangerous

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.410 align:middle line:84%
and the most powerful
man in the world.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.810 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, Paul Kruger
didn't know about this.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.090 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know what
he stumbled upon.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.060 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, he would have
behaved very, very differently.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.240 align:middle line:84%
However, the British Empire
knew exactly what had happened.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.510 align:middle line:84%
They knew that Paul Kruger must
have stumbled upon the Annunaki

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:47.370 align:middle line:90%
gold.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.130 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, where did he
get all that gold from?

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And this is why they
mobilized 470,000 soldiers

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.610 align:middle line:90%
to throw at the problem.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.580 align:middle line:84%
They had to stop this man,
no matter what it took.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Remember who the
British Empire is.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.480 align:middle line:84%
They are the royal
bloodlines, and they are

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.420 align:middle line:90%
the empire that runs the world.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.400 align:middle line:90%
They are the banking families.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.420 align:middle line:84%
These people know exactly about
the Annunaki, the history,

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.530 align:middle line:90%
and the gold.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.360 align:middle line:84%
They knew that unless they
dealt with the problem,

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.350 align:middle line:84%
Paul Kruger was going to become
the biggest problem they ever

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.400 align:middle line:84%
faced in the history
of this planet,

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.870 align:middle line:84%
with all the Annunaki
gold at his fingertips.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.520 align:middle line:10%
And that takes us to analyzing
these millions of stone

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.810 align:middle line:10%
structures in Southern
Africa connected

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.670 align:middle line:10%
to the gold mining, all
this mining activity, Enki,

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.730 align:middle line:10%
and the cloning of a species.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.110 align:middle line:84%
But what were these
stone ruins and the stone

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.900 align:middle line:90%
circles all about?

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.640 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, they were not
dwellings for people,

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.880 align:middle line:84%
and they were not dwellings
for cows, or sheep,

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.030 align:middle line:90%
or any other animal.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.720 align:middle line:84%
They have no doors
and entrances.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.100 align:middle line:84%
They're all connected
by channels.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.520 align:middle line:90%
So what were they?

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.960 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very
obvious to most

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.090 align:middle line:84%
that have been watching
the series what

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.360 align:middle line:90%
we're dealing with here.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.710 align:middle line:84%
First of all, the stones
in the walls of these ruins

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.610 align:middle line:84%
are all made up
with a material that

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.320 align:middle line:84%
is very rich in quartz, or
metamorphisized quartzite,

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.040 align:middle line:90%
or crystalline substance.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.130 align:middle line:84%
It's either dolerite, or it's
a stone known as hornfels,

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.530 align:middle line:84%
it's known as ring stone by
geologists in Southern Africa

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:22.870 align:middle line:90%
and around the world.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.820 align:middle line:84%
And it also contains stones
that ring like bells.

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, it was at this
moment, shortly

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.850 align:middle line:84%
after I started researching
the stone circles,

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.410 align:middle line:84%
and we were clearing
one of the stone circles

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.780 align:middle line:84%
to prepare it for tourism and
to bring tourists to the site.

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And the team that we had,
they were moving the stones

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.760 align:middle line:84%
and picking some of the
ones up from underfoot

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.330 align:middle line:84%
so we could clear a path--
that they were putting

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.090 align:middle line:84%
the stones down and I
suddenly heard the sounds that

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.120 align:middle line:84%
were being made by these
20 or 30 people who

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.070 align:middle line:90%
are moving the stones.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.528 align:middle line:84%
And it was literally
like ding dong

00:05:55.528 --> 00:05:58.520 align:middle line:84%
ding ding ding ding-- just
these ringing ping ping

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.790 align:middle line:84%
sounds as they were
moving the stones.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.470 align:middle line:84%
And I realized at that
moment that the stones

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.400 align:middle line:90%
had something to do with sound.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And this was supported soon
after with the discovery

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.890 align:middle line:84%
of the elongated stones that
very obviously ring like bells.

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.680 align:middle line:84%
And to demonstrate how these
stones ring like bells,

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.600 align:middle line:84%
I've compiled a
little video clip

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.240 align:middle line:84%
to show you the beautiful
sounds that they make.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.720 align:middle line:84%
It's important to note
that many of these stones

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.380 align:middle line:84%
ring at a b-flat, which is the
same note that was measured

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:37.750 align:middle line:84%
by NASA from the center of
the very massive supercluster

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:42.860 align:middle line:84%
galaxy in the Perseus
Supercluster Galaxy Complex.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.660 align:middle line:90%
So enjoy this little clip.

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.960 align:middle line:84%
Maybe also to show you how
some of these other stones

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:55.895 align:middle line:84%
ring like bells-- as you
can see, we find many,

00:06:55.895 --> 00:06:59.620 align:middle line:90%
many of these elongated stones.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.358 align:middle line:90%
The one is full of the patina.

00:07:01.358 --> 00:07:06.050 align:middle line:90%


00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.980 align:middle line:84%
It's thick patina
so it's quite dull,

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:10.816 align:middle line:84%
but you can still
hear the effect.

00:07:10.816 --> 00:07:14.790 align:middle line:90%


00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:16.550 align:middle line:90%
And this is a beautiful one.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.616 align:middle line:84%
This one actually rings at
two different frequencies.

00:07:19.616 --> 00:07:29.400 align:middle line:90%


00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.810 align:middle line:90%
Dong dong dong, dong dong dong.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:35.010 align:middle line:90%
They're quite large.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:36.470 align:middle line:90%
Look at this one.

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And it looks also like it
was inserted into something

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:40.460 align:middle line:90%
up to that point.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And also remember, they
all ring like bells.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:44.802 align:middle line:90%
This one is no exception.

00:07:44.802 --> 00:07:52.190 align:middle line:90%


00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:55.660 align:middle line:90%
All right, and on that note.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:56.980 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:57.570 align:middle line:90%
That's better.

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:01.290 align:middle line:90%


00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:02.590 align:middle line:90%
That's what you want.

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:04.880 align:middle line:84%
You realize that this thing
really rings like a bell,

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.700 align:middle line:84%
and it reverberates
for quite a long time.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:23.330 align:middle line:90%


00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And there you go--
demonstration how

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.970 align:middle line:90%
these stones ring like bells.

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:30.530 align:middle line:84%
And they were used in all
kinds of ways and fashions,

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:34.090 align:middle line:84%
just like the Ankh to
create specific vibrational

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:37.809 align:middle line:84%
frequencies and
specific notes to use

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:41.250 align:middle line:84%
as a form and a
source of energy.

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.049 align:middle line:90%
What are these stones made of?

00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:47.370 align:middle line:84%
What is a stone that
rings like a bell made of?

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:48.860 align:middle line:90%
We've already spoken about this.

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:50.780 align:middle line:10%
It's made up of
crystalline structure.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.120 align:middle line:10%
What is crystalline structure?

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.400 align:middle line:10%
It contains silica,
silica dioxide.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.130 align:middle line:10%
That's what crystals are.

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:56.880 align:middle line:10%
What is silica?

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.320 align:middle line:10%
Silica contains memory.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.940 align:middle line:10%
Silica conducts sound.

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.590 align:middle line:10%
Silica conducts light.

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:04.990 align:middle line:84%
Silica stores memory
and information.

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:08.110 align:middle line:84%
Silica is at the heart of
the most advanced technology

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:09.500 align:middle line:90%
we have today.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.430 align:middle line:84%
You know, Silicon
Valley, fiber optics,

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:15.630 align:middle line:84%
silicon chips-- the words
make it very clear what

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:16.640 align:middle line:90%
we're dealing with here.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:21.770 align:middle line:84%
All these ancient sites are
giant Silicon Valley memory

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:24.810 align:middle line:84%
banks that hold huge
amounts of information,

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:28.370 align:middle line:84%
encoded in the walls of
these ancient structures.

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:30.160 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's the
pyramids of Giza,

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.720 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the
walls of the stone

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:35.310 align:middle line:84%
circles in South Africa, or
Stonehenge, or Borobudur--

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:36.020 align:middle line:90%
doesn't matter.

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:39.800 align:middle line:84%
All these ancient sites contain
a large amount of silica

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.420 align:middle line:84%
that will contain a
lot of the knowledge

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.010 align:middle line:90%
and information in them.

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And now that we know
that-- very recently we've

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:51.930 align:middle line:84%
been told that crystals
can hold digital data,

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:53.860 align:middle line:84%
as if we didn't
know this before,

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.890 align:middle line:84%
but finally they
released this information

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:57.610 align:middle line:90%
to the global population.

00:09:57.610 --> 00:09:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And we know that an
ordinary little crystal

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:03.080 align:middle line:84%
can store billions of
terabytes of information.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.120 align:middle line:84%
But obviously this is
not good for business.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:09.250 align:middle line:84%
They can't release new forms
of upgrades of computers

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:11.872 align:middle line:84%
to make us buy the same
stuff over and over again.

00:10:11.872 --> 00:10:13.580 align:middle line:84%
So that kind of
knowledge and information

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:15.660 align:middle line:84%
is very quickly swept
under the carpet

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:19.340 align:middle line:84%
and kept for the benefit of the
computer and the IT industry

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:20.770 align:middle line:90%
and those that make computers.

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:24.280 align:middle line:84%
But now that we know that
digital data and information

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.490 align:middle line:84%
can be stored in
crystals, we realize

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:29.590 align:middle line:84%
that so much information
and knowledge

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:32.450 align:middle line:84%
must be stored in the
crystalline structure of all

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:35.080 align:middle line:84%
these ancient sites
around the world.

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:39.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a matter of time
before some 12-year-old kid

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.140 align:middle line:84%
with a fancy application
walks up to Stonehenge

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:44.560 align:middle line:84%
and plugs it into
one of the cracks,

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.650 align:middle line:84%
and starts to download some
fascinating information

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:50.030 align:middle line:84%
from the rocks at
Stonehenge, or the Pyramids,

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:52.190 align:middle line:84%
or any of these ancient
sites around the world.

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:54.990 align:middle line:84%
I just hope that he uploads
this information on to YouTube

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:56.830 align:middle line:84%
before the black
helicopters appear

00:10:56.830 --> 00:11:00.660 align:middle line:84%
above his house, or the car
that he finds himself in.

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.340 align:middle line:84%
Because clearly this is
not the kind of information

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:06.910 align:middle line:84%
that those that control humanity
would like to share with us.

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:09.972 align:middle line:84%
The conclusion that we
reach from this expose

00:11:09.972 --> 00:11:13.490 align:middle line:84%
is that all these ancient
sites are really built

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:15.840 align:middle line:90%
for very much the same reasons.

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.740 align:middle line:90%
They're giant machines.

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:19.390 align:middle line:90%
They all resonate.

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:23.100 align:middle line:84%
They use sound and
frequency and resonance

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.360 align:middle line:84%
to drive these machines to
perform whatever function

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.720 align:middle line:90%
they're supposed to perform.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And this is also why
most of these, or many

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:34.510 align:middle line:84%
of these, ancient
sites are aligned

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:36.050 align:middle line:90%
with the movement of the sun.

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:39.930 align:middle line:84%
Because they use the movement
of the sun from the winter

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:41.470 align:middle line:84%
solstice, to the
summer solstice,

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:43.830 align:middle line:84%
to the equinox, and the
movement of the stars.

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:46.530 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we might think
that the stars are faint,

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:48.880 align:middle line:84%
but it's still light
that comes down.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And when the sun rises
on the summer solstice

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:54.730 align:middle line:84%
and comes down a passage, and
hits a standing stone that's

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:56.550 align:middle line:84%
filled with
crystalline substance,

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:59.800 align:middle line:84%
it's like the sound frequencies
and the light frequencies

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.330 align:middle line:84%
in that beam of
light that activate.

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:04.350 align:middle line:84%
It's like hitting
Enter on your computer.

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:06.500 align:middle line:84%
It activates the
machine to start

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:10.230 align:middle line:84%
performing a specific function,
whatever it's supposed to do.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.990 align:middle line:90%
And it starts to work.

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And when the sun moves
to the winter solstice,

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:17.280 align:middle line:84%
and comes down another passage,
or a tunnel over there,

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:21.480 align:middle line:84%
and the sunlight, when it rises,
hits another standing stone,

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.370 align:middle line:84%
or another stone filled
with crystalline substance--

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:26.620 align:middle line:84%
it activates the machine
to do something else,

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:29.560 align:middle line:84%
or to stop doing or
performing the function which

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.840 align:middle line:84%
it was instructed to do
on the solstice before.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:37.410 align:middle line:84%
And this is how these ancient
structures were built,

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:40.490 align:middle line:84%
and why they were aligned
with the movement of the sun.

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:43.110 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly it starts to
make a lot more sense.

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And we realize that all these
ancient sites, whether it's

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:49.870 align:middle line:84%
Stonehenge-- when we look at
the research done at Stonehenge,

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:51.690 align:middle line:84%
there's so much work
that's been done

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:54.020 align:middle line:84%
to do with the sound and
resonance that was measured

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.960 align:middle line:84%
in Stonehenge showing us
beautiful, symmetrical

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.330 align:middle line:90%
interference patterns.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:01.760 align:middle line:84%
Clearly showing us, even though
stone has been reconstructed,

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.340 align:middle line:84%
the encoded energy fields
in these structures

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:07.730 align:middle line:84%
are so strong that they
hold those resonances even

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:11.680 align:middle line:84%
in their very badly decomposed
or deconstructed state.

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And this very clearly
shows us that Stonehenge

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:18.560 align:middle line:84%
was built with intent to
be a resonating chamber,

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.410 align:middle line:90%
or a resonating device.

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:24.120 align:middle line:10%
And this photograph that has
been shown on the internet

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.230 align:middle line:10%
shows us that weird
frequencies are being

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:28.730 align:middle line:10%
emitted from the pyramids.

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:31.200 align:middle line:10%
This was taken with a special
lens that can actually

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:35.210 align:middle line:10%
photograph sound frequencies
and show us the effect of sound

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:36.380 align:middle line:10%
through a lens.

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:40.250 align:middle line:84%
This clearly shows that
even in their really badly

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:43.990 align:middle line:84%
deconstructed state, the
pyramids are still active.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:47.030 align:middle line:84%
Not always, but on
certain times of the year

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:49.090 align:middle line:90%
and on certain days.

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And in recent times we started
seeing photographs emerge

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.370 align:middle line:84%
coming out of the Chichen
Itza pyramid, this very

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:59.350 align:middle line:84%
powerful beam of light that
was captured that shows us

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:02.970 align:middle line:84%
that there's these pyramids
emitting huge amounts of energy

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:04.970 align:middle line:90%
in sound and light.

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:08.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is consistent with
our findings in the stone

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:10.720 align:middle line:84%
circles in Southern
Africa, and specifically

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.930 align:middle line:90%
at Adam's Calendar.

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:15.410 align:middle line:84%
Here's another example at the
Pyramid of the Sun in Mexico.

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:17.640 align:middle line:84%
Huge amount of
energy being released

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.490 align:middle line:84%
from the top of the pyramid,
which clearly boggles

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:24.950 align:middle line:84%
the mind of researchers that
still see these as structures

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:27.410 align:middle line:84%
that were built by people who
didn't really know what they

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:29.390 align:middle line:84%
were doing, or
built because they

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:33.520 align:middle line:84%
were built as tombs or
something nonsensical like that.

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:36.990 align:middle line:84%
This is the phenomenal
discovery by Semir Osmanagic,

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:38.440 align:middle line:90%
the Bosnian Pyramid.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And just like all the
other ancient sites,

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:42.850 align:middle line:84%
the Bosnian Pyramid,
which at this stage

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:45.730 align:middle line:84%
seems to be the largest
pyramid discovered,

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:49.230 align:middle line:84%
emits a beam of energy from
the top of the pyramid.

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And this beam of energy has
been measured at 28 kilohertz.

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:54.960 align:middle line:84%
It's fascinating that
this 28 kilohertz

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:58.840 align:middle line:84%
is repeated in many ancient
discoveries around the world

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:02.680 align:middle line:84%
and is very significant,
that particular frequency.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.840 align:middle line:84%
What I need to tell you,
as well, about the Bosnian

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.381 align:middle line:84%
Pyramid, since we
are on the subject,

00:15:06.381 --> 00:15:10.420 align:middle line:84%
is that the many tunnels
that leads to the pyramid--

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.800 align:middle line:84%
and if you don't know
this yet, the pyramid

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:17.620 align:middle line:84%
is pretty much located on
top of a large labyrinth

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:20.930 align:middle line:84%
of underground tunnels that
all lead to the pyramid.

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And Semir Osmanagic
is busy excavating

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:25.430 align:middle line:84%
these tunnels that
lead, and making

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:28.290 align:middle line:90%
his way into the pyramid.

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:31.490 align:middle line:84%
What's fascinating about this
particular Bosnian Pyramid

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:35.990 align:middle line:84%
is that inside the tunnels
there is a very pure air.

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And this clean, crisp air,
very high in negative ions,

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:44.780 align:middle line:84%
they've actually
captured healing effects.

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:49.520 align:middle line:84%
People with problems with the
knees, or backs, or asthma,

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.060 align:middle line:84%
or other ailments that they
have-- after they come work

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:57.430 align:middle line:84%
as volunteers in the tunnels
of the Bosnian Pyramid--

00:15:57.430 --> 00:16:00.666 align:middle line:84%
come away feeling
revitalized and healed.

00:16:00.666 --> 00:16:02.290 align:middle line:84%
People that have had
problems for years

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:05.690 align:middle line:84%
come away completely cured
and healed from the problem

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:07.230 align:middle line:84%
that they entered
the tunnels with.

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And I specifically experienced
a similar situation.

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.370 align:middle line:84%
The moment you walk
into those tunnels you

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:16.230 align:middle line:90%
can feel the fresh, clean air.

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:23.170 align:middle line:84%
It's like there's this constant
move or negative ions that

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:27.800 align:middle line:84%
are good for you, this movement
of air that has this very

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:30.260 align:middle line:90%
positive effect on your body.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, what is this
doing for the pyramid?

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And this is my take on
the Bosnian Pyramid.

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:43.470 align:middle line:10%
It seems to be some sort of a
device, where the tunnels work

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:50.950 align:middle line:10%
like the trachea and the bronchi
and the alveoli in our lungs.

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:55.110 align:middle line:10%
The air moves through our
lungs, energizing the oxygen

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:57.270 align:middle line:10%
and activating our body.

00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And this is exactly what these
tunnels under the Bosnian

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:01.500 align:middle line:90%
permit seem to do.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:05.130 align:middle line:84%
As the air moves through
this labyrinth of tunnels,

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:07.530 align:middle line:84%
it creates a sound
and a resonance

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:10.849 align:middle line:84%
that resonates the
pyramid, that starts to do

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:12.550 align:middle line:90%
whatever it's supposed to do.

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And at this stage, we
believe that the pyramid

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:17.460 align:middle line:84%
has got something to
do with the activation

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:20.609 align:middle line:84%
of our consciousness,
or the increase

00:17:20.609 --> 00:17:25.390 align:middle line:84%
or the elevating of human
consciousness on this planet.

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:26.940 align:middle line:84%
There are specific
reasons for this,

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:30.770 align:middle line:84%
and we may get into
that in future episodes.

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:34.480 align:middle line:84%
But right now let's move on
into-- this is just to show you

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:37.380 align:middle line:84%
what some of these tunnels
under the pyramids look like.

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And at this stage I
think Semir Osmanagic

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:42.990 align:middle line:84%
has excavated close to two
kilometers of these tunnels

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:46.330 align:middle line:84%
as he's making his way
towards under the pyramid

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:48.520 align:middle line:90%
and into the Bosnian Pyramid.

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.860 align:middle line:84%
So what are the stone circles
in Southern Africa all about?

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:55.200 align:middle line:84%
We've explored cymatics
and the manifestation

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.040 align:middle line:84%
of sand on a metal
plate, or sound

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:02.360 align:middle line:84%
that creates physical form when
you put sand on a metal plate.

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:05.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think by now, if you've
looked at the stone circles

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:08.090 align:middle line:84%
from the aerial
photographs, you realize

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:10.120 align:middle line:84%
that that's exactly
what we're dealing with.

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:14.470 align:middle line:84%
Every stone circle is just
a physical manifestation

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:17.160 align:middle line:84%
of the sound frequencies
that emanate out

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.110 align:middle line:84%
of Mother Earth at
that particular point.

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:23.580 align:middle line:84%
So this is why every stone
circle is completely unique,

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:29.210 align:middle line:84%
because the sound frequencies
are changed and morphed

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:32.320 align:middle line:90%
as they move through the earth.

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And as they surface, on that
particular place of the earth,

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:38.080 align:middle line:84%
they create a very
specific frequency,

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.730 align:middle line:84%
and a very specific
cymatic pattern

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:42.900 align:middle line:90%
based on that frequency.

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.830 align:middle line:84%
And this is what the
ancients captured,

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:48.090 align:middle line:90%
what the Annunaki captured.

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:52.710 align:middle line:84%
They identified the cymatic
pattern of the sound.

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:55.740 align:middle line:84%
And they stacked
the stones according

00:18:55.740 --> 00:19:00.040 align:middle line:84%
to the cymatic pattern,
amplifying the sound coming out

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:04.410 align:middle line:84%
of the earth and turning them
into electromagnetic fields

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:08.030 align:middle line:84%
and a form of energy that
are then used for everything

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:10.560 align:middle line:84%
they did in this
part of the world,

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.840 align:middle line:84%
and possibly right
around the world.

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And this gives us
a giant energy grid

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.720 align:middle line:90%
that is still active today.

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.230 align:middle line:84%
Because remember, all
these stone circles

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:22.280 align:middle line:84%
in southern Africa
are all connected

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:26.880 align:middle line:84%
by those channels, or wires,
that all connect them together.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:29.350 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking
at a giant energy

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:33.350 align:middle line:84%
grid that creates an
unimaginable amount of energy.

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:38.670 align:middle line:84%
We simply cannot imagine the
amount of energy that was

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:43.180 align:middle line:84%
and still is created by these
stone circles of southern

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:44.340 align:middle line:90%
Africa.

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And some of these
stone circles are built

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:48.950 align:middle line:90%
in the shape of magnetrons.

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And we've already spoken
about magnetrons, and the fact

00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:55.540 align:middle line:84%
that magnetrons are also driven
by sound and resonance that

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:58.190 align:middle line:84%
create this very
high energy output.

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:02.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, if a small magnetron
can create a laser beam that

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:05.520 align:middle line:84%
can cut metal in a
split second, you

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:09.970 align:middle line:84%
can just imagine how much
energy is created, or would

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:14.540 align:middle line:84%
be created, by a giant
magnetron about 20 meters,

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:19.690 align:middle line:84%
or 60 feet in diameter, made
out of quartz, and silica,

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:23.300 align:middle line:84%
and crystalline
substance-- stone.

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:25.540 align:middle line:84%
This is why the
ancients used stone.

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:28.020 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have to use
advanced technology,

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:30.560 align:middle line:84%
or what we perceive as
advanced technology,

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.000 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't have
to sell it to anybody.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.530 align:middle line:90%
They didn't have money.

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:35.960 align:middle line:90%
They didn't use money.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.740 align:middle line:84%
They did things for
whatever they needed

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:41.467 align:middle line:90%
to do to achieve their goals.

00:20:41.467 --> 00:20:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we're going to
talk about in much more detail

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:45.440 align:middle line:90%
in future episodes.

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:50.580 align:middle line:84%
So if one small magnetron
can create a laser beam that

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:53.440 align:middle line:84%
can cut metal in a split
second, how much energy

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:56.350 align:middle line:90%
would a giant magnetron create?

00:20:56.350 --> 00:21:00.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, I had two answers from
two magnetron scientists.

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:03.620 align:middle line:84%
And they both gave
me the same answer.

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:07.940 align:middle line:84%
One of these would create
more energy than all the power

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:10.560 align:middle line:90%
plants on earth today.

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.370 align:middle line:90%
This is staggering.

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:14.040 align:middle line:90%
Why is it staggering?

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:17.760 align:middle line:84%
Because we don't just have
one of these ancient magnetron

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:20.600 align:middle line:84%
sites, we have
thousands of them.

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:24.600 align:middle line:84%
And then we have 10 million
of these stone structures that

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:27.480 align:middle line:90%
support these magnetron sites.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.860 align:middle line:84%
This is truly
something that we need

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:31.990 align:middle line:90%
to take some time to digest.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:34.280 align:middle line:84%
But the most exciting
thing about this

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:37.380 align:middle line:84%
is that these stone
circles are still alive.

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And we know this because
we measured them.

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:42.120 align:middle line:84%
We measured the
sound frequencies,

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:44.330 align:middle line:84%
the electromagnetic
fields that are

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:46.510 align:middle line:84%
created by these sound
frequencies coming out

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:47.600 align:middle line:90%
the stone walls.

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.930 align:middle line:84%
We measured the heat signatures
that it created that come out

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:54.410 align:middle line:84%
of the ground, which is the
average temperature about 300

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:56.210 align:middle line:90%
meters below the ground.

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:59.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, the heat signatures are a
very interesting and peculiar

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:00.330 align:middle line:90%
thing here.

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:03.390 align:middle line:84%
It's not the surface temperature
on the surface of the ground.

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:06.010 align:middle line:84%
It's the average
temperature about 300 meters

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:08.560 align:middle line:90%
below the surface of the ground.

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And the scale works on the
basis that at 80 degrees

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Celsius-- I'm not sure
what that is in Fahrenheit.

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:18.320 align:middle line:84%
But remember, that in Celsius
water boils at 100 degrees.

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:21.740 align:middle line:84%
So at 80 degrees
Celsius, it tells you

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:24.160 align:middle line:84%
that you're standing
on top of a volcano.

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:27.330 align:middle line:84%
That's what this heat
signature scale measures.

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:30.080 align:middle line:84%
That's how it's
calibrated-- 80 degrees,

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.190 align:middle line:84%
you're standing on
top of a volcano.

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:33.980 align:middle line:84%
And you'll start
seeing how important

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:36.270 align:middle line:84%
this calculation,
or this measurement

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:39.710 align:middle line:84%
is when we start
measuring these sites.

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:41.820 align:middle line:84%
At this particular
stone circle we

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:45.940 align:middle line:84%
measured 33 and 1/2
gigahertz of sound frequency

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:47.680 align:middle line:90%
coming out of the walls.

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:49.760 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you that
the lowest frequency

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:52.910 align:middle line:84%
we measured coming out
of the walls is about 14

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:55.600 align:middle line:84%
and 1/2 gigahertz,
which is insane.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:58.440 align:middle line:84%
You shouldn't be measuring
sound in the gigahertz

00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:02.640 align:middle line:84%
coming out of nature,
or stones in nature.

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:05.720 align:middle line:84%
So clearly, whatever
these ancients

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:09.000 align:middle line:84%
did, what the Annunaki did
in constructing these stone

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.330 align:middle line:84%
circles, they knew
exactly what they

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:16.020 align:middle line:84%
were doing to harness
and amplify the energy.

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:18.670 align:middle line:84%
33 and 1/2 gigahertz
sound frequencies

00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:19.880 align:middle line:90%
coming out of these walls.

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to me
that it is the quartz,

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:27.730 align:middle line:84%
it's the vibration of the quartz
in the crystalline structure

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:31.050 align:middle line:84%
of the rocks that make up the
walls, that actually emits

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:35.120 align:middle line:84%
the sound frequency that is
picked up by the instruments

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.760 align:middle line:90%
that we use to detect this.

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:40.630 align:middle line:84%
The other thing we measured is
the heat signature coming out

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:41.840 align:middle line:90%
of the stone circle.

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:45.370 align:middle line:84%
Outside of the stone
circle the heat signature,

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:48.790 align:middle line:84%
the average temperature
300 meters deep, is about 5

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:51.810 align:middle line:90%
and 1/2 degrees Celsius.

00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:54.320 align:middle line:84%
The moment we swing
the measuring device

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:58.480 align:middle line:84%
into the stone circle it shoots
up to 58 degrees Celsius.

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.180 align:middle line:90%
This is spectacular.

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:02.250 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make any sense.

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:04.350 align:middle line:84%
We measured
electromagnetic fields

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:07.520 align:middle line:84%
that are being created
as a result of the sound,

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:11.310 align:middle line:84%
and this seemingly swirling
sound, this movement

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:13.290 align:middle line:84%
of sound through the
stone walls that creates

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:14.810 align:middle line:90%
an electromagnetic field.

00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And it is this
electromagnetic field,

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:19.690 align:middle line:84%
that seems to run horizontally
in most of the sun circles,

00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:21.810 align:middle line:84%
and this is what
prevents you from getting

00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:23.150 align:middle line:90%
satellite reception.

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:25.340 align:middle line:90%
And you lose GPS reception.

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:27.930 align:middle line:90%
And your GPS stops to work.

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:33.020 align:middle line:84%
Now we can explain why we pick
up these weird GDP anomalies

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:34.830 align:middle line:84%
when you walk into
the stone circles,

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:37.310 align:middle line:84%
and specifically
into Adam's Calendar,

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:39.630 align:middle line:90%
where it's even more pronounced.

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:43.110 align:middle line:84%
When we get to Adam's
Calendar-- or as we now know,

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:45.970 align:middle line:84%
Enki's Calendar--
everything we think

00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:48.620 align:middle line:84%
we know about science
and measuring of sound

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:51.030 align:middle line:84%
and frequencies
flies out the window.

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:54.050 align:middle line:84%
Because as you approach
it, and you measure

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:56.290 align:middle line:84%
the sound frequencies,
there's nothing there,

00:24:56.290 --> 00:24:57.700 align:middle line:90%
just ambient noise.

00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And the moment you step
through that imaginary circle,

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:05.610 align:middle line:84%
because there is not even
a wall at Adam's Calendar.

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:08.140 align:middle line:84%
You know, at the stone circles
you can still understand

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:10.210 align:middle line:90%
where the sound is coming from.

00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:11.820 align:middle line:84%
It's coming from
out of the walls.

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:14.270 align:middle line:84%
Yet, at Adam's Calendar
there are no walls,

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:16.120 align:middle line:90%
but the same thing happens.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:17.780 align:middle line:90%
As we approach, nothing.

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:21.620 align:middle line:10%
And the moment you step
into the imaginary circle,

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:27.090 align:middle line:10%
the sound frequencies
go beyond 375 gigahertz.

00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:28.760 align:middle line:10%
This is insane.

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:31.680 align:middle line:10%
I don't think anything in
the history of this planet

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:35.730 align:middle line:10%
has a vein measured at 375
gigahertz that I know of.

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:37.622 align:middle line:84%
Unless you're working
in the secret military,

00:25:37.622 --> 00:25:39.080 align:middle line:84%
or the secret space
program, you're

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:41.480 align:middle line:84%
probably working at those
kind of frequencies.

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:43.690 align:middle line:84%
But certainly not in
nature, and certainly

00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:46.330 align:middle line:90%
not in man-made structures.

00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:48.730 align:middle line:84%
The heat signatures
are spectacular.

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:51.520 align:middle line:84%
Again, outside the
Adam's Calendar

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:54.580 align:middle line:84%
the heat signature
is about 9 degrees,

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:55.780 align:middle line:90%
9 degrees approaching it.

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:59.320 align:middle line:84%
The moment you step right
into the imaginary circle it

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:01.980 align:middle line:90%
shoots up to 77 degrees.

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:04.000 align:middle line:84%
That means you are three
degrees short of being

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.220 align:middle line:90%
on top of a volcano.

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:10.130 align:middle line:10%
The moment you step between
the two central calendar stones

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:12.440 align:middle line:10%
it shoots up beyond 80 degrees.

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:14.160 align:middle line:10%
Now the reading is
telling you you're

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:16.470 align:middle line:10%
standing on top of
an active volcano.

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:19.110 align:middle line:10%
But we know we're not
on top of a volcano.

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:21.500 align:middle line:10%
So clearly, the site
is doing something

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:24.450 align:middle line:10%
that's generating this
incredible heat signature,

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:27.360 align:middle line:10%
suggesting something that
we don't quite understand.

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:29.890 align:middle line:84%
Something strange
is happening here.

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And this all gets exposed
when we start measuring

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:35.230 align:middle line:90%
the electromagnetic fields.

00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:39.420 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
enter Adam's Calendar,

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:43.790 align:middle line:84%
the electromagnetic field
created by the swirling sound

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:47.660 align:middle line:84%
in the very high gigahertz
creates a very powerful

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:51.090 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic field running
horizontally, again, blocking

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:55.240 align:middle line:84%
satellite and making
you lose your GPS signal

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:58.660 align:middle line:84%
until you go between the two
calendar stones in the middle.

00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And there the
electromagnetic field

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:05.050 align:middle line:84%
runs vertically, out of
the ground into the sky.

00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:06.750 align:middle line:90%
This doesn't make any sense.

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:09.060 align:middle line:84%
This is just a
complete confusion.

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:12.330 align:middle line:84%
We have crossing
electromagnetic fields.

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:14.350 align:middle line:90%
That shouldn't happen in nature.

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:16.260 align:middle line:90%
So what have we got here?

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:22.280 align:middle line:84%
We have clear evidence of an
intelligently constructed site.

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And I believe we have
something like this--

00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:30.330 align:middle line:84%
an active vortex, an active
portal constructed by those who

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:32.830 align:middle line:84%
understand the laws
of nature, understand

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:36.240 align:middle line:84%
how to use sound and
frequencies to create

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.540 align:middle line:90%
this kind of energetic site.

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:41.290 align:middle line:90%
Now what was this site used for?

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:43.820 align:middle line:84%
We were already told that
this is where humanity

00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:45.350 align:middle line:90%
was created by the gods.

00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And in future episodes
I can share much more

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:51.700 align:middle line:84%
about that from information,
from channeled information,

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:56.390 align:middle line:84%
and shamanic revelations, and
many other areas of research

00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:58.660 align:middle line:84%
that has come to
me over the years.

00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:01.840 align:middle line:84%
But what was this
possibly used for?

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.250 align:middle line:84%
We learned from
Zecharia Sitchin,

00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:07.340 align:middle line:84%
and from the translations,
that the Annunaki were

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:09.680 align:middle line:90%
taking the gold off the planet.

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:11.590 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to be
consistent with the fact

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:14.970 align:middle line:84%
that there is not much
gold on this planet today.

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And is it possible that
they were using this site

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:21.400 align:middle line:90%
to beam up the gold?

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:23.300 align:middle line:90%
It certainly is quite possible.

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And once we realize that
teleportation is something

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:29.150 align:middle line:90%
that we can do today, already.

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:32.130 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the Annunaki
were possibly doing that.

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And they were not blasting
the gold into space

00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:39.310 align:middle line:84%
with sky ships or rocket ships
as Zecharia Sitchin suggests.

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:42.400 align:middle line:84%
They were actually beaming
it up with ancient sites

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:45.080 align:middle line:84%
like Adam's Calendar and
possibly other sites.

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:48.620 align:middle line:84%
One other great possible site
that they were doing this

00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:54.360 align:middle line:84%
was at Abu Gurab, just
close to the Giza pyramids.

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:57.110 align:middle line:84%
If you look at Abu
Gurab, it so closely

00:28:57.110 --> 00:29:03.900 align:middle line:84%
resembles the Star Trek
beam me up, Scotty platform.

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:05.750 align:middle line:90%
It's actually ridiculous.

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:10.410 align:middle line:84%
You've got this huge,
alabaster crystalline platform

00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:13.980 align:middle line:84%
right in front of the
broken down pyramid that

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:19.280 align:middle line:84%
would have been the source
of energy that energized

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.230 align:middle line:84%
the crystal platform
in front of it

00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:23.910 align:middle line:84%
that would have been the
teleportation device.

00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:29.022 align:middle line:84%
All on a beautiful large
rectangular circuit

00:29:29.022 --> 00:29:30.480 align:middle line:84%
board, if you want
to call it that,

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:33.150 align:middle line:84%
or an energetic
platform that would

00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:35.330 align:middle line:84%
have been used as
a teleportation

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:40.690 align:middle line:84%
device, or a transmutation
device, or something like that,

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:43.980 align:middle line:84%
through the understanding of
the use of sound and resonance

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:45.750 align:middle line:90%
from Mother Earth.

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And that brings us to
the end of this episode,

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:52.310 align:middle line:84%
and how this
information connects

00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:54.040 align:middle line:90%
to many other ancient sites.

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And how these sites were used
in ways that we could not even

00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:02.310 align:middle line:84%
begin to imagine on such
a large and massive scale

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:04.540 align:middle line:90%
that truly boggles the mind.

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:08.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm Michael Tellinger,
and thanks for watching.

00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:12.980 align:middle line:90%
