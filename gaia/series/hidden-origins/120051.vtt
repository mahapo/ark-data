[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:14.090 align:middle line:10%
>>Hello.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.810 align:middle line:10%
I'm Michael Tellinger, and our
journey of discovery continues.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.350 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we get to
really my favorite part.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is what, I
suppose, my life's work

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:31.160 align:middle line:84%
has come to this point, and
to the crossroads of realizing

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.060 align:middle line:84%
that we, as the human
race, can do something

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.220 align:middle line:84%
about the misery, the
unhappiness, and the state

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.340 align:middle line:84%
of our planet that
we find ourselves in.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.680 align:middle line:90%
It's up to us.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.370 align:middle line:84%
We realize that we are truly
the ones we've been waiting for.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's what we do with the
knowledge and information

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.380 align:middle line:84%
that we've gained from the
ancient civilizations, all

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.000 align:middle line:84%
the horrible news, the
disturbing, the dark stuff,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.790 align:middle line:84%
taking that and turning
it into positive energy,

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.060 align:middle line:84%
turning it into a solution
for all our problems,

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.800 align:middle line:84%
a solution to release us
from the state of depression

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.370 align:middle line:84%
and the state of
control, and we find

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.850 align:middle line:84%
this in this very liberating
ancient philosophy

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.260 align:middle line:90%
that the Africans call Ubuntu.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.370 align:middle line:84%
Now this is not
unique to Africa.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.620 align:middle line:84%
All ancient civilizations
around the world,

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.400 align:middle line:84%
all the ancient people
around the world,

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.490 align:middle line:84%
the Native Americans, the
original people of Australia,

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.830 align:middle line:84%
the people of Asia, we all had
a similar philosophy to Ubuntu.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And basically what it comes down
to is, unity within community.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.750 align:middle line:84%
We're going to use this
ancient knowledge and wisdom

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.780 align:middle line:84%
to find a way forward, and
you will realize how simple

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.560 align:middle line:90%
and how liberating this is.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.670 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing these
workshops around the world

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.910 align:middle line:84%
now for a number
of years, and what

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.560 align:middle line:84%
I find is at the
end of the session,

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.620 align:middle line:84%
it is almost like doing
a group therapy session.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.810 align:middle line:84%
I never intended to
do group therapy.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.520 align:middle line:84%
This is the last
thing on my mind.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm just sharing
knowledge and information,

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.040 align:middle line:84%
hoping that people extract the
good news, the positive news,

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.540 align:middle line:84%
discard the dark and
the disturbing stuff,

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.889 align:middle line:84%
and only take out the
good and the positive,

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:12.166 align:middle line:84%
and just use that for
the benefit of humanity.

00:02:12.166 --> 00:02:14.040 align:middle line:84%
But what I've been
finding is that at the end

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.910 align:middle line:84%
of these sessions, it
actually does end up

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.190 align:middle line:84%
being like a transformational
process where people truly

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.310 align:middle line:84%
feel liberated, and they realize
that we have the answers.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.870 align:middle line:84%
We have solutions
for all our problems,

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.290 align:middle line:84%
no matter how dark and deep
you think the problems may be,

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.930 align:middle line:90%
we find the solutions.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.600 align:middle line:84%
And the best part
of this whole thing

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.510 align:middle line:84%
is that I'm not the
one that's going

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:39.680 align:middle line:90%
to give you the solutions.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.200 align:middle line:84%
Each and every one of
you will find and come up

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.780 align:middle line:84%
with the same solutions that
all of us find collectively.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.730 align:middle line:84%
This is the most
incredible thing.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.070 align:middle line:84%
All of us, every
single person I've

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.150 align:middle line:84%
encountered over the
last 10 years or 11 years

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.400 align:middle line:84%
since I've been talking
about this world

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.010 align:middle line:84%
without money, Ubuntu,
and contributionism.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.326 align:middle line:84%
I find that the more
we talk about it,

00:03:02.326 --> 00:03:03.700 align:middle line:84%
the more we look
at the problems,

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.700 align:middle line:84%
the more we solve the problems,
the stronger the system

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.620 align:middle line:90%
and the philosophy becomes.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And the more people tap into
this philosophy, the more

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.830 align:middle line:84%
problems and solutions we
find and we throw at it.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And the more we solve, the
more people take out of it.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.820 align:middle line:84%
It is really like
a self correcting

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.960 align:middle line:84%
system that grows
stronger and stronger,

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.000 align:middle line:84%
and gives people more
and more reason, and more

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.220 align:middle line:84%
and more energy, to
take out for themselves

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.450 align:middle line:84%
and feel more and
more liberated.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.590 align:middle line:84%
It is truly a wonderful
journey of discovery,

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.260 align:middle line:84%
a wonderful journey of self
empowerment, so let's start.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.630 align:middle line:84%
What are we going to talk
about in the next few episodes?

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.560 align:middle line:84%
Much of this information is
being written in the "Ubuntu

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.170 align:middle line:90%
Contributionism" book.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.850 align:middle line:84%
It's, I call it a blueprint
for human prosperity,

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.880 align:middle line:90%
but this is a living philosophy.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.050 align:middle line:84%
This is just the foundation
for ancient knowledge.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.970 align:middle line:84%
The Cherokee people, for
example, have a philosophy,

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.450 align:middle line:84%
and that says, if it's
not good for everyone,

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:02.790 align:middle line:90%
it's no good at all.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually
the same philosophy

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.840 align:middle line:84%
that we've incorporated
into the Ubuntu philosophy,

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.810 align:middle line:84%
creating a bridge between
African and American

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.960 align:middle line:84%
philosophies, of
ancient civilizations.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.959 align:middle line:84%
And this is really echoed very
well throughout the world,

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.040 align:middle line:84%
and people all over the world
have embraced this philosophy

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.520 align:middle line:84%
way beyond my
wildest expectations.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.640 align:middle line:84%
So we are on an 11 year
journey that has brought us

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.170 align:middle line:90%
to this point in time.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.800 align:middle line:84%
What do we do with this
knowledge and information?

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.960 align:middle line:84%
So if you have time, get
the copy of "Ubuntu" book.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.710 align:middle line:84%
Read as much as you
can, because that'll

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.880 align:middle line:84%
give you the foundation
and the platform

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.440 align:middle line:84%
to be able to share
this knowledge

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.670 align:middle line:84%
and information with the people
around you, without feeling

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.510 align:middle line:84%
that you don't quite have
this or don't quite have that.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.820 align:middle line:84%
But, even if you don't
get a copy of the book

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.840 align:middle line:84%
and you just watch
these few episodes,

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.170 align:middle line:84%
this will give you the
foundation that you need,

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:53.600 align:middle line:90%
to give you the confidence.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.550 align:middle line:84%
Some people think
that just by reading

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.810 align:middle line:84%
a few articles and a few
papers on the internet,

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.940 align:middle line:84%
they figured it all out
and they know how it works.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.410 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's not how it works.

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.770 align:middle line:84%
This is a much bigger story
than just a few articles.

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.640 align:middle line:84%
You really have to
internalize this.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.820 align:middle line:84%
You have to feel
completely comfortable

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.220 align:middle line:84%
with every aspect
of this philosophy

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.940 align:middle line:90%
to be able to convey it.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.200 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise what happens is, you
start talking to your friends

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.370 align:middle line:84%
about this, and it's very easy
for people to run you down.

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.090 align:middle line:84%
I know, because of my
own personal experience.

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.810 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you, in
2005, when I first

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.980 align:middle line:84%
started promoting the idea
and the concept of a world

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.760 align:middle line:84%
without money-- because
ultimately, this

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.580 align:middle line:84%
is what it's all about, and
we're going to talk about that

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.560 align:middle line:90%
in great, great detail.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.970 align:middle line:84%
When I start promoting
a philosophy of a world

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.890 align:middle line:84%
without money, you can
imagine the kind of ridicule

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:43.100 align:middle line:90%
that I underwent.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.160 align:middle line:90%
And it just makes you stronger.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And I don't necessarily want
everyone to go through this,

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.840 align:middle line:84%
so I'd like you to learn
from my experience,

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.860 align:middle line:84%
and learn from the experience
of thousands of people that,

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.510 align:middle line:84%
over an 11 year period,
have contributed

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.950 align:middle line:84%
towards this growing body of
knowledge and information,

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.450 align:middle line:84%
creating a very solid foundation
for a simple philosophy

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.130 align:middle line:90%
of ancient civilizations.

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.960 align:middle line:84%
What I realized was, in
2005 while I was writing

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.960 align:middle line:84%
"Slave Species of
god", that-- and this

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.460 align:middle line:84%
is really what
happens when you look

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.960 align:middle line:84%
into studying origins of
humankind, ancient cultures

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.230 align:middle line:90%
and civilizations.

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:20.650 align:middle line:84%
The one thing that
I came across,

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.590 align:middle line:84%
was that money didn't
exist in ancient times,

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:27.060 align:middle line:84%
that people lived and existed
without money for much

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.570 align:middle line:84%
longer than we've lived
and existed with money.

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And that started me
on a path of thinking,

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:34.847 align:middle line:84%
well, how would things
work without money?

00:06:34.847 --> 00:06:36.180 align:middle line:90%
How did people live and survive?

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.100 align:middle line:84%
How did people buy
stuff without money?

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:40.580 align:middle line:90%
And you know what I found?

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:45.230 align:middle line:84%
The more you think about it, the
more you explore and challenge

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.660 align:middle line:84%
yourself on how would this
work and how would that work,

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.700 align:middle line:84%
the solutions that
you come up with

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:55.460 align:middle line:84%
are so amazing and so
simple and so eloquent,

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.920 align:middle line:90%
that it truly blows your mind.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
a world without money

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.880 align:middle line:84%
is far simpler,
far more elegant,

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.970 align:middle line:84%
and far more
sustainable, and far more

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:10.350 align:middle line:84%
abundant than the world we
find ourselves in today.

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:13.440 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of
process, brought me

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.940 align:middle line:84%
to this point in time where,
11 years down the road,

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:22.330 align:middle line:84%
we have a cohesive structure,
a cohesive philosophy.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.501 align:middle line:84%
But as I said, it's a growing--
it's a living philosophy.

00:07:25.501 --> 00:07:27.000 align:middle line:10%
So what else are
we going to discuss

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.340 align:middle line:10%
in the next few episodes?

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.690 align:middle line:10%
We're going to talk about, what
is Ubuntu, its origins, where

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:34.660 align:middle line:10%
I've already given you
some indications and ideas

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.320 align:middle line:10%
of the origins of Ubuntu.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.400 align:middle line:10%
This concept of contributionism.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.200 align:middle line:10%
What is that word?

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.660 align:middle line:10%
Where does it come from?

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.720 align:middle line:10%
We're going to talk about
the origins of money

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.490 align:middle line:10%
and the misconception
about money.

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:48.280 align:middle line:84%
Very few people really know what
money is, where it comes from,

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.560 align:middle line:84%
how it arrived in
our society, why

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:54.010 align:middle line:84%
it has become so inextricably
connected and woven

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:56.810 align:middle line:90%
into every aspect of our lives.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:00.830 align:middle line:84%
Every crack and crevice of our
lives is controlled by money.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:02.560 align:middle line:90%
How did this become like that?

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.400 align:middle line:90%
How do we get to that point?

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.670 align:middle line:10%
We're going to talk
about central banks.

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:09.590 align:middle line:10%
What are central banks, how
did they come into being,

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:13.230 align:middle line:10%
and the global control of those
who control the central banks.

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:15.480 align:middle line:10%
We're going to talk about
the Ubuntu plan of action,

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.760 align:middle line:10%
because ultimately that's
what this knowledge

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.500 align:middle line:10%
and information leads to.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.270 align:middle line:90%
Do we have a plan of action?

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:22.290 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we have.

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:24.850 align:middle line:84%
It's a simple and a
clear plan of action

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:27.380 align:middle line:84%
that so many people
get so excited about.

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:30.900 align:middle line:84%
That's why the Ubuntu movement
is growing exponentially

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.770 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And at this stage,
on the last count

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.440 align:middle line:84%
it looks like we have
supporters and members

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.049 align:middle line:84%
in more than 200
countries of the world.

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:41.900 align:middle line:10%
We're going to talk about
community and political aspects

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.039 align:middle line:10%
of the Ubuntu
movement, and why it's

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:47.240 align:middle line:10%
important to approach it both
from a community development

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.120 align:middle line:10%
and a political approach.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.050 align:middle line:84%
Some people feel a
little bit uncomfortable

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:53.740 align:middle line:84%
with a political aspect, but
it's very important for us

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:54.730 align:middle line:90%
to deal with this.

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:58.610 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, we're going to
continue tripping ourselves up

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:00.720 align:middle line:84%
about this thing
called politics.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:06.060 align:middle line:10%
We're going to talk about free
electricity, and the liberation

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.870 align:middle line:10%
of our scientists to
allow them to create

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:12.620 align:middle line:10%
and invent and deliver new
sources of energy, which

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.540 align:middle line:10%
are called free
electricity, and how

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:18.710 align:middle line:10%
we can use this free electricity
as a tool of unification,

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:23.060 align:middle line:10%
which until now, has been used
as a tool of control, division,

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:24.290 align:middle line:10%
and separation.

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:27.520 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we are a
deeply divided species.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:30.790 align:middle line:84%
We are divided on so many
levels that we can't even

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:33.000 align:middle line:90%
begin to quantify it.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And this is, again, when
you look at our planet,

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:37.930 align:middle line:84%
when you look at
these beautiful images

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:40.840 align:middle line:84%
from space of what the
Earth looks like, it's

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:44.250 align:middle line:84%
like this beautiful, unified
organism, this living,

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:49.840 align:middle line:84%
conscious organism that is
there, that provides the energy

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:53.000 align:middle line:84%
and the consciousness for
everything to exist on it

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:53.500 align:middle line:90%
and in it.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:54.800 align:middle line:90%
And around it.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And the closer we
get to it, the more

00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:59.850 align:middle line:84%
we realize how deeply
divided we are.

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:01.740 align:middle line:90%
We're divided on so many levels.

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:05.890 align:middle line:84%
We're divided by country,
by religion, by language,

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:08.720 align:middle line:84%
by borders, by the
city's we live in,

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.270 align:middle line:84%
by what schools we
go to, by what car

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:14.890 align:middle line:84%
we drive, what credit card
we have, what job we do.

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:17.310 align:middle line:84%
We're divided by
the brands we wear,

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:18.860 align:middle line:84%
and we look down
upon people that

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.725 align:middle line:84%
wear lesser brands because
television has told us

00:10:21.725 --> 00:10:23.800 align:middle line:84%
that this is a more
important brand or a slicker

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:24.910 align:middle line:90%
brand than that.

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:26.150 align:middle line:90%
It's insane.

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:30.090 align:middle line:84%
The division in
humanity is imaginable.

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:33.250 align:middle line:84%
So, we're going to
bridge this division,

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:36.120 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to lay a
platform of unification.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:40.780 align:middle line:84%
And it starts, in my opinion,
and the plan and the philosophy

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:42.320 align:middle line:84%
of the Ubuntu
movement, it starts

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:47.710 align:middle line:84%
by breaking down some of the
most powerful areas of control

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:49.430 align:middle line:84%
that have been
imposed on humanity,

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:52.320 align:middle line:84%
and electricity is
one of those areas.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.590 align:middle line:84%
Between electricity and
pharmaceutics and media,

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:57.910 align:middle line:84%
those three areas
is where humanity

00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:01.490 align:middle line:84%
is being controlled most
efficiently and effectively.

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:04.600 align:middle line:10%
So, we're going to look
at how to use electricity

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.360 align:middle line:10%
as a tool of unification.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.140 align:middle line:10%
We're going to look at the
community projects that

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:12.290 align:middle line:10%
are the drivers of the
transitional phases,

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:14.270 align:middle line:10%
getting us from
where we are today

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:18.070 align:middle line:10%
into a world of utopia,
the Utopian world

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:21.070 align:middle line:10%
that we all want to live in, the
paradise that we can imagine,

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:23.085 align:middle line:10%
the beautiful planet
that most of us

00:11:23.085 --> 00:11:25.610 align:middle line:10%
have imagined at some
stage of our lives.

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And this is all
good news, people.

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:30.970 align:middle line:84%
I want you to remember
that we have the solutions.

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:33.060 align:middle line:84%
Every now and then we
click back into, oh, this

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:35.420 align:middle line:84%
sounds very wonderful
and very Utopian.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:36.970 align:middle line:84%
But I'm telling
you, I'm giving you

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:39.860 align:middle line:84%
the structure and the platform
that this is all possible,

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:40.960 align:middle line:90%
and we can do it.

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.820 align:middle line:84%
We are the ones we've
been waiting for.

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:45.850 align:middle line:10%
If we don't do it, no one
else is going to do it for us.

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:47.810 align:middle line:10%
We're going to continue
with education,

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:51.450 align:middle line:10%
and how education has been
used as a tool of control

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:55.490 align:middle line:10%
against us, creating a platform
for a future working labor

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:59.450 align:middle line:10%
force, not for sharing
knowledge and information

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:05.540 align:middle line:10%
or giving children and ourselves
important skills for life

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:07.240 align:middle line:10%
that'll benefit
us in the future.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.350 align:middle line:84%
We're going to look at education
and how that can play, and will

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:14.630 align:middle line:84%
play, a critical part in the
transitioning process of taking

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:19.130 align:middle line:84%
us from this enslavement
system into the place of unity

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:19.925 align:middle line:90%
and abundance.

00:12:19.925 --> 00:12:21.800 align:middle line:10%
And we're going to talk
about tribal leaders,

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.570 align:middle line:10%
because many parts
of the world still

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:26.010 align:middle line:10%
have traditional
and original people,

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:28.750 align:middle line:10%
with their own tribal leaders,
living in these areas.

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And what a beautiful,
fertile place that is for us

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:35.845 align:middle line:84%
to initiate some of this Ubuntu
and contributionism philosophy.

00:12:35.845 --> 00:12:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk
about other industry.

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:41.410 align:middle line:84%
How will the world without
money affect industries

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:45.600 align:middle line:84%
like mining and manufacturing,
technology, farming.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.590 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk
about Ubuntu warehouses,

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:50.630 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to even talk
about an alternative currency,

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:54.100 align:middle line:84%
and how we can very quickly,
without even realizing this,

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:57.930 align:middle line:84%
by the abundance that we create,
create alternative currencies.

00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
finish this segment,

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.960 align:middle line:84%
these next few episodes,
with the answers

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:06.490 align:middle line:84%
to all the questions
and all the problems.

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:08.780 align:middle line:84%
Because over the
last 11 years, I

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:12.020 align:middle line:84%
think you can imagine that I've
had thousands and thousands

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:14.717 align:middle line:84%
of questions and
doubts, and people

00:13:14.717 --> 00:13:17.300 align:middle line:84%
wondering, how's this going to
work, how's that going to work.

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:22.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to have an answer
to every problem that crops up.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:25.790 align:middle line:84%
What we do is, we collectively
come up with the answers.

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:29.670 align:middle line:84%
All we have to do is to have
the cornerstones in place,

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:32.770 align:middle line:84%
and have the philosophy and
the plan of action in place.

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And once that is
there as a foundation

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.250 align:middle line:84%
to sprout this new
philosophy into being,

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:41.150 align:middle line:90%
the answers present themselves.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And each and every one
of you, by the time

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:44.880 align:middle line:84%
we've finished
here in the series,

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.350 align:middle line:84%
will have all the
answers, and will

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:49.330 align:middle line:84%
be able to answer
all the questions.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:52.330 align:middle line:84%
Because hopefully, if I get
this message across to you

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.560 align:middle line:84%
as successfully as
I hope I'm going to,

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:58.240 align:middle line:84%
you will really be able to
internalize this philosophy

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.760 align:middle line:84%
and be able to find
the answers, know

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.180 align:middle line:90%
where to look for the answers.

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And you, yourselves,
will be able to come up

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:07.730 align:middle line:84%
with all the answers
to so many problems

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:12.060 align:middle line:84%
that, right now, we
think are insurmountable.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:16.030 align:middle line:84%
So, let's get started, and start
with the question, once again,

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:17.570 align:middle line:90%
let's revisit what is Ubuntu.

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:18.910 align:middle line:90%
Where does it come from?

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:23.730 align:middle line:84%
So, it's a simple, ancient,
African philosophy.

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:26.570 align:middle line:84%
A philosophy of
unity consciousness.

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:30.020 align:middle line:84%
A philosophy where
everybody in community

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:32.420 align:middle line:84%
contributes their
skills and talents

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:35.650 align:middle line:84%
for the benefit of everyone
in their community.

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:38.860 align:middle line:84%
It goes against everything
we've been taught, today.

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:41.050 align:middle line:90%
It is unity within community.

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:45.080 align:middle line:84%
One of the most commonly used
definitions for the word Ubuntu

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:50.560 align:middle line:84%
is, I am who I am,
because of who we all are.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.230 align:middle line:84%
All ancient cultures
around the world

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:55.140 align:middle line:84%
have their own
version of Ubuntu.

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:57.020 align:middle line:84%
But because I'm
from South Africa,

00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:01.370 align:middle line:84%
and because many people believe
that the humanity was created

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:05.510 align:middle line:84%
and arose out of Africa, and
specifically Southern Africa,

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:07.610 align:middle line:84%
and the Sumerian texts
and our discoveries

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:09.830 align:middle line:84%
there regarding the
Annunaki and the activities

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:13.460 align:middle line:84%
of the so-called gods gives us
a very clear indication this

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.700 align:middle line:84%
may indeed be the
case, we're going

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.270 align:middle line:84%
to stick with his
word called Ubuntu.

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:23.000 align:middle line:84%
So remember, it's not
Un-buntu, it is Ubuntu.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.890 align:middle line:84%
Once you get the
pronunciation right,

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:26.780 align:middle line:84%
you see how that
resonance actually

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:29.930 align:middle line:84%
helps you to connect with
the word, and the origins

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:32.460 align:middle line:84%
of the philosophy
behind the word.

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:34.890 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned before,
all ancient cultures

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:36.700 align:middle line:90%
have their own version of this.

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:41.480 align:middle line:84%
The Cherokee people of America
have their own expression

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.920 align:middle line:84%
that says, if it's not good for
everyone, it's no good at all.

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And we actually combined that
together with Ubuntu philosophy

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:53.760 align:middle line:84%
to create a more cohesive,
unified version of this.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.030 align:middle line:90%
What is contributionism?

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:58.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I was first
looking at a world

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:02.760 align:middle line:84%
without money, how will this
crazy world work without money,

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:08.150 align:middle line:84%
I realized that we can't go back
to Ubuntu, to ancient cultures,

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:09.180 align:middle line:90%
ancient civilizations.

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:12.260 align:middle line:84%
We can't go back living in
those kind of communities.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.960 align:middle line:84%
We live in the world we
find ourselves in today.

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:15.940 align:middle line:90%
We can't escape that.

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:18.570 align:middle line:84%
Tomorrow morning when I wake
up, I'm still in my house.

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:21.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm still in the suburb
or the town or the city

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:22.150 align:middle line:90%
that I live in.

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:24.550 align:middle line:84%
So, how do we apply
this ancient philosophy

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:26.720 align:middle line:84%
to the modern
world, and the world

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.180 align:middle line:90%
we find ourselves in today?

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's where this word
contributionism comes from,

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:35.460 align:middle line:84%
where we contribute natural
born talents or acquired

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:38.220 align:middle line:84%
skills for the
greatest benefit of all

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:40.470 align:middle line:90%
the people in our communities.

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:43.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the word
contributionism means.

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.480 align:middle line:90%
It is not fascism.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.950 align:middle line:90%
It is not capitalism.

00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:49.530 align:middle line:84%
It is not communism or
socialism or any other ism.

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:54.000 align:middle line:84%
It is a whole new ism that
we've never had before.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.630 align:middle line:90%
Contributionism.

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:57.040 align:middle line:90%
We don't need money.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.360 align:middle line:90%
We don't need barter.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.310 align:middle line:84%
We don't need any formal
value attached to anything.

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:03.930 align:middle line:84%
And we'll start breaking
this construct down,

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:06.589 align:middle line:84%
this matrix that has
been imposed on us where

00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:07.943 align:middle line:90%
money drives everything.

00:17:07.943 --> 00:17:09.609 align:middle line:84%
We're going to break
right through that,

00:17:09.609 --> 00:17:12.800 align:middle line:84%
and realize that
contributionism is really

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.750 align:middle line:90%
the only way out of the system.

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:19.000 align:middle line:84%
So, while we're
speaking about the dos

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.800 align:middle line:84%
and the don'ts,
let's break down,

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:24.819 align:middle line:84%
before we even go into this,
what are the fundamental

00:17:24.819 --> 00:17:26.859 align:middle line:84%
building blocks of
contributionism?

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:30.650 align:middle line:84%
What I call the five point
mantra, and it's very simple.

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:35.100 align:middle line:84%
It breaks away completely from
everything we've been taught,

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:38.800 align:middle line:84%
everything that's been imposed
on us in our current society

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:40.330 align:middle line:90%
and current social structure.

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:42.550 align:middle line:84%
What we're doing
here, people, is we

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:45.420 align:middle line:84%
are creating a whole
new social structure.

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:47.710 align:middle line:84%
Because clearly, the
structure that we've

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:52.490 align:middle line:84%
had for the last 6,000 or 12,000
years, clearly hasn't worked.

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes very obvious
that the social structure

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:59.070 align:middle line:84%
we find ourselves in, has been
maliciously and consciously

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:03.000 align:middle line:84%
imposed on us to turn us
into a species with amnesia,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.600 align:middle line:84%
to turn us into good
slaves that march

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.990 align:middle line:84%
to the rhythm of the drum
of the slave masters.

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:13.140 align:middle line:10%
And everything that we've
been told to be true,

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:15.700 align:middle line:10%
has turned out to be
lies and deceptions.

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:19.840 align:middle line:10%
So, we need to turn that around
180 degrees, and part of that,

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:26.300 align:middle line:10%
is to break down the thousands
and hundreds of years

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:29.420 align:middle line:10%
of brainwashing
and indoctrination,

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:31.750 align:middle line:10%
which is not easy,
because all of us

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:35.050 align:middle line:10%
are born into this
capitalist world.

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:37.350 align:middle line:90%
All of us grow up with money.

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:41.260 align:middle line:84%
We grow into the system that
we find ourselves in, where

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:42.774 align:middle line:90%
things work the way they work.

00:18:42.774 --> 00:18:43.690 align:middle line:90%
We have to have money.

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:44.780 align:middle line:90%
We have to get a job.

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:45.960 align:middle line:90%
Have to go to school.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.090 align:middle line:90%
We go through this process.

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:49.780 align:middle line:84%
It's like everything is
planned and laid out for us.

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:52.660 align:middle line:84%
So, let's start out
right now, dealing

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:55.420 align:middle line:84%
with a whole new way,
where we turn everything

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:57.090 align:middle line:90%
around 180 degrees.

00:18:57.090 --> 00:18:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And this system, these
five point mantra

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:02.440 align:middle line:84%
of contributionism,
is very simple.

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:03.840 align:middle line:90%
No money.

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.170 align:middle line:90%
No barter.

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:06.210 align:middle line:90%
No trade.

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:07.670 align:middle line:90%
And this is critical, people.

00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:11.090 align:middle line:84%
Don't think that we're
going to replace money

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:12.130 align:middle line:90%
with barter and trade.

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:13.588 align:middle line:84%
And many people,
this is where they

00:19:13.588 --> 00:19:15.050 align:middle line:90%
make the mistake, once again.

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:16.881 align:middle line:84%
They discover Ubuntu
and contributionism,

00:19:16.881 --> 00:19:18.380 align:middle line:84%
and they go, yeah,
yeah, we're going

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:20.020 align:middle line:84%
to get into barter
and trade again.

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:21.160 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.310 align:middle line:84%
That's just another
slavery system.

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:26.250 align:middle line:84%
Anyone who has more to
barter or more to trade

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:28.530 align:middle line:90%
will ultimately rule the roost.

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:29.530 align:middle line:90%
And that's how it works.

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:31.990 align:middle line:84%
This is why we have to
move away completely

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:36.310 align:middle line:84%
from any form of exchange,
any form of barter or trade,

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:39.630 align:middle line:84%
and it starts to make sense
as we go through this process.

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:41.500 align:middle line:90%
No value attached to anything.

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:44.552 align:middle line:84%
Value is just a construct of
money or bartering or trading.

00:19:44.552 --> 00:19:46.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, if I give you
10 eggs, what are you

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:47.390 align:middle line:90%
going to give me in return?

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:49.300 align:middle line:84%
What you're giving me
doesn't have the same value

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:50.190 align:middle line:90%
as what I gave you.

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:53.080 align:middle line:84%
You see where the thing of
value becomes a problem.

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:55.300 align:middle line:84%
It is something that
keeps tripping us up,

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.590 align:middle line:90%
and we need to get beyond it.

00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:01.380 align:middle line:84%
We've got to get past this,
and this is the critical point.

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:03.970 align:middle line:84%
Contributionism is a
system that we get rid

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:07.920 align:middle line:84%
of all those negative aspects,
and we bring in an aspect

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.910 align:middle line:84%
where everybody contributes
their natural born

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:14.440 align:middle line:84%
talents or their acquired
skills for the greatest benefit

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:16.270 align:middle line:90%
of everyone in the community.

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:20.300 align:middle line:84%
What contributionism is, is
not a one to one exchange.

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:24.440 align:middle line:84%
We're not creating
communities of sustainability

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.200 align:middle line:90%
or self-sustained communities.

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.700 align:middle line:84%
We are creating
communities of abundance.

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:29.960 align:middle line:90%
How do we do that?

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:33.690 align:middle line:84%
By making everything available
to everyone all the time.

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:38.600 align:middle line:84%
Everything I do is available
to everyone at any time,

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.910 align:middle line:84%
because we're doing
this together.

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:43.380 align:middle line:84%
We're all contributing
our skills

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:46.270 align:middle line:84%
into the pool to be
shared and enjoyed

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:49.300 align:middle line:84%
by everyone,
contributing our skills

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:53.560 align:middle line:84%
and talents for the benefit
of everyone in our community.

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:54.860 align:middle line:90%
Very simple structure.

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:58.700 align:middle line:84%
It's a one to many
exchange, not a one to one.

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:01.110 align:middle line:84%
So please remember,
if anybody tells you--

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:04.230 align:middle line:84%
when you start talking
to people about this,

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:06.300 align:middle line:84%
somebody says, yeah,
yeah, yeah, let's get back

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:07.550 align:middle line:90%
to self-sustained communities.

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:09.466 align:middle line:84%
We need to create a
self-sustaining community.

00:21:09.466 --> 00:21:10.630 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:12.690 align:middle line:84%
And once again,
this is a conclusion

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:16.400 align:middle line:90%
that people jump to quite often.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.510 align:middle line:84%
We're not building
communities of sustainability.

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:21.910 align:middle line:84%
Just the word,
self-sustaining community,

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:24.240 align:middle line:84%
is like we're hanging
on for dear life.

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.990 align:middle line:90%
We're just sustaining ourselves.

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:26.990 align:middle line:90%
We don't want that.

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:28.350 align:middle line:90%
We want to live in abundance.

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:31.310 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we live on
a planet of abundance.

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:34.120 align:middle line:84%
We don't live on a
planet of scarcity.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.850 align:middle line:84%
We live on a planet
of infinite abundance.

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:40.190 align:middle line:84%
One apple tree doesn't
grow another apple tree.

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:43.100 align:middle line:84%
One apple tree grows
thousands of apple trees.

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:47.140 align:middle line:84%
And as we expand on this
philosophy of contributionism,

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:51.506 align:middle line:84%
you realize how simple it is to
move from a planet of scarcity

00:21:51.506 --> 00:21:55.070 align:middle line:84%
where we've been
enslaved and denied

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:58.540 align:middle line:84%
pretty much everything
we want to gain and want

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:01.230 align:middle line:84%
to attain and want
to do in our lives.

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:03.710 align:middle line:10%
We've been deprived
of everything,

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:07.190 align:middle line:10%
all our creative needs
and creative desires

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:11.420 align:middle line:10%
that we want to do, and we can
replace that with abundance

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:13.420 align:middle line:10%
on every possible level.

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:16.600 align:middle line:10%
So, I'd like to remind
you that everything we've

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:19.350 align:middle line:10%
been told and taught is a lie.

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:22.960 align:middle line:10%
And hopefully by now, if you've
watched the rest of the series,

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:27.190 align:middle line:10%
you realize that this
is actually the case,

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:29.860 align:middle line:10%
that somehow Big
Brother, all those that

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:32.150 align:middle line:10%
have been manipulating and
controlling this planet

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:37.020 align:middle line:10%
and controlling the human
race and our slow manipulation

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:40.430 align:middle line:10%
into what we've become
today, have drip fed

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:42.580 align:middle line:10%
us little snippets of truth.

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:45.850 align:middle line:84%
Like, what they do is, they
attach a little bit of truth

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:47.590 align:middle line:90%
to a big, fat lie.

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:50.026 align:middle line:84%
And, like, they'd say,
well, it's raining today.

00:22:50.026 --> 00:22:51.650 align:middle line:84%
Everyone can see it's
raining, but that

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:53.470 align:middle line:90%
is attached to a big fat lie.

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:55.680 align:middle line:84%
They'll tell you, oh, you
look pretty, or whatever.

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:58.460 align:middle line:84%
So they use little
bits of truths

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.250 align:middle line:90%
attached to a big, fat lie.

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And over a compounded,
extended period of time,

00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:06.320 align:middle line:84%
the lies and the
truths are so mixed up

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:09.440 align:middle line:84%
that you can't discern the
truth from the lies anymore.

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And this is the period
and the situation

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:13.340 align:middle line:90%
we find ourselves in right now.

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:16.300 align:middle line:84%
We have no idea what is true,
and what is a lie anymore.

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:19.260 align:middle line:84%
So we have to start
from a clean slate,

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:22.760 align:middle line:84%
as we did with examining
the ancient civilizations,

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:24.647 align:middle line:84%
discovering that they
didn't have money,

00:23:24.647 --> 00:23:27.760 align:middle line:84%
and that money was introduced
as a tool of enslavement

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.660 align:middle line:90%
at a specific point in time.

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:31.420 align:middle line:10%
Everything we've
been told is a lie,

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:35.080 align:middle line:10%
and especially in the field
of science and technology,

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.760 align:middle line:10%
and the laws of nature.

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:40.380 align:middle line:10%
We know, by now, that
we have in us the power

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:44.000 align:middle line:10%
to be co-creators, co-creators
of our own reality,

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.100 align:middle line:10%
of our future.

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And once again, I'd
like to remind you,

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.540 align:middle line:84%
we are the ones we've
been waiting for.

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:51.240 align:middle line:90%
We are in the new age.

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:53.250 align:middle line:84%
We've crossed the
galactic plane.

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:55.880 align:middle line:84%
We are in what the
ancient cultures told us

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.500 align:middle line:90%
the new age will be.

00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:00.190 align:middle line:84%
We're the first wave
of this new age,

00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:02.720 align:middle line:84%
so let's act like
the first wave,

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:04.720 align:middle line:90%
and do something about this.

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:06.410 align:middle line:84%
There are many people
around the world

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:08.450 align:middle line:84%
that now resonate with
a simple philosophy

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:10.220 align:middle line:90%
and the simple message.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:13.210 align:middle line:90%
This philosophy is insatiable.

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:16.220 align:middle line:84%
Once it gets you, once it
resonates in your heart,

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:17.550 align:middle line:90%
you can't shut up.

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:19.710 align:middle line:84%
All you want to do is go
out there and run and tell

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:20.860 align:middle line:90%
everybody about it.

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And I trust the same will
happen to you, so make sure

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:27.180 align:middle line:84%
you prepare yourself with
enough knowledge and information

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:29.810 align:middle line:84%
so that you can share
this philosophy eloquently

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:31.030 align:middle line:90%
and successfully.

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And don't feel
dejected or negated

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.030 align:middle line:84%
if people try and
stop you, because it's

00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:40.730 align:middle line:84%
very easy for people to
break you down and break down

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:42.410 align:middle line:84%
your spirit,
because we've become

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:44.690 align:middle line:84%
negative creatures
because of the system

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:45.600 align:middle line:90%
we find ourselves in.

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:49.330 align:middle line:84%
Many of us are very
negative, and it's

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:53.111 align:middle line:84%
a lot easier to break somebody
down than to support somebody.

00:24:53.111 --> 00:24:54.610 align:middle line:84%
Most of us are
actually more worried

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:58.380 align:middle line:84%
about what our friends and
neighbors and extended circle

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:03.630 align:middle line:84%
of acquaintances will think of
us, than the actual philosophy

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:05.120 align:middle line:90%
and the truth that we share.

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:08.190 align:middle line:84%
We are influenced by the
belief system of others.

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:09.450 align:middle line:90%
Don't do that.

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:11.040 align:middle line:90%
Internalize the philosophy.

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.320 align:middle line:84%
Be strong in your
convictions, and go out there

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:15.940 align:middle line:84%
and share this
philosophy when it starts

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:17.300 align:middle line:90%
to resonate in your heart.

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:19.060 align:middle line:84%
We know from quantum
physics, which

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:21.030 align:middle line:84%
is more than 100
years old already,

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:24.730 align:middle line:84%
which, incidentally, we don't
teach at school at all, that we

00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:27.740 align:middle line:84%
are the makers and the
creators of our own reality.

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:31.070 align:middle line:84%
So, this is why we
can stop bullets.

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:37.340 align:middle line:84%
We should be able to create and
prepare our own future the way

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:39.790 align:middle line:90%
we see it, a Utopian future.

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:41.810 align:middle line:90%
Utopia is not a bad word.

00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:43.970 align:middle line:84%
Quite often, I come across
people and they say,

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:45.880 align:middle line:90%
oh, this is just a Utopian idea.

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.050 align:middle line:90%
I say, yeah, it is.

00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:48.900 align:middle line:90%
Utopia is a good word.

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.120 align:middle line:90%
I like utopia.

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:51.080 align:middle line:90%
I don't like misery.

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:52.240 align:middle line:90%
I don't like slavery.

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:56.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't like any of the stuff
that I've been forced into.

00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:58.080 align:middle line:90%
I don't like exploitation.

00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:59.800 align:middle line:90%
I don't like scarcity.

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:01.654 align:middle line:84%
I want to live in
a Utopian world

00:26:01.654 --> 00:26:03.320 align:middle line:84%
where everything is
possible, everything

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:06.580 align:middle line:84%
is available, where
anything I want to do

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:10.017 align:middle line:84%
is possible and available to
me whenever I want to do that.

00:26:10.017 --> 00:26:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And this is the kind
of future that we

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:12.940 align:middle line:90%
can create for ourselves.

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:14.590 align:middle line:84%
What we're going
to move into is how

00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:18.230 align:middle line:84%
the system and the
world around us

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:22.950 align:middle line:84%
has been developed for us, to
control us, and yet also feed

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:25.640 align:middle line:84%
us with knowledge and
information that gives us

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:28.970 align:middle line:84%
subliminal and subconscious
knowledge to help us

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:33.820 align:middle line:84%
into the future, and there's no
better example than Hollywood.

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:37.190 align:middle line:84%
Just the fact that Hollywood
makes these amazing movies

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:38.750 align:middle line:84%
that, many of you
will be aware of,

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:42.950 align:middle line:84%
are encoded with very advanced
knowledge and information.

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:45.690 align:middle line:84%
By now, you should know that
the wood of a holly tree

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:49.410 align:middle line:84%
was used by wizards and
witches to cast spells, right?

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:51.470 align:middle line:84%
So the whole thing
about Hollywood,

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:54.600 align:middle line:84%
and the fact that Hollywood
makes blockbuster movies--

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.530 align:middle line:84%
where does that word,
blockbuster, come from?

00:26:56.530 --> 00:26:58.630 align:middle line:84%
Who came up with this
word blockbuster?

00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:01.490 align:middle line:84%
Is that something
you'd call to express

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:05.260 align:middle line:84%
a wonderful movie that
everybody loves and everybody is

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:06.510 align:middle line:90%
raving about?

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:08.580 align:middle line:84%
Is it possibly
called a blockbuster

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:12.490 align:middle line:84%
because it busts the block
of our unconsciousness?

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:16.850 align:middle line:84%
I suspect that something around
there is closer to the truth.

00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And once we start exploring
the Hollywood blockbusters,

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:22.690 align:middle line:84%
we realize how
deeply encoded they

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:27.680 align:middle line:84%
are with all this knowledge, and
almost a guideline to show us

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.700 align:middle line:84%
what we should be
doing as humanity.

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:33.610 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, it's encoded
with the blood, guts and gore,

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:35.550 align:middle line:84%
and misery and the
horrible stuff,

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:39.390 align:middle line:84%
the same way that the Bible
is encoded with a soap opera

00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:42.740 align:middle line:84%
storylines, and then the
deeply advanced knowledge

00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:46.770 align:middle line:84%
and information of scientific
and esoteric knowledge

00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:49.060 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual knowledge
and information,

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:52.250 align:middle line:84%
encoded beneath that soap opera
that we read in the Bible.

00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:54.960 align:middle line:84%
The same thing, we find,
in the so-called Hollywood

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.250 align:middle line:90%
blockbusters.

00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:59.970 align:middle line:84%
So, let's finish this
episode here, and move on

00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:04.170 align:middle line:84%
to some of the very important
encoded messages that fill us

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:06.190 align:middle line:84%
with advance knowledge
and information

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:08.850 align:middle line:84%
in some of the best known
movies that came out

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:11.145 align:middle line:84%
a Hollywood over
the last 100 years.

00:28:11.145 --> 00:28:14.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm Michael Tellinger,
and thanks for watching.

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:19.289 align:middle line:90%
