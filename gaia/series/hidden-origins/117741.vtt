00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.720 align:middle line:10%
>>Hello, this is
Michael Tellinger.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.730 align:middle line:10%
And we continue our exploration
of ancient civilizations,

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.780 align:middle line:10%
learning to see what we can
discover in ancient times that

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.110 align:middle line:10%
will benefit us in the future.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And one of these
mysterious discoveries

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.800 align:middle line:84%
is the tools and
artifacts, these strange

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.549 align:middle line:84%
looking tools and
artifacts that I've been

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:34.880 align:middle line:90%
collecting in Southern Africa.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.360 align:middle line:84%
But to understand
these tools, we

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.790 align:middle line:84%
have to realize
that we're dealing

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.330 align:middle line:84%
with an advanced
vanished civilization.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And, unfortunately,
this has completely

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.780 align:middle line:84%
been missed and misunderstood by
historians and archaeologists.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.900 align:middle line:84%
When they discover these
tools and artifacts,

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.230 align:middle line:90%
they simply ignore them.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.000 align:middle line:84%
And this has been the phenomenal
discovery and the conclusion

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.150 align:middle line:90%
that I've reached.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.700 align:middle line:84%
Because all of our history books
and archaeologists will make

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.580 align:middle line:84%
us believe that the
ancients were primitive,

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.000 align:middle line:84%
that we come from caves, and
that these people clearly

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.110 align:middle line:84%
could not have had advanced
knowledge and technology

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.760 align:middle line:90%
the way that we have today.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.830 align:middle line:84%
But, at the same
time, we are told

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.150 align:middle line:84%
that these people with
their clubs and long hair

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.530 align:middle line:84%
are the same people that
build ancient sites like this.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.710 align:middle line:10%
And, in fact, when
you go to Stonehenge,

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.870 align:middle line:10%
you realize that they-- they
keep fooling us and trying

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.280 align:middle line:10%
to shove this down
our throats by having

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.100 align:middle line:10%
these elaborate drawings
of men in loin cloths,

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.860 align:middle line:10%
and long hair, and ropes pulling
these giant blocks onto sites

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.400 align:middle line:10%
to erect Stonehenge.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.960 align:middle line:84%
So they keep proposing
and promoting this lie

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.570 align:middle line:84%
from antiquity to try and keep
us and maintain the species

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:47.620 align:middle line:90%
with amnesia.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.710 align:middle line:84%
And so it's these
people from caves

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.890 align:middle line:84%
that built sites like
this, apparently,

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.930 align:middle line:90%
and places like this.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.910 align:middle line:90%
And it continues.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.870 align:middle line:84%
And-- just the more
you think about it,

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.240 align:middle line:84%
the more you realize
how completely ludicrous

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.780 align:middle line:84%
it is that people from
caves and primitive men

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.760 align:middle line:84%
and women in ancient
times would be

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.030 align:middle line:84%
capable of even building
as fraction of what we

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.250 align:middle line:90%
find in ancient civilizations.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.740 align:middle line:84%
What we find is
that the technology

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.750 align:middle line:84%
used by ancient civilizations
till today has undergone

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.220 align:middle line:90%
some sort of a regression.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we can
truly call ourselves

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.970 align:middle line:90%
a species with amnesia.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.780 align:middle line:84%
Because, clearly, when they
built these ancient sites,

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.140 align:middle line:84%
they did this because
it was easy for them.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.360 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't difficult.
And if we still

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.660 align:middle line:84%
had this capability today, we
would continue building sites

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:35.330 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And, clearly, we
are not doing that.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And this brings us to
the three holy cows

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.120 align:middle line:90%
of our education system.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.340 align:middle line:84%
And we first have to overcome
our misconception about who

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.090 align:middle line:84%
the ancients were,
what they did,

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.180 align:middle line:84%
and the knowledge they held
for us to deal with discovering

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.040 align:middle line:84%
some of this ancient technology
and ancient civilizations.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And these three holy
cows of our education

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.820 align:middle line:84%
are the three fundamental
building blocks

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.560 align:middle line:90%
of our science and physics.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And we keep repeating this
over and over in class.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, if you
reply incorrectly to this,

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.510 align:middle line:84%
you will fail at
school and you'll

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.320 align:middle line:90%
feel really bad about yourself.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.110 align:middle line:84%
And these three points are that
humans evolved out of apes,

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.860 align:middle line:84%
that nothing can travel faster
than the speed of light,

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.610 align:middle line:84%
and that energy cannot
be created or destroyed.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.130 align:middle line:84%
It can only be changed from
one form of energy to another.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.505 align:middle line:90%
Well, these are all three lies.

00:03:28.505 --> 00:03:30.380 align:middle line:84%
These are the lies that
have been shoved down

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.350 align:middle line:84%
our throats for so long that
all of us now believe them.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And we keep regurgitating
these lies over and over again

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.180 align:middle line:84%
because we believe that those
that tell us this information

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.550 align:middle line:84%
are of a higher
authority, that they know

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:43.840 align:middle line:90%
what they're talking about.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.200 align:middle line:10%
But, soon, we discover
that these are just

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.260 align:middle line:10%
perpetuated lies that
keep repeating themselves

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.120 align:middle line:10%
over and over so that we
remain a species with amnesia.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.980 align:middle line:10%
The theory of evolution
has been busted many times.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.310 align:middle line:10%
And there's simply no evidence
that humanity has evolved out

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.110 align:middle line:10%
of apes.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.230 align:middle line:10%
This is clearly a
lie, because anyone

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.560 align:middle line:10%
who has done any
research into this area

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.520 align:middle line:10%
will follow the beautiful
work of the many molecular

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.790 align:middle line:10%
biologists, the scientists, and
especially the geneticists that

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.180 align:middle line:10%
tell us very clearly that the
human DNA, it is not evolved

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.950 align:middle line:10%
DNA.

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.630 align:middle line:90%
It is a spliced DNA.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.720 align:middle line:90%
It is a manipulated DNA.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.500 align:middle line:84%
It is a concoction
of a patchwork of DNA

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.240 align:middle line:84%
that has turned us
into the species

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.855 align:middle line:84%
that we are today, a
species with amnesia.

00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:34.420 align:middle line:84%
I know I'm repeating
this over and over again,

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.820 align:middle line:84%
but we need to internalize this,
that we've been manipulated.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.140 align:middle line:84%
This amnesia has been imposed
on us by-- on purpose.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.530 align:middle line:84%
It is a premeditated
act of amnesia.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.100 align:middle line:84%
So the theory of
evolution has clearly

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.920 align:middle line:84%
been blown out the water
many times over again.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And then we get to the
fact that nothing can

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.270 align:middle line:90%
move beyond the speed of light.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, in 2005, at the Middle
Tennessee State University,

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.000 align:middle line:84%
three undergraduates and
two high school students,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.800 align:middle line:84%
I believe, managed
to propel sound

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.470 align:middle line:90%
beyond the speed of light.

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.920 align:middle line:84%
This is well-documented in the
American Institute of Physics

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:16.670 align:middle line:84%
in 2007 and very quickly hidden
below a pile of disinformation,

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.930 align:middle line:84%
because it is not
good for people

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.480 align:middle line:84%
to know that sound can travel
faster than the speed of light.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, many people would
be very confused by this.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.770 align:middle line:84%
How can sound travel faster
than the speed of light?

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we need to
really go back and re-evaluate

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.520 align:middle line:84%
what we learned about
sound, sound and resonance,

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.330 align:middle line:84%
what it truly is, and how this
sound and resonance brought

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.560 align:middle line:90%
everything into creation.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.000 align:middle line:84%
Remember that if
sound and resonance is

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.800 align:middle line:84%
the source of all things
in creation, surely,

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.340 align:middle line:84%
we should be able
to do everything

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.670 align:middle line:90%
with sound and resonance.

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And remember that
the Bible tells us

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.920 align:middle line:84%
that God said let
there be light.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And light is a
consequence of sound.

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:02.620 align:middle line:84%
So a very simple example
in today's reality,

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.160 align:middle line:84%
in this density,
in this reality,

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.350 align:middle line:84%
on this planet we find
ourselves in today, all of us

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:12.220 align:middle line:84%
know that when you put light
through a specific medium,

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.450 align:middle line:84%
the denser the medium, the
slower the light moves.

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:18.900 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when you put light
through a boson Einstein

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.080 align:middle line:84%
concentrate, which is a
very fancy name for a very

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.720 align:middle line:84%
dense substance, it
slows down the speed

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.260 align:middle line:84%
of light to what is referred
to as bicycle speed.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:33.190 align:middle line:84%
So we know that light slows
down the denser the medium.

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:36.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, the converse
is true for sound.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.370 align:middle line:84%
The denser the medium, the
faster the speed of sound.

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.370 align:middle line:84%
For example, sound moves
a lot faster in water

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.820 align:middle line:84%
because water is a lot
denser than the air.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And so, if you have an
infinitely dense medium,

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.500 align:middle line:90%
sound will move infinitely fast.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.450 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very
simple way of explaining

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:55.670 align:middle line:84%
how sound, even in this
reality, in this density,

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:59.720 align:middle line:84%
can potentially move faster,
and infinitely faster

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.090 align:middle line:90%
than the speed of light.

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.920 align:middle line:84%
But the true understanding,
how sound moves faster

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.220 align:middle line:84%
than the speed of light, and
actually permeates everything

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:11.050 align:middle line:84%
in creation instantly through
the resonance of sound,

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:12.510 align:middle line:84%
comes to us from
an understanding

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:16.230 align:middle line:84%
of the so-called
vacuum, or the ether,

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:20.020 align:middle line:84%
or the other side of this
reality we find ourselves in.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And it has been shown through
various formulas and papers

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.810 align:middle line:84%
written on this density of
the vacuum that shows us

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:31.370 align:middle line:84%
that the density of the vacuum,
as Nassim Haramein would refer

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:34.560 align:middle line:84%
to it, the density of
the vacuum is infinite.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.930 align:middle line:90%
Now what is this vacuum?

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:40.250 align:middle line:84%
The vacuum is this
other side, the portal

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:42.260 align:middle line:90%
to the other dimensions.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, every cell in our
body, at its nucleus,

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.590 align:middle line:84%
has this portal to
these other dimensions.

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:50.180 align:middle line:84%
There's a little
tiny black hole,

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:53.750 align:middle line:84%
or if you want to call it that,
or the portal, the gateway,

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.680 align:middle line:84%
to other dimensions
into this vacuum,

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.470 align:middle line:84%
into the ether of connectedness,
the morphogenetic field that

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:01.300 align:middle line:90%
is sometimes called.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And it is through this
portal, at the center

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:08.150 align:middle line:84%
of every atom in our body,
that the resonance moves

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:12.410 align:middle line:84%
through into infinite density
that connects everything,

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:15.560 align:middle line:84%
every thought we have,
every sound we make,

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.390 align:middle line:84%
every word we speak, every
move and motion we make,

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:23.150 align:middle line:84%
the resonance of that
enters this other dimension

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:25.280 align:middle line:84%
and connects us,
connects our thoughts

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.870 align:middle line:84%
and what we say to this
morphogenetic field

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:30.940 align:middle line:84%
or the vacuum, and as this
information is available

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:34.090 align:middle line:84%
instantly right throughout
the fabric of creation.

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:35.500 align:middle line:84%
So this is a way
that we can look

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:39.870 align:middle line:84%
at how sound travels faster
than the speed of light, sound

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:40.460 align:middle line:90%
and resonance.

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And remember that this can
manifest itself anywhere,

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.040 align:middle line:84%
just like these giant
supercluster galaxies are

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:51.020 align:middle line:84%
forming trillions and
billions of galaxies

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:53.680 align:middle line:84%
out of the center of
a giant black hole

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.500 align:middle line:84%
that keep being
formed and birthed.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.470 align:middle line:84%
This is the same event that
happens on a microscopic level,

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:01.930 align:middle line:84%
from the very large
to the very small.

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:03.580 align:middle line:90%
As above, so below.

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:06.820 align:middle line:84%
This is the magic and
the deep understanding

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:09.760 align:middle line:84%
of source creation and
the resonance field

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.190 align:middle line:90%
that we all find ourselves in.

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:18.190 align:middle line:84%
So this takes us to the third
argument in the holy trinity

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:21.540 align:middle line:84%
of our education system, the
holy cows of our education

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.560 align:middle line:84%
system, the fact that
energy cannot be created.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.470 align:middle line:84%
That it can just be chained
from one form to another.

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:30.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're seeing
supercluster galaxies

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:31.990 align:middle line:90%
being born all the time.

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:34.970 align:middle line:84%
NASA tells us that
from this black hole,

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:36.770 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing these
super-- these galaxies

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:37.770 align:middle line:90%
being born all the time.

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:39.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, where are
they coming from?

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:42.510 align:middle line:84%
This matter-- trillions
and trillions of galaxies

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:45.250 align:middle line:84%
are being born all
the time every second.

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:47.440 align:middle line:84%
So this matter is
coming from somewhere.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And we have all been
told about the Big Bang.

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:52.940 align:middle line:84%
On the one hand, they tell us
that everything in creation

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.720 align:middle line:84%
came out of this moment
called the Big Bang,

00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:01.010 align:middle line:84%
that all the energy came out of
this one spectacular explosion

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:04.529 align:middle line:84%
of matter and energy and
brought forth everything

00:10:04.529 --> 00:10:05.570 align:middle line:90%
that we know in creation.

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:08.180 align:middle line:90%
So we got to make up our minds.

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:11.020 align:middle line:84%
Did we create energy
or was energy created,

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:12.190 align:middle line:90%
everything in creation?

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:16.220 align:middle line:84%
Or was it just compressed
into one final-- finite

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:20.630 align:middle line:84%
or infinite tiny, infinitesimal
blob of energy that is

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:22.780 align:middle line:90%
referred to as the singularity?

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And this is how they
get away with it.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.740 align:middle line:84%
They say that, oh,
it wasn't created.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.100 align:middle line:90%
The energy was already there.

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.910 align:middle line:84%
It was just in a
point of singularity.

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And this is the kind of nonsense
they spin us over and over

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:35.490 align:middle line:84%
again and we keep buying
it and nodding our heads

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:38.520 align:middle line:84%
like silly little children
obeying a higher authority.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're going to-- put
that all out of our heads

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:46.090 align:middle line:84%
and realize that-- that reality
is a lot stranger than most

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:47.190 align:middle line:90%
of us can imagine.

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:49.630 align:middle line:90%
Things are not as they seem.

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:52.990 align:middle line:84%
At the quantum level,
everything breaks down

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:55.380 align:middle line:84%
into a whole
different set of rules

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.800 align:middle line:84%
that we're now
starting to understand

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.530 align:middle line:84%
as we explore the
ancient civilizations

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:02.810 align:middle line:90%
and the technology they used.

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:07.270 align:middle line:84%
And this takes us back to
the tools, these weird tools

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:09.500 align:middle line:84%
and artifacts that
I've been collecting.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.710 align:middle line:84%
And where do these tools
and artifacts come from?

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:14.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, they come from
the mysterious stone

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:16.470 align:middle line:90%
circles of Southern Africa.

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:18.320 align:middle line:84%
But before I get to
the stone circles

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:22.170 align:middle line:84%
and the vanished civilizations
and the mysterious ruins

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:23.940 align:middle line:84%
of Southern Africa,
I want to take you

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:27.630 align:middle line:84%
through some of these very
fascinating tools and artifacts

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:29.060 align:middle line:90%
that I've been collecting.

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And they really
are very strange.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.151 align:middle line:84%
And no wonder our
poor historians

00:11:34.151 --> 00:11:35.650 align:middle line:84%
and archaeologists
have missed them,

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:38.600 align:middle line:84%
because they're just not trained
in this kind of thinking.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.120 align:middle line:84%
They don't think
like scientists.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.090 align:middle line:84%
They don't think about
sound and resonance

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:44.910 align:middle line:84%
and what these tools and
artifact could possibly do.

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:47.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, they look
for Stone Age tools.

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:49.710 align:middle line:84%
They look for pottery
and fragments,

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:52.310 align:middle line:84%
and then they put together
a silly little story

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:55.267 align:middle line:84%
about some people that occupied
this land and they lived here

00:11:55.267 --> 00:11:56.350 align:middle line:90%
and they moved over there.

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:58.660 align:middle line:84%
And this is all
nonsensical garbage

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:01.470 align:middle line:84%
because it just shows us
that there was occupation.

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:04.790 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't prove the
source of construction.

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:08.370 align:middle line:84%
So just to show you some
beautiful photographs

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:10.400 align:middle line:84%
over the past eight
years of my life

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:14.600 align:middle line:84%
that I've collected of finding
these weird, anomalous tools.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And I guess-- I suppose we can
actually start calling them

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:21.470 align:middle line:84%
a new class of tool, because
we find out that they really

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:26.280 align:middle line:84%
are a very special kind of tool
that work in very special ways.

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And very special
emphasis is placed

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:31.825 align:middle line:84%
on these cone
shaped tools that I

00:12:31.825 --> 00:12:36.400 align:middle line:84%
will talk about in a lot more
detail in the next episode.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And these cone shaped
tools I started finding all

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.040 align:middle line:90%
around the stone circles.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And it is just phenomenal that
there are so many of them.

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:48.700 align:middle line:84%
And not just throughout
the stone circles, but all

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:49.850 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And then these famous
sacred stones, or donut

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:55.220 align:middle line:84%
shaped stones, that
you find scattered

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:56.800 align:middle line:90%
all over Southern Africa.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And they are thousands, if
not hundreds of thousands,

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:00.530 align:middle line:90%
that these stones.

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:03.050 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean that they
are easy to find or easy

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:04.430 align:middle line:90%
to lay your hands on.

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And then these strange
elongated stones

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:09.360 align:middle line:84%
that look like French
loaves of bread that

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.540 align:middle line:84%
ring like bells,
that really brought

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.770 align:middle line:84%
a whole different way
of thinking to my mind

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:15.940 align:middle line:84%
as to what it is that
we're dealing with.

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And phallus stones that
lie scattered around

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.800 align:middle line:90%
and near the stone ruins.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.840 align:middle line:84%
Phallus stones, smaller,
and some very large,

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:28.610 align:middle line:84%
that clearly had a very
important symbolic place

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:31.210 align:middle line:90%
in these ancient civilizations.

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And then the phenomenal bird
shaped stones, and birds

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:38.100 align:middle line:84%
on pedestals, that we find
in the Great Zimbabwe ruins,

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:42.990 align:middle line:84%
and also in the ruins and around
the ruins in Southern Africa.

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:46.320 align:middle line:84%
I've been collecting these
strange bird shaped stones

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.920 align:middle line:84%
that I believe are actually
the early prototypes

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.220 align:middle line:84%
to the Zimbabwean
birds that became very

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:55.380 align:middle line:84%
famous from the mid 1800s,
as they became excavated

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:57.410 align:middle line:90%
at the Great Zimbabwe ruins.

00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:02.130 align:middle line:84%
This is a phenomenal example
of this ancient carving

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:06.180 align:middle line:84%
of a bird shaped stone that I
will talk about later, again,

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:09.130 align:middle line:84%
when we talk about the
dating of these stones

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:10.840 align:middle line:84%
and the dating of
some of these tools

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:14.790 align:middle line:84%
and artifact which takes us
back much further back in time

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:17.630 align:middle line:84%
than most of us could
have possibly imagined.

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:20.580 align:middle line:84%
So where do these tools
and artifacts come from?

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:24.300 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned, from the
proximity of the stone

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:27.960 align:middle line:84%
circles and the stone
ruins in Southern Africa.

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And these stone ruins have
often been called cattle corral.

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And cattle corral
means an enclosure

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:37.810 align:middle line:84%
for cows or
domesticated animals.

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And, unfortunately,
the ignorance

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:42.200 align:middle line:84%
of our academics,
and the historians,

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:46.320 align:middle line:84%
and the archaeologists that
keep exploring and excavating

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:49.660 align:middle line:84%
these ancient sites, which I
must tell you is really very

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:51.970 align:middle line:84%
rare, not much
excavation and exploring

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:54.350 align:middle line:84%
is going on in
these ancient sites,

00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:57.340 align:middle line:84%
they just keep seem to
regurgitate the same story

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:59.950 align:middle line:84%
from previous textbooks
and previous books

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:02.650 align:middle line:84%
with the same disinformation
and a lack of knowledge

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:04.100 align:middle line:90%
of what was really going on.

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And they keep referring to them
as dwellings and cattle corral

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:10.270 align:middle line:90%
of little historic value.

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:14.250 align:middle line:84%
But the first references we get
about these ancient structures

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:18.310 align:middle line:84%
in Southern Africa actually
come to us from 500 years ago,

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:21.890 align:middle line:84%
from the late 1400s
and the early 1500s,

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:24.740 align:middle line:84%
from people like Joe
de Barros and Antonio

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:27.120 align:middle line:84%
Fernandez, the
Portuguese explorers that

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:30.610 align:middle line:84%
first came around the Cape
of Good Hope around Cape Town

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:32.140 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.290 align:middle line:84%
500 years ago, and
they came on shore

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:38.900 align:middle line:84%
and they met the Karanga people
and the Makaranga people.

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk more
about those as well,

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:43.900 align:middle line:84%
because they hold a very
special place in the connection

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:46.170 align:middle line:84%
to gold mining in
Southern Africa,

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:49.310 align:middle line:84%
and the connection between
Southern Africa and Asia.

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And they came on shore and they
found many, many of these stone

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:57.090 align:middle line:84%
circular structures, these stone
circles in these ancient sites.

00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And when they asked the
locals who built these sites,

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:02.670 align:middle line:84%
they were clearly told
that they didn't know.

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:06.110 align:middle line:84%
The locals in the late
1400s and early 1500s

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:09.490 align:middle line:84%
told the Portuguese explorers
they did not know who

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:11.710 align:middle line:90%
built these ancient structures.

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:14.110 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, our
modern day historians

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:15.870 align:middle line:84%
have been overcome
by ego and they

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:17.839 align:middle line:84%
seem to think they
know exactly who built

00:16:17.839 --> 00:16:19.380 align:middle line:84%
these structures,
when they built it,

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:20.550 align:middle line:90%
and why they built it.

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:23.310 align:middle line:84%
So they go completely
against the knowledge

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:24.930 align:middle line:90%
of ancient civilizations.

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And you see, in
their lies a catch as

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:32.150 align:middle line:84%
to how you create a
species with amnesia,

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:37.530 align:middle line:84%
a very slick manipulation of
the facts and historic events.

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:41.790 align:middle line:84%
One little slick move like
that, and a whole generation

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:44.870 align:middle line:84%
and 500 years of
knowledge gets wiped out.

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:46.870 align:middle line:84%
The ancient cultures
told us they did not

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:49.290 align:middle line:84%
know who built these
stone structures,

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:52.720 align:middle line:84%
but that's not what our
history books reflect today.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.580 align:middle line:84%
The stone ruins of South
Africa and Southern Africa,

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:59.780 align:middle line:84%
which covers large parts
of South Africa, Zimbabwe,

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:03.910 align:middle line:84%
Botswana, Mozambique, and
even across the Zambezi River

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:06.869 align:middle line:90%
into Zambia are spectacular.

00:17:06.869 --> 00:17:08.619 align:middle line:90%
And there are many of them.

00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And they've been written
about, as I mentioned,

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:13.500 align:middle line:90%
from the Portuguese era already.

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And also, then,
started being explored

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:20.260 align:middle line:84%
by the German and British
archaeologists in the mid 1900s

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.040 align:middle line:90%
right through the early 1900s.

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Fascinating thing is that
obviously Great Zimbabwe

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:29.200 align:middle line:84%
is part of all this activity
in South Africa, Southern

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:33.180 align:middle line:84%
Africa, Great Zimbabwe being
in modern day Zimbabwe.

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:36.180 align:middle line:84%
And-- but Great Zimbabwe,
the last excavations

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:39.370 align:middle line:84%
that happened at Great
Zimbabwe happened in 1930,

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:41.380 align:middle line:90%
according to my latest research.

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:44.800 align:middle line:84%
It just shows you how this kind
of knowledge is suppressed.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.420 align:middle line:84%
It's just like the
pyramids, you know?

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:49.330 align:middle line:84%
No more excavation is
happening around the pyramids,

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:51.840 align:middle line:84%
although there's clearly a
lot of stuff being covered

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.230 align:middle line:90%
by the sand in the desert.

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:54.930 align:middle line:84%
But they don't want
to go dig there

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:56.720 align:middle line:84%
because they know
what they're going

00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:00.050 align:middle line:84%
to uncover is not going
to be good for suppressing

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:03.340 align:middle line:84%
the ancient knowledge
and the advanced ability

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:05.630 align:middle line:90%
of the ancient civilizations.

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:09.090 align:middle line:84%
So just to show you some of
the spectacular photographs

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:13.220 align:middle line:84%
of these mysterious stone
structures in Southern Africa,

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:15.210 align:middle line:84%
many of these
pictures were taken

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:18.290 align:middle line:84%
by Johan Heine over
a 15 year period

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:20.440 align:middle line:84%
while he started
recognizing that we're

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:23.480 align:middle line:84%
dealing with some very
mysterious ancient structures

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:25.020 align:middle line:90%
and civilizations.

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And he put together a
spectacular collection

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:30.300 align:middle line:84%
of aerial photographs
that clearly show us

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:33.860 align:middle line:84%
that there was a lot of
activity going on here

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:35.440 align:middle line:90%
at the southern tip of Africa.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.930 align:middle line:84%
What you'll note is that
all of these ancient ruins

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:42.370 align:middle line:84%
are circular, and yet each
one is completely unique.

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:45.610 align:middle line:84%
No two stone circles, as they
have become affectionately

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:47.410 align:middle line:90%
called, are the same.

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:50.030 align:middle line:84%
Every one is completely
unique and we

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:55.350 align:middle line:84%
find some very interesting
shapes and structures

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:58.000 align:middle line:84%
that come out of them,
these strange looking horse

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.620 align:middle line:84%
shoes, that horseshoe shapes
that come out of them,

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:02.910 align:middle line:84%
or ohm shaped patterns
that come out.

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:04.960 align:middle line:84%
And that becomes
critical when we later

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:09.230 align:middle line:84%
start realizing what-- or
uncovering-- or figuring out

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:11.320 align:middle line:84%
what these ruins
actually all about.

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:14.060 align:middle line:84%
Horseshoe shapes,
keep that in mind.

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And the stone structures
are phenomenal.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:19.180 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, we run into
these beautiful flower

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:21.950 align:middle line:84%
shaped patterns, flower
shaped stone ruins.

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:24.110 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we can only
see this once you

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:27.060 align:middle line:84%
start looking at them from
an aerial perspective.

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:30.620 align:middle line:84%
Until then, you don't
really know what's going on.

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:33.470 align:middle line:84%
So what is so special
about all these ruins?

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, they all seem to be
aligned-- well, all the ones

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:37.420 align:middle line:90%
that we've measured.

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And, again, this is
the pioneering work

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:43.030 align:middle line:84%
of Johan Heine, when he
started exploring these ruins

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:46.400 align:middle line:90%
in the '90s and early 2000s.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.330 align:middle line:84%
Realize that they
seem to be aligned

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:50.850 align:middle line:84%
with the movement of the
sun, with the solstices

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:52.130 align:middle line:90%
and the equinoxes.

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And sacred geometric
patterns are

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:56.370 align:middle line:90%
built into these structures.

00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:58.390 align:middle line:90%
And it truly boggles the mind.

00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:00.690 align:middle line:84%
Because, clearly,
this was by design.

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:01.980 align:middle line:90%
This is not by accident.

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:04.310 align:middle line:90%
You don't do this by accident.

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:07.590 align:middle line:84%
This has taken a lot of
planning, a lot of work,

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:09.940 align:middle line:84%
and a detailed
understanding of what's

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:13.760 align:middle line:84%
going on around us, the
solar system, the stars,

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.360 align:middle line:84%
the movement of the stars,
the movement of the sun.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:19.320 align:middle line:84%
And we start seeing
star tetrahedrons

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:22.480 align:middle line:84%
appear in the structure
of these stone ruins.

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:24.620 align:middle line:84%
We realize that
whoever built this

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:27.650 align:middle line:84%
had a deep understanding
of the laws of nature

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:31.830 align:middle line:84%
and the nature of reality
that we find ourselves in.

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:35.720 align:middle line:84%
Fascinating thing about
these stone circles

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:39.030 align:middle line:84%
is that they are all connected
by these weird looking

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:39.530 align:middle line:90%
channels.

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:41.820 align:middle line:84%
They look like roads
when you look at them

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:44.250 align:middle line:84%
from aerial photographs,
but they have nothing

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:45.290 align:middle line:90%
to do with roads.

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And, unfortunately, our
historians and archaeologists

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:51.750 align:middle line:84%
today still claim
that these are roads.

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:54.490 align:middle line:84%
They still claim that these
are roads that created a very

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:55.810 align:middle line:90%
cohesive community.

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:58.820 align:middle line:84%
I have to tell you categorically
that these are not roads.

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:00.650 align:middle line:84%
They have nothing
to do with roads.

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:04.370 align:middle line:84%
They are far more advanced in
their use and in their nature.

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:08.400 align:middle line:84%
So I call them channels
that connect all these stone

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:11.470 align:middle line:84%
structures for hundreds
and hundreds of miles.

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:16.650 align:middle line:84%
No stone circle stands alone
in the original structure

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:21.170 align:middle line:84%
and in the original
cluster of stone ruins

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:26.170 align:middle line:84%
that create large and cover
large areas of Southern Africa.

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:28.190 align:middle line:84%
And some of these
aerial photographs

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:32.800 align:middle line:84%
clearly show us that these
channels are a main feature

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.830 align:middle line:90%
of these stone structures.

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And notice that these
stone circles are also

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.500 align:middle line:90%
inside much larger grids.

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:42.890 align:middle line:84%
They're like giant spiders
webs and hold them together.

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:44.740 align:middle line:90%
No stone circle stands alone.

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:48.890 align:middle line:84%
It is a huge network of
stone circles connected

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:51.900 align:middle line:84%
by these channels, and
this giant spider's web

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:55.490 align:middle line:84%
of what seems to be terraces
and other activity that holds it

00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:58.990 align:middle line:84%
all together, agricultural
terraces that run

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:00.410 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of kilometers.

00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:02.500 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there were
some researchers

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.500 align:middle line:84%
in the '60s and '70s
that claim that there

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:10.040 align:middle line:84%
are more than 450,000
square kilometers

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:13.710 align:middle line:84%
of agricultural terraces that
cover South Africa and Great

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:14.620 align:middle line:90%
Zimbabwe.

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:16.850 align:middle line:84%
This clearly gives
us an indication

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:20.770 align:middle line:84%
that we're dealing with a large
population in ancient times.

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And this flies right in
the face of all our history

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:27.100 align:middle line:84%
books that tell us Southern
Africa was a sparsely

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:29.350 align:middle line:90%
populated part of the world.

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:31.820 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a look at some
of these agricultural terraces

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:34.720 align:middle line:84%
because they really are
spectacular when you start

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:37.440 align:middle line:84%
seeing-- when you drive
around Southern Africa,

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.110 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the
town that I live in,

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:41.680 align:middle line:84%
Waterval Boven, the
mountains are literally

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:43.130 align:middle line:90%
covered in these terraces.

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:45.160 align:middle line:84%
When you start looking
at aerial photographs,

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.360 align:middle line:84%
from Google photographs,
you see images

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:50.270 align:middle line:84%
like this that clearly show
you large parts of Southern

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:54.640 align:middle line:84%
Africa covered in agricultural
terraces, ancient terraces.

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:58.260 align:middle line:84%
Some of the aerial shots
from Botswana, Botswana

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:00.970 align:middle line:84%
is known as the mountain
kingdom of Botswana,

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:03.200 align:middle line:90%
there are mountains everywhere.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And I tell you, it
is almost impossible

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:10.110 align:middle line:84%
to look on Google Earth and
find any part of Botswana that

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:13.640 align:middle line:84%
does not have agricultural
terraces on it.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:16.150 align:middle line:84%
It is impossible for
the ancient cultures

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:19.420 align:middle line:84%
to have created so many
agricultural terraces

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:23.510 align:middle line:84%
with such a sparse population
as our history books claim.

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:26.250 align:middle line:84%
And wherever you go, if
you keep your eyes opened

00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:28.180 align:middle line:84%
and if you know what
you're looking for,

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:31.590 align:middle line:84%
you'll find these terraces
that cover entire mountains

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:33.520 align:middle line:90%
and truly take your breath away.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.630 align:middle line:84%
This is a photograph
taken just up the road

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:37.870 align:middle line:84%
from my house that
show you stone

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:41.670 align:middle line:84%
circles, agricultural terraces,
like the spider's web,

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:43.860 align:middle line:84%
and the channels that
run between the circles

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:47.030 align:middle line:84%
and connect them to this
huge grid that covers

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:49.540 align:middle line:90%
large parts of Southern Africa.

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:51.430 align:middle line:84%
This is the top of
that same mountain.

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And from this particular
vantage point,

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:58.370 align:middle line:84%
I'd guess the radius would
be about 50 to 60 miles

00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:01.750 align:middle line:84%
in any direction, that the
ancient structures would

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:03.490 align:middle line:90%
have covered that whole area.

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:07.010 align:middle line:84%
It is truly a spectacular
site even today.

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:10.180 align:middle line:84%
The other mysterious
anomaly are the fact

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:13.920 align:middle line:84%
that archaeological
drawings from 1939 already,

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.960 align:middle line:84%
that were initiated by the
University of Bloemfontein,

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:19.900 align:middle line:84%
show us very clearly
that these stone

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:23.770 align:middle line:84%
circles, or these ancient ruins,
had no doors and entrances,

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:26.950 align:middle line:84%
and that they were all connected
together, to each other,

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:29.180 align:middle line:84%
by these strange
looking channels.

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:32.000 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes,
these stone circles

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.360 align:middle line:10%
were concentric circles
with no doors and entrances,

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:39.070 align:middle line:10%
making it even more mysterious,
connected to each other

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:40.870 align:middle line:10%
by these channels.

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:44.520 align:middle line:84%
So anyone that claims that
these are dwellings for people

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:51.060 align:middle line:84%
or housing for cows is
clearly misguided and clearly

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:55.270 align:middle line:84%
does not have enough
information about the origins

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:58.110 align:middle line:84%
of these structures and
how they were manipulated.

00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:01.160 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it is true that
many of these structures

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:06.070 align:middle line:84%
were later used, and
reconverted, and adapted

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:08.560 align:middle line:90%
to migrating tribes of people.

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And they were occupied,
but they-- that

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:13.850 align:middle line:84%
does not mean that these
were the original tribes that

00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:14.850 align:middle line:90%
built them.

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:17.900 align:middle line:84%
Occupation does not
mean construction.

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:21.670 align:middle line:84%
Or proof of occupation is
not proof of construction.

00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we need to
remind ourselves all the time.

00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:28.260 align:middle line:84%
The question is how
many of these stone

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:30.520 align:middle line:84%
ruins are there in
Southern Africa.

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
everything we thought

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:36.760 align:middle line:84%
we knew about our human history
flies right out of the window.

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:40.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, our counting of the
stone ruins of Southern Africa

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:44.400 align:middle line:84%
begins in around 1891 with
the brilliant Theodore Bent.

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And Theodore Bent wrote
some spectacular information

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:50.960 align:middle line:84%
and wrote a phenomenal book
on the vanished civilizations

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.990 align:middle line:84%
of Mashonaland and
Southern Africa.

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:55.750 align:middle line:84%
He spent several years
traveling on horseback,

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:58.080 align:middle line:84%
exploring the ruins
of Southern Africa,

00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:01.800 align:middle line:84%
the stone circles of South
Africa, Botswana, and Zimbabwe,

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:05.100 align:middle line:84%
and gives us an incredible
amount of information.

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:08.820 align:middle line:84%
He's also the first guy that
truly explored and excavated

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:09.920 align:middle line:90%
Great Zimbabwe.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I
show Great Zimbabwe

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:14.490 align:middle line:90%
in this-- in this slide.

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:17.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, Theodore Bent,
in 1891, already

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:21.000 align:middle line:84%
estimated that there were about
4,000 of these stone ruins.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And that is already
a large number,

00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:25.390 align:middle line:84%
if you take into
consideration this is supposed

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:28.550 align:middle line:84%
to be a sparsely populated
part of the world

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:30.800 align:middle line:84%
according to our
modern historians.

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:34.010 align:middle line:84%
Then, by 1974,
Roger Summers, who

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:37.640 align:middle line:84%
was at that stage
the chief historian

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:41.470 align:middle line:84%
and the chief of antiquities in
Southern Africa and Zimbabwe,

00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:44.880 align:middle line:84%
he did a very more
elaborate calculation

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:48.390 align:middle line:84%
and calculated about 20,000
of these stone ruins.

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:50.220 align:middle line:90%
And this clearly blew my mind.

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:53.410 align:middle line:84%
I discovered this
around the year 2005

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:56.790 align:middle line:84%
that there was this mysterious
history of thousands

00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:59.770 align:middle line:84%
of ancient stone ruins in
Southern Africa that has really

00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:03.880 align:middle line:84%
been kept away from the main
population in Southern Africa.

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:06.690 align:middle line:84%
The average person
is not aware of this.

00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:10.850 align:middle line:84%
And by the time I
got involved in 2005,

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:13.130 align:middle line:84%
I called up the retired
head of archaeology

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:16.830 align:middle line:84%
at Wits University, my old
university, Revel Mason,

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:19.930 align:middle line:84%
who was very outspoken about
all the stuff in his day.

00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him on the phone,
Revel, how many of these stone

00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:24.900 align:middle line:90%
circles do you think we have.

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:26.640 align:middle line:90%
He didn't even blink an eye.

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:30.770 align:middle line:84%
Off the bat, he just blurted out
there must be at least 100,000

00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:31.830 align:middle line:90%
of these.

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:35.570 align:middle line:84%
Remember, at this stage, I still
believed, like everybody else,

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:37.540 align:middle line:84%
that these were dwellings,
dwellings for people

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:39.800 align:middle line:90%
or possibly enclosures for cows.

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:43.280 align:middle line:84%
So when Revel Mason told me
that there were at least 100,000

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.250 align:middle line:90%
of these, I got very excited.

00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:47.390 align:middle line:84%
Because, at this stage,
I had probably walked

00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:49.400 align:middle line:84%
through at least 1,000
of these stone circles

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:52.110 align:middle line:84%
myself, evaluating
and exploring them

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:55.080 align:middle line:84%
for my own-- for
my own research.

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:57.450 align:middle line:84%
So when he said 100,000,
I got very excited

00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:00.280 align:middle line:84%
and I said, Revel, that's
great news because I believe

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.800 align:middle line:90%
there are 100,000 as well.

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.990 align:middle line:90%
But this poses a problem.

00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:08.800 align:middle line:84%
This means, if we allocate say
10 people per stone circle,

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:12.530 align:middle line:84%
that means we're dealing with a
population of a million people.

00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is not according
to our history books.

00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:17.970 align:middle line:84%
At which point
Revel Mason told me,

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:21.450 align:middle line:84%
well, then there can't
be 100,000 ruins.

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:22.290 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:25.160 align:middle line:84%
Just like our
academics do, go back

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.360 align:middle line:90%
to what the textbooks tell us.

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:30.610 align:middle line:84%
The population of Southern
Africa was very, very small.

00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:33.170 align:middle line:84%
It was a sparsely populated
part of the world.

00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And, therefore, it's
impossible for there--

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:39.250 align:middle line:84%
for there to have been a million
people to build 100,000 ruins,

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:41.210 align:middle line:84%
and, therefore, there
can't be 100,000 ruins,

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:43.670 align:middle line:84%
although the evidence
is all around us.

00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:45.190 align:middle line:90%
And so it goes.

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:48.660 align:middle line:84%
So before I wrote "Adam's
Calendar" and "Temples

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:51.420 align:middle line:84%
of the African Gods,"
I wanted to present

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:53.660 align:middle line:84%
some scientific
proof and evidence

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:55.880 align:middle line:90%
that there were around 100,000.

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And I was really
hoping that I would

00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:00.360 align:middle line:84%
find the evidence I was
looking for, that there

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:02.160 align:middle line:90%
were 100,000 of these ruins.

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:05.080 align:middle line:84%
Because I believe
that that would really

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:08.130 align:middle line:84%
elevate the research
and the interest

00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:11.210 align:middle line:84%
in this part of the
world and highlight

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:14.330 align:middle line:84%
the fact that we're dealing
with vanished civilizations.

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:15.740 align:middle line:90%
So I started counting.

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:17.790 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at
aerial photographs,

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:21.200 align:middle line:84%
I looked at Google, I looked
at everything I could possibly

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:24.210 align:middle line:84%
lay my eyes on and
lay my hands on,

00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:27.470 align:middle line:84%
and I got averages, you
know, per square kilometer.

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:30.520 align:middle line:84%
I looked at all of Southern
Africa and Zimbabwe.

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:32.640 align:middle line:84%
I looked at all-- wherever
I could find terraces

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:35.030 align:middle line:84%
and activity around
the terraces,

00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:37.500 align:middle line:84%
and the-- you know, just
south of Johannesburg,

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.010 align:middle line:84%
at Suikerbosrand, there are
thousands of these stone

00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:42.010 align:middle line:84%
circles that are
completely ignored

00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:45.390 align:middle line:84%
by historians, and
archaeologists, and academia.

00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:48.685 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at other
side of Rustenburg,

00:29:48.685 --> 00:29:52.180 align:middle line:84%
where I matriculated, and where
I grew up the last few years

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:53.430 align:middle line:90%
of my high school.

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:54.905 align:middle line:84%
On other side of
Rustenburg, there

00:29:54.905 --> 00:29:57.630 align:middle line:84%
are settlements like this
that are so dense that

00:29:57.630 --> 00:29:59.220 align:middle line:90%
truly boggle the mind.

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:02.450 align:middle line:84%
This is about a five
square kilometer area.

00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:05.990 align:middle line:84%
And by the time I
finished counting,

00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:08.030 align:middle line:90%
I could not believe my eyes.

00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And I recounted
over and over again,

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:12.310 align:middle line:84%
because I thought I
was making a mistake.

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:15.200 align:middle line:84%
Because I counted that there
were more than 10 million

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.630 align:middle line:90%
of these ancient sites.

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:19.990 align:middle line:84%
And this clearly
tells us that we're

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:22.920 align:middle line:84%
dealing with a
vanished civilization

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:25.740 align:middle line:84%
that we know absolutely
nothing about.

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And we have to go back
and start from scratch.

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:31.430 align:middle line:84%
Because we realize
that everything

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:34.682 align:middle line:84%
we've been told about our
history has been a lie.

00:30:34.682 --> 00:30:38.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm Michael Tellinger,
and thanks for watching.
