00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.200 align:middle line:84%
>>Welcome to the second episode
of the UBUNTU Contributionism

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.390 align:middle line:90%
Workshop.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.080 align:middle line:84%
We're going to pick
up where we left off

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.270 align:middle line:84%
in the previous session,
and that is with how simple

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.920 align:middle line:84%
the transition to the new
future of humanity is,

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.910 align:middle line:84%
and how simple it can be,
how simple it is going to be.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And to remind us that it is so
simple, we can't screw it up.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.650 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I say it is
because the whole Ubuntu

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.290 align:middle line:84%
system is an ancient
system, and it was ancient

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.280 align:middle line:84%
because ancient cultures
embraced it for a reason,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.400 align:middle line:90%
because it is a natural system.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.060 align:middle line:84%
I say that it's so easy
we can't screw it up

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.330 align:middle line:84%
because it follows the
natural order of things.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And it follows the
laws of nature.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And in many instances,
in most of the activities

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.660 align:middle line:84%
and that you'll find as we
process this information, most

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.940 align:middle line:84%
of the time, we follow
the laws of nature,

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.970 align:middle line:84%
and we follow sacred geometry in
its spectacular various forms,

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.870 align:middle line:84%
and its multiple fractals that
it manifests in this reality.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.480 align:middle line:84%
So no matter how hard we
try, we can't screw it up.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And like I mentioned before,
over an 11-year period,

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.570 align:middle line:84%
I've had hundreds of thousands
of problems and naysayers,

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.520 align:middle line:84%
and people trying to break
this down and reduce it

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.930 align:middle line:90%
to a bad idea.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And the more questions and
the more comments we get,

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.200 align:middle line:90%
the stronger the system becomes.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.500 align:middle line:84%
The more questions
we answer, the more

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.160 align:middle line:90%
it strengthens the foundation.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
it's still growing,

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.560 align:middle line:84%
and it is an
evolving philosophy.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.250 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
that is finite.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.390 align:middle line:84%
It'll continue evolving as
people embrace it and use it

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.460 align:middle line:84%
for the benefit in
their own communities.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.509 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, just
to recap again, we

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.340 align:middle line:84%
don't need to have all of the
answers to all of the solutions

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.770 align:middle line:84%
today, as long as we know
what the foundations are

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.790 align:middle line:84%
and what the cornerstones
are of this platform

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.800 align:middle line:84%
to launch us into this new
way forward for this planet.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.140 align:middle line:10%
One of the amazing discoveries
I made on this journey

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.320 align:middle line:10%
was when I went to Cape
Town to visit my friend

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.810 align:middle line:10%
in at his wellness center.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.840 align:middle line:10%
He's got the place called
the Ubuntu Wellness

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.370 align:middle line:10%
Centre in Cape Town,
a beautiful place

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.880 align:middle line:10%
with amazing healing
facilities and flotation tanks,

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.630 align:middle line:10%
and there's also an
Ubuntu tree that they

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.380 align:middle line:10%
planted there, and held
some ceremony, and so forth.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.400 align:middle line:84%
But he showed me
the picture that

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.820 align:middle line:84%
was done by Dr. Masaru Emoto
where they encoded the word

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.117 align:middle line:84%
Ubuntu, or spoke the word
Ubuntu to some water,

00:03:01.117 --> 00:03:02.700 align:middle line:84%
and then he put it
through the process

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.810 align:middle line:84%
that he used to do
of freezing the water

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.080 align:middle line:84%
and seeing what crystal
structures are formed

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.060 align:middle line:84%
with the resonance
of the word that's

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.490 align:middle line:90%
captured in the wood Ubuntu.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.380 align:middle line:90%
And this is what came out.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.990 align:middle line:84%
It was described by
Masaru Emoto as one

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.430 align:middle line:84%
of the most beautiful,
perfect water crystals

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.640 align:middle line:90%
he's ever captured.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And that just brings us back
to the simple philosophy

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.680 align:middle line:84%
and how incredible these
synchronicities are.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.880 align:middle line:84%
You can't plan this
kind of thing, right?

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.800 align:middle line:90%
It just happens automatically.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.960 align:middle line:84%
So this is what Masaru
Emoto had to say.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.860 align:middle line:84%
"A beautiful circle appeared
inside of the crystal.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.160 align:middle line:84%
I believe this circle
is Ubuntu itself.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.160 align:middle line:84%
It signifies that everything
is in perfect harmony.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.990 align:middle line:84%
Only when everything is
in harmony and accord,

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.482 align:middle line:84%
all the beings will
attain true happiness."

00:03:55.482 --> 00:03:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's just
amazing, because he

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.570 align:middle line:84%
talks about harmony and
resonance and accord, which

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.590 align:middle line:84%
is pretty much what
this is all about.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.640 align:middle line:84%
It's unity consciousness,
unity within community.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.970 align:middle line:84%
We live in harmony
with each other.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And only that kind of
unity will bring us

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.510 align:middle line:90%
into infinite diversity.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.310 align:middle line:84%
So let's have a look at the
perspective of our reality

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.990 align:middle line:90%
that we find ourselves in today.

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:23.190 align:middle line:84%
We sort of touched upon it
in the previous session,

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.470 align:middle line:84%
and that is that
the reality we find

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.050 align:middle line:84%
ourselves is molded by the
world we are born into,

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.330 align:middle line:84%
and are shaped by
our own experiences,

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.780 align:middle line:84%
and the socioeconomic structure
that we are born into, that we

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.010 align:middle line:90%
have very little say about.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.630 align:middle line:84%
We just emerge in this,
and it's around us,

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.550 align:middle line:90%
and this is what we grow up in.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:48.040 align:middle line:84%
So our reality is molded by
television shows, by the media,

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:55.700 align:middle line:84%
by the celebrities, by the
music, the movies, the fashion,

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.880 align:middle line:84%
the cars we drive,
the fact that we

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.270 align:middle line:84%
have to use petrol, the fact
that we pay for electricity,

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.890 align:middle line:84%
the fact that everything we
do, we have to have money for.

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.020 align:middle line:84%
So this is the reality
we find ourselves in,

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.600 align:middle line:84%
and that reality is
deeply encoded in what

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.690 align:middle line:90%
we face every day.

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.910 align:middle line:84%
And so to undo that
is one of the biggest

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.500 align:middle line:84%
tasks or the biggest
challenges that we face,

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.150 align:middle line:84%
is to undo the
programming of the reality

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.810 align:middle line:84%
that we're born into, and
how we perceive this reality.

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.120 align:middle line:84%
And yet, so many people
find it so easy to do.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.610 align:middle line:84%
It's as if they
know instinctively

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.575 align:middle line:84%
that this is just a
part of the problem,

00:05:36.575 --> 00:05:39.520 align:middle line:84%
that this is just a phase
we're going through,

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.590 align:middle line:84%
and that we really
know what outcomes.

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.120 align:middle line:84%
We already know that
there's a better way out.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.774 align:middle line:84%
And in many ways, I'd
like to just revisit

00:05:47.774 --> 00:05:50.440 align:middle line:84%
what we said earlier, is that we
don't want to confront anybody.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.630 align:middle line:84%
This isn't about
confrontation or fighting

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.030 align:middle line:90%
anyone or resisting anyone.

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.900 align:middle line:84%
It's about finding a new
way and a new alternative.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And for that
reason, we also need

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.550 align:middle line:84%
to thank those people that
have imposed this system on us.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.300 align:middle line:84%
We actually thank them
for showing us the way.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.360 align:middle line:84%
Thank the politicians,
thank the slave masters,

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.900 align:middle line:84%
thank the bankers and those that
are mostly unconscious of what

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.390 align:middle line:90%
they are doing.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.670 align:middle line:90%
Not everybody in banking is bad.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.620 align:middle line:84%
They just have
jobs, and they don't

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:22.840 align:middle line:90%
know how to escape their job.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.820 align:middle line:84%
They don't know how to
escape that reality.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.010 align:middle line:84%
So we've got to thank these
people for showing us the way,

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:29.630 align:middle line:84%
that this is not
how we want to live.

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:33.040 align:middle line:84%
This is not how we want
to express ourselves

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.430 align:middle line:84%
in this world, and that
there is a better way.

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:39.110 align:middle line:84%
So they really have become our
greatest teachers, in a way,

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.100 align:middle line:84%
to show us or tell us that
we need to find a new way.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.200 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things that,
for me, was a huge aha

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.850 align:middle line:84%
moment many years ago, when
I came across the expression

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.325 align:middle line:84%
that everything we've
been told is a lie.

00:06:54.325 --> 00:06:55.270 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at this
and I went, wow.

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.630 align:middle line:90%
That's quite a heavy statement.

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.710 align:middle line:84%
How can you say
something like that?

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
not everything is a lie.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:08.320 align:middle line:84%
A lot of things we've been
told and we learned is true.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And now, 20, 30 years later,
I look back at the statement

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.610 align:middle line:84%
and I go, well, I'm
not so sure anymore.

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.490 align:middle line:84%
I think pretty much everything
we've been told is a lie.

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:20.460 align:middle line:84%
And the more you go
back over your life,

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.370 align:middle line:84%
the education system, what
our governments have told us,

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:25.170 align:middle line:84%
what we think we
know about science

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:29.570 align:middle line:84%
and this nature of reality,
the more you realize that, wow.

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:32.272 align:middle line:84%
Pretty much everything
we've been told is a lie.

00:07:32.272 --> 00:07:33.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are some
truths, of course.

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:34.990 align:middle line:90%
It's raining right now.

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:36.980 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, we know it's raining.

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:41.240 align:middle line:84%
So what they've done very
cleverly is they take a lie,

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.860 align:middle line:84%
and they attach it to
a little bit of truth.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And then the lies have become so
convoluted with little snippets

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:51.410 align:middle line:84%
of truth that it's
very difficult

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:54.624 align:middle line:84%
to distinguish and separate
the lies from the truth.

00:07:54.624 --> 00:07:55.790 align:middle line:90%
And this is what's happened.

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:58.050 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very
difficult, almost

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:02.020 align:middle line:84%
impossible for most people, to
separate the lies from truth.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:04.480 align:middle line:90%
But keep this in mind.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.160 align:middle line:84%
Pretty much everything
we've been told

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.360 align:middle line:84%
is a lie, especially
when we start

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.980 align:middle line:84%
looking at it from a
perspective of science

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:12.730 align:middle line:90%
and the laws of nature.

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:15.630 align:middle line:84%
Most of us still get
told things at school

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:17.280 align:middle line:90%
that are no longer true.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.815 align:middle line:84%
We get told that light is the
fastest thing in creation,

00:08:20.815 --> 00:08:22.350 align:middle line:90%
and it's no longer true.

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:24.870 align:middle line:84%
We know that that's not
true, that things move faster

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:27.350 align:middle line:90%
than the speed of light.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:29.550 align:middle line:84%
In my other workshops
and research,

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:32.260 align:middle line:84%
I show that sound moves
beyond the speed of light.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.179 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the best-kept
secrets in science.

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:36.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going
to into it now.

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.679 align:middle line:84%
You can watch other
presentations on that.

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:40.620 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just trying
to prove a point here,

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:44.530 align:middle line:84%
now some basic fundamental
knowledge, like the fact

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:47.190 align:middle line:84%
that quantum physics, more than
100 years ago, already showed

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:50.340 align:middle line:84%
us that we are the creators
of our own reality.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And we can create our own
reality by thinking it,

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:57.870 align:middle line:84%
by projecting it,
by imagining it.

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:00.040 align:middle line:84%
Albert Einstein said
knowledge is great.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.480 align:middle line:84%
Knowledge will take
you to a certain point.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.750 align:middle line:84%
But imagination will
take you everywhere.

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And this is it, how we
can create own reality.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And this knowledge
and information

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.580 align:middle line:90%
is not lost upon us.

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:16.690 align:middle line:84%
For some strange
reason, Hollywood

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:21.140 align:middle line:84%
has become a messenger and the
carrier of this information

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:27.570 align:middle line:84%
to expose the truth, often
disguising it with the obvious.

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:32.790 align:middle line:84%
You know, violence and
torment and subjects

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:34.810 align:middle line:84%
that they cover
in the storylines,

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:36.750 align:middle line:90%
in the Hollywood blockbusters.

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:39.710 align:middle line:84%
But then subliminally
encoding the movies

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:42.120 align:middle line:84%
with very advanced
knowledge and information,

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.350 align:middle line:90%
the subliminal messages.

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:45.680 align:middle line:90%
And this is just spectacular.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.005 align:middle line:84%
Just the fact that
the name Hollywood,

00:09:48.005 --> 00:09:50.420 align:middle line:84%
the fact that the
wood of a holly tree

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:54.220 align:middle line:84%
was used by wizards to cast
spells, and that's what it is.

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:57.940 align:middle line:84%
And when we watch movies, we're
looking at a projected reality,

00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:58.930 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:01.400 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot of still
photographs that

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.460 align:middle line:84%
are strung together
that move very quickly,

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:08.850 align:middle line:84%
so we see the
illusion of reality.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:10.360 align:middle line:90%
We perceive it as reality.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.760 align:middle line:90%
And yet it's not.

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And one of the philosophies or
the plans of action, whatever,

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:20.140 align:middle line:84%
whoever is planning this,
is to hide deep information,

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:22.100 align:middle line:90%
hide it in plain sight.

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.480 align:middle line:84%
So advanced knowledge
is available to us

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.980 align:middle line:90%
all the time in these movies.

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.470 align:middle line:90%
They put it in plain sight.

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:30.060 align:middle line:84%
"Star Trek" is one of the
greatest examples, right?

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.740 align:middle line:84%
Everything we've ever
see on "Star Trek"

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:34.770 align:middle line:84%
has either become true, or it's
still going to become true.

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:39.670 align:middle line:84%
Scientific ideas that 40
years ago were really way out,

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:42.560 align:middle line:84%
and today we think of
them as run-of-the-mill,

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.150 align:middle line:90%
everyday activity.

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:49.750 align:middle line:84%
So one of the great movies
came out of Hollywood

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:51.920 align:middle line:84%
is obviously "The
Matrix" that tells us,

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.990 align:middle line:90%
we live in the invisible matrix.

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And it explains
to us exactly what

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:59.020 align:middle line:90%
is happening in our reality.

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:03.780 align:middle line:84%
And when you read some of the
dialogue from "The Matrix,"

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:08.570 align:middle line:84%
it is just spine-chilling that
they tell us what's going on,

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:09.670 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:11.560 align:middle line:84%
They have very specific
reasons for this,

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.600 align:middle line:84%
why they put this encoded
stuff into the movies.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:19.290 align:middle line:84%
Because the global
elite are not stupid.

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:20.970 align:middle line:84%
They know exactly
what's going on.

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:23.680 align:middle line:84%
They understand
the laws of nature.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.432 align:middle line:84%
They have a deep
understanding of everything

00:11:26.432 --> 00:11:27.390 align:middle line:90%
that we are discussing.

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:29.390 align:middle line:90%
This is why they're in control.

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:31.750 align:middle line:84%
If they weren't smart, if
they didn't know this stuff,

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:33.580 align:middle line:90%
they wouldn't be in control.

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:37.740 align:middle line:84%
So just let's understand
what's going on here.

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:43.710 align:middle line:84%
So they also understand that
by not sharing this deeply

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:46.330 align:middle line:84%
philosophical knowledge
and information with us,

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:50.670 align:middle line:84%
all this way-out stuff,
without sharing that with us

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:54.360 align:middle line:84%
and encoding it subconsciously
into the movies and the reality

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:59.720 align:middle line:84%
around us, they'll be creating
a huge gap and a separation

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:03.190 align:middle line:84%
between the consciousness,
the collective consciousness

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:05.037 align:middle line:84%
of the people, and
what they're trying

00:12:05.037 --> 00:12:06.120 align:middle line:90%
to shove down our throats.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:10.290 align:middle line:84%
So they constantly have to keep
us not too far behind what's

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:11.090 align:middle line:90%
really going on.

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:14.420 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, they're going to
just lose the global population,

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.980 align:middle line:84%
and everybody will
just go, hold on.

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:18.420 align:middle line:90%
Then it'll become very obvious.

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:22.830 align:middle line:84%
So by keeping us reasonably
close to what's really

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:26.950 align:middle line:84%
going on subconsciously, they're
not losing the rest of humanity

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:30.020 align:middle line:84%
and making it very obvious as
to what they're doing to us.

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:33.080 align:middle line:10%
But Morpheus in the
movie "The Matrix,"

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:35.360 align:middle line:10%
he says, "The Matrix
is everywhere.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.280 align:middle line:10%
It is all around us.

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:39.360 align:middle line:10%
Even now, in this very room.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.420 align:middle line:10%
You can see it when you
look out of your window

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:43.810 align:middle line:10%
or when you turn
on your television.

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:47.550 align:middle line:10%
You can feel it when you go to
work, when you go to church,

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:49.190 align:middle line:10%
when you pay your taxes.

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:52.620 align:middle line:10%
It is the world that has
been pulled over your eyes

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.750 align:middle line:10%
to blind you from the truth."

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:56.770 align:middle line:10%
And Neo says, "What truth?"

00:12:56.770 --> 00:13:00.300 align:middle line:10%
Morpheus says, "that
you are a slave, Neo.

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:03.880 align:middle line:10%
Like everyone else, you
were born into bondage,

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:07.180 align:middle line:10%
into a prison that you
cannot taste or see or touch.

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:09.370 align:middle line:10%
A prison for your mind."

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:11.330 align:middle line:90%
It's like, wow.

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:14.420 align:middle line:90%
They tell us exactly what it is.

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:17.600 align:middle line:84%
Now just remember
that in "Matrix,"

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.010 align:middle line:90%
Neo is an anagram for one.

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:22.950 align:middle line:84%
So it's like they're telling
us that he is the one,

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:27.430 align:middle line:84%
or we are the one that have
come to save yourselves.

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:28.440 align:middle line:90%
Because we are all one.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.090 align:middle line:84%
We're all part of the same
collective consciousness.

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And we've been divided so deeply
that we forget that we actually

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.640 align:middle line:84%
resonate and share
the same knowledge,

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.500 align:middle line:84%
and we can share that
information very,

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.440 align:middle line:90%
very quickly and very easily.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And the slave system is
described as the matrix.

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:46.250 align:middle line:10%
It's "a system, Neo.

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:48.860 align:middle line:10%
That system is our enemy.

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:52.410 align:middle line:10%
But when you're inside, you
look around, what do you see?

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:55.550 align:middle line:10%
Businessmen, teaches,
lawyers, carpenters.

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:58.670 align:middle line:10%
The very minds of the people
we are trying to save.

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:02.870 align:middle line:10%
But until we do, these people
are still a part of that system

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:04.570 align:middle line:10%
and that makes them our enemy.

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:07.060 align:middle line:10%
You have to understand,
most of these people

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:09.110 align:middle line:10%
are not ready to be unplugged.

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:12.850 align:middle line:10%
And many of them are so
inured, so hopelessly dependent

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:16.620 align:middle line:10%
on the system, that they
will fight to protect it."

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And that is pretty
much most of what

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:22.100 align:middle line:84%
the global population
is all about.

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:24.680 align:middle line:84%
We Most of us believe
that this is our reality.

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:25.480 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.920 align:middle line:84%
There's not much
we can do about it,

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.580 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
fight to protect it,

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:30.350 align:middle line:84%
because it's the
only thing we've got.

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:33.410 align:middle line:84%
And we believe our governments,
and they send our young men

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:36.400 align:middle line:84%
into other countries to invade
them and shoot innocent people

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.910 align:middle line:90%
and kill them.

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:40.030 align:middle line:90%
For what?

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:41.974 align:middle line:90%
It's just insane, what we do.

00:14:41.974 --> 00:14:43.390 align:middle line:84%
You know, I was
just thinking when

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:46.690 align:middle line:84%
I was putting this
workshop together,

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:49.299 align:middle line:84%
just thinking about
that absolute horror

00:14:49.299 --> 00:14:51.340 align:middle line:84%
if you're a soldier, and
you suddenly end up face

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:53.950 align:middle line:84%
to face with somebody else with
another gun pointing at you.

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:57.020 align:middle line:84%
You realize you're about to
shoot another human being.

00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:00.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the horror of
that is just unbelievable.

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, we make it
OK, because our governments

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:03.920 align:middle line:90%
told us to do this.

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's that automatic
response to authority.

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:09.900 align:middle line:90%
Do what the authority tells you.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:13.562 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you're in denial
of whoever is in charge.

00:15:13.562 --> 00:15:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And that horror of having to
shoot another human being just

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:19.430 align:middle line:84%
because you were sent by a
government to invade a country

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:21.730 align:middle line:90%
and kill some innocent people?

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:24.190 align:middle line:84%
It just-- I can't even
begin to imagine that.

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And all of us have
pretty much grown up

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:28.500 align:middle line:84%
into this kind of system where
this is our daily reality,

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:31.450 align:middle line:84%
and this is what we see on
television day in and day out.

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:33.420 align:middle line:84%
It's that whole fear
mongering thing that gets

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:35.160 align:middle line:90%
shoved down our throats.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:40.310 align:middle line:84%
One of the great exposes
in a Hollywood blockbuster

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:41.680 align:middle line:90%
is "The Wizard of Oz."

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.225 align:middle line:90%
Just the word blockbuster again.

00:15:44.225 --> 00:15:46.500 align:middle line:90%
Why is it called a blockbuster?

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:47.800 align:middle line:90%
I talk about this quite often.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:50.685 align:middle line:84%
Is it busting the block
of our unconsciousness?

00:15:50.685 --> 00:15:51.810 align:middle line:90%
So it's "The Wizard of Oz."

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:52.730 align:middle line:90%
Oz is gold.

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:53.540 align:middle line:90%
Ounce of gold.

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:54.350 align:middle line:90%
Ounces of gold.

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:55.150 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And Dorothy, who's the
only human being there,

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.020 align:middle line:84%
accompanied by her
weird friends--

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:03.500 align:middle line:84%
and they are much more
weird than we realize--

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:07.620 align:middle line:84%
goes down the yellow brick
road, the road paved with gold.

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:09.845 align:middle line:90%
Bars of gold, right?

00:16:09.845 --> 00:16:12.500 align:middle line:84%
To the home of the
wizard, the wizard that

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:16.180 align:middle line:84%
controls the gold, or the ounces
of gold, the Wizard of Oz.

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:19.540 align:middle line:84%
And her friends
are the Scarecrow,

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:22.640 align:middle line:84%
which is the straw man,
or your legal fiction,

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:26.194 align:middle line:84%
or your ID documents
and the thing

00:16:26.194 --> 00:16:28.110 align:middle line:84%
that the government turns
you into when you're

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:31.930 align:middle line:90%
born, into a piece of paper.

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:36.120 align:middle line:84%
She's accompanied by the
Tin Man, the T-I-N, the Tax

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.980 align:middle line:90%
Identification Number.

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And then the Lion, the coward
who hides behind his roar,

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:53.420 align:middle line:84%
but he's only fierce and violent
when he's in a pack of others.

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:56.430 align:middle line:84%
But he's a coward when
he's surrounded on his own,

00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:57.660 align:middle line:90%
and he becomes a coward.

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And then little Toto, which
in Latin and legal terms

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:04.760 align:middle line:90%
means in totality.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:08.220 align:middle line:84%
Toto then exposes the wizard
from being just a guy sitting

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:13.099 align:middle line:84%
behind a screen with smoke
and fancy lighting that

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:16.000 align:middle line:84%
scares everyone into submission,
and he's actually not a wizard.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.640 align:middle line:84%
He's just a normal
guy that pulls

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.339 align:middle line:90%
the wool over everybody's eyes.

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:23.410 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that it's all
about the control of gold.

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:26.650 align:middle line:84%
He who controls the
gold controls the world.

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:29.330 align:middle line:84%
But what this does
bring us to is

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:35.330 align:middle line:84%
the fact that money has
become the supreme holy cow.

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, that's
what drives our lives.

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:41.420 align:middle line:84%
You can attack the Jews,
the Christians, the Muslims,

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:42.220 align:middle line:90%
the Hindus.

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:45.000 align:middle line:84%
You can have a go at any
religion in the world,

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.110 align:middle line:84%
and you'll probably have a bunch
of people that side with you

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:49.110 align:middle line:90%
and agree with you.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:52.310 align:middle line:84%
But the moment you attack
money, everybody goes crazy.

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:54.070 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well,
what do you mean?

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:55.370 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean we've
got to get rid of money?

00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:56.750 align:middle line:90%
How are we going to buy stuff?

00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:58.010 align:middle line:90%
How are we going to survive?

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:00.050 align:middle line:90%
We can't survive without money.

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:01.650 align:middle line:84%
Because we've been
so indoctrinated

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:03.900 align:middle line:84%
by this for so long,
and it literally

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:07.340 align:middle line:84%
has been for thousands of years
that this money thing has been

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:09.100 align:middle line:90%
shoved down our throats.

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:13.930 align:middle line:84%
So we are all born into this
global, sociopolitical system.

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:16.330 align:middle line:84%
Most of us believe
it is unchangeable.

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's what some
of you echoed earlier.

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.210 align:middle line:84%
Most of us think, well, how
are we going to change it?

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:22.030 align:middle line:90%
There is no other way.

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:22.690 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:23.773 align:middle line:90%
It's how it's always been.

00:18:23.773 --> 00:18:27.610 align:middle line:84%
You said that in school, that's
what they try and teach us.

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:29.570 align:middle line:90%
And that's exactly what goes on.

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:32.750 align:middle line:84%
They lie to us over and
over and over again.

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And remember who's behind
the schooling system,

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:37.065 align:middle line:90%
the current education system.

00:18:37.065 --> 00:18:42.570 align:middle line:84%
So most of us grow up
having very little money.

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:45.320 align:middle line:84%
Most of the people in the
world-- some of us in this room

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:48.690 align:middle line:84%
are a lot more privileged than
the majority of the world.

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And even the people in
this room, most of us

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:54.710 align:middle line:84%
can't achieve or attain
what our dreams are.

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:57.190 align:middle line:84%
We always have these dreams
that we never attain,

00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:59.190 align:middle line:84%
because we never
have enough money

00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:02.100 align:middle line:84%
to achieve our
dreams or our goals.

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.860 align:middle line:84%
We can't do this or can't go
there, or can't create this,

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.460 align:middle line:84%
or can't invent
this, or can't build

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:08.940 align:middle line:84%
that, up can't start a
bakery because we just

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:10.650 align:middle line:90%
don't have enough money.

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:12.830 align:middle line:84%
Always yearning for the
things we cannot have.

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:15.530 align:middle line:84%
It's like part of this
reality that we've been

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:18.290 align:middle line:90%
sucked into and trapped into.

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And once again, Hollywood
exposes this reality to us

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.560 align:middle line:90%
in "The Truman Show."

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.340 align:middle line:90%
Remember, we forget.

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:27.625 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
mind-blowing movies

00:19:27.625 --> 00:19:31.180 align:middle line:84%
that actually tells us
how the life around us

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:32.940 align:middle line:90%
have enslaved us.

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:36.470 align:middle line:84%
Where the producer, who
remember, he sits in the moon,

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:40.050 align:middle line:84%
controlling the whole show--
that's where the production

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:43.480 align:middle line:84%
office is, in the moon-- and
looking down on the world,

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:48.820 align:middle line:84%
this surreal world made up and
controlled from this satellite

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:50.040 align:middle line:90%
planet.

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.050 align:middle line:90%
Boy.

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:55.320 align:middle line:84%
So the producer says, "we
accept the reality of the world

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.390 align:middle line:90%
with which we are presented."

00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:59.690 align:middle line:90%
And that was Truman's reality.

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
most of us believe.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we
grew up with believing.

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:07.260 align:middle line:84%
We believe that
capitalism and democracy

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:10.290 align:middle line:84%
are the highest
goal and the highest

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:12.230 align:middle line:90%
purpose for which we are born.

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And making money is
what we all about.

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And from the earliest of ages,
while we're at school, right?

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:19.644 align:middle line:84%
So what are you going
to do when you grow up?

00:20:19.644 --> 00:20:21.330 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I'm going to
become a sculptor.

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:22.130 align:middle line:90%
Oh, really?

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:23.742 align:middle line:84%
Well, how are you
going to earn money?

00:20:23.742 --> 00:20:25.200 align:middle line:84%
That's not going
to earn you money.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.230 align:middle line:90%
Well, really?

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:30.800 align:middle line:84%
So money becomes the decisive
factor or the deciding thing

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.770 align:middle line:84%
about, what are we going to
do for the rest of our lives?

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And then we get shoved
down our throats

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:38.170 align:middle line:84%
this thing called
democracy, as if democracy

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:41.200 align:middle line:84%
is the ultimate way that
we should be living.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.025 align:middle line:84%
And most of us
think, oh, democracy.

00:20:43.025 --> 00:20:44.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, democracy.

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And many of us still
use that argument.

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:49.200 align:middle line:84%
So I want to just make you
throw that out the window.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.270 align:middle line:84%
Because democracy is
just as bad as anything

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:54.820 align:middle line:84%
else that's ever been
shoved down our throats.

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:58.010 align:middle line:84%
Democracy is nothing more
than a bullying tactic.

00:20:58.010 --> 00:20:59.440 align:middle line:90%
There's 51 of us and 49 of you?

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.590 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, it's our way.

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:02.720 align:middle line:90%
It's us.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.570 align:middle line:84%
There's more of us than there
is of you, so it'll be our way.

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:07.150 align:middle line:90%
It's a bullying tactic.

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:10.110 align:middle line:84%
It's not a solution
for our problems.

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:14.290 align:middle line:84%
So later, I'm going to
talk to you about the fact

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:19.080 align:middle line:84%
that while democracy is based
on a majority rule system,

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.650 align:middle line:84%
and this is what's
shoved down our throats,

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:25.520 align:middle line:84%
the whole Contributionism or
Ubuntu philosophy is actually--

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:29.531 align:middle line:84%
the foundation of that is based
on a minority rule system.

00:21:29.531 --> 00:21:31.530 align:middle line:84%
And when you say this to
people, they freak out.

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:34.220 align:middle line:84%
Most people just go, what
do you mean, minority rules?

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:35.240 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:36.240 align:middle line:90%
How is it going to work?

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.410 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's very simple.

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:39.930 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
jump the gun now,

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:41.346 align:middle line:84%
but I'm just
preparing you for it,

00:21:41.346 --> 00:21:44.980 align:middle line:84%
because it's such a simple and
eloquent, noble way of solving

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:46.290 align:middle line:90%
all our problems.

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:48.200 align:middle line:84%
They're infinitely
more minorities

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.290 align:middle line:90%
than there are majorities.

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:51.689 align:middle line:84%
There's a clue for
you, all right?

00:21:51.689 --> 00:21:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And we'll deal with
that a little bit

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:57.650 align:middle line:84%
later, just how simple and
eloquent that solution is.

00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:59.940 align:middle line:84%
If we deal with a
minority-based system,

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:02.030 align:middle line:84%
we can solve all our
problems, because we'll

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:04.630 align:middle line:90%
deal with everyone's needs.

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:08.820 align:middle line:84%
And the majority rule system
only deals with one problem,

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:12.690 align:middle line:84%
and that doesn't necessarily
serve everybody's needs.

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:18.190 align:middle line:84%
So we grow up believing that
capitalism and democracy is

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:19.530 align:middle line:90%
the way forward.

00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:22.390 align:middle line:84%
That we have to earn money
to live in this world.

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:24.520 align:middle line:84%
The only species that
has to earn money

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:27.930 align:middle line:84%
to live on the planet
that we're born on.

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:29.650 align:middle line:90%
That's insanity.

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:32.170 align:middle line:84%
And we're told that democracy
is good, and so many of us

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:34.652 align:middle line:84%
keep using democracy
as the highest place

00:22:34.652 --> 00:22:35.860 align:middle line:90%
that we want to reach, right?

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:38.318 align:middle line:84%
In some countries, oh, that
country doesn't have democracy.

00:22:38.318 --> 00:22:39.975 align:middle line:84%
We need to impose
democracy on them.

00:22:39.975 --> 00:22:40.850 align:middle line:90%
And then you go back.

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:41.140 align:middle line:90%
Hold on.

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:43.810 align:middle line:84%
So why are we so obsessed
with this democracy thing?

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:47.850 align:middle line:84%
Because democracy is a
brutal bullying tactic.

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:50.310 align:middle line:84%
It's based on a
majority rule system.

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:54.710 align:middle line:84%
There's 51 of us, 49 of you,
so it's our way or the highway.

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:57.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't care who
you 49 people are.

00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:58.350 align:middle line:90%
It's this way.

00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:00.050 align:middle line:90%
We're going their way.

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:03.670 align:middle line:84%
So 49 people are going to be
pretty upset with a decision,

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:06.140 align:middle line:84%
while 51 people
think this is great.

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:08.070 align:middle line:90%
This is not a solution, right?

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:10.380 align:middle line:84%
So this is why I
actually propose,

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:12.670 align:middle line:84%
which we're going to
work in much more detail,

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:16.220 align:middle line:84%
what I refer to as the
minority-based system, minority

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:17.530 align:middle line:90%
rule system.

00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And when you say to people,
what do you mean, minority rule?

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:21.620 align:middle line:84%
How come minority
rules the majority?

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:24.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's not about
ruling majority.

00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:26.830 align:middle line:84%
It's about creating
harmony in community.

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:29.500 align:middle line:84%
It's about creating
abundance in community.

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:32.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'll give you a clue right
now before we get to it later,

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:35.410 align:middle line:84%
is that there are infinitely
more minorities than there

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:37.040 align:middle line:90%
are majorities.

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And if we take care
of all the minorities,

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:42.160 align:middle line:84%
and all the minorities
are contributing

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:43.950 align:middle line:84%
towards the benefit
of their community,

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:46.540 align:middle line:84%
I think we've created a
pretty harmonious system

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:49.160 align:middle line:84%
and a pretty harmonious
community that

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.510 align:middle line:90%
is pretty well balanced.

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have
one group dominating

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:57.650 align:middle line:84%
everybody else, which is
currently the democracy that we

00:23:57.650 --> 00:23:58.770 align:middle line:90%
find ourselves in.

00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:01.740 align:middle line:90%
Democracy is not a solution.

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:04.390 align:middle line:84%
The other important thing
that we grow up with

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:06.650 align:middle line:84%
is this thing
called competition.

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:09.030 align:middle line:84%
All our lives, we are
told that competition

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:12.780 align:middle line:84%
is good, that we have to compete
to get to the top of the pile,

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:14.400 align:middle line:90%
to be the best.

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.660 align:middle line:84%
And without competition,
there'd be no progress.

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:18.060 align:middle line:90%
There'd be no invention.

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:20.310 align:middle line:84%
There'd be-- people would
have no desire to reach.

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:22.610 align:middle line:84%
People would be lazy
without competition.

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:23.630 align:middle line:90%
It's like, really?

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:26.980 align:middle line:84%
This is what we shove
into children's minds

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:28.510 align:middle line:90%
from the earliest of ages.

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:30.990 align:middle line:84%
And we've all gone
through this, right?

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:33.120 align:middle line:84%
Without competition-- I
have to get to the top.

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:34.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, so you get to
the top of the pile,

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:36.350 align:middle line:84%
and then some
other schmuck wants

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:37.600 align:middle line:90%
to get to the top of the pile.

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.020 align:middle line:90%
Then what happens then?

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:43.250 align:middle line:84%
So how is competition going
to solve this inequality

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:48.030 align:middle line:84%
in this world that
we find ourselves in?

00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:50.190 align:middle line:90%
Competition is not a solution.

00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:52.920 align:middle line:84%
Competition is
probably-- and this

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:55.970 align:middle line:84%
is my opinion--
the most evil thing

00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:58.870 align:middle line:84%
that's ever been imposed
on humanity, because it's

00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:03.070 align:middle line:84%
the driving force of the divided
world we find ourselves in.

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:05.270 align:middle line:84%
We constantly compete
against each other,

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:08.670 align:middle line:84%
undermining each other,
bringing each other down

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:12.160 align:middle line:84%
where we should be supporting
each other, helping each other,

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.410 align:middle line:90%
working together.

00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:16.700 align:middle line:84%
So competition leads to
a corporate hierarchical

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:20.170 align:middle line:84%
structure, which is the
system that runs the world.

00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:23.540 align:middle line:84%
Corporations that run the world,
including our governments.

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:24.340 align:middle line:90%
Competition.

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:26.010 align:middle line:90%
Competing to get to the top.

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:28.755 align:middle line:84%
Even our candidates
compete to get to the top.

00:25:28.755 --> 00:25:29.685 align:middle line:90%
It's just ridiculous.

00:25:29.685 --> 00:25:33.010 align:middle line:84%
It's like a circus
show every few years.

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And then you realize, when they
start talking on television,

00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:37.086 align:middle line:84%
that they know
absolutely nothing.

00:25:37.086 --> 00:25:40.710 align:middle line:84%
They're just regurgitating the
same lies over and over again.

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:44.350 align:middle line:84%
Remember, any politician
that doesn't tell the people

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:47.770 align:middle line:84%
about the banking and the money
system is lying to the people.

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And since no politician
is telling the people

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:53.170 align:middle line:84%
about the banking
and the money system,

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:56.120 align:middle line:84%
is either ignorant of
it, or they're lying.

00:25:56.120 --> 00:26:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And neither of those aspects
make them fit to lead anybody.

00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:02.845 align:middle line:90%
So just keep that in mind.

00:26:02.845 --> 00:26:05.470 align:middle line:84%
Anyone that's still thinks that
there are politicians out there

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:07.390 align:middle line:90%
that are actually quite good.

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And they're all
lying, thieving crooks

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:13.540 align:middle line:84%
who want to get into
a position of power

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:15.950 align:middle line:84%
so that they can
benefit themselves, not

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:17.419 align:middle line:90%
benefit anyone else.

00:26:17.419 --> 00:26:18.960 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, they'd
be telling everyone

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:22.180 align:middle line:84%
on television about
the money system.

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:23.380 align:middle line:90%
And they're not.

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:26.830 align:middle line:84%
Remember, competition
causes compartmentalization.

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:30.840 align:middle line:84%
Competition causes corporations
and the whole pyramid structure

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:32.920 align:middle line:90%
of secrecy and hiding things.

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And what competition
does as well

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:41.540 align:middle line:84%
is it prevents and inventions
and technology from reaching

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:45.470 align:middle line:84%
us, reaching the people,
because corporations hide it,

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:47.690 align:middle line:84%
because it's not
good for business.

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:49.970 align:middle line:84%
So cures for disease
don't reach people

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:52.570 align:middle line:84%
because that's not
good for business.

00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:55.310 align:middle line:84%
Free electricity devices don't
get released because it's not

00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:56.110 align:middle line:90%
good for business.

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:58.980 align:middle line:84%
Cars that levitate or
cars that run on air

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:00.490 align:middle line:90%
is not good for business.

00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:04.440 align:middle line:84%
So competition is actually
the antithesis of progress.

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.300 align:middle line:84%
So when people tell
you about competition,

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:09.320 align:middle line:84%
there'd be no progress,
there'd be no inventions, no.

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:11.020 align:middle line:90%
It's actually the opposite.

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:15.235 align:middle line:84%
Competition causes the society
that we find ourselves in

00:27:15.235 --> 00:27:18.820 align:middle line:84%
to hide technology, to
hide inventions, hide it

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:20.790 align:middle line:90%
from humanity.

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:23.190 align:middle line:84%
Not to share it with
humanity, because it's

00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:24.590 align:middle line:90%
controlled by corporations.

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:28.090 align:middle line:84%
Or universities, for
education institutions

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:31.587 align:middle line:84%
that hide breakthrough
inventions and technology.

00:27:31.587 --> 00:27:33.545 align:middle line:84%
And we get to that, and
we talk about education

00:27:33.545 --> 00:27:37.700 align:middle line:84%
and the education system,
and how that is enslaving us.

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, competition
leads to control,

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.570 align:middle line:84%
because those
corporations that have

00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:44.940 align:middle line:84%
the patents and
the knowledge, they

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:47.020 align:middle line:84%
control the supply
of whatever it

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:51.800 align:middle line:84%
is that they're contributing or
manufacturing or distributing.

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:54.650 align:middle line:84%
So that control
leads to scarcity.

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And this is why so many of
us live under the illusion

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.160 align:middle line:84%
that we live on a
planet of scarcity,

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:01.570 align:middle line:84%
that things are scarce,
when we, in fact, live

00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:03.880 align:middle line:84%
on a planet of
infinite abundance.

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And we should have an
infinite amount of everything

00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:10.100 align:middle line:84%
that we want because of
this abundance factor

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:11.480 align:middle line:90%
that we are capable of.

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:13.820 align:middle line:84%
But competition
does the opposite.

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:15.640 align:middle line:90%
It creates scarcity.

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:18.020 align:middle line:90%
So how do we turn this around?

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:20.870 align:middle line:84%
Once again, the
solution is so simple

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:22.600 align:middle line:84%
that sometimes and
most of the time,

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:26.980 align:middle line:84%
we are the own obstacles
in our own way of thinking.

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:29.770 align:middle line:84%
All we have to do
is turn competition

00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:32.890 align:middle line:84%
into cooperation
and collaboration.

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:33.900 align:middle line:90%
That's how simple it is.

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:37.070 align:middle line:84%
It's 180-degree turn
in the way we think.

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:38.440 align:middle line:90%
Stop competing with people.

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:40.870 align:middle line:84%
Start working
together with them.

00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:42.640 align:middle line:84%
Let scientists start
working together

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:45.590 align:middle line:84%
towards developing whatever
it is they're working on,

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:47.250 align:middle line:90%
and inventions and technology.

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And that that cooperation
and collaboration then

00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:54.364 align:middle line:84%
leads to the sharing of that
knowledge with the population

00:28:54.364 --> 00:28:56.280 align:middle line:84%
of the world, and with
the people of your town

00:28:56.280 --> 00:29:00.300 align:middle line:84%
or your country or your city,
wherever you may find yourself.

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:02.710 align:middle line:84%
This is the chain
and the flow of how

00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:05.270 align:middle line:84%
we use cooperation as
opposed to competition

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:07.210 align:middle line:90%
for the benefit of humanity.

00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:10.630 align:middle line:84%
Remember that only out of
cooperation and collaboration

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:12.090 align:middle line:90%
will we create abundance.

00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:14.010 align:middle line:84%
And out of that
abundance will come

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:17.170 align:middle line:84%
the lack of fear, the
dropping of the suspicion

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:20.930 align:middle line:84%
and being afraid of our
neighbors and strangers,

00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:22.310 align:middle line:90%
and start to embrace everybody.

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:24.140 align:middle line:84%
Because we all seem
to be working together

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:27.280 align:middle line:84%
for the benefit of
everyone and unity.

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And then this leads us to the
very important philosophy.

00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And this is like the
fundamental statement

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:37.770 align:middle line:84%
here that we need to really
embrace, is only out of unity

00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:39.190 align:middle line:90%
comes infinite diversity.

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:44.650 align:middle line:84%
Out of this united collective
working together in cooperation

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:48.290 align:middle line:84%
and collaboration, that creates
the unity in our communities,

00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:50.080 align:middle line:90%
in our countries, on our planet.

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:53.680 align:middle line:84%
And out of that unity will
create infinite diversity.

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:57.230 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is we set our
minds to in arts, in culture,

00:29:57.230 --> 00:30:01.530 align:middle line:84%
in growing food, in technology,
anything we can imagine.

00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:03.820 align:middle line:84%
How long will it take a
bunch of computer geeks--

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:08.940 align:middle line:84%
if you put them together
into a lab, a Silicon Valley

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:12.350 align:middle line:84%
lab, how long will it take
a bunch of computer geeks,

00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:15.410 align:middle line:84%
with whatever we
have to offer them,

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:18.580 align:middle line:90%
to create a supercomputer?

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:22.210 align:middle line:84%
I was just recently--
where was I-- in Austria.

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:25.070 align:middle line:84%
And there was a computer
geek in the room.

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And he said-- and his
answer was six months.

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And I would probably
concur with that.

00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:31.530 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:34.346 align:middle line:84%
I'd say it'd probably
take even less than that,

00:30:34.346 --> 00:30:36.220 align:middle line:84%
because these computer
geeks probably already

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:38.600 align:middle line:84%
have a supercomputer
sitting somewhere,

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.259 align:middle line:84%
but they're not
allowed to release it

00:30:40.259 --> 00:30:42.550 align:middle line:84%
because their companies won't
allow them to release it,

00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:44.460 align:middle line:84%
and they're under contract
with their company

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:46.880 align:middle line:84%
preventing them from
releasing anything

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.380 align:middle line:84%
while they worked
with that company,

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:49.880 align:middle line:90%
or even after they leave.

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:52.900 align:middle line:84%
They have all these disclosure
contacts that you have to sign.

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:55.690 align:middle line:84%
So if you do away
with all that control

00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:58.270 align:middle line:84%
and you ask a bunch of computer
geeks, they'll probably say,

00:30:58.270 --> 00:30:59.400 align:middle line:90%
here it is.

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:00.890 align:middle line:84%
It's not even going
to take a week.

00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:03.490 align:middle line:84%
They'll just present
it to you, right?

00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And this is what happens
when you get rid of money,

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:09.920 align:middle line:84%
and you get rid of the
control and the competition

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:12.580 align:middle line:84%
and the corporate
hierarchical structures.

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:14.880 align:middle line:84%
How quickly things
come into creation.

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:17.760 align:middle line:84%
The moment you remove
money from the system,

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:20.160 align:middle line:84%
the creative process
out of the millions

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:24.030 align:middle line:84%
of people around the world, the
millions and billions of people

00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:27.930 align:middle line:84%
that are capable of
creating incredible things

00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:30.430 align:middle line:84%
that we can't imagine because
we've never been given

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:32.780 align:middle line:84%
the opportunity to witness
that, because all of that

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:36.290 align:middle line:84%
is constantly hidden from us
by the corporate structures

00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:40.490 align:middle line:84%
and the governments that are
supposed to be serving us.

00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:44.210 align:middle line:84%
So only out of unity
comes infinite diversity

00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:45.430 align:middle line:90%
and abundance.

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And one of the greatest
examples for this,

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:55.050 align:middle line:84%
showing this in real,
living, active, physical form

00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:56.880 align:middle line:90%
are our own bodies.

00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:01.430 align:middle line:84%
Our own bodies consist
of trillions of cells.

00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And yet all of those
trillions of cells

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:06.930 align:middle line:84%
come out of one cell
that started to divide.

00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:11.700 align:middle line:84%
Out of that first unified cell
comes this infinite diversity.

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:14.030 align:middle line:84%
And guess what these
trillions of cells do?

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:15.590 align:middle line:90%
Do they compete with each other?

00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:16.500 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:18.210 align:middle line:90%
Of course not.

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:21.140 align:middle line:84%
They work together
in perfect harmony

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:23.470 align:middle line:84%
for the benefit of
the whole community

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:25.890 align:middle line:90%
of cells called your body.

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:28.820 align:middle line:84%
So when the cells
start to compete,

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:30.560 align:middle line:90%
that's when you get cancer.

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:33.370 align:middle line:84%
That's when you're
in dissonance.

00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:35.040 align:middle line:90%
You're not resonating together.

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:36.860 align:middle line:90%
You're not working together.

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:41.310 align:middle line:84%
You're in disease with each
other, and you get sick.

00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:44.170 align:middle line:84%
So that's what's happened to
our societies, our communities.

00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:46.040 align:middle line:84%
Because we're competing
with each other,

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:48.570 align:middle line:90%
our society is sick.

00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And we can solve
the sick society

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:53.310 align:middle line:84%
by stopping the
competition and starting

00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:55.040 align:middle line:90%
to cooperate and collaborate.

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:58.980 align:middle line:84%
That's how quickly we
can change our society,

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:00.990 align:middle line:90%
using our bodies as an example.

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And you know, you can
take it a step further.

00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:07.670 align:middle line:84%
Even when the cells in your
body start to gang up together

00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:11.240 align:middle line:84%
and they form clusters
of specialized cells--

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:12.820 align:middle line:90%
oh, we a special, right?

00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:15.547 align:middle line:84%
Now in our lives, that
creates little clique groups,

00:33:15.547 --> 00:33:17.130 align:middle line:84%
and then they go
against those groups.

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:17.310 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no.

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:18.893 align:middle line:84%
You can't do this,
and you can't-- oh,

00:33:18.893 --> 00:33:22.320 align:middle line:84%
you have to fill in forms to
join us, and all this-- really?

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:23.600 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:27.200 align:middle line:84%
In your body, when these cells
form together, they gang up

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:29.850 align:middle line:84%
together and they form your
heart cells and your liver

00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:33.760 align:middle line:84%
cells and your skin cells
and your hair cells,

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:35.360 align:middle line:84%
they're still not
fighting each other

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:37.090 align:middle line:90%
or competing against each other.

00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:40.320 align:middle line:84%
They're still working
in cooperation

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:43.790 align:middle line:84%
for the greatest benefit of
the whole community of cells,

00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:47.050 align:middle line:84%
which is called your
body, your community.

00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:50.210 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at our
bodies as a perfect example

00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:54.390 align:middle line:84%
of this world in harmony,
and use the world around us.

00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And let's take this into
the world around us.

00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:59.240 align:middle line:90%
Just think about this.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:02.550 align:middle line:84%
At breakfast time, when you
come down to the kitchen--

00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:03.750 align:middle line:90%
this is the perfect family.

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:06.250 align:middle line:84%
Mother, father, son,
daughter, right?

00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:09.570 align:middle line:84%
This is the wonderful family
that has been sketched for us.

00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And you come down for
breakfast in the morning,

00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:14.150 align:middle line:84%
and you start making
yourself some toast.

00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:16.449 align:middle line:84%
Then your daughter
comes down, and she has

00:34:16.449 --> 00:34:19.260 align:middle line:90%
a bowl of oats and some juice.

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:22.451 align:middle line:84%
And then your wife
comes down, and she has

00:34:22.451 --> 00:34:23.659 align:middle line:90%
French-- what do you call it?

00:34:23.659 --> 00:34:24.969 align:middle line:90%
French toast.

00:34:24.969 --> 00:34:25.969 align:middle line:90%
And your son comes down.

00:34:25.969 --> 00:34:28.060 align:middle line:84%
He has some Rice
Krispies or something,

00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:31.667 align:middle line:84%
and some juice and some
peanut butter, and whatever.

00:34:31.667 --> 00:34:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And you're all sitting,
having beautiful breakfast

00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:35.449 align:middle line:84%
together, at which point
you turn to your daughter

00:34:35.449 --> 00:34:37.510 align:middle line:84%
and say, listen, that's
$5 for that bowl of oats

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:39.980 align:middle line:90%
and another $2 for the juice.

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And Darling, to your
wife, say, Darling,

00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:44.980 align:middle line:84%
that French toast
is going to be $5.

00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And son, that's $3.50 for you,
because you only had a bowl

00:34:48.810 --> 00:34:50.600 align:middle line:90%
of Rice Krispies.

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:52.020 align:middle line:90%
We don't do that, right?

00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:52.820 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:53.360 align:middle line:90%
We work together.

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:54.160 align:middle line:90%
This is our family.

00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:55.730 align:middle line:90%
We share.

00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:57.750 align:middle line:90%
We're sharing.

00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:59.990 align:middle line:84%
We share everything
in our families.

00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:02.840 align:middle line:84%
I guess there are some families
that don't, but let's not

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:04.630 align:middle line:90%
go there right now.

00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:08.657 align:middle line:84%
Let's focus on the loving,
united, harmonious families,

00:35:08.657 --> 00:35:10.490 align:middle line:84%
because there are more
of those in the world

00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:12.630 align:middle line:90%
than there are the opposite.

00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:14.560 align:middle line:90%
So we don't do that.

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:17.620 align:middle line:84%
And then you take
it further, and you

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:20.100 align:middle line:84%
go to the pub on a
Friday night and you bump

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:21.910 align:middle line:90%
into some really nice people.

00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:23.830 align:middle line:84%
You click with them and
you have a great time.

00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And you say, hey, I'm having a
barbecue on Sunday at my house.

00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:29.610 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you come over
to a barbecue at my house?

00:35:29.610 --> 00:35:31.315 align:middle line:84%
And they come to
our house on Sunday

00:35:31.315 --> 00:35:32.850 align:middle line:84%
and say, hey, John,
how's it going?

00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:33.690 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:35.340 align:middle line:90%
The beers are over there.

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:36.990 align:middle line:90%
There's a barby, come.

00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:38.304 align:middle line:90%
And you have a great time.

00:35:38.304 --> 00:35:40.720 align:middle line:84%
At which points you turn to
John and say, hey, by the way,

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:43.300 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be $100 for
the beers and the barbecue.

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:44.100 align:middle line:90%
You don't do that.

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:47.180 align:middle line:84%
You invited them over, and
you've opened your heart.

00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:49.280 align:middle line:84%
You've shared with
complete strangers.

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.890 align:middle line:90%
You've just met them.

00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:52.890 align:middle line:84%
You don't know them
from a bar of soap

00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:56.240 align:middle line:84%
except exchanging some
stories on football or ballet,

00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:58.170 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is
you spoke about.

00:35:58.170 --> 00:35:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And you resonate
with that person,

00:35:59.810 --> 00:36:01.450 align:middle line:84%
and so now you share
with that person.

00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:05.730 align:middle line:84%
That resonance goes beyond
just some bar chit-chat.

00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And you don't charge
them for that.

00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:10.350 align:middle line:90%
Or something weird happens.

00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:13.540 align:middle line:84%
Sunday night comes, you
wake up Monday morning,

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:16.610 align:middle line:84%
you get into your car,
you put on your suit,

00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:19.000 align:middle line:84%
you take your suitcase,
you get into your car,

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.110 align:middle line:84%
and you hit the
highway, and you change.

00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly you become
this monster machine.

00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:26.080 align:middle line:90%
It's all about making money.

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:26.880 align:middle line:90%
Get out of my way.

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:27.680 align:middle line:90%
Get out of my way.

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:29.100 align:middle line:90%
Why are you driving so slowly?

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And road rage takes over,
and you just want to-- you

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:33.754 align:middle line:84%
change from his
loving, sharing being

00:36:33.754 --> 00:36:35.670 align:middle line:84%
that wants to share
everything with his family

00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:37.880 align:middle line:84%
and complete strangers
over the weekend

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:40.180 align:middle line:84%
to this money-making
machine that has to go out,

00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:41.880 align:middle line:84%
and don't have time
for you, sorry.

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:42.370 align:middle line:90%
No, sorry.

00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:42.860 align:middle line:90%
Can't have time.

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:44.340 align:middle line:84%
Got to go out and
make some money.

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:45.790 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:48.620 align:middle line:84%
No wonder we've
become psychotic,

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:51.680 align:middle line:84%
because we have to live these
split personality lives.

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:54.600 align:middle line:84%
On the one hand, we just want
to share and share, and give

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:57.090 align:middle line:84%
everything, and invite
people into our space.

00:36:57.090 --> 00:36:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And on the other
hand, we're forced

00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:00.760 align:middle line:90%
to become these machines.

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And this is how our lives of
driven by this money thing,

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:05.120 align:middle line:90%
and destroyed.

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:09.840 align:middle line:84%
So the message really is treat
your community and the world

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:10.750 align:middle line:90%
as your family.

00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:13.500 align:middle line:10%
Start sharing this
beautiful gift that we have,

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:16.210 align:middle line:10%
this humanness that we
have with everyone else.

00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:18.776 align:middle line:84%
Start sharing that
with everyone you know.

00:37:18.776 --> 00:37:21.410 align:middle line:84%
In the poorest countries,
in the poorest places,

00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:24.020 align:middle line:84%
in the poorest villages, that's
where you get the most care

00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:25.680 align:middle line:90%
if you're stranded.

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:26.660 align:middle line:90%
People invite you in.

00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:28.300 align:middle line:84%
They give you the
last meal they have,

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:30.020 align:middle line:84%
the last bread, the
last food they have.

00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:32.510 align:middle line:84%
They'll give you the
shirt off their back

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:34.494 align:middle line:84%
if they find that
you need a shirt.

00:37:34.494 --> 00:37:35.910 align:middle line:84%
You don't find
that in the cities,

00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:37.060 align:middle line:90%
in the wealthy countries.

00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:39.770 align:middle line:84%
But in the poorest countries,
that's what happens to you.

00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:41.925 align:middle line:84%
They are far more
sharing and accommodating

00:37:41.925 --> 00:37:43.550 align:middle line:84%
than those of us that
have been chasing

00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:45.330 align:middle line:90%
the money in the big cities.

00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And remember, the reason most
people live in the cities--

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:49.996 align:middle line:84%
well, either they're
born there and that's all

00:37:49.996 --> 00:37:52.110 align:middle line:84%
they know, but the
majority of the people,

00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:54.360 align:middle line:84%
at some stage of our
lives, like me, was

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:58.890 align:middle line:84%
drawn into the city because of
work, jobs, or whatever it is.

00:37:58.890 --> 00:38:00.350 align:middle line:90%
You're drawn to the city.

00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:03.670 align:middle line:84%
They've become these giant
metropolitan clusters

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:07.960 align:middle line:84%
of desperate people looking to
survive because we came there

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:11.650 align:middle line:84%
looking for a job, or we
offered a job in the city

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:14.010 align:middle line:84%
that you weren't offered
out in the village.

00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:18.040 align:middle line:84%
So you're forced to vacate and
leave the place that you love,

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:19.960 align:middle line:84%
to live in, that you
choose to live in,

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:23.070 align:middle line:84%
you're forced to leave
that because money has

00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:25.290 align:middle line:90%
forced you to move to the city.

00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:26.187 align:middle line:90%
It's not by choice.

00:38:26.187 --> 00:38:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's how people get
trapped in these cities.

00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:31.870 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
unfold all of this,

00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:34.250 align:middle line:84%
and deprogram and
undo all of this,

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:36.993 align:middle line:84%
and show how easy it
is to reverse that it.

00:38:36.993 --> 00:38:40.940 align:middle line:84%
How easy it is to allow
people to leave the cities

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:43.660 align:middle line:84%
and move back into their
small towns and villages.

00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:47.170 align:middle line:84%
No matter how small a town
it is, how far or distant

00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:49.140 align:middle line:84%
that village may
be, the moment we

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:53.050 align:middle line:84%
introduce the Contributionism
and the Ubuntu principles,

00:38:53.050 --> 00:38:56.530 align:middle line:84%
all this becomes an
instant possibility.

00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And this is the most
liberating thing about this.

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:04.140 align:middle line:84%
The millions of people that are
trapped in the cities right now

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:06.100 align:middle line:90%
immediately have an escape.

00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:09.610 align:middle line:84%
They can give it all up
and leave without any fear

00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:11.180 align:middle line:84%
that they're not
going to have a job,

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:14.070 align:middle line:84%
or not going to have enough
food, or a place to live,

00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:15.960 align:middle line:84%
or that they're going
back to the dark ages,

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:18.060 align:middle line:84%
or having to live in
caves because they left

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:20.150 align:middle line:84%
the comfort of the
city, even though they

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:23.965 align:middle line:84%
live in squalor or a little hole
in the city most of the time.

00:39:23.965 --> 00:39:28.910 align:middle line:84%
So this is what this
Ubuntu and Contributionism

00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:29.860 align:middle line:90%
philosophy does.

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:31.450 align:middle line:90%
It reverses that process.

00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:34.930 align:middle line:84%
It is quite spectacular
when you see this unfold.

00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:37.850 align:middle line:84%
Treat your community
and the world

00:39:37.850 --> 00:39:42.430 align:middle line:84%
as your family, and
everything changes.

00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And this brings us back to what
we started off talking about,

00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:52.740 align:middle line:84%
the fact that we're really
revisiting some of the reasons

00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:55.210 align:middle line:84%
why the world is so screwed
up and so messed up,

00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:57.690 align:middle line:84%
and why so many
people live in misery.

00:39:57.690 --> 00:40:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And we have to face
the terrible truth.

00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And that terrible truth brings
the enlightenment with it.

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:06.650 align:middle line:84%
If we're strong enough to
face the terrible truth

00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:10.650 align:middle line:84%
of our enslavement
and this insane world

00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:12.460 align:middle line:84%
that we're trapped in,
we are strong enough

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:16.130 align:middle line:84%
to take the steps to
liberate ourselves from it.

00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:19.840 align:middle line:84%
And see it, as I said
earlier, as a liberating

00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:22.640 align:middle line:84%
process, as information
that liberates us,

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:24.760 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't get this
us down and depressed.

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:26.350 align:middle line:90%
It must do the opposite.

00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:28.800 align:middle line:84%
Often, people get so
depressed about this-- no.

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:29.750 align:middle line:90%
Don't do that.

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:32.240 align:middle line:84%
Wherever you are, at home,
wherever you're watching this,

00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:34.030 align:middle line:90%
don't get depressed about this.

00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:35.600 align:middle line:90%
Get excited about this.

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:38.440 align:middle line:84%
This information shows
us what we must be doing

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.470 align:middle line:84%
and what we should be
doing, how simple it

00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:42.670 align:middle line:84%
is, how we're not
only going to do it,

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:44.100 align:middle line:90%
how we already are doing it.

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:46.709 align:middle line:84%
There are millions of
people around the world that

00:40:46.709 --> 00:40:49.000 align:middle line:84%
have already engaged in this
process, that are doing it

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.250 align:middle line:84%
in ways that we can't
imagine until we've

00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:53.090 align:middle line:90%
seen these people do it.

00:40:53.090 --> 00:40:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately enough,
I'm in a position,

00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:57.410 align:middle line:84%
because of sharing
this philosophy,

00:40:57.410 --> 00:41:00.250 align:middle line:84%
I get a lot of emails
and often phone

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:02.810 align:middle line:84%
calls from people telling
me about what they're

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:04.980 align:middle line:84%
doing in their communities,
and doing the most

00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:09.390 align:middle line:84%
incredible things that literally
makes this journey for me

00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:12.900 align:middle line:84%
personally worthwhile,
every second of every day,

00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:16.280 align:middle line:84%
and why I have not yet given
up because I know it's real.

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:17.870 align:middle line:90%
I know it's a possibility.

00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:21.680 align:middle line:84%
It's not just a
theory or an ideology.

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:23.230 align:middle line:90%
This is a new reality.

00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:26.680 align:middle line:84%
Because once it resonates inside
you and inside all of us--

00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:29.750 align:middle line:84%
and I know it already resonates
in all of you here today.

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:31.290 align:middle line:90%
That's why you're here.

00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:33.870 align:middle line:84%
Once it resonates in you,
there's no turning back.

00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's only one way forward,
and we're busy doing it.

00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:42.430 align:middle line:84%
So let's face the terrible truth
and see how we can get around

00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:44.570 align:middle line:84%
it, how we can create
a new alternative

00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:48.430 align:middle line:84%
reality for ourselves, to
create a world of abundance.

00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:51.120 align:middle line:84%
First of all, we have to
realize that we are not

00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:52.630 align:middle line:90%
born free on this planet.

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:54.680 align:middle line:90%
We cannot move around freely.

00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:56.660 align:middle line:10%
We cannot live
where we choose to.

00:41:56.660 --> 00:41:58.790 align:middle line:10%
We need passports
and work permits.

00:41:58.790 --> 00:42:00.550 align:middle line:10%
We spoke about that
during the break.

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:03.110 align:middle line:10%
We need to follow rules
and laws that we didn't

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:05.360 align:middle line:10%
agree to at birth, right?

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:08.680 align:middle line:84%
How many of you agreed
to the rules and the laws

00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:13.240 align:middle line:84%
at birth that are
imposed on you today?

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:14.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:15.140 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:17.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most of us
don't even really know

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:19.210 align:middle line:84%
where and when we
were born, but we

00:42:19.210 --> 00:42:22.850 align:middle line:84%
claim we know because we have
a birth certificate, right?

00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:26.440 align:middle line:84%
So we have to work and
earn money to survive.

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:29.570 align:middle line:10%
We have to pay taxes
to escape jail time.

00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:33.070 align:middle line:10%
This is-- and some people still
say, oh, I've got free will.

00:42:33.070 --> 00:42:33.945 align:middle line:90%
I can do what I want.

00:42:33.945 --> 00:42:35.450 align:middle line:90%
And I go, really?

00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:36.680 align:middle line:90%
You can do what you want to?

00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:37.480 align:middle line:90%
Oh, of course.

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:39.580 align:middle line:84%
I can go wherever I want,
I can do what I want.

00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:42.540 align:middle line:84%
I can catch a plane
anywhere in the world.

00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:43.442 align:middle line:90%
I said, really?

00:42:43.442 --> 00:42:45.275 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever had your
passport confiscated?

00:42:45.275 --> 00:42:46.545 align:middle line:90%
Do you even have a passport?

00:42:46.545 --> 00:42:49.640 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever tried to
cross a border recently?

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:50.780 align:middle line:90%
It is not an easy thing.

00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:52.870 align:middle line:90%
It's not a pleasant thing.

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:56.540 align:middle line:84%
You feel like a criminal just
crossing a border the way

00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:58.990 align:middle line:84%
that they interrogate you,
the way they look at you.

00:42:58.990 --> 00:43:01.974 align:middle line:84%
There's that's suspicious--
it's just insanity,

00:43:01.974 --> 00:43:02.890 align:middle line:90%
what's happened to us.

00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:04.090 align:middle line:90%
This is not freedom, people.

00:43:04.090 --> 00:43:06.255 align:middle line:90%
We all know what this is called.

00:43:06.255 --> 00:43:08.210 align:middle line:90%
It's called slavery.

00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:09.770 align:middle line:90%
We are all born into slavery.

00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:10.940 align:middle line:90%
Remember what Morpheus said.

00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:12.640 align:middle line:90%
You're all "born into bondage."

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:17.230 align:middle line:84%
We're all born on a slave--
we're born on a prison planet,

00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:19.240 align:middle line:90%
all enslaved by money.

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:22.100 align:middle line:84%
It is the money factor
that is the foundation

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:25.090 align:middle line:90%
of this enslavement system.

00:43:25.090 --> 00:43:28.360 align:middle line:84%
So we live on a prison planet
that's driven by money.

00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:30.460 align:middle line:84%
It has been for
thousands of years.

00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we have to
deal with the money thing.

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Until we deal with
the money problem,

00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:38.430 align:middle line:84%
we are never going
to solve the problem.

00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:41.290 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to deal
with some really disturbing

00:43:41.290 --> 00:43:44.070 align:middle line:84%
reminders of what
money has done,

00:43:44.070 --> 00:43:46.650 align:middle line:84%
what money has-- the
effects of money.

00:43:46.650 --> 00:43:48.150 align:middle line:84%
Every time I look
at these pictures,

00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:51.170 align:middle line:84%
it makes me want
to cry, what humans

00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:57.390 align:middle line:84%
have done to other humans in
the pursuit of money and wealth.

00:43:57.390 --> 00:44:01.670 align:middle line:84%
How you could possibly do
this to other human beings.

00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:04.520 align:middle line:84%
The effects of money
and capitalism.

00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:06.750 align:middle line:84%
This picture, I mean,
these are young boys.

00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:10.710 align:middle line:84%
Some of them must
be 13, 14 years old.

00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:12.840 align:middle line:84%
You can see the
fear in their eyes.

00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And remember that
the slave trade

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:17.590 align:middle line:90%
was seen as a noble trade.

00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And some of the most important
politicians and leaders

00:44:20.830 --> 00:44:23.560 align:middle line:84%
in the past were
all slave traders,

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:25.780 align:middle line:90%
dealing in human misery.

00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:28.790 align:middle line:84%
It's just unbelievable
that these people are still

00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:33.120 align:middle line:84%
in charge of our countries and
our destinies, and our lives.

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:34.610 align:middle line:90%
Not for very much longer.

00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:36.650 align:middle line:84%
This has been going on
for thousands of years,

00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:41.070 align:middle line:84%
but these are just reminders
from very recent times, how

00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:44.530 align:middle line:90%
slavery has been imposed on us.

00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:50.080 align:middle line:10%
How you can trade human lives
in a notice in a newspaper.

00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:54.770 align:middle line:10%
It's actually just almost
unbearable to look at.

00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And the treatment
that was handed out

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:01.890 align:middle line:84%
to other human beings
by their so-called slave

00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:03.690 align:middle line:90%
masters and their owners.

00:45:03.690 --> 00:45:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And this is just the
tip of the iceberg.

00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:09.840 align:middle line:84%
This is what money
has caused us to do.

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:12.600 align:middle line:90%
Money, greed, capitalism.

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:15.660 align:middle line:84%
This kind of
behavior that is just

00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:19.050 align:middle line:84%
unimaginable to any
sentient, conscious being.

00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And if you think that slavery
has ended, think again.

00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:25.590 align:middle line:90%
We are all slaves.

00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:27.610 align:middle line:90%
We just don't realize it.

00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:31.290 align:middle line:84%
It is just today, the whips
and chains have simply

00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:34.510 align:middle line:90%
been replaced by money.

00:45:34.510 --> 00:45:38.570 align:middle line:84%
If you don't earn money, you
cannot survive in this world.

00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:41.860 align:middle line:84%
Slavery in the modern
world is much worse

00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:44.200 align:middle line:84%
than anybody could
ever imagine, and this

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:46.980 align:middle line:90%
is what we need to deal with.

00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:50.450 align:middle line:84%
The Ubuntu
Contributionism system

00:45:50.450 --> 00:45:53.810 align:middle line:90%
deals with this immediately.

00:45:53.810 --> 00:45:57.050 align:middle line:84%
It cannot continue in
a world without money.

00:45:57.050 --> 00:46:01.220 align:middle line:84%
In a world without money, there
is no tool of enslavement.

00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:03.020 align:middle line:90%
It is a tool of enslavement.

00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:05.800 align:middle line:84%
It is nothing less
and nothing more.

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:06.660 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is.

00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:09.440 align:middle line:84%
That's all it was
ever intended to be.

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:13.260 align:middle line:84%
Without money or control
or the hierarchical system,

00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:16.140 align:middle line:84%
nobody could ever
impose a slavery system

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:18.420 align:middle line:90%
of any kind on anyone,

00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:21.050 align:middle line:84%
It's Wolfgang Goethe that
made one of the most cutting

00:46:21.050 --> 00:46:24.900 align:middle line:84%
statements that said, "none are
more enslaved than those who

00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:26.620 align:middle line:90%
falsely believe they are free."

00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:30.210 align:middle line:84%
The emphasis is on "falsely
believe they are free."

00:46:30.210 --> 00:46:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And most of the people today
falsely believe they are free.

00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:35.530 align:middle line:84%
They think that
because they live

00:46:35.530 --> 00:46:39.260 align:middle line:84%
in a democratic society that
has elections every four years,

00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:41.110 align:middle line:90%
they live in a free world.

00:46:41.110 --> 00:46:43.390 align:middle line:84%
This is the illusion that
we find ourselves in.

00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:47.910 align:middle line:84%
This is what we need to bypass
to create a new alternative

00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:50.410 align:middle line:90%
that simply escapes this.

00:46:50.410 --> 00:46:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And before anyone
realizes, the sooner

00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:56.890 align:middle line:84%
we do this, the sooner we start
implementing this, those that

00:46:56.890 --> 00:46:59.260 align:middle line:84%
are currently
controlling humanity

00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:01.510 align:middle line:84%
or think they control
humanity will suddenly

00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:03.360 align:middle line:90%
be in control of nobody.

00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:06.840 align:middle line:84%
The bankers and the financial
families, the banking families

00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:08.430 align:middle line:84%
that run the world
with their money

00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:11.410 align:middle line:84%
will suddenly have no one
to control, no one to run.

00:47:11.410 --> 00:47:12.910 align:middle line:84%
All their money
will be completely

00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:14.390 align:middle line:90%
worthless and useless.

00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:17.680 align:middle line:84%
That's how simple and eloquent
this plan of action is.

00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And we'll unfold that as we
move on through this series

00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:22.510 align:middle line:90%
of workshops.

00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:24.800 align:middle line:84%
But we've come to the
end of another hour,

00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:28.300 align:middle line:84%
so let's take another 10 minutes
to throw some ideas around.

00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:31.280 align:middle line:84%
Can't believe how
quickly an hour goes.

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:33.890 align:middle line:90%
So are there any questions?

00:47:33.890 --> 00:47:35.825 align:middle line:90%
So anything people want to say?

00:47:35.825 --> 00:47:36.845 align:middle line:90%
Over there.

00:47:36.845 --> 00:47:39.800 align:middle line:84%
>>You talked about
bypassing the system earlier

00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:41.800 align:middle line:90%
and not confronting it.

00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And with movements like
the March Against Monsanto

00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:47.110 align:middle line:84%
and the Million Mask
March who were confronting

00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:50.410 align:middle line:84%
this type of government
corruption and control

00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:53.030 align:middle line:84%
through money and
corporations, what do you think

00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:54.520 align:middle line:90%
about that kind of approach?

00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:55.320 align:middle line:90%
>>Awesome.

00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:56.220 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for bringing that up.

00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:56.910 align:middle line:90%
It's really important.

00:47:56.910 --> 00:47:58.550 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a
question that I get

00:47:58.550 --> 00:48:00.550 align:middle line:90%
or a suggestion I get often.

00:48:00.550 --> 00:48:02.880 align:middle line:84%
People say, oh, you
know, why don't you

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:05.780 align:middle line:84%
join up with the
Thrive Movement,

00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:10.030 align:middle line:84%
or join up with The Venus
Project or the Zeitgeist

00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:12.110 align:middle line:84%
Movement, and New Earth
Nation, and so forth?

00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:13.860 align:middle line:90%
And we know all those people.

00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:15.720 align:middle line:84%
We've had contact
with all these groups

00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:18.030 align:middle line:84%
in these amazing initiatives
that have been started.

00:48:18.030 --> 00:48:20.910 align:middle line:84%
There are thousands of
initiatives, thousands

00:48:20.910 --> 00:48:23.860 align:middle line:84%
of movements around the world
that are doing incredible work.

00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:28.090 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of marches going on
against the inhumane activities

00:48:28.090 --> 00:48:30.090 align:middle line:84%
and brutality of
our governments,

00:48:30.090 --> 00:48:31.760 align:middle line:84%
and thousands of
movements that are

00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:36.285 align:middle line:84%
proposing eloquent solutions
for specific problems.

00:48:36.285 --> 00:48:38.660 align:middle line:84%
The objective is not
to unite us all now.

00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:40.570 align:middle line:84%
We all need to
respect each other.

00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:42.530 align:middle line:84%
What we need to do is
be aware of each other

00:48:42.530 --> 00:48:46.990 align:middle line:84%
and support each other in
our individual activities.

00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:49.010 align:middle line:84%
Like, I said, the organs
in your body, right?

00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:49.280 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:51.820 align:middle line:84%
>>Support each other, work--
so if we know that there's

00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:53.990 align:middle line:84%
a March Against Monsanto,
we support them,

00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:57.220 align:middle line:84%
and get as many people there
to do what that group of people

00:48:57.220 --> 00:48:58.110 align:middle line:90%
are doing.

00:48:58.110 --> 00:49:01.097 align:middle line:84%
When we're doing something, we
expect everybody to support us.

00:49:01.097 --> 00:49:02.680 align:middle line:84%
When Venus Project
is doing something,

00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:04.452 align:middle line:84%
we will support them
with everything we do

00:49:04.452 --> 00:49:05.410 align:middle line:90%
and everything we know.

00:49:05.410 --> 00:49:07.492 align:middle line:84%
And all of these movements
around the world,

00:49:07.492 --> 00:49:09.700 align:middle line:84%
we need to support each
other, be aware of each other

00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:10.820 align:middle line:90%
and support each other.

00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:13.910 align:middle line:84%
There's no need to unite
and start working together.

00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:16.880 align:middle line:84%
I describe it as seeing
all the global activities

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:20.280 align:middle line:84%
and the amazing movements around
the world as individual links

00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:23.570 align:middle line:84%
of a long chain, performing
a very important role,

00:49:23.570 --> 00:49:25.410 align:middle line:90%
holding the chain strong.

00:49:25.410 --> 00:49:27.820 align:middle line:84%
But it's the chain,
individual links,

00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:30.620 align:middle line:84%
a chain that's around
the neck of the beast.

00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And we're tightening the noose
around the neck of the beast,

00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:36.550 align:middle line:90%
link by link, click by click.

00:49:36.550 --> 00:49:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And we'll automatically unite
and come together in the middle

00:49:40.070 --> 00:49:41.550 align:middle line:90%
when we've overcome the beast.

00:49:41.550 --> 00:49:44.430 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to do it
synthetically or force it.

00:49:44.430 --> 00:49:47.110 align:middle line:84%
Let's just carry on doing
what we're doing individually,

00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:49.030 align:middle line:84%
but collectively, be
aware of each other

00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:50.200 align:middle line:90%
and support each other.

00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:53.300 align:middle line:84%
>>We all have, like, a same
goal through these movements,

00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:57.360 align:middle line:84%
and we're all trying
to fight it separately

00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:00.790 align:middle line:84%
in individual groups,
but we're all one.

00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:01.660 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:05.720 align:middle line:84%
The Wall Street activities,
the Occupy Wall Street.

00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:08.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, remember how-- that
was insane how big that

00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:13.120 align:middle line:84%
became all over the world,
South Africa, everywhere.

00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:15.860 align:middle line:84%
But there wasn't
really an outcome.

00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:16.950 align:middle line:90%
But that doesn't matter.

00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:19.380 align:middle line:90%
They didn't need an outcome.

00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:25.050 align:middle line:84%
the job of that particular
event and that energetic field

00:50:25.050 --> 00:50:27.050 align:middle line:84%
there was to just make
people of the world

00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:29.610 align:middle line:84%
aware of the crimes
of the bankers,

00:50:29.610 --> 00:50:31.380 align:middle line:84%
and what the banking
families were doing,

00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:34.432 align:middle line:84%
and how the banks were
abusing our liberties.

00:50:34.432 --> 00:50:35.390 align:middle line:90%
And they achieved that.

00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:37.120 align:middle line:84%
They achieved that
to a large extent.

00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:39.550 align:middle line:84%
Although it was
infiltrated and manipulated

00:50:39.550 --> 00:50:42.140 align:middle line:84%
by the global elite,
and we know there

00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:44.920 align:middle line:84%
are lots of stories about
how that was used and abused,

00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:45.720 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't matter.

00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:47.780 align:middle line:84%
It still brought
to the attention

00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:49.660 align:middle line:84%
of most of the
people in the world

00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:53.070 align:middle line:84%
how completely
corrupt and inadequate

00:50:53.070 --> 00:50:54.720 align:middle line:84%
the financial and
the money system

00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:58.670 align:middle line:90%
is for the global population.

00:50:58.670 --> 00:50:59.795 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for sharing that.

00:50:59.795 --> 00:51:00.160 align:middle line:90%
>>Yep.

00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:00.960 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:04.930 align:middle line:84%
>>Anybody else have anything
to say or add at this stage?

00:51:04.930 --> 00:51:07.390 align:middle line:84%
>>Do you think that
we'd be able to take

00:51:07.390 --> 00:51:10.450 align:middle line:84%
this movement to the
next level with the steps

00:51:10.450 --> 00:51:11.800 align:middle line:90%
that we're taking?

00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:14.090 align:middle line:84%
Or do you think it's
going to take a collapse?

00:51:14.090 --> 00:51:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And I guess what brings
that about is recently,

00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:19.910 align:middle line:84%
I went to the World Series
Parade there in Kansas City.

00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:23.720 align:middle line:84%
800,000 people came together
in the little community.

00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:26.180 align:middle line:84%
No riots, no crime,
nothing like that.

00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:29.820 align:middle line:84%
But it was just 800,000
people came together

00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:33.390 align:middle line:84%
to celebrate something
that is of no importance

00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:36.180 align:middle line:90%
to civilization, to humanity.

00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And we have a small
gathering of what

00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:41.490 align:middle line:84%
I believe to be
one of the greatest

00:51:41.490 --> 00:51:45.340 align:middle line:84%
movements in all the history
that I've ever been taught.

00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:47.640 align:middle line:84%
So I guess my
question is, do you

00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:49.840 align:middle line:84%
think we'd be able to
do it with the steps

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:52.570 align:middle line:84%
that you're taking in
directing us towards?

00:51:52.570 --> 00:51:54.340 align:middle line:84%
Or do you think it'll
take a collapse?

00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:55.140 align:middle line:90%
>>Thanks for bringing that up.

00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:55.570 align:middle line:90%
Steve?

00:51:55.570 --> 00:51:55.865 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:51:55.865 --> 00:51:57.070 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, thanks, Steve.

00:51:57.070 --> 00:52:00.960 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the frequently
asked questions as well,

00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:02.860 align:middle line:90%
so let's deal with it right now.

00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:05.860 align:middle line:84%
Never underestimate the
power and the importance

00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:08.030 align:middle line:84%
and the effect of a
small gathering of people

00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:10.700 align:middle line:84%
and the effect they have
on their environment

00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:14.220 align:middle line:84%
and their government
and the world.

00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:20.760 align:middle line:84%
All revolutions, all new
movements, all events

00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:23.470 align:middle line:84%
of the past that have had
huge effects on the planet

00:52:23.470 --> 00:52:26.510 align:middle line:84%
have started in little rooms
and little meetings like this.

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:28.514 align:middle line:84%
And this is not an
isolated meeting.

00:52:28.514 --> 00:52:30.680 align:middle line:84%
There have been thousands
of these around the world.

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:34.840 align:middle line:84%
I've held these workshops
in dozens of countries

00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:36.610 align:middle line:84%
and spoken to
thousands of people.

00:52:36.610 --> 00:52:38.970 align:middle line:84%
Because of the internet,
this is seen by millions

00:52:38.970 --> 00:52:40.430 align:middle line:90%
of people around the world.

00:52:40.430 --> 00:52:43.660 align:middle line:84%
We don't necessarily have to
come together in one gathering.

00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:47.612 align:middle line:84%
But what it does do,
it allows people access

00:52:47.612 --> 00:52:49.820 align:middle line:84%
to this knowledge and
information, it plants the seed

00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:52.180 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness in their
hearts and in their minds,

00:52:52.180 --> 00:52:55.470 align:middle line:84%
and it makes many
people act and react

00:52:55.470 --> 00:52:57.550 align:middle line:84%
to the knowledge
and the information.

00:52:57.550 --> 00:53:01.800 align:middle line:84%
And they then become the
driver of that knowledge

00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:04.450 align:middle line:84%
and the resonance to
everyone around them.

00:53:04.450 --> 00:53:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And remember, the fact that
even if you don't say this,

00:53:07.050 --> 00:53:09.530 align:middle line:84%
you carry that
resonance in your body.

00:53:09.530 --> 00:53:12.986 align:middle line:84%
So wherever you walk--
I often joke about this.

00:53:12.986 --> 00:53:14.860 align:middle line:84%
You walk up-- once you
know this information,

00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:19.030 align:middle line:84%
you go to a
pharmaceutical conference

00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:20.910 align:middle line:90%
and just go stand at the door.

00:53:20.910 --> 00:53:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to
say a word to them.

00:53:22.990 --> 00:53:24.280 align:middle line:90%
Just think it out loud.

00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:25.450 align:middle line:90%
Think it and just go--

00:53:25.450 --> 00:53:26.590 align:middle line:90%
[GROAN]

00:53:26.590 --> 00:53:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And you just shove this
knowledge and this information

00:53:29.070 --> 00:53:32.110 align:middle line:84%
onto all the people at the
pharmaceutical conference,

00:53:32.110 --> 00:53:33.930 align:middle line:90%
the convention inside there.

00:53:33.930 --> 00:53:35.110 align:middle line:90%
We can cure all disease.

00:53:35.110 --> 00:53:35.910 align:middle line:90%
[GROAN]

00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:37.360 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:38.740 align:middle line:90%
But it's an important thing.

00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:42.220 align:middle line:84%
The fact that people are
gathering, they get together

00:53:42.220 --> 00:53:46.140 align:middle line:84%
and there is that thing of
unity and the collectiveness,

00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:47.804 align:middle line:84%
and the connectedness
of those people.

00:53:47.804 --> 00:53:49.720 align:middle line:84%
Even though it might be
for different reasons,

00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:54.510 align:middle line:84%
it's like a training ground
for other activities later on.

00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:57.300 align:middle line:84%
Today they're meeting because
of football or something else.

00:53:57.300 --> 00:54:00.302 align:middle line:84%
Next week, it might be because
of a very different situation.

00:54:00.302 --> 00:54:01.760 align:middle line:84%
Than they'll be
comfortable with it

00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:06.880 align:middle line:84%
because they'll see their
football buddies there as well.

00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:08.260 align:middle line:90%
So it's a process.

00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And the answer to
your question is, yes.

00:54:10.830 --> 00:54:15.890 align:middle line:84%
Or again, by the time we finish
with this eight-hour workshop,

00:54:15.890 --> 00:54:19.300 align:middle line:84%
you'll not only believe
that we can do this,

00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:20.720 align:middle line:84%
and it can happen
really quickly,

00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:24.180 align:middle line:84%
you will know that it
can happen very quickly.

00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:27.200 align:middle line:84%
Because you'll see the steps,
and how simple the steps are,

00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:29.590 align:middle line:84%
and that we're busy
taking the steps already.

00:54:29.590 --> 00:54:36.070 align:middle line:84%
So you know, I'm of the opinion
that within the next few years,

00:54:36.070 --> 00:54:39.070 align:middle line:84%
we can see a radical
shift of consciousness

00:54:39.070 --> 00:54:42.390 align:middle line:84%
and the effects of what it is
that we're doing here today,

00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:44.840 align:middle line:84%
planting the seeds
of consciousness

00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:48.240 align:middle line:84%
in the small group
that's recorded

00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:50.690 align:middle line:84%
that's going to be shared
with millions of people

00:54:50.690 --> 00:54:52.970 align:middle line:90%
by watching this recording.

00:54:52.970 --> 00:54:55.970 align:middle line:84%
We can't imagine
how this resonance

00:54:55.970 --> 00:55:00.510 align:middle line:84%
will affect the fabric of
reality in the quantum field.

00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:02.398 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:02.398 --> 00:55:03.820 align:middle line:90%


00:55:03.820 --> 00:55:05.800 align:middle line:90%
So one final thing.

00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:07.940 align:middle line:90%


00:55:07.940 --> 00:55:08.740 align:middle line:90%
>>Hi.

00:55:08.740 --> 00:55:09.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm Delisa.

00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:14.390 align:middle line:84%
I was really encouraged to hear
you say that even though this

00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:18.010 align:middle line:84%
is like the supreme sacred cow,
this whole thing about money,

00:55:18.010 --> 00:55:21.910 align:middle line:84%
that when you plant the
seed, it will, at some point,

00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:23.110 align:middle line:90%
begin to germinate.

00:55:23.110 --> 00:55:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I
find that so helpful

00:55:27.110 --> 00:55:30.760 align:middle line:84%
is that ever since I came across
your work about two years ago,

00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:34.740 align:middle line:84%
I've told every single person
I've met, I think, about this.

00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:38.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, strangers in the
airport, my closest friends.

00:55:38.890 --> 00:55:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And I have found almost no one
who will get excited about it

00:55:44.450 --> 00:55:46.530 align:middle line:84%
like I did on the
very first thing.

00:55:46.530 --> 00:55:50.542 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well, of course,
that makes so much sense.

00:55:50.542 --> 00:55:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And all I get instead
is, but, but, but.

00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:56.110 align:middle line:84%
We're intrinsically
greedy, and all those kinds

00:55:56.110 --> 00:55:57.840 align:middle line:84%
of things, and money's
not the problem,

00:55:57.840 --> 00:55:58.840 align:middle line:90%
it's what we do with it.

00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:01.220 align:middle line:90%
And all those arguments.

00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:02.740 align:middle line:84%
And even last
night, I was talking

00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:06.930 align:middle line:84%
with somebody who has a
very great consciousness,

00:56:06.930 --> 00:56:10.365 align:middle line:84%
and yet she's like, well,
it's just not my thing.

00:56:10.365 --> 00:56:12.570 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:12.570 --> 00:56:17.320 align:middle line:84%
And I did some introspection
after that, and I thought,

00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:19.140 align:middle line:84%
what should I do in a
situation like this?

00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:22.110 align:middle line:84%
Should I continue to
tell her about this?

00:56:22.110 --> 00:56:24.470 align:middle line:84%
Should I just pull
back and go, you know,

00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:26.340 align:middle line:84%
I feel this instant
resistance as soon

00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:28.160 align:middle line:90%
as I bring up the subject.

00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:30.450 align:middle line:90%
What should I do about that?

00:56:30.450 --> 00:56:31.780 align:middle line:90%
And I'd like your response.

00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:35.780 align:middle line:84%
But what I heard from
you earlier is that,

00:56:35.780 --> 00:56:36.700 align:middle line:90%
keep talking about it.

00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:37.970 align:middle line:90%
Don't expect them to like it.

00:56:37.970 --> 00:56:40.320 align:middle line:90%
Don't expect them to absorb it.

00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:43.246 align:middle line:90%
Just plant the seed.

00:56:43.246 --> 00:56:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And I believe, do it in love,
and not make them wrong.

00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:47.380 align:middle line:90%
Just plant the seed.

00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And then go on and get
busy and plant some more,

00:56:50.180 --> 00:56:54.310 align:middle line:84%
because life will provide
the circumstances under which

00:56:54.310 --> 00:56:55.310 align:middle line:90%
that seed can germinate.

00:56:55.310 --> 00:56:56.110 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:56:56.110 --> 00:56:58.070 align:middle line:84%
Now you've answered
your own question there.

00:56:58.070 --> 00:56:59.030 align:middle line:90%
It's really that.

00:56:59.030 --> 00:57:01.464 align:middle line:84%
And thanks for bringing
this up, because it just

00:57:01.464 --> 00:57:02.880 align:middle line:84%
reminds me of when
I first started

00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:05.220 align:middle line:90%
talking about this in 2005.

00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:07.610 align:middle line:84%
The first time I spoke
to anyone about this

00:57:07.610 --> 00:57:10.590 align:middle line:84%
was 12 people at
a dinner that was

00:57:10.590 --> 00:57:16.262 align:middle line:84%
hosted by a senior manager of
Barclays bank in South Africa.

00:57:16.262 --> 00:57:18.140 align:middle line:90%
And I just walked into a trap.

00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:20.790 align:middle line:84%
She said, oh, so you've been
talking about this world

00:57:20.790 --> 00:57:21.590 align:middle line:90%
without money.

00:57:21.590 --> 00:57:23.030 align:middle line:84%
So why don't you-- I'm
going to host a dinner,

00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:25.110 align:middle line:84%
and come and tell us about
how this world without money

00:57:25.110 --> 00:57:26.030 align:middle line:90%
is going to work.

00:57:26.030 --> 00:57:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And this-- I was maybe,
like, three, four months

00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:29.360 align:middle line:90%
into this philosophy.

00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:30.650 align:middle line:90%
Boy, did I walk into a trap.

00:57:30.650 --> 00:57:31.450 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:31.450 --> 00:57:34.220 align:middle line:84%
So I nearly got beaten up
that night, quite frankly,

00:57:34.220 --> 00:57:37.780 align:middle line:84%
by very arrogant guys
with big four-by-fours

00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:39.799 align:middle line:84%
and huge egos that
said, well, how

00:57:39.799 --> 00:57:42.340 align:middle line:84%
dare you suggest you're going
to take away from me everything

00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:43.740 align:middle line:90%
I've worked so hard for?

00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:47.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's that kind of-- it's
always a fear-based response.

00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:49.160 align:middle line:84%
It's a lack of knowledge,
a lack of resonance,

00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:52.640 align:middle line:84%
a lack of information
that makes people respond.

00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:54.760 align:middle line:84%
We're not taking anything
away from anyone.

00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:57.380 align:middle line:84%
We're providing people with an
alternative that will give them

00:57:57.380 --> 00:57:58.240 align:middle line:90%
infinite abundance.

00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:00.490 align:middle line:84%
But then we're going to deal
with all those questions,

00:58:00.490 --> 00:58:02.410 align:middle line:84%
the 13 most frequently
asked questions.

00:58:02.410 --> 00:58:05.742 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see how you'll answer
these questions with such ease.

00:58:05.742 --> 00:58:07.200 align:middle line:84%
That's what will
happen to everyone

00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:09.807 align:middle line:84%
that watches this workshop
and everyone here,

00:58:09.807 --> 00:58:11.390 align:middle line:84%
and that is the most
liberating thing.

00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:13.927 align:middle line:84%
When you can answer any
question that you can come up

00:58:13.927 --> 00:58:16.510 align:middle line:84%
with in your mind because you've
completely internalized this,

00:58:16.510 --> 00:58:20.010 align:middle line:84%
and you resonate with
this philosophy naturally.

00:58:20.010 --> 00:58:23.390 align:middle line:84%
That's when you
really feel liberated.

00:58:23.390 --> 00:58:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And I would suggest,
don't force the issue.

00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:28.720 align:middle line:84%
If you tell somebody about
this and they automatically

00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:30.180 align:middle line:90%
resist it, don't force it.

00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:31.820 align:middle line:84%
But at least you've
planted the seed.

00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:32.760 align:middle line:90%
And something will happen.

00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:34.176 align:middle line:84%
They might walk
past the book shop

00:58:34.176 --> 00:58:36.860 align:middle line:84%
and see a book in the window,
or they read an article,

00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:39.300 align:middle line:84%
or they see a politician
say something, or whatever.

00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And it'll just reactivate that
trigger, and they'll go, wow.

00:58:43.530 --> 00:58:46.030 align:middle line:84%
That crazy woman I
saw at the airport,

00:58:46.030 --> 00:58:48.550 align:middle line:84%
she said we can live in
a world without money.

00:58:48.550 --> 00:58:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And let me think about
that a little bit more.

00:58:50.910 --> 00:58:53.740 align:middle line:84%
Because you see, sometimes
it might be a little tragedy

00:58:53.740 --> 00:58:55.034 align:middle line:90%
that happens to that person.

00:58:55.034 --> 00:58:56.450 align:middle line:84%
They might come
home and they find

00:58:56.450 --> 00:58:59.530 align:middle line:84%
that a loved one died or
their house burned down,

00:58:59.530 --> 00:59:00.884 align:middle line:90%
or whatever, you know?

00:59:00.884 --> 00:59:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, your whole
reality shifts and changes,

00:59:03.050 --> 00:59:06.280 align:middle line:84%
and you're forced to
rethink your own future.

00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:07.840 align:middle line:90%
And that is a trigger point.

00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:11.320 align:middle line:84%
So what I tell people, everyone
has their own trigger point,

00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:14.110 align:middle line:84%
and just by planting
the seeds, you're

00:59:14.110 --> 00:59:17.435 align:middle line:84%
preparing that person to
reach their own trigger point

00:59:17.435 --> 00:59:19.340 align:middle line:90%
and let that seed germinate.

00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:21.640 align:middle line:84%
So let's keep telling
everyone, and keep

00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:23.220 align:middle line:90%
sharing that information.

00:59:23.220 --> 00:59:25.152 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you.

00:59:25.152 --> 00:59:27.360 align:middle line:84%
>>So that brings us to the
end of this second session

00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:28.570 align:middle line:90%
here today.

00:59:28.570 --> 00:59:31.740 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for your participation
and your contributions.

00:59:31.740 --> 00:59:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And let's go and take a break,
and come back afterwards.

00:59:35.090 --> 00:59:39.554 align:middle line:90%

I'm Michael Tellinger,
and thanks for watching.
