00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.050 align:middle line:10%
>>Hello, this is
Michael Tellinger.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.460 align:middle line:10%
And we are exploring a
way to get from the misery

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.630 align:middle line:10%
that we find ourselves on
this planet, where millions

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.670 align:middle line:10%
of people wake up, billions
of people wake up every day,

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.960 align:middle line:10%
unhappy with their lives,
having to do things

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.950 align:middle line:10%
they don't want to
do, being forced

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.500 align:middle line:10%
to travel, to sit in traffic,
and take trains and buses,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.530 align:middle line:10%
and ride bicycles in rain and
bad weather and in the cold

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.630 align:middle line:10%
and in the heat to do
things they don't want

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.920 align:middle line:10%
to do because they need
to earn money to survive,

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.280 align:middle line:10%
to pay their bills
month in, month out.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.480 align:middle line:84%
We're finding a solution
for the slavery system

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.915 align:middle line:90%
we find ourselves in.

00:00:48.915 --> 00:00:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And in this episode, we're
going to unpack the simple steps

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.830 align:middle line:84%
that we can take to get us into
this utopian situation, a world

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.600 align:middle line:84%
that we all dream of, a world
in which we can express our born

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.550 align:middle line:84%
talents, that we can create
and contribute to our society

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.430 align:middle line:84%
with what we are really good at,
for which we would be honored

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.080 align:middle line:84%
and respected for by
those in our communities,

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.540 align:middle line:84%
and not judged by what we
have and how much we have

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.360 align:middle line:90%
and how much we've hoarded.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.000 align:middle line:90%
This changes completely.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.160 align:middle line:10%
This is all about moving into
a state of higher consciousness

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.830 align:middle line:10%
and embracing unity.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.990 align:middle line:10%
And out of this
unity, we know we

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.970 align:middle line:10%
can create infinite diversity
and infinite abundance.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.200 align:middle line:84%
This is a hope, something that
you've learned and picked up

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.560 align:middle line:84%
during the past few
episodes while we're

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.390 align:middle line:84%
exploring this world of
Ubuntu and contributionism.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.220 align:middle line:10%
So the moment we remove money
from the system-- by now,

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.700 align:middle line:10%
I hope that it's
very clear to you

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.120 align:middle line:10%
that all the dark and
horrible things in our lives

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.040 align:middle line:10%
and in our reality
simply melt away.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.160 align:middle line:10%
How this melts away, we're
going to look at as well now.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.480 align:middle line:10%
No hoarding, no crime, no
gluttony, no envy, no greed,

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.920 align:middle line:10%
no hierarchy, and
especially, no hunger.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is the world of
Ubuntu and contributionism.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.949 align:middle line:90%
But how do we get there?

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:11.600 align:middle line:90%
What is our plan of action?

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.080 align:middle line:90%
What do we do?

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.420 align:middle line:84%
It's a very simple
plan of action.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.390 align:middle line:84%
And what I have found
over the last 11

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.060 align:middle line:84%
years of doing this
and talking about this

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.630 align:middle line:84%
and doing countless workshops
and presentations on this,

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.980 align:middle line:84%
is I'll tell you, I
find that we actually

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.120 align:middle line:90%
become our own worst enemies.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.270 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as if
we've been programmed

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.640 align:middle line:90%
to trip ourselves up.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.360 align:middle line:84%
We've been programmed to become
our own prison wardens that

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.680 align:middle line:90%
keep ourselves imprisoned.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.980 align:middle line:84%
We keep coming up with
potential problems.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.442 align:middle line:84%
Oh, but this isn't
going to work.

00:02:41.442 --> 00:02:42.650 align:middle line:90%
And that's not going to work.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.710 align:middle line:90%
And how are we going to do this?

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.043 align:middle line:90%
And how are we going to do that?

00:02:45.043 --> 00:02:48.755 align:middle line:84%
Instead of just bloody getting
on with the job, just doing it.

00:02:48.755 --> 00:02:50.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, the good news
is we are doing it.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.040 align:middle line:90%
We already are on the path.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.550 align:middle line:84%
Millions of people are
waking up every day,

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.090 align:middle line:84%
knowing that they no longer
want to live in the system

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.860 align:middle line:84%
that we are trapped in,
looking for the solutions.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that we are
looking for the solutions

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.890 align:middle line:84%
means that we are
already on our way.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And now, we have found
a very simple way,

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.620 align:middle line:84%
a very simple system and a
plan of action to get us there.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.780 align:middle line:90%
If consists of two parts.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.660 align:middle line:84%
It consists of developing
our communities,

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.150 align:middle line:84%
putting simple
structures into place.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And it consists of activating
the same philosophies

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.347 align:middle line:90%
on a political front.

00:03:22.347 --> 00:03:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And I know many people are
going to scoff at this.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to
say, oh, politics.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.520 align:middle line:84%
Politics is a dirty and
disgusting business.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.210 align:middle line:84%
Why you getting
involved in politics?

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me remind you that
politics rules our lives.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.540 align:middle line:90%
And we cannot get away from it.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.270 align:middle line:84%
Ignoring it is not going
to make it go away.

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.000 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
make things better.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.010 align:middle line:90%
We have to engage politics.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.270 align:middle line:84%
We have to change this dirty,
disgusting, crooked, inhumane

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.200 align:middle line:84%
part of our lives into a
respectable, honorable part

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.290 align:middle line:84%
of society that actually serves
humanity and serves the people

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.830 align:middle line:90%
that it's supposed to serve.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.950 align:middle line:84%
It needs to be a benefit to
us, the living, breathing

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.180 align:middle line:84%
human beings, and not a
tool used by corporations

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.900 align:middle line:90%
and governments to enslave us.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.320 align:middle line:84%
This is why we have to get
involved and engaged politics

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.620 align:middle line:84%
and take this
negative dark energy

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.250 align:middle line:84%
and convert it into
a positive energy,

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.510 align:middle line:84%
into something that
actually works for us.

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.459 align:middle line:84%
We need to inject the
virus of consciousness

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.459 align:middle line:84%
into the political
beast and change it.

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.930 align:middle line:84%
We've learned quite a lot
over the last few years

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.700 align:middle line:90%
about this political arena.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's this experience that
we now bring to the people

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.930 align:middle line:84%
around the world, and sharing
this to show the simple steps.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, in 2014, I participated--
the Ubuntu party participated

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.350 align:middle line:90%
in the South African elections.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.060 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, I ran for president.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.280 align:middle line:84%
As crazy as it sounds, I ran
for president of South Africa.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.410 align:middle line:84%
The amazing thing
is that we ended up

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.540 align:middle line:84%
with about a million followers
going into these elections.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.590 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't actually believe that
that's how much support we got.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.560 align:middle line:84%
In several radio
interviews that I did--

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.770 align:middle line:84%
and we didn't get much exposure
in the mainstream media at all.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.430 align:middle line:84%
The Ubuntu Party only
go two radio interviews

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.600 align:middle line:90%
on national radio.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.610 align:middle line:90%
One was for an hour.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.130 align:middle line:90%
And one was for half an hour.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, in those two
interviews, the Ubuntu Party

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.260 align:middle line:90%
had 100% support.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.790 align:middle line:84%
Let me repeat
that, 100% support,

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:20.680 align:middle line:84%
from all the callers, the
emails, the tweets, the SMS

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.790 align:middle line:84%
messages, and anyone that
participated in that.

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.430 align:middle line:84%
This is unheard
of, unprecedented.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And the most common
response from the callers

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.360 align:middle line:84%
and the people on
email and tweets

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.000 align:middle line:84%
was the following--
he is saying what

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.070 align:middle line:90%
I've been thinking all my life.

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what this is all about.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.410 align:middle line:84%
We need to implement
all these things we've

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.620 align:middle line:90%
been dreaming of all our lives.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And through Ubuntu and
contributionism philosophy,

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.440 align:middle line:90%
we can implement it.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And we can use the
political arena

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.840 align:middle line:84%
to speed up this
process, to help

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.740 align:middle line:84%
us realize this a lot
quicker if we approach it

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.720 align:middle line:84%
from the community
development upwards

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.090 align:middle line:84%
and from the political platform
downwards, the top down,

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:01.500 align:middle line:90%
bottom up approach.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.430 align:middle line:84%
What we do is we give
the Ubuntu philosophy

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.760 align:middle line:84%
an outlet, a way out,
and a political escape

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.330 align:middle line:84%
route and a political
implementation of the Ubuntu

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.940 align:middle line:84%
philosophy on grassroots
and at grassroots levels.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.390 align:middle line:90%
This is a simple plan.

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:16.980 align:middle line:90%
And we're busy implementing it.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's a lot more
difficult to convert

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.310 align:middle line:84%
big cities and big
metropolitan areas

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.070 align:middle line:90%
into this kind of thinking.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:27.370 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot easier to go to
small towns and villages

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:32.570 align:middle line:84%
and convert those into places of
cooperation and collaboration.

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.180 align:middle line:90%
And this is exactly the plan.

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.170 align:middle line:84%
So our plan of action
is to transform

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:40.680 align:middle line:84%
small towns and small villages
into these Ubuntu communities

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.120 align:middle line:84%
and start that
process from there.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.750 align:middle line:10%
We have a simple plan
that takes us into 2016

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.560 align:middle line:10%
and the local,
municipal elections

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.340 align:middle line:10%
in South Africa,
which present us

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:54.790 align:middle line:10%
with a spectacular opportunity
to implement the simple Ubuntu

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:58.580 align:middle line:10%
contributionism philosophies
into a few small towns.

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.480 align:middle line:84%
The reason why
this has come about

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.980 align:middle line:84%
is because of what we learned in
the national elections of 2014.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:08.250 align:middle line:84%
What we realized, first of all,
that the national elections

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:11.010 align:middle line:84%
are completely crooked,
completely manipulated,

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.950 align:middle line:84%
and completely staged
and fraudulent.

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:18.270 align:middle line:84%
The outcome is a
predetermined scenario.

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.790 align:middle line:84%
They will crook and
maneuver the numbers

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:22.380 align:middle line:90%
whichever way they want.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
examples that I

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.810 align:middle line:84%
could quote that I'm not going
to do here that we experienced

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:28.320 align:middle line:90%
during the national elections.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.860 align:middle line:84%
But what I realized
is the following,

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.520 align:middle line:84%
that an elected mayor
on a local level,

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.400 align:middle line:84%
on a local, municipal level,
will be far more effective

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.360 align:middle line:84%
and will have a much bigger
influence and an impact

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.870 align:middle line:84%
on his community and his town
than an elected politician

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:47.760 align:middle line:90%
that serves in parliament.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.910 align:middle line:84%
Can you see the big
difference here?

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:53.840 align:middle line:84%
This is why our approach in
the local, municipal elections

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.590 align:middle line:84%
in 2016 is like the
Achilles heel approach

00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:00.840 align:middle line:84%
where the smallest town, the
smallest village, the smallest

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:05.300 align:middle line:84%
municipality will be the
smallest area that brings down

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:10.180 align:middle line:84%
the beast because once we win
an election in a small town

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:13.440 align:middle line:84%
or small municipality,
because we can reach all

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.830 align:middle line:84%
the people in those small
towns with our message

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:18.450 align:middle line:84%
and make them see the
way, the way ahead,

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:22.080 align:middle line:84%
make them resonate with this
message, make them say to us,

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.880 align:middle line:84%
you are saying what I've
been thinking all my life.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.660 align:middle line:84%
Once the people in these
small towns get our message,

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:30.090 align:middle line:84%
we will win at least
one of these small towns

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:33.070 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to after in
the local, municipal elections.

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:35.059 align:middle line:10%
And that changes everything.

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:37.070 align:middle line:10%
So this is our plan of action.

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:41.120 align:middle line:10%
We are targeting 12
small municipalities

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.539 align:middle line:10%
in the local election.

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:46.500 align:middle line:10%
And our plan is to win at
least one of these small towns

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.740 align:middle line:10%
and let that be the
first domino to fall.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, some people say, well,
what effect will that have.

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:55.690 align:middle line:84%
It'll have an incredible
effect because we

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:57.590 align:middle line:90%
live in a global community.

00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:00.010 align:middle line:84%
Our friends, the people
that live in these towns,

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:02.700 align:middle line:84%
have friends and relatives in
neighboring towns and cities

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:05.970 align:middle line:84%
across the country, in
cities across borders,

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:08.190 align:middle line:84%
across continents,
across oceans.

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:10.400 align:middle line:84%
This knowledge and this
message and information

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.040 align:middle line:84%
will spread so quickly
around the world.

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And the same events will
happen in other countries,

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:19.470 align:middle line:84%
in thousands of towns and
thousands of communities

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:22.340 align:middle line:84%
outside of South Africa,
in the United States,

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:24.730 align:middle line:84%
in Australia and
the UK and Germany.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:28.620 align:middle line:84%
It's unpredictable
what will happen.

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:32.510 align:middle line:84%
We cannot in our wildest
dreams imagine the effect,

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:36.190 align:middle line:84%
the energetic knock-on
effect, on this one event

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:39.390 align:middle line:84%
and the domino effect that
will not just be linear.

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:41.190 align:middle line:90%
It'll not just be exponential.

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:45.320 align:middle line:84%
It'll be a quantum
effect, a domino effect.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And this is how
powerful this is.

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:50.110 align:middle line:84%
One small town can
change our entire planet.

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:53.680 align:middle line:84%
Our entire campaign in
these 2016 elections

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.170 align:middle line:84%
is based on providing
our small towns

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:59.300 align:middle line:84%
with our own alternative
electricity supply.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.850 align:middle line:84%
It's all based on
providing free electricity.

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:04.380 align:middle line:90%
Why can we promise this?

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:07.380 align:middle line:84%
Because we have access
to this technology.

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:10.140 align:middle line:84%
We know that there are
thousands of inventors

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.900 align:middle line:84%
and brilliant minds that
have access and have

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.990 align:middle line:90%
developed free energy devices.

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:17.810 align:middle line:84%
We can use the rivers that
run through these towns

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:19.850 align:middle line:84%
as a simple source
of electricity.

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's, in fact, that that
we promise to our people.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.840 align:middle line:84%
We will use the rivers
and the running water

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.520 align:middle line:84%
to provide our own
supply of electricity.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And that electricity will
be free to all the people.

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:33.450 align:middle line:84%
Free electricity for
everyone, as long

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:37.320 align:middle line:84%
as they contribute three hours
a week to one of the community

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.270 align:middle line:90%
projects that we set up.

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:41.560 align:middle line:84%
So let's go through
the scenario again.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.430 align:middle line:90%
We win a campaign.

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:46.120 align:middle line:84%
We win the elections
in a small town.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:50.280 align:middle line:84%
The Ubuntu mayor start to
implement the simple philosophy

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:52.170 align:middle line:90%
of community projects.

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:55.270 align:middle line:84%
We set up a wide variety
of community projects

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:59.000 align:middle line:84%
that actually benefit the people
of the town, not corporations

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.260 align:middle line:84%
or the municipality
or the government.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.500 align:middle line:84%
The community projects must be
there to benefit the people.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:09.230 align:middle line:84%
And remember that we still live
in a world driven by money.

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:12.350 align:middle line:84%
So we need to use money to
set up the systems to free

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:14.050 align:middle line:90%
ourselves from the money.

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:16.060 align:middle line:84%
Once we win the
elections, we also

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:18.260 align:middle line:84%
get money channeled
from government.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.195 align:middle line:84%
That money right now is used and
abused by our municipalities,

00:11:21.195 --> 00:11:24.660 align:middle line:84%
by our mayors, for their
own personal agenda, to buy

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:26.580 align:middle line:90%
fancy cars and fancy houses.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:28.810 align:middle line:84%
We see virtually
no money that gets

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:31.210 align:middle line:84%
channeled into
upgrading our towns

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:33.550 align:middle line:84%
and providing facilities
for the people.

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:36.150 align:middle line:84%
Once we start funneling
and channeling this money

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:38.270 align:middle line:84%
into setting up
community projects,

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:41.850 align:middle line:84%
people will see a rapid
change very, very quickly.

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:44.120 align:middle line:84%
Over and above that,
community projects

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.710 align:middle line:84%
will be set up that
benefit the communities.

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:48.940 align:middle line:84%
These are not just
set up haphazardly.

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:53.020 align:middle line:84%
They're set up with very
specific intent in mind,

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:57.030 align:middle line:84%
and managed and set up with
master teachers or master

00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:00.360 align:middle line:84%
artisans in each one so that
we have master engineers

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.050 align:middle line:84%
or scientists or
researchers or bakers

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:06.200 align:middle line:84%
or cheesemakers or people
that run the dairy.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.910 align:middle line:84%
Each one of these would
be specifically chosen

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:11.720 align:middle line:84%
to run that particular
community project.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And we have, at this stage,
identified about 24 community

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:19.040 align:middle line:84%
projects to set up in our
town, in our community.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And we're using
this as an example.

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:23.730 align:middle line:90%
What happens next?

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:28.150 align:middle line:84%
Everyone that participates
in these community projects

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:29.900 align:middle line:90%
gets free electricity.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:31.360 align:middle line:90%
It's our electricity.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.310 align:middle line:84%
We have implemented this
electricity for ourselves.

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:38.100 align:middle line:84%
We unplug the grid that comes
from central government.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And we plug our own
electricity supply in.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.990 align:middle line:84%
The time for asking
permission is over.

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:47.700 align:middle line:84%
We are implementing our
own election promises.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.200 align:middle line:84%
We're implementing what
we promised the people.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.890 align:middle line:84%
The people vote us in because of
what we say we're going to do.

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:56.070 align:middle line:90%
Now we're going to do this.

00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:58.050 align:middle line:84%
I hope this is
making sense to you.

00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:00.320 align:middle line:84%
This is really important
to internalize this.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the
governments are supposed

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:04.000 align:middle line:84%
to be the servants
of the people.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.950 align:middle line:84%
The municipality is supposed
to be the local servant

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:07.880 align:middle line:90%
of the people.

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.160 align:middle line:84%
The countries belong
to the people.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.695 align:middle line:90%
The towns belong to the people.

00:13:11.695 --> 00:13:14.330 align:middle line:84%
We are taking back what
belongs to the people

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:18.440 align:middle line:84%
and making it paradise and a
utopian place for us to live,

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:22.240 align:middle line:84%
working in unity, working
together, collaboratively

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.140 align:middle line:90%
and in collaboration.

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:27.850 align:middle line:84%
What we do-- everybody
contributes three hours a week

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:29.660 align:middle line:84%
towards one of these
community projects.

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And in return, you
get free electricity.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.450 align:middle line:90%
But that does a lot more.

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:38.110 align:middle line:84%
What this does is
instantly turns our town

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:41.590 align:middle line:84%
into a powerful
united labor force.

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:42.930 align:middle line:90%
Here's a simple example.

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:46.730 align:middle line:84%
Our little town of 5,000
people, three hours a week,

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:51.490 align:middle line:84%
that's equivalent to 15,000
hours of labor per week.

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:55.210 align:middle line:84%
No corporation, no
municipality can compete

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:56.890 align:middle line:90%
with that kind of labor force.

00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And I hope you
realize that this is

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:02.450 align:middle line:84%
how quickly we can turn things
around in favor of the people.

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:05.150 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, we're doing
things for ourselves.

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And everybody has three
hours a week to contribute.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.030 align:middle line:10%
What do people get in return?

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:10.870 align:middle line:10%
Everything.

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:13.870 align:middle line:10%
Free electricity, free
bread, free milk, free eggs,

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:17.980 align:middle line:10%
free furniture, free clothes,
cheese, cream, fish, shoes.

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:20.210 align:middle line:84%
Whatever we set up as
a community project,

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:24.220 align:middle line:84%
you get for free because you
give your three hours a week.

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:26.550 align:middle line:84%
It's a very important
thing that happens

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:28.930 align:middle line:84%
in this transitional
phase is that you

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:30.650 align:middle line:90%
don't have to give up your job.

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And this is how
beautiful and simple

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.920 align:middle line:90%
this transitional phase is.

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:38.050 align:middle line:10%
Everyone can keep their job,
keep doing what they're doing,

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:40.080 align:middle line:10%
and just contribute
three hours a week

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:44.760 align:middle line:10%
as we set up these projects
and start creating abundance.

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.260 align:middle line:10%
And this is where the
contributionism principle

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:48.170 align:middle line:10%
kicks in.

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:51.290 align:middle line:10%
We don't just make
enough for ourselves.

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:54.690 align:middle line:10%
Remember, we are not creating
self-sustaining communities.

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:57.400 align:middle line:84%
We are creating
communities of abundance

00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:00.230 align:middle line:84%
where we create far
more than what we need.

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:04.185 align:middle line:84%
So we very carefully calculate
how many potatoes we need,

00:15:04.185 --> 00:15:06.310 align:middle line:84%
how much of this we need
and how much that we need.

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And we create at least, at
least three times as much

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:13.550 align:middle line:84%
as what we need for every
member of our community.

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:16.300 align:middle line:84%
This means we'll
always have too much.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:20.630 align:middle line:84%
So what happens with this
excess that we create?

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:22.695 align:middle line:84%
This is where the
abundance comes in.

00:15:22.695 --> 00:15:24.590 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning,
while we still live

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:27.470 align:middle line:84%
in a world driven
by money, we make

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:30.850 align:middle line:84%
this excess available to all
our surrounding communities.

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:33.790 align:middle line:84%
But because we're doing
it ourselves for free,

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:37.250 align:middle line:84%
we can make it available
for a very, very low cost,

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:41.490 align:middle line:84%
at a fraction of the price that
any Walmart or any corporation

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:45.050 align:middle line:84%
or any supermarket can sell
these items or these services

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:46.340 align:middle line:90%
or these goods for.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:50.070 align:middle line:84%
We can underprice anyone,
which means we immediately

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:52.200 align:middle line:84%
start to affect the
capitalist model

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:55.740 align:middle line:84%
of all our neighboring towns
and as far and wide as we

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:57.580 align:middle line:84%
distribute our
products and services

00:15:57.580 --> 00:15:59.280 align:middle line:90%
from our little community.

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:01.690 align:middle line:84%
This will bring in
huge amounts of money

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:04.500 align:middle line:84%
into the community coffers
and the community chest

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:08.100 align:middle line:84%
account that is
there for the people,

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:10.870 align:middle line:84%
not for the municipality,
for the people.

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:14.640 align:middle line:84%
But now that the municipality
is run by the Ubuntu mayor,

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.060 align:middle line:90%
everything changes.

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And this money keeps getting
reinvested into the coffers

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:23.930 align:middle line:84%
and upgrading every community
project on a regular basis.

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:26.070 align:middle line:84%
Very quickly,
overnight, the people

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:28.870 align:middle line:84%
in our town and our community
will see the upgrades

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:31.320 align:middle line:84%
in the sporting facilities
and all these things

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:34.530 align:middle line:84%
that I've mentioned, the 24
community projects that we have

00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:37.290 align:middle line:90%
mentioned in our manifesto.

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And this is how rapidly
things can change.

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:41.880 align:middle line:90%
I want to give you an example.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:45.320 align:middle line:84%
At the moment, we have a
fish farm in our community.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.830 align:middle line:90%
That fish farm is standing idle.

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Once implemented and upgraded
and made operational,

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:55.770 align:middle line:84%
this fish farm can breed about
a million fish per month.

00:16:55.770 --> 00:17:00.180 align:middle line:84%
That will bring arguably
about a million dollars month

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:01.710 align:middle line:90%
to our community.

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:06.339 align:middle line:84%
This is about three times
as much as our current town

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:07.829 align:middle line:90%
gets from government.

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:11.790 align:middle line:84%
So this is one community project
bringing in three times as much

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:13.720 align:middle line:90%
as government is putting in.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:17.109 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can expand this
to 24 community projects.

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:19.690 align:middle line:84%
Can you see how much
money our community

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:24.480 align:middle line:84%
will be bringing in while we're
getting everything for free?

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:28.010 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the
principle of making people

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:30.960 align:middle line:84%
realize that money is
worthless, that it's not

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.140 align:middle line:84%
the money that keeps
our community going,

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.070 align:middle line:90%
it's ourselves.

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:36.250 align:middle line:84%
It's the people that
keep the community going.

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:38.510 align:middle line:84%
We're the ones that are
building and growing and doing

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:40.170 align:middle line:90%
everything for ourselves.

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And very soon, we realize
we get so much money

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:46.020 align:middle line:84%
that we can do
anything, while we still

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:47.170 align:middle line:90%
live in a world with money.

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:48.840 align:middle line:84%
If we need a new
hospital, the money

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.690 align:middle line:84%
will be available to
build a new hospital.

00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:53.730 align:middle line:84%
Whatever we think we
need do, we can do.

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And this is all driven by what
we call the Council of Elders.

00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:59.890 align:middle line:84%
We have to change
the way we operate.

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we go back
to the ancient philosophies

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:05.500 align:middle line:84%
of tribal councils,
where the councils were

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.920 align:middle line:84%
the representative
councils of the people,

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:11.300 align:middle line:84%
to make decisions that
best benefit the community

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:14.740 align:middle line:84%
and not benefit individuals
to the detriment

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:16.810 align:middle line:84%
of the rest of the people
in their community.

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:19.110 align:middle line:84%
So what we call the
Council of Elders

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:21.480 align:middle line:84%
is appointed by everyone
in the community

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.360 align:middle line:84%
and consists of the
12 most trusted people

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.910 align:middle line:84%
and individuals
in that community.

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the
transparency comes through,

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:33.500 align:middle line:84%
again, because everyone will
vote for the Council of Elders

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:34.400 align:middle line:90%
by their own name.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:39.510 align:middle line:84%
So I, Michael, nominate John
to be on the Council of Elders.

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And if John is a
thief and a crook,

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.600 align:middle line:84%
everybody will know
that I have just

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.540 align:middle line:84%
nominated a thief and a crook
onto the Council of Elders.

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:48.150 align:middle line:90%
So I'll have exposed my motives.

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:49.640 align:middle line:90%
I'll have exposed myself.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:52.140 align:middle line:84%
Once you realize how
transparent this system is,

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:54.350 align:middle line:84%
you realize that
it's incorruptible

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:56.700 align:middle line:84%
and that no amount of
money can corrupt it

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:59.570 align:middle line:84%
because by trying to
corrupt it, you always

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:02.840 align:middle line:84%
expose yourselves and expose
your ulterior motives.

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And this is ultimately
not where we're going.

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:07.620 align:middle line:84%
We want to create abundance
by working together.

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And we can only do that
by the simple philosophy

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:11.790 align:middle line:90%
of cooperation.

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:17.540 align:middle line:84%
So this contributionist system
is really managed and guided

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:20.740 align:middle line:84%
by this Council of Elders,
where it's 12 around one.

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:22.970 align:middle line:84%
The 13th member of
the Council of Elders

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:25.180 align:middle line:84%
is a spokesperson
for the council.

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is how the
community makes decisions

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:32.890 align:middle line:84%
on a daily basis, hour-by-hour
and minute-by-minute basis.

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:35.030 align:middle line:84%
If we don't like
something, we take it

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:36.190 align:middle line:90%
to the Council of Elders.

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And the decision gets
made that same day.

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:42.240 align:middle line:84%
This is not something that takes
months and years for it to go

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.850 align:middle line:84%
through government or some
body somewhere that sits

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:47.780 align:middle line:84%
in a crystal palace and makes
decisions about what you can

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:49.350 align:middle line:90%
and cannot do in your community.

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:52.070 align:middle line:84%
This is why we say the
Ubuntu philosophy is

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:54.920 align:middle line:84%
to deconstruct government,
to decentralize

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.960 align:middle line:84%
government, and let
communities run themselves.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:00.950 align:middle line:84%
And the Councils of Elders
become the guiding bodies

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:04.310 align:middle line:84%
that guide and advise
the communities of what's

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:06.210 align:middle line:84%
best for the
community and what we

00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:09.150 align:middle line:84%
should be doing for the
benefit of the whole community.

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:12.280 align:middle line:84%
So we create three times
as much as what we need.

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the
abundance comes from.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.250 align:middle line:84%
This is where we
start destroying

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:17.470 align:middle line:90%
the capitalist model.

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I've been
saying that contributionism

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.960 align:middle line:84%
devours capitalism
whenever it finds it.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.750 align:middle line:10%
It is impossible for
any capitalist model

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:32.610 align:middle line:10%
to exist within the proximity
of a contributionism community.

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:34.860 align:middle line:10%
Everything in our
communities ultimately

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:36.340 align:middle line:10%
becomes a community project.

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.330 align:middle line:10%
Whether I'm a
painter or sculptor,

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:41.690 align:middle line:10%
or whether I have a
horse farm, or whatever

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:44.660 align:middle line:10%
it is I do, sooner
or later, what I do

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:47.340 align:middle line:10%
will benefit people
in my community.

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:51.250 align:middle line:84%
So by making what I do
a community project,

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:54.420 align:middle line:84%
I'll not only benefit myself,
but I'll benefit everyone

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:55.220 align:middle line:90%
in our community.

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:56.020 align:middle line:90%
For

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:58.980 align:middle line:84%
Example, if I have a horse farm
and I have a bunch of horses

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:01.130 align:middle line:84%
and I open my horse
farm and my horses

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:05.390 align:middle line:84%
to be used by the community,
I will get the labor force

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:06.300 align:middle line:90%
for free.

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:07.710 align:middle line:90%
I will get the food.

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:11.000 align:middle line:84%
I will get everything I need to
groom and look after my horses.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And people will come and
help me run my horse farm.

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:15.880 align:middle line:84%
All I have to do
is make the horses

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:17.820 align:middle line:84%
available to the
whole community.

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:20.690 align:middle line:84%
It's a win-win
situation for everyone.

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:24.180 align:middle line:84%
The farmers that we've
engaged around our town

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:27.960 align:middle line:84%
have pretty much all agreed in
making their lands available

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:31.020 align:middle line:84%
and participating in
the community projects

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.460 align:middle line:84%
so that they benefit
from it as well.

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:36.050 align:middle line:84%
I've spoken to a number
of farmers unions.

00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:38.480 align:middle line:90%
And the answers are spectacular.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.612 align:middle line:84%
It is always not let
us negotiate and try

00:21:41.612 --> 00:21:42.820 align:middle line:90%
and find a solution for this.

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:45.530 align:middle line:84%
It's always, how
quickly can we start?

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:46.770 align:middle line:90%
When can we start?

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:48.350 align:middle line:84%
This is how simple
this philosophy

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:52.230 align:middle line:84%
is because how do we attract
farmers and businesses

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:53.510 align:middle line:90%
into this model.

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we
show how inclusive

00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:58.710 align:middle line:84%
this philosophy of Ubuntu
and contributionism

00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:00.880 align:middle line:84%
really is, how it
invites everyone

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:04.002 align:middle line:84%
to participate and to
share their knowledge

00:22:04.002 --> 00:22:05.460 align:middle line:84%
and their skills
and whatever it is

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:08.010 align:middle line:84%
they do with everyone
in their community

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:09.650 align:middle line:90%
while it benefits themselves.

00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:13.600 align:middle line:84%
So how will we invite
existing factories

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:16.730 align:middle line:84%
and existing businesses to
participate in these community

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:17.530 align:middle line:90%
projects?

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:18.470 align:middle line:90%
It's very simple.

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:19.940 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you an example.

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:23.680 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we set up community
projects of all kinds.

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:26.340 align:middle line:84%
Anything that you can imagine
can become a community project.

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:27.300 align:middle line:90%
It's up to us.

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:29.780 align:middle line:84%
We decide what we're
going to do and set up.

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:33.350 align:middle line:84%
So if we need to make
bicycle spokes for bicycles,

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:36.700 align:middle line:84%
we'll set up a community project
that makes bicycle spokes.

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:39.690 align:middle line:84%
If we need sand delivered
for the building industry,

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:43.230 align:middle line:84%
we set up a community
project that works with sand.

00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:47.330 align:middle line:84%
Anything that we want to do, if
we need a research laboratory

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:51.160 align:middle line:84%
to provide whatever we need for
the scientists that are making

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.740 align:middle line:84%
new materials, we'll set
up the research laboratory

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:57.425 align:middle line:84%
to provide the components for
new materials that use hemp

00:22:57.425 --> 00:22:59.790 align:middle line:84%
and graphene to create
new materials that

00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:02.900 align:middle line:84%
are far superior than
anything we can imagine.

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.870 align:middle line:84%
Laboratories, research
laboratories, scientists,

00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:09.090 align:middle line:84%
inventors will be invited
to come and set up

00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:11.120 align:middle line:84%
whatever research
facilities they need.

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:13.037 align:middle line:84%
And everything they need
will be provided for.

00:23:13.037 --> 00:23:13.836 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:23:13.836 --> 00:23:14.670 align:middle line:90%
Because we can.

00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:16.700 align:middle line:90%
And we choose to do so.

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:20.170 align:middle line:84%
People that develop cures
for all disease, doctors,

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:22.800 align:middle line:84%
scientists, inventors that
work in the healing industry

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:26.090 align:middle line:84%
will be invited to work in
our hospital and our research

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:29.350 align:middle line:84%
facilities to provide
the cure for all disease.

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:31.580 align:middle line:84%
Everything becomes
possible as long

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:35.300 align:middle line:84%
as we do this cooperatively
and collaboratively.

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:37.800 align:middle line:90%
So here is an example.

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.835 align:middle line:84%
In our town, we
have a wood factory.

00:23:39.835 --> 00:23:42.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, how will they benefit
from-- why should I join you?

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:43.989 align:middle line:84%
And say, well,
what's in it for me?

00:23:43.989 --> 00:23:45.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, the following
is in it for you.

00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:46.946 align:middle line:84%
If you make your
wood factory that

00:23:46.946 --> 00:23:51.060 align:middle line:84%
makes window frames and
door frames, wooden door

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:54.020 align:middle line:84%
frames and windows, if
you make your business

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:55.690 align:middle line:84%
part of the community
project, you

00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:59.300 align:middle line:84%
get the following-- free
electricity, no rates and taxes

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:01.190 align:middle line:84%
because remember,
the town belongs us.

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:04.380 align:middle line:84%
Why should we pay rates
and taxes to ourselves?

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:07.070 align:middle line:84%
You get free labor from the
people that come and work

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:09.060 align:middle line:90%
in your community project now.

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:10.350 align:middle line:90%
You get free components.

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:12.140 align:middle line:84%
The wood will come
from our wood factory,

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:13.590 align:middle line:90%
which is a community project.

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:16.040 align:middle line:84%
The glue will come from
our laboratory, scientists

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.800 align:middle line:84%
that are making glues
that are much better

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.200 align:middle line:90%
and biodegradable and nontoxic.

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:23.190 align:middle line:84%
So basically, you'll be
getting all your components

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:24.980 align:middle line:90%
to make windows and doors.

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And in return, you retain 1/3 of
the profits made from this wood

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:33.870 align:middle line:84%
factory because it's
now a community project.

00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:36.140 align:middle line:84%
The other 2/3 go
to the community

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:39.770 align:middle line:84%
to benefit the community and
bring money into the community

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:43.410 align:middle line:84%
coffers, while we still
operate under a financial

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:45.360 align:middle line:90%
and a capitalist system.

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:49.580 align:middle line:84%
So you, as the owner of the
factory or any other business,

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:53.140 align:middle line:84%
has zero cost and
everything to gain.

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And this is why it
becomes such an attraction

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:58.210 align:middle line:84%
for anyone who's in
any kind of business

00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:00.010 align:middle line:90%
to come and join our community.

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:03.820 align:middle line:84%
So what we'll find, we'll
get people from far and wide

00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:07.760 align:middle line:84%
that'll come to our town, our
Ubuntu contributionism town,

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:10.560 align:middle line:84%
and participate in
what will probably

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:14.980 align:middle line:84%
be the most exciting
new era of this planet.

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And it is certainly
a place that I

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:18.670 align:middle line:84%
want to find myself
in because it'll

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:25.510 align:middle line:84%
be the most unimaginable place
of creation and expansion

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:27.400 align:middle line:90%
that we've ever witnessed.

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.620 align:middle line:84%
Free electricity, no
barrier to progress,

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:34.000 align:middle line:84%
no hurdle to progress,
no hurdle to inventions,

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.150 align:middle line:84%
no holding onto knowledge
and information.

00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:39.570 align:middle line:84%
Everything is shared
with the world.

00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:42.480 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine what will
happen when our hospital

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.530 align:middle line:84%
and our healing
facilities where we really

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:47.300 align:middle line:84%
heal and cure disease,
what'll happen

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:50.590 align:middle line:84%
when we've cured the first
multimillionaire of cancer?

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:52.320 align:middle line:84%
You know what the
answer to that is.

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.020 align:middle line:90%
This will be unstoppable.

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:56.510 align:middle line:84%
No government, no
border, will be

00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:59.610 align:middle line:84%
able to restrain the
expansion and the growth.

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And this is why
I said the moment

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:05.540 align:middle line:84%
that we win one little
town in our country

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:08.530 align:middle line:84%
or in any country of the
world-- this can be in the USA,

00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:11.900 align:middle line:84%
in Germany and Australia,
when one little town becomes

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:14.590 align:middle line:84%
an Ubuntu
contributionism model, it

00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:17.750 align:middle line:84%
creates this quantum
domino effect

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:20.800 align:middle line:84%
that'll go right across the
borders in many countries

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:21.970 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:25.140 align:middle line:84%
This takes us to the
Ubuntu Warehouse philosophy

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:26.640 align:middle line:84%
because we're not
always going to be

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:30.240 align:middle line:84%
able to sell everything we make
and grow and create and build.

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:32.770 align:middle line:84%
What are we going to do
with all the excess stuff we

00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:33.940 align:middle line:90%
can't consume ourselves?

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:36.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're going to put it into
a warehouse somewhere, right?

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:38.600 align:middle line:84%
So let's call it the
Ubuntu Warehouse.

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And we make that warehouse
and the stuff in there

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:43.170 align:middle line:84%
available to all the
people in our community

00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:46.390 align:middle line:84%
and also, to everyone else
outside of our community

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:48.580 align:middle line:90%
for a very low price.

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:51.210 align:middle line:84%
No Walmart will ever
be able to compete

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:54.470 align:middle line:84%
with our prices and our goods
and our services in the Ubuntu

00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:55.450 align:middle line:90%
Warehouse.

00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:59.390 align:middle line:84%
And everyone in our
community will most likely

00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:01.040 align:middle line:84%
get some sort of
an electronic card,

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:02.540 align:middle line:84%
not because we want
to create money,

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:05.770 align:middle line:84%
but because we just want to make
sure that people don't abuse

00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:10.440 align:middle line:84%
the system while we still have
that possible bit of a hangover

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:12.480 align:middle line:90%
from a capitalism driven system.

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And with your
Ubuntu card, you can

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:16.970 align:middle line:84%
go into the Ubuntu Warehouse
and get your stuff for the week,

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:20.010 align:middle line:84%
as long as you contribute
your three hours a week.

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:23.660 align:middle line:84%
We know exactly how much
is allocated to everybody

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:25.030 align:middle line:90%
because we've worked it out.

00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:25.830 align:middle line:90%
Remember?

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:28.540 align:middle line:84%
We create at least three
times as much as what we need.

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:31.090 align:middle line:84%
So we know how much is
allocated to everybody.

00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:33.260 align:middle line:90%
It's not a guessing situation.

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:35.150 align:middle line:84%
So you go in there
and get what you need.

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And we'll probably
never, ever take as much

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:40.110 align:middle line:84%
as what we've actually
allocated to ourselves.

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:43.040 align:middle line:84%
So there will always
be too much stuff left.

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.900 align:middle line:90%
So what have we just achieved?

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:48.590 align:middle line:84%
We've achieved two
very important things.

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:53.550 align:middle line:84%
We've created a new supply
chain of goods, food, services.

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:55.470 align:middle line:84%
Everything we can
imagine, everything

00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:58.560 align:middle line:84%
we create in our
Ubuntu communities,

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:01.620 align:middle line:84%
we've now created a
new supply chain away

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:03.700 align:middle line:84%
from the current
corporate structures that

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:05.716 align:middle line:84%
have controlled our
lives and the governments

00:28:05.716 --> 00:28:07.090 align:middle line:84%
and the corporate
structures that

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:10.500 align:middle line:84%
have created an era and
a system of scarcity.

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:14.390 align:middle line:84%
We've created a system of
abundance very, very quickly,

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:18.090 align:middle line:84%
virtually overnight, by
creating one little example

00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:20.500 align:middle line:90%
of a contributionist community.

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:21.900 align:middle line:90%
What else have we done?

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.120 align:middle line:84%
Without even realizing
it, we've created

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:26.430 align:middle line:84%
a new alternative
currency system

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:30.300 align:middle line:84%
that is untouchable and
uncollapsible by the Rothschild

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:31.960 align:middle line:90%
banking families.

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:35.760 align:middle line:84%
We've created a new card that
you can use on any Ubuntu

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:38.570 align:middle line:84%
Warehouse that they cannot take
away from you because if they

00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:40.502 align:middle line:84%
do, they will just
issue you a new card.

00:28:40.502 --> 00:28:41.960 align:middle line:84%
They can't close
your bank account.

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:43.740 align:middle line:84%
They can't take your
money away from you.

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:46.555 align:middle line:84%
This card allows you to go
into your Ubuntu Warehouse

00:28:46.555 --> 00:28:48.320 align:middle line:90%
and get whatever you need.

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:52.280 align:middle line:84%
No one can ever cause you any
financial harm or damage again.

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:54.120 align:middle line:90%
But what else does this mean?

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:57.030 align:middle line:84%
It means that you can jump
on a train or jump on a plane

00:28:57.030 --> 00:29:00.110 align:middle line:84%
or get in your car and
drive from LA to New York

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:02.780 align:middle line:84%
and go to your Ubuntu community
there and say, hi, I'm Michael.

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:04.040 align:middle line:90%
I've arrived.

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:05.080 align:middle line:90%
What do you need?

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:06.290 align:middle line:90%
They swipe my little card.

00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:07.550 align:middle line:90%
They say welcome, Michael.

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:10.716 align:middle line:84%
Oh, the chemistry lab
needs some help this week.

00:29:10.716 --> 00:29:12.340 align:middle line:84%
They're putting a
new material together

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:13.930 align:middle line:90%
with graphene and hemp.

00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:14.980 align:middle line:90%
Very exciting.

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Please go and help
them for three hours.

00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:18.740 align:middle line:84%
And they tell me where
to report, what to do.

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:20.330 align:middle line:84%
They might tell
me to go and work

00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:23.170 align:middle line:84%
in some other factory
or some other place

00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:26.160 align:middle line:84%
in one of the community
projects in that community.

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:30.210 align:middle line:84%
What this allows me is to go
anywhere I want, I choose to.

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:32.990 align:middle line:84%
And by contributing
my three hours a week,

00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:35.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm then entitled to anything
I need from the Ubuntu

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:38.290 align:middle line:90%
Warehouse in that place.

00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:40.290 align:middle line:84%
That means we've created
an alternative currency

00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:44.180 align:middle line:84%
system that's untouchable and
uncollapsible by the banking

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:45.830 align:middle line:90%
families of the world today.

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:47.410 align:middle line:90%
And this goes across borders.

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:50.110 align:middle line:84%
I can fly to Australia,
arrive in Sydney,

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:53.530 align:middle line:84%
or whatever small town
I choose to arrive in.

00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:57.080 align:middle line:84%
As long as I have my
Ubuntu card and I log on

00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:58.970 align:middle line:84%
and I give my
three hours a week,

00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:02.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm entitled to anything I
need and anything I want.

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.960 align:middle line:90%
That's how simple the system is.

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:08.510 align:middle line:84%
This is how quickly we
can bypass the system,

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:12.210 align:middle line:84%
create a new alternative,
use the political structure

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:14.750 align:middle line:84%
to create a whole
new system, plant

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:17.830 align:middle line:84%
the virus of consciousness
into the political beast,

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:21.180 align:middle line:84%
and create something beautiful
and simple that works

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:23.900 align:middle line:90%
for everyone alive today.

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:26.040 align:middle line:84%
Once we've done
it in one town, we

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:30.500 align:middle line:84%
can replicate this in
thousands of towns in no time.

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And this is what brings us
to realizing that we don't

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:37.930 align:middle line:90%
need to destroy our world.

00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:40.760 align:middle line:84%
We no longer need
the mining industry

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:44.660 align:middle line:84%
and these disgusting industries
that destroy our world

00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:45.970 align:middle line:90%
and pollute our world.

00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:48.900 align:middle line:84%
We no longer have to do
this because in a world

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:52.200 align:middle line:84%
without money where we
set our scientists free,

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.500 align:middle line:84%
where we set our
inventors free, are we

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:57.840 align:middle line:84%
still going to need
disgusting, coal-driven power

00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:59.930 align:middle line:90%
plants to create electricity?

00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:01.350 align:middle line:90%
The answer is no.

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:06.930 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have a whole new
supply of exotic energy devices

00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:11.170 align:middle line:84%
that keep the world clean
and free of any toxins.

00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:13.650 align:middle line:84%
Anything we do in a
world without money

00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:16.700 align:middle line:90%
changes virtually overnight.

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And our needs for materials
changes with that.

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:24.630 align:middle line:84%
Where we live, how we live, how
we travel, what we travel in,

00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:28.310 align:middle line:84%
what we eat, how we
eat, where we eat it,

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:33.470 align:middle line:84%
where we choose to live, how we
get healed, everything changes.

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:36.310 align:middle line:84%
What electricity we use,
everything in our reality

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:38.070 align:middle line:90%
changes overnight.

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:40.780 align:middle line:84%
This is the world of
Ubuntu and contributionism.

00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:45.450 align:middle line:84%
Everything is recyclable,
renewable, and reusable.

00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:46.350 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:47.460 align:middle line:90%
Because we can.

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:49.290 align:middle line:84%
And because this
is the way we plan

00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:53.080 align:middle line:84%
to do it, to live in
harmony with our planet,

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:57.470 align:middle line:84%
harmony with our community,
and everything around us.

00:31:57.470 --> 00:32:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And this is the world
I'd like to live in.

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:03.590 align:middle line:10%
And to end this
episode and to end

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:08.420 align:middle line:10%
this expose of a whole new
system that is so simple for us

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:10.970 align:middle line:10%
to achieve, to
create an alternative

00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:13.500 align:middle line:10%
by using the existing
system, we've

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:16.250 align:middle line:10%
come back to the most
frequently asked questions.

00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:18.840 align:middle line:10%
And I hope that by now, by
looking at these questions,

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:21.240 align:middle line:10%
you realize how
stupid and laughable

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:24.410 align:middle line:10%
they are because every
single one of these questions

00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:29.160 align:middle line:10%
comes from a position
within a capitalist system.

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:32.750 align:middle line:10%
All these questions come
from a place of fear

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:35.370 align:middle line:10%
and worrying about
not having enough

00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:38.740 align:middle line:10%
and not understanding that by
removing money from the system,

00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:40.190 align:middle line:10%
we're not creating scarcity.

00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:44.000 align:middle line:84%
We are lifting the ceiling
of the current system that

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.440 align:middle line:90%
has kept us under control.

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:48.620 align:middle line:84%
We're removing the barriers
and the hurdles to progress.

00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:51.970 align:middle line:84%
We are allowing people
to dream, to create,

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:54.380 align:middle line:84%
to invent, and make
anything they've ever

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:56.670 align:middle line:90%
dreamt of possible.

00:32:56.670 --> 00:32:59.470 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to drive the
cars that we drive today

00:32:59.470 --> 00:33:00.960 align:middle line:90%
in a world without money?

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.350 align:middle line:90%
The answer is no.

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:04.750 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to use the
electricity we use today

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:06.070 align:middle line:90%
in a world without money?

00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:07.050 align:middle line:90%
The answer is no.

00:33:07.050 --> 00:33:09.180 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to live
in houses the way

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:10.640 align:middle line:90%
they're structured today?

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:11.440 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.900 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
have new materials.

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:14.510 align:middle line:84%
Are we going back
to the Dark Ages?

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:15.600 align:middle line:90%
The answer is no.

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:16.790 align:middle line:90%
We're going to the stars.

00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:17.910 align:middle line:90%
We're going to the sky.

00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:19.530 align:middle line:90%
Everything becomes possible.

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:21.050 align:middle line:90%
Is this a lawless society?

00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:22.490 align:middle line:90%
The answer is no.

00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:24.960 align:middle line:84%
The new laws and
new guidelines are

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:27.330 align:middle line:84%
created by the people
of the community that

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:30.670 align:middle line:84%
are then implemented by
the Council of Elders.

00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:32.632 align:middle line:84%
And why should I do
something I don't like?

00:33:32.632 --> 00:33:34.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're not doing
anything you don't like.

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:36.500 align:middle line:84%
You're contributing
three hours a week

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:38.420 align:middle line:84%
towards one of the
community projects.

00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:41.810 align:middle line:84%
The other benefit of this
is that the three hours

00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:45.310 align:middle line:84%
that we each contribute
towards the community projects

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:47.970 align:middle line:84%
actually becomes the
new education system.

00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:50.670 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine, after a
few years of doing this,

00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:54.930 align:middle line:84%
where you've worked in the
bakery and the engineering

00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:58.350 align:middle line:84%
firm and the rocket
science lab or wherever,

00:33:58.350 --> 00:34:00.110 align:middle line:84%
each and every one
of us will attain

00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:04.410 align:middle line:84%
new skills and new
abilities that we are not

00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:08.120 align:middle line:84%
privy to in the world
we find ourselves today.

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:13.599 align:middle line:84%
By the time we've embraced this
new system of contributionism,

00:34:13.599 --> 00:34:17.800 align:middle line:84%
our society will be filled
with well-informed and highly

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:20.949 align:middle line:84%
skilled individuals that
love their community

00:34:20.949 --> 00:34:23.380 align:middle line:84%
and are capable
of doing anything.

00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:25.050 align:middle line:84%
You'll be able to
build a bridge,

00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:28.469 align:middle line:84%
create an energy device,
bake bread, milk a cow,

00:34:28.469 --> 00:34:30.110 align:middle line:90%
solve mathematical equations.

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:33.239 align:middle line:84%
You'll be able to do things
that you cannot possibly imagine

00:34:33.239 --> 00:34:36.810 align:middle line:84%
that you can do in a capitalist
world where everything is

00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:40.600 align:middle line:84%
restricted and controlled an
access denied unless you have

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:41.590 align:middle line:90%
money.

00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:44.460 align:middle line:84%
This is the world of
Ubuntu and contributionism.

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And I hope that by now, you
can answer any question that

00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:51.620 align:middle line:84%
gets thrown at you about
how are we going to do this

00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:53.130 align:middle line:90%
or how are we going to do that.

00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:56.444 align:middle line:84%
In a world without money,
everything changes.

00:34:56.444 --> 00:34:59.300 align:middle line:84%
It'll remove the
ceiling and the hurdle

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:02.831 align:middle line:84%
to progress and allow
us to dream and achieve.

00:35:02.831 --> 00:35:03.705 align:middle line:90%
Anything is possible.

00:35:03.705 --> 00:35:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to thank you for
watching the series of exposes

00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:11.820 align:middle line:84%
and learning from the ancient
past and finding solutions.

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:13.610 align:middle line:90%
So what can you do?

00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:15.720 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to suggest
that you become

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:18.770 align:middle line:84%
the seed of consciousness
in your community.

00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:20.470 align:middle line:90%
Tell everyone.

00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:22.110 align:middle line:90%
Read as much as you can.

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And do not be afraid of sharing
your knowledge and information

00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:27.640 align:middle line:84%
with those around
you because remember,

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:30.520 align:middle line:84%
now that we know what sound
and resonance is all about

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:34.760 align:middle line:84%
and we have this opportunity and
ability to share this knowledge

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:38.500 align:middle line:84%
and transform our communities
into communities of abundance,

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:39.300 align:middle line:90%
go out there.

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:40.890 align:middle line:90%
Be a seed of consciousness.

00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And tell everyone because
once they've heard it,

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:46.530 align:middle line:90%
they can never unhear it.

00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:48.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm Michael Tellinger.

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:50.660 align:middle line:90%
And thank you for watching.
