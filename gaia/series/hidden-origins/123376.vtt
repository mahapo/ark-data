00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.510 align:middle line:90%


00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:14.310 align:middle line:90%
>>Welcome back.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.350 align:middle line:10%
This is episode five of the
Ubuntu Contributionism Workshop

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.810 align:middle line:10%
where we continue our journey
of discovery looking back

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.830 align:middle line:10%
at the origins of money,
the banking system,

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.620 align:middle line:10%
how money works, and the
financial world around us

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.360 align:middle line:10%
has enslaved us.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.220 align:middle line:10%
And we look at ancient
civilizations and the wisdom

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.770 align:middle line:10%
that we can learn from
the ancient cultures,

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.020 align:middle line:10%
and how we can put
it into practice

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.470 align:middle line:10%
today in this crazy life
that we find ourselves in,

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.540 align:middle line:10%
and how we can learn
from this ancient wisdom

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.654 align:middle line:10%
and really benefit
all of humanity

00:00:46.654 --> 00:00:47.820 align:middle line:10%
with this ancient knowledge.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
this is all about.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.650 align:middle line:84%
So the first four
episodes were really

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.110 align:middle line:84%
about laying the foundation
of where the money comes from,

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.900 align:middle line:84%
the origins of money, how the
banking families came to be,

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.990 align:middle line:84%
how the world
financial systems work,

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.970 align:middle line:84%
who's really in control
of the government,

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.550 align:middle line:84%
and all this information
that is often hidden

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.715 align:middle line:90%
and obscured from sight.

00:01:09.715 --> 00:01:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And today, we start
with the good news.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.600 align:middle line:84%
So we've gone through
the foundation building

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.380 align:middle line:84%
and the revision, which,
as we already discovered,

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.760 align:middle line:84%
it could be quite
depressing and dark.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.910 align:middle line:84%
But just, again,
to remind us, let's

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.660 align:middle line:84%
see it as important
knowledge and information,

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.920 align:middle line:84%
the platform that we first have
to know upon which we can then

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.530 align:middle line:84%
build a bright and
prosperous future for us all.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.680 align:middle line:84%
From now on, it's really
about the good news,

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.110 align:middle line:84%
the plan of action,
and start sharing

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.710 align:middle line:84%
this the philosophy of
Ubuntu and Contributionism,

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.580 align:middle line:84%
that we can really
see how simple it

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.500 align:middle line:84%
is to free ourselves
from this enslavement

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.640 align:middle line:90%
that we find ourselves in.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.370 align:middle line:84%
So where we ended
our previous episode

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.870 align:middle line:84%
was talking about
the fact that we

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.830 align:middle line:84%
have to remove the
money from the system.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.620 align:middle line:84%
As long as we have money,
it'll continue enslaving us.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.720 align:middle line:84%
Somebody'll always
find a way to use money

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.660 align:middle line:84%
as a tool of enslavement,
to benefit themselves,

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.935 align:middle line:84%
and the hierarchical
corporate structural

00:02:06.935 --> 00:02:10.770 align:middle line:84%
will continue being
enforced on us.

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.370 align:middle line:84%
The moment we remove money from
the system, all that changes.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And it is virtually impossible
to keep control of a people

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.530 align:middle line:90%
unless you have money.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.810 align:middle line:84%
So without a money system,
everything falls flat.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.110 align:middle line:84%
And we start looking at a
whole new paradigm shift,

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.830 align:middle line:84%
and embracing all whole
new way of interacting,

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.460 align:middle line:84%
living, and working together
towards a benefit of everyone.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:40.220 align:middle line:84%
Cooperating, collaborating,
and no longer competing.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.240 align:middle line:84%
The moment you say
to people, we're

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.940 align:middle line:84%
going to remove money
from the system,

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.959 align:middle line:90%
some people really freak out.

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.500 align:middle line:84%
You know, they can't
handle that kind

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.510 align:middle line:84%
of-- even the thought
of that starts

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.920 align:middle line:90%
to affect them physically.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.640 align:middle line:84%
Immediately, you start
getting bombarded

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.060 align:middle line:84%
with what have become my
favorite 13 frequently asked

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.480 align:middle line:90%
questions.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And this is over
an 11-year period

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.990 align:middle line:84%
now that these same
questions keep popping up.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.320 align:middle line:84%
What I find fascinating is that
in a world where we are faced

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.587 align:middle line:84%
with millions of
problems every day--

00:03:12.587 --> 00:03:14.670 align:middle line:84%
how many problems do we
have in the United States?

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.310 align:middle line:84%
How many problems do
we have in England

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.640 align:middle line:84%
and Germany and the
whole world collectively?

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.390 align:middle line:84%
Just the problems never
end piling up, right?

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.232 align:middle line:84%
And it's always--
it's very difficult

00:03:24.232 --> 00:03:25.440 align:middle line:90%
to solve the problems, right?

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.774 align:middle line:90%
We've already gone through that.

00:03:26.774 --> 00:03:28.565 align:middle line:84%
We're always told that
it's very difficult.

00:03:28.565 --> 00:03:30.170 align:middle line:84%
It's not easy to
solve the problems.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.544 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's all
nonsense, right?

00:03:31.544 --> 00:03:34.036 align:middle line:84%
We know that to solve the
problems is really very easy.

00:03:34.036 --> 00:03:36.160 align:middle line:84%
It's the money that makes
it difficult to solve it.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.219 align:middle line:84%
So always the hurdle to solving
the problem becomes the money.

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:42.260 align:middle line:84%
There's never enough money
to solve the problems.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.970 align:middle line:84%
But what I find fascinating
is that in a world where

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.940 align:middle line:84%
we are faced with
millions of problems,

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.680 align:middle line:84%
with money, the moment
you remove money

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.890 align:middle line:84%
in an 11-year period,
there are just

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.700 align:middle line:84%
a few dozen questions
and problems or hurdles

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.360 align:middle line:90%
that people find.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.250 align:middle line:84%
And they keep worrying
about the same things.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.300 align:middle line:84%
So it shows is that when you
remove money from the system,

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.960 align:middle line:84%
we only need to solve
arguably 13 problems to live

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.450 align:middle line:84%
in paradise, where in
a world with money,

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.730 align:middle line:84%
we have to solve
millions of problems.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.769 align:middle line:84%
So just philosophically,
that already presents us

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.570 align:middle line:84%
with a very eloquent
pointer towards the fact

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.900 align:middle line:84%
that if you remove money, things
just automatically improve.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is quite a
liberating thought,

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.750 align:middle line:90%
just to start today off with.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.530 align:middle line:84%
So you see some
of the questions.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.320 align:middle line:10%
You know, one of the
most popular ones

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.920 align:middle line:10%
is, who's going to
shovel the crap?

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.884 align:middle line:10%
Because in a world
of money, those

00:04:38.884 --> 00:04:40.300 align:middle line:10%
are the jobs that
are always given

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.600 align:middle line:10%
to the low-paid people, the
immigrants and the people,

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.930 align:middle line:10%
the great unwashed that we
don't want in our societies.

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.600 align:middle line:84%
But we use them and
abuse them because they

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.141 align:middle line:84%
do the jobs that we
don't want to do,

00:04:49.141 --> 00:04:51.310 align:middle line:90%
because they're lowly paid jobs.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
associate these kind of jobs

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.890 align:middle line:84%
with, and positions that
people take in our society.

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.700 align:middle line:84%
And if you just go through
these questions right now,

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.350 align:middle line:84%
I'll just sit on my
ass and do nothing.

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.840 align:middle line:84%
If everything is for free, I'll
just sit back and do nothing,

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.790 align:middle line:90%
and people will bring me stuff.

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:10.590 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.392 align:middle line:84%
That's not what's
going to happen.

00:05:12.392 --> 00:05:14.350 align:middle line:84%
It's not called sit on
your ass and do nothing.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:15.710 align:middle line:90%
It's called Contributionism.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.510 align:middle line:84%
You have to contribute towards
the benefit of your community.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And in return, you have
access to everything

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.500 align:middle line:84%
that the community
produces and develops

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.245 align:middle line:90%
and invents and creates.

00:05:25.245 --> 00:05:26.620 align:middle line:10%
And if everything
is free, I want

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.370 align:middle line:10%
50 Ferraris and 20 mansions.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.950 align:middle line:10%
So just notice where
these questions come from.

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:37.130 align:middle line:84%
They all come from a position
of fear, ego, hierarchy, money,

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.210 align:middle line:84%
position in society, all
this kind of mental--

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.900 align:middle line:84%
these mental blocks
that we have.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.350 align:middle line:84%
How are we going to pay for
things if we've got no money?

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.085 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
when you say people,

00:05:48.085 --> 00:05:51.020 align:middle line:84%
we're going to remove money
from the system, a lot of people

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.820 align:middle line:90%
go into shock.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.772 align:middle line:84%
We're not saying we're going to
prevent you from buying stuff,

00:05:54.772 --> 00:05:56.230 align:middle line:84%
we're going to take
your money away

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.314 align:middle line:84%
so you've got no money
to go out and but stuff.

00:05:58.314 --> 00:06:00.230 align:middle line:84%
We're saying, we're going
to change the system

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.139 align:middle line:90%
so you don't need money.

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:04.430 align:middle line:84%
But when you say to people
you're going to remove money

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.050 align:middle line:84%
from society, they automatically
equate that with poverty,

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.530 align:middle line:90%
not having enough.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.480 align:middle line:84%
So that's not what
we're talking about.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.010 align:middle line:90%
How are we going to buy stuff?

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:17.040 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just laying a
little foundation for you

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.540 align:middle line:84%
to start thinking or
going, taking your thoughts

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.040 align:middle line:84%
in the right direction to be
able to answer these questions.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.600 align:middle line:84%
Because each and
every one of these

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.700 align:middle line:84%
questions comes from a
capitalist perspective,

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.340 align:middle line:84%
the system that
we're in right now.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.110 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't come from
thinking about it

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.520 align:middle line:90%
from the different paradigm.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
the problem lies,

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:38.600 align:middle line:90%
each and every one of them.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.775 align:middle line:10%
And it continues.

00:06:39.775 --> 00:06:42.000 align:middle line:10%
Are we going back
to the dark ages?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.810 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.240 align:middle line:84%
We're releasing our
inventors and scientists

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.686 align:middle line:90%
to create infinitely.

00:06:47.686 --> 00:06:49.810 align:middle line:84%
So we certainly aren't
going back to the dark ages.

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:50.850 align:middle line:90%
Is it a lawless society?

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:52.280 align:middle line:10%
Who makes the laws?

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.015 align:middle line:84%
I used to joke about
it and say, I do.

00:06:55.015 --> 00:06:56.710 align:middle line:84%
But people often
don't get that, so--

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:57.740 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:58.800 align:middle line:90%
I've stopped saying that.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.264 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:00.264 --> 00:07:02.420 align:middle line:90%
So who makes the laws?

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're going to
have new laws, right?

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:05.980 align:middle line:84%
Our communities are
going to make the laws

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.530 align:middle line:90%
for their own communities.

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:09.260 align:middle line:84%
Why should I do
something I don't like?

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, today you're doing
something that you don't like.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And today you work
like a slave just

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.262 align:middle line:84%
so you can buy food and
bread and milk and pay

00:07:15.262 --> 00:07:17.470 align:middle line:84%
for electricity and put your
children through school.

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.275 align:middle line:84%
You think that doing three
hours a week for something

00:07:20.275 --> 00:07:21.790 align:middle line:90%
is too much?

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:27.160 align:middle line:84%
So again, people completely
misunderstand when you first

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.390 align:middle line:90%
throw this at people.

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:30.181 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take
money out of the system

00:07:30.181 --> 00:07:31.360 align:middle line:90%
and create abundance.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.900 align:middle line:84%
It's, well, how can you create
abundance with no money?

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:35.620 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.735 align:middle line:84%
And that's the undoing,
the unlearning,

00:07:37.735 --> 00:07:40.580 align:middle line:84%
the unschooling that
we have to go through,

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:44.360 align:middle line:84%
reprogramming the way we
think about everything.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And remember, just
remind yourself,

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.350 align:middle line:84%
money has affected
and infiltrated

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:53.000 align:middle line:84%
every crack and crevice of
our existence, of our reality.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.160 align:middle line:90%
It affects everything.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.945 align:middle line:84%
This morning, again, as
I was leaving the hotel,

00:07:57.945 --> 00:07:59.130 align:middle line:90%
I turned on the TV.

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:02.910 align:middle line:84%
Just-- I wanted to see what
the local channel looked like.

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And there they come with
their economic report.

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And just every day, no
matter where you turn,

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.840 align:middle line:84%
they shove this money
thing in our faces.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:15.274 align:middle line:84%
And 99% of the global
population or more

00:08:15.274 --> 00:08:17.190 align:middle line:84%
don't even understand
what they're telling us.

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:19.670 align:middle line:84%
The economic report, the
stock markets, or this

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:23.095 align:middle line:84%
is up and that, and
NASDAQ and Dow Jones,

00:08:23.095 --> 00:08:25.180 align:middle line:90%
and what are you talking about?

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And these numbers and
arrows going up and down.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And people look at
this day in, day out.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:32.620 align:middle line:84%
They see it all
around us everywhere.

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.179 align:middle line:84%
And because it's
shoved in our face,

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:35.919 align:middle line:84%
we all think this is
really important stuff.

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:37.710 align:middle line:84%
You know, the people
that put this together

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:38.710 align:middle line:90%
are very, very smart.

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And those are the lies, once
again, that we are told.

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:42.490 align:middle line:90%
This is very complicated stuff.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:44.510 align:middle line:84%
Only a few people
really understand this.

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:47.220 align:middle line:84%
No, it's all bogus,
Ponzi scheme crap

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.610 align:middle line:84%
that's being shoved
down our throats to make

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:51.270 align:middle line:90%
us believe that it's important.

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And this is how we're
going to see it.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.040 align:middle line:84%
Those are the lies
and the traps.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.766 align:middle line:84%
And it's everywhere around
us, no matter where you go.

00:08:57.766 --> 00:08:59.390 align:middle line:10%
Why should I do
something I don't like?

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:02.360 align:middle line:10%
So already, remember, we're
creating a society where

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:06.000 align:middle line:10%
you can follow your dreams,
live out the perfect life

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.600 align:middle line:10%
that you've always
seen for yourself.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.720 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to do
something you don't like.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.490 align:middle line:84%
You choose a
community you live in.

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:13.680 align:middle line:84%
You participate in a
community you live in.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.220 align:middle line:90%
Human nature is to be lazy.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:16.640 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I love that one.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:17.440 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.480 align:middle line:84%
Is that what you
think of humanity?

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.810 align:middle line:90%
Human nature is to be lazy?

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:21.610 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:23.110 align:middle line:84%
Laziness, the way
we perceive it,

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:25.160 align:middle line:90%
is a consequence of capitalism.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.737 align:middle line:84%
And people doing stinking
jobs that they hate,

00:09:27.737 --> 00:09:30.320 align:middle line:84%
they have to get up at 4 o'clock
in the morning to catch a bus

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.930 align:middle line:84%
or ride a bicycle in
the rain or in the cold,

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:35.467 align:middle line:84%
go to a stinking job
that they despise,

00:09:35.467 --> 00:09:37.550 align:middle line:84%
but they have to do it
because it's the only means

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:39.360 align:middle line:84%
that they can keep
their family alive,

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.236 align:middle line:84%
this is why people get lazy,
and why you call somebody lazy.

00:09:42.236 --> 00:09:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, some
people just rebel.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.401 align:middle line:84%
They say, I'm not
doing this anymore.

00:09:45.401 --> 00:09:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly, oh,
it's terrible, you know?

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Become a respectable
member of society.

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:52.280 align:middle line:90%
Get a job.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.880 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.530 align:middle line:84%
That makes you respectable
because you've got a job?

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And this is how we constantly
torture ourselves and torture

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.690 align:middle line:84%
our children and
torture our friends.

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:04.670 align:middle line:84%
Because we look at our
friends as mirrors.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And if our friends don't
agree with what we're doing,

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:10.510 align:middle line:84%
that's probably the worst
thing that can happen to us.

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:14.420 align:middle line:84%
In fact, what I find
is that often, people

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:17.120 align:middle line:84%
don't like to talk about
this subject or a world

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.787 align:middle line:84%
without money or this
whole new paradigm

00:10:18.787 --> 00:10:21.161 align:middle line:84%
is because they're worried
about what their friends might

00:10:21.161 --> 00:10:22.060 align:middle line:90%
think about them.

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:23.750 align:middle line:84%
It's not about their
own perspective

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:24.980 align:middle line:90%
or what I believe in.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:27.710 align:middle line:84%
It's, what are my friends going
to say if I say these things?

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:28.750 align:middle line:90%
And then they just keep quiet.

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:31.125 align:middle line:84%
They don't actually say this,
because they're too scared.

00:10:31.125 --> 00:10:35.130 align:middle line:84%
So once again, the fear of
what'll happen outside of you

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:37.665 align:middle line:84%
takes over, and it starts
to control your life.

00:10:37.665 --> 00:10:40.090 align:middle line:84%
But we know better
now, don't we?

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:41.900 align:middle line:10%
I want to say--
Let me go back to,

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:43.260 align:middle line:10%
who's going to shovel the crap?

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:44.410 align:middle line:10%
Let's do that one quickly.

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:46.690 align:middle line:90%
Has anybody got an answer?

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:48.140 align:middle line:90%
>>Hi, I'm Patrick.

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'd be more than happy
to fulfill number one.

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:54.030 align:middle line:84%
Somebody's got to do it, and
if you learn how to do it well,

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:55.821 align:middle line:84%
other people will get
involved, and they'll

00:10:55.821 --> 00:10:57.410 align:middle line:90%
share in the effort.

00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:00.110 align:middle line:84%
Especially if it's only
three hours a week.

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:01.200 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you, Patrick.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad you said this,
because this is what I find.

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:06.630 align:middle line:84%
Wherever I do the
Ubuntu workshops,

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:09.130 align:middle line:84%
there's always somebody,
or at least one person,

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:11.850 align:middle line:84%
more often more than one
person who puts up their hand

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:13.300 align:middle line:90%
and says, I'll do it.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.480 align:middle line:84%
It just shows you
the human spirit.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.140 align:middle line:84%
People aren't scared of
doing the so-called menial

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:18.940 align:middle line:90%
or dirty jobs.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:20.106 align:middle line:90%
It's not really a dirty job.

00:11:20.106 --> 00:11:22.980 align:middle line:84%
It's what capitalism
has reduced it to be.

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.060 align:middle line:84%
You know, we all
go to the toilet.

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:26.470 align:middle line:90%
We all create waste.

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:27.510 align:middle line:90%
Animals create waste.

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:28.570 align:middle line:90%
There's mess everywhere.

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:30.880 align:middle line:84%
We've got to clean the
mess up behind ourselves.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:34.540 align:middle line:84%
We can't expect others to clean
up behind us all the time.

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:37.000 align:middle line:84%
So it's just taking
responsibility back

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.490 align:middle line:84%
onto ourselves, and
becoming respectable members

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:42.030 align:middle line:84%
of our own community and
society and say, well, we all

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:43.367 align:middle line:90%
have to clean up the mess.

00:11:43.367 --> 00:11:45.950 align:middle line:84%
But there's another solution to
the problem as well, you know?

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:49.635 align:middle line:84%
It's like, remember,
there are as many talents

00:11:49.635 --> 00:11:51.010 align:middle line:84%
as there are people
in the world.

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:53.509 align:middle line:84%
There are as many passions as
there are people in the world.

00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:56.330 align:middle line:84%
Each and every one of
us is completely unique.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And every one of us has
more than one talent.

00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:01.310 align:middle line:90%
We have multi-talented people.

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:03.810 align:middle line:90%
Many of us are multi-talented.

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:07.550 align:middle line:84%
And there are as many
crazy chemical engineers

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:11.070 align:middle line:84%
and scientists out there as
they are budding Michelangelos,

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:11.870 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:15.820 align:middle line:84%
So for every crazy artist who
wants to create the next "Mona

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:19.650 align:middle line:84%
Lisa" or sculpture
of the "David,"

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:21.960 align:middle line:84%
they are crazy scientists
and chemical engineers

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.400 align:middle line:84%
who want to solve
the sewage problem,

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.640 align:middle line:84%
and will find ways of
solving that in a way that

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:31.190 align:middle line:84%
is eloquent, easy,
clean, and actually

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:33.050 align:middle line:90%
good for your community.

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:35.190 align:middle line:84%
So by the time the sewage
comes out of your home

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:37.490 align:middle line:84%
or out of a building
or anywhere else,

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:39.650 align:middle line:84%
it not only beautifies
your environment,

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:44.420 align:middle line:84%
it probably produces energy
and helps your garden grow,

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:47.350 align:middle line:84%
and will do things that we can't
imagine today because today,

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:49.970 align:middle line:84%
it's not financially
viable to do that.

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:52.600 align:middle line:84%
See, most of the technology
that we should be using,

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.920 align:middle line:84%
or the advancement that
we should have today

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.930 align:middle line:90%
is not financially viable.

00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:59.290 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that amazing?

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Bankers have become the
decision makers that

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.842 align:middle line:90%
allow us to do things or not.

00:13:04.842 --> 00:13:07.050 align:middle line:84%
If you think about it, if
you want to start a bakery,

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:09.610 align:middle line:84%
you'll go to the
bank for a loan,

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:11.290 align:middle line:84%
and they say, well,
Michael, we've

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:12.940 align:middle line:90%
heard about your baking skills.

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:14.840 align:middle line:84%
Apparently you're the
best baker in town.

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:15.874 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:13:15.874 --> 00:13:17.540 align:middle line:84%
But you know, we've
looked at the model,

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:20.370 align:middle line:84%
and unfortunately,
your business model

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:23.082 align:middle line:84%
doesn't make financial
sense, so we can't give you

00:13:23.082 --> 00:13:26.080 align:middle line:90%
a loan to start your bakery.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:26.880 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.550 align:middle line:84%
Is this the kind of world we
want to live in, where bankers

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:32.110 align:middle line:84%
decide what we're going to
do and can and cannot do?

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:32.910 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:34.430 align:middle line:84%
This is why we
have to change it.

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:36.710 align:middle line:90%
It cannot continue like this.

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:41.330 align:middle line:84%
I want to go back to 20
Ferraris and 50 mansions

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:44.410 align:middle line:84%
because that's one that always
puts a smile on people's faces.

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:45.210 align:middle line:90%
So right-- really?

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And so in which of those 20
mansions do you want to live?

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:50.870 align:middle line:84%
Remember, because you don't
need money, everything is free,

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:52.860 align:middle line:84%
everything is available
to you, and you have

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:54.790 align:middle line:90%
a home you choose to live in.

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:57.550 align:middle line:84%
So the only reason people
have more than one home today

00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:59.940 align:middle line:84%
is because it's actually
their security blanket.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:00.740 align:middle line:90%
It's a value.

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:02.399 align:middle line:90%
They buy it as an investment.

00:14:02.399 --> 00:14:04.440 align:middle line:84%
So if they hit Skid Row,
if they lose everything,

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:05.640 align:middle line:90%
at least they've got a home.

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:07.389 align:middle line:84%
And one of them, they
can sell one of them

00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:10.056 align:middle line:84%
and then they can survive
having enough money.

00:14:10.056 --> 00:14:12.430 align:middle line:84%
That's often a reason why
people have more than one home,

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:13.830 align:middle line:84%
or they just have
too much money,

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:16.880 align:middle line:84%
and they just keep buying stuff
because it's all they know.

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:21.420 align:middle line:84%
But if you live in an Ubuntu
Contributionism society,

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:24.080 align:middle line:84%
you can live and choose
to live wherever you want.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And our homes will look
very different to the way

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:27.510 align:middle line:90%
they look today.

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:28.841 align:middle line:90%
We'll use different materials.

00:14:28.841 --> 00:14:30.090 align:middle line:90%
We'll talk about that as well.

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:32.840 align:middle line:84%
What kind of materials are we
going to use around us, right?

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:37.090 align:middle line:84%
To buy a home, it's just a
statement of greed and ego

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:38.335 align:middle line:90%
to have more than one home.

00:14:38.335 --> 00:14:40.710 align:middle line:84%
Because if you don't want to
live in this town or village

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:41.300 align:middle line:90%
anymore, you say, look.

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:42.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go and
live over there.

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.892 align:middle line:84%
And you go to another town, and
they welcome you with open arms

00:14:45.892 --> 00:14:48.100 align:middle line:84%
because you're going to come
and join their community

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:51.590 align:middle line:84%
and contribute to that
community with your own talents

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:54.530 align:middle line:84%
and skills, and contribute
towards the community projects

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:56.070 align:middle line:90%
that they already have going.

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:58.324 align:middle line:90%
The 50 Ferraris is a great one.

00:14:58.324 --> 00:15:00.490 align:middle line:84%
Why do people want to-- you
want to drive a Ferrari?

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:01.450 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:02.699 align:middle line:90%
So let me just get this right.

00:15:02.699 --> 00:15:06.810 align:middle line:84%
So you want to drive a Ferrari
that you have to put petrol in?

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:10.280 align:middle line:84%
You're going to want to go
fill up at a gas station,

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.565 align:middle line:84%
pay money to put
petrol in your Ferrari

00:15:12.565 --> 00:15:14.620 align:middle line:84%
while all your friends
are driving around,

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:17.540 align:middle line:84%
floating around with
levitation vehicles for free?

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:20.737 align:middle line:90%
You really want to do that?

00:15:20.737 --> 00:15:22.070 align:middle line:90%
That's where we're going, right?

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:24.470 align:middle line:84%
So why would you
want 50 Ferraris

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:27.494 align:middle line:84%
when everyone is moving with
advancement and technology

00:15:27.494 --> 00:15:29.160 align:middle line:84%
because it's all for
free and available,

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.970 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
our scientists do?

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:33.930 align:middle line:84%
And they make it available to
all of us in our community.

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:36.130 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not saying Ferraris
will go out the window.

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:38.600 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm saying is
that Ferraris are probably

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.610 align:middle line:84%
going to become like a
collectible, crazy curiosity

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:42.410 align:middle line:90%
from the past.

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:46.710 align:middle line:84%
Wow, can you believe that people
used to drive those things?

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And they had to put
this thing called

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:49.520 align:middle line:90%
petrol in that made it go?

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:51.930 align:middle line:84%
It had this weird
thing called an engine

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:54.255 align:middle line:84%
that was like really ancient
steam train technology?

00:15:54.255 --> 00:15:56.030 align:middle line:90%
You know, combustion engine?

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:57.840 align:middle line:84%
Because in essence,
that's what it is.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:01.740 align:middle line:84%
All our cars today still run
on steam train technology.

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:05.900 align:middle line:84%
This is not well liked by
Formula One enthusiasts

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:08.700 align:middle line:84%
because they think that
this is really advanced

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:09.790 align:middle line:90%
technology in those cars.

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:11.870 align:middle line:90%
No, it's steam train technology.

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:14.640 align:middle line:84%
You have a little explosion
that creates pressure and makes

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.060 align:middle line:84%
the pistons move, and
it makes the car go.

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:17.860 align:middle line:90%
It's like, wow.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And they disguise it
in all kinds of ways.

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.410 align:middle line:84%
So we are still stuck
150 years in the past

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:26.230 align:middle line:84%
with a so-called advanced
technology we use today.

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:28.740 align:middle line:84%
That's how they pull
the wool over our eyes.

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:30.972 align:middle line:84%
So you're not going
to want a Ferrari.

00:16:30.972 --> 00:16:32.430 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
want to participate

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:34.650 align:middle line:90%
in the explosion of technology.

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:37.174 align:middle line:84%
But if you want a
Ferrari, you can have one.

00:16:37.174 --> 00:16:38.840 align:middle line:84%
Except, where are you
going to drive it?

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.720 align:middle line:84%
Because we're not
going to have roads.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.100 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to probably
have to keep some of the roads

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:46.700 align:middle line:84%
so that people can drive
their Ferraris in future.

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:47.890 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:49.760 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that brings
another problem.

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.040 align:middle line:84%
What are we going to
do with all the roads?

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:55.909 align:middle line:84%
Millions and millions of
miles of tar and concrete

00:16:55.909 --> 00:16:57.200 align:middle line:90%
that have destroyed our planet.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:00.355 align:middle line:84%
What are we going to
do with all the roads?

00:17:00.355 --> 00:17:02.730 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have to find
a creative solution for that.

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:06.990 align:middle line:84%
Now there is a great creative
challenge for the scientists

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:08.310 align:middle line:90%
to come up with.

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:10.050 align:middle line:84%
Let's figure out what we're
going to do with all the roads.

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And then all the high-rise
buildings in the cities.

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.319 align:middle line:84%
What are we going
to do with those?

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:14.985 align:middle line:84%
Because we're not
going to have offices.

00:17:14.985 --> 00:17:16.599 align:middle line:84%
You're not going
to go to an office.

00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:19.380 align:middle line:84%
You're going to live where you
participate in your community.

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:21.647 align:middle line:90%
So no s has an office.

00:17:21.647 --> 00:17:23.730 align:middle line:84%
There might be a laboratory
if you're a scientist,

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:27.450 align:middle line:84%
or there might be a dairy
if you make cheese or milk

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:30.250 align:middle line:90%
or whatever, but no offices.

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:32.780 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have a studio
where you design stuff,

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:35.410 align:middle line:84%
but that's not an office,
a high-rise building.

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:38.730 align:middle line:84%
So we've got some interesting
creative challenges

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:41.996 align:middle line:84%
when we start breaking
down the capitalist system.

00:17:41.996 --> 00:17:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think people
are going to come up

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:45.970 align:middle line:84%
with phenomenal
ideas for what to do

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:50.890 align:middle line:84%
with these skyscrapers and
the high-density city areas

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:53.820 align:middle line:84%
and the tar roads and the
roads all over the world.

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, human
nature is to be lazy.

00:17:56.780 --> 00:18:01.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how dare anyone
make such a statement

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.670 align:middle line:84%
when it is obviously
just a reflection

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:05.460 align:middle line:90%
of the capitalist system?

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.920 align:middle line:84%
When people are rebelling
against being forced

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.530 align:middle line:84%
into doing disgusting
jobs that they get

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:13.860 align:middle line:84%
paid just a slave
labor salary just

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.320 align:middle line:84%
to keep them alive
from month to month,

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:19.640 align:middle line:84%
and then repeat that same
insanity over and over again.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.970 align:middle line:90%
And this is our life, right?

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:22.240 align:middle line:90%
These are our lives.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:25.911 align:middle line:84%
I've been saying for a long time
now that the best description

00:18:25.911 --> 00:18:27.910 align:middle line:84%
of human nature, or the
best way we can probably

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:29.730 align:middle line:84%
define human nature
is to be creative,

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:33.315 align:middle line:84%
to create, to co-create,
to give expression

00:18:33.315 --> 00:18:35.100 align:middle line:90%
of what we are ourselves.

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:38.010 align:middle line:84%
We are part of the
great creation.

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
all we want to do,

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.550 align:middle line:84%
is to create, from the
earliest of time as babies.

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:46.270 align:middle line:84%
We blow bubbles, we make noises,
we make signs with our hands.

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:50.570 align:middle line:84%
We sing, we draw, we
make sand castles.

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:51.900 align:middle line:90%
We just want to create.

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And then that gets beaten out
of us when we go to school.

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:56.080 align:middle line:90%
No, you can't do that anymore.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:57.788 align:middle line:84%
Now you've got to get
serious about life.

00:18:57.788 --> 00:18:59.140 align:middle line:90%
How are you going to earn money?

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:01.380 align:middle line:90%
And everything changes, right?

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:03.640 align:middle line:84%
So human nature
is not to be lazy.

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.730 align:middle line:90%
Human nature is to be creative.

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And this Ubuntu
Contributionism system

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:11.830 align:middle line:84%
provides the absolute
fertile platform and ground

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:15.450 align:middle line:84%
for everyone to give expression
to all their creative talents

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:17.970 align:middle line:84%
and abilities, no
matter what they may be.

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And whatever it
is, it'll always be

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:22.750 align:middle line:84%
supported by the community
you find yourself in.

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:25.770 align:middle line:84%
Where the tools, the components,
whatever it is you need

00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:28.470 align:middle line:84%
will always be provided
for, because all those are

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:32.020 align:middle line:84%
part of the community project
that looks after itself.

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And these frequently
asked questions continue.

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:36.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
bore you with it.

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:39.740 align:middle line:10%
But why should I give up all the
things I've worked so hard for?

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:42.380 align:middle line:84%
You see, it's always
from a position of fear

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:45.040 align:middle line:90%
or a hierarchical structure.

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:47.530 align:middle line:84%
You'll see, when you start
reading these questions now,

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:50.040 align:middle line:84%
they become so silly, and we
can see right through them

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.000 align:middle line:90%
instantly.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.125 align:middle line:10%
Why should I give you
something if you have nothing

00:19:53.125 --> 00:19:54.840 align:middle line:10%
to give me in return?

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.000 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's like that
kind of mentality.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, you don't have to
give me anything in return,

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:01.200 align:middle line:84%
because what I do
for my community is

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.640 align:middle line:84%
available to everyone
all the time.

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.200 align:middle line:90%
That's how it works.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:08.110 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to give
me anything in return.

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:09.850 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you
something of value.

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:11.420 align:middle line:84%
What am I going
to get in return?

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:13.171 align:middle line:84%
Is this just a
form of communism?

00:20:13.171 --> 00:20:14.420 align:middle line:90%
This is often what people say.

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:16.460 align:middle line:84%
It's just another
form of communism.

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And the answer to
that is, no, it's not.

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:20.460 align:middle line:90%
Communism fell desperately.

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:22.570 align:middle line:84%
It turned out to be a
fascist dictatorship that

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:24.150 align:middle line:90%
was driven by money.

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:25.580 align:middle line:90%
So that's what communism was.

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:28.750 align:middle line:84%
It may have been a noble
idea in its original form,

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:30.760 align:middle line:84%
but it was hijacked, and
that's what it became.

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:34.220 align:middle line:84%
So we've got to call
communism what it became,

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:37.590 align:middle line:84%
not what the ideal
philosophy was.

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:38.910 align:middle line:90%
This works without money.

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:40.850 align:middle line:84%
This is the only
system in the world

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:43.650 align:middle line:84%
that we propose that
works without money.

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:47.130 align:middle line:84%
Yank the money out of it and
turn our place into paradise.

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:48.740 align:middle line:10%
What about human
nature, or the fact

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:51.320 align:middle line:10%
that people want to
continually better themselves?

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:52.770 align:middle line:90%
That's an interesting one.

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:55.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, you'll have the
platform and the opportunity

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:57.340 align:middle line:84%
to infinitely better
yourself, because you'll

00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:00.040 align:middle line:84%
have everything you've ever
needed to better yourself.

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.790 align:middle line:84%
And what about progress and
advancement and technology?

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:06.060 align:middle line:84%
Does this mean we're going
to regress and go backwards?

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:07.360 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.780 align:middle line:90%
We're going to the stars.

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:12.200 align:middle line:84%
We're bringing up our
scientists to create and invent

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.730 align:middle line:84%
infinitely, giving them the
laboratories and research

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:17.690 align:middle line:84%
facilities that they
need to continue

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:20.110 align:middle line:84%
inventing and creating,
and then sharing all that

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:21.350 align:middle line:90%
with all of us.

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:23.170 align:middle line:84%
So we certainly are
not going backwards.

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:26.760 align:middle line:84%
Right now, money doesn't allow
us to create a laboratory

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.010 align:middle line:90%
to invent things.

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:30.615 align:middle line:84%
And inventors that have
given us cures for disease

00:21:30.615 --> 00:21:34.090 align:middle line:84%
and free energy devices and
so forth, they get shot down

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:36.980 align:middle line:84%
or they get killed or
threatened or bought out.

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:39.420 align:middle line:84%
Their inventions are taken
in, they're patented,

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:41.950 align:middle line:84%
their patents get bought
up, and they get shelved,

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:44.420 align:middle line:84%
never to be released because
it's not good for business

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:46.580 align:middle line:90%
to cure disease.

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:47.380 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:50.700 align:middle line:84%
Once everyone is cured, who
are we going to sell drugs to?

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:51.910 align:middle line:10%
And it goes on.

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:54.080 align:middle line:10%
If there's no money, how
are we going to get things?

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:57.510 align:middle line:10%
Why would I want to slave
away all day for free?

00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:58.420 align:middle line:90%
Again, can you see?

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:02.620 align:middle line:84%
It's like they compute
working with not getting money

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:03.420 align:middle line:90%
in return.

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:04.940 align:middle line:90%
And it's just amazing.

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:09.720 align:middle line:84%
And see how quickly you
see through the insanity.

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.610 align:middle line:84%
Just answer a few
of these questions,

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:14.300 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly, the
rest come so easily.

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:19.680 align:middle line:84%
So this took me several years
to figure out in the beginning.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:22.780 align:middle line:84%
Today, it takes a few
minutes to figure it out.

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's all part of the
collective consciousness,

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.970 align:middle line:84%
because we've all
grown consciously.

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:29.810 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot easier for
people to embrace this today

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:32.860 align:middle line:90%
than it was in 2005.

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:34.360 align:middle line:84%
How are we going
to get electricity?

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:37.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've spoken
about it already.

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:40.321 align:middle line:84%
Free electricity devices have
been discovered many times,

00:22:40.321 --> 00:22:41.820 align:middle line:84%
and the inventors
have always either

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:43.861 align:middle line:84%
been silenced or killed
or threatened or tortured

00:22:43.861 --> 00:22:45.270 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:48.040 align:middle line:84%
So is this not a case
of taking from the rich

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.590 align:middle line:90%
and giving to the poor?

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:50.395 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:22:50.395 --> 00:22:52.660 align:middle line:90%
There are no rich and no poor.

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:55.970 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has
everything you need.

00:22:55.970 --> 00:23:00.110 align:middle line:84%
So none of that Robin Hood
kind of mentality, right?

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:03.130 align:middle line:10%
And why don't we rather focus
on improving the economy

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:06.650 align:middle line:10%
and alleviate poverty so that
everyone has sufficient access

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:08.360 align:middle line:10%
to food and other things?

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:09.580 align:middle line:90%
Again, yeah.

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:10.470 align:middle line:90%
Alleviate poverty.

00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:11.969 align:middle line:84%
And these are real
questions, so I'm

00:23:11.969 --> 00:23:14.080 align:middle line:84%
sharing real questions
that I've received

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.840 align:middle line:90%
from people all over the world.

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And it just shows you
how equally poisoned

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:19.360 align:middle line:90%
we have become.

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:20.520 align:middle line:90%
Alleviate poverty.

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:23.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, poverty is a consequence
of not having money.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:26.050 align:middle line:84%
So we're getting rid of
money, so nobody is poor.

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:28.197 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has
everything they need.

00:23:28.197 --> 00:23:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And it just keeps
coming back to that.

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:31.910 align:middle line:90%
It always comes back to that.

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:35.100 align:middle line:10%
Finally, does this not mean the
degradation of our lifestyle?

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:36.210 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:38.790 align:middle line:84%
It means an infinite
improvement of our lifestyle,

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:41.100 align:middle line:84%
and everything you've
ever dreamt of.

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:43.200 align:middle line:10%
Is this not a free
for all and a lawless

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:46.120 align:middle line:10%
society where everyone
can do what they want?

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:47.340 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:50.460 align:middle line:84%
It's far more
controlled, in a way,

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:53.420 align:middle line:84%
because everyone takes
responsibility for themselves.

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:54.670 align:middle line:90%
It's about high consciousness.

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:57.780 align:middle line:84%
It's about people
feeling respected

00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:00.940 align:middle line:84%
by their own community because
they feel that they're actually

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:04.850 align:middle line:84%
contributing something that
other people respect and love

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:05.770 align:middle line:90%
them for.

00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:08.430 align:middle line:84%
Not because they're
doing some menial job

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:12.350 align:middle line:84%
and they're the unseen people
in the society, as so many of us

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:13.449 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:24:13.449 --> 00:24:15.490 align:middle line:10%
If everything is for free,
can I go to your house

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:16.670 align:middle line:10%
and take whatever I want?

00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:17.605 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:17.605 --> 00:24:18.405 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:24:18.405 --> 00:24:19.440 align:middle line:90%
This is a real question.

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:21.430 align:middle line:90%
It's like, really?

00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:22.730 align:middle line:90%
So let me just get this right.

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:24.080 align:middle line:90%
Why would you want to do that?

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.660 align:middle line:84%
If you live in this
society, everything

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:29.490 align:middle line:90%
you have is tailor-made for you.

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:31.930 align:middle line:84%
The table and
chairs in your house

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:34.340 align:middle line:84%
are made for you by the
carpenters in your town.

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:36.040 align:middle line:84%
I don't want your
tables and chairs,

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:39.437 align:middle line:84%
because I've got my own,
made specifically for me.

00:24:39.437 --> 00:24:41.020 align:middle line:84%
So why would you
want to come and take

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:44.500 align:middle line:84%
my stuff that's imbued with my
energy and the way I like it?

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:48.667 align:middle line:84%
Again, it is a capitalistic
kind of knee-jerk response.

00:24:48.667 --> 00:24:50.750 align:middle line:84%
I'll just come to your
house and take what I want.

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:52.720 align:middle line:84%
So that's the other
very important thing.

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:55.600 align:middle line:84%
Remember, in this world
where our community projects

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.010 align:middle line:84%
are driven by the
people in our community

00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:02.040 align:middle line:84%
and their creative talents
and abilities, everything

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:04.390 align:middle line:84%
we have is going to
be tailor-made for us,

00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:06.900 align:middle line:84%
from our shoes to our
clothes to our homes,

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:08.840 align:middle line:84%
the way they're
designed and built,

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:13.140 align:middle line:84%
to the furniture in your
house, to possibly the cars

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:15.170 align:middle line:84%
or vehicles that we
travel in, whatever

00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:16.810 align:middle line:90%
that technology may be.

00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:20.820 align:middle line:84%
Because we can, and
we choose to do so.

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And that is a huge
paradigm shift.

00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:26.980 align:middle line:84%
Today to get tailor-made shoes,
they'd cost you a fortune.

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:29.720 align:middle line:84%
We can't afford tailor-made
shoes today, right?

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:32.300 align:middle line:84%
Or go to a tailor and have
clothes made for yourself.

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:38.290 align:middle line:84%
That'd cost you 100 times more
than buying stuff off a shelf.

00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:41.150 align:middle line:84%
So that's how things
turn around completely.

00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:46.270 align:middle line:84%
It's a 180-degree turnaround
in everything we do.

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:51.070 align:middle line:84%
The moment you remove money from
the system, everything changes,

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:53.810 align:middle line:84%
and it changes
dramatically, and it

00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:57.640 align:middle line:84%
changes for the better of
everyone in the community

00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:00.900 align:middle line:84%
because it looks after
everyone in the community.

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And that is why it is a
minority-based system.

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.510 align:middle line:84%
So we might as well
talk about it now,

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:09.400 align:middle line:90%
because I brought it up.

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.470 align:middle line:84%
A minority-based
system, because it's not

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:13.270 align:middle line:90%
about what the majority wants.

00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:17.480 align:middle line:84%
It's about looking after all
the hundreds of minorities that

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.600 align:middle line:84%
make up our communities,
from the people that

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:22.550 align:middle line:84%
look after the butterflies
to the people that worry

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:25.514 align:middle line:84%
about the bugs eating the
trees, so the trees die,

00:26:25.514 --> 00:26:27.180 align:middle line:84%
to the people that
look after the horses

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:30.840 align:middle line:84%
or keep the water in the rivers
clean, to the carpenters,

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:33.430 align:middle line:84%
do the dairies, to
everything that we do.

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:35.900 align:middle line:84%
These are all people
that do things

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:38.250 align:middle line:84%
that are minorities in our
society, that contribute

00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:41.530 align:middle line:84%
to the well being and
the abundance of everyone

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:43.110 align:middle line:90%
in the community.

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:45.020 align:middle line:84%
And this is why
it is so important

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:46.730 align:middle line:90%
to look after minorities.

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:49.500 align:middle line:84%
And there are weird
people doing weird things.

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:52.110 align:middle line:90%
But amazingly exciting things.

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And also, in a world without
money where all of this

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:57.770 align:middle line:84%
is possible and the technology
is available to people,

00:26:57.770 --> 00:27:00.120 align:middle line:90%
the minorities will explode.

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Today, we can't
do certain things

00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:05.780 align:middle line:84%
and do good for our
societies or the environment

00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:07.460 align:middle line:84%
because it's not
financially viable.

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:08.870 align:middle line:90%
We don't have enough money.

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:11.140 align:middle line:84%
I know that most of you
would have gone out and tried

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:13.350 align:middle line:84%
to do something that was
good for your community,

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:15.620 align:middle line:84%
and there's just not
enough money to do that.

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:17.600 align:middle line:90%
So that changes completely.

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:21.890 align:middle line:84%
So this is why I call this
a minority-driven system,

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:23.270 align:middle line:90%
not a majority-driven system.

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:25.525 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes people
take it out of context

00:27:25.525 --> 00:27:27.450 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, Tellinger's
lost his mind.

00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:28.340 align:middle line:90%
I say, no.

00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:30.910 align:middle line:84%
We're just actually getting
down to the root of the problem

00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:32.040 align:middle line:90%
and making people see.

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:35.500 align:middle line:84%
So in essence, what
it is, is it is

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:38.600 align:middle line:84%
moving into a level
of higher conscious,

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:41.140 align:middle line:84%
embracing unity,
and working together

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:45.670 align:middle line:84%
in cooperation, collaboration,
and forgetting that this word

00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:47.650 align:middle line:90%
competition ever existed.

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:51.180 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there is still competition
within the structure,

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:57.214 align:middle line:84%
but it's called cooperative,
collaborative competition where

00:27:57.214 --> 00:27:59.130 align:middle line:84%
scientists might sort
of challenge each other.

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:02.130 align:middle line:84%
Say, well, who's going to come
up with a better electricity

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:04.890 align:middle line:84%
device or a better cure
for cancer quicker?

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And then whoever comes
up with it quicker says,

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:08.130 align:middle line:90%
hey, well done, buddy.

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And everybody knows
that you did it,

00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:12.030 align:middle line:84%
and everyone then looks
to you as the master,

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:15.750 align:middle line:84%
and you teach everybody else
what you have discovered so

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:17.330 align:middle line:90%
that it benefits the community.

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:20.930 align:middle line:84%
Today, that competition if you
discover something like that,

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:23.210 align:middle line:84%
you get shuffled away,
they take your invention,

00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:24.780 align:middle line:90%
and they hide it, right?

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:27.610 align:middle line:84%
So that cooperative
competition that

00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:29.340 align:middle line:90%
actually benefits community.

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And I have no idea
what'll happen

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:33.650 align:middle line:90%
to sport, competitive sport.

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:37.060 align:middle line:84%
Because often, sport is equated
with actually preparing us

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:41.060 align:middle line:84%
for war, especially games
like rugby where you've

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:44.400 align:middle line:84%
got these teams, and you've got
rules, and you've got referees,

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.430 align:middle line:84%
and you get penalties and
yellow cards and all this.

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And so I have no idea how
this will affect sport.

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:52.240 align:middle line:90%
But we'll see.

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:54.460 align:middle line:90%
We'll see how it evolves.

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:57.430 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to have the
answers for all the questions

00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:59.824 align:middle line:84%
today because the
communities will

00:28:59.824 --> 00:29:01.490 align:middle line:84%
decide what they're
going to do and what

00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:03.850 align:middle line:90%
they're not going to do.

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:06.680 align:middle line:10%
So the moment you take
money out of the system

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:09.580 align:middle line:10%
a miracle happens.

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:10.630 align:middle line:90%
A world without money.

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:14.930 align:middle line:84%
There's no crime, no envy,
no gluttony, no greed,

00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:20.500 align:middle line:84%
no hoarding, no hierarchy,
and especially no hunger.

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:25.010 align:middle line:84%
No obstacles of any kind
to any form of progress.

00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:28.990 align:middle line:84%
We have removed all
hurdles to each one

00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:32.690 align:middle line:84%
of our individual dreams,
to the collective progress

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:35.610 align:middle line:84%
of our towns and
communities, and that's

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:37.940 align:middle line:84%
what happens
virtually immediately.

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:41.020 align:middle line:84%
People say, well, what
about crimes of passion?

00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And there's a very simple
answer for that as well.

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:46.911 align:middle line:84%
Crimes of passion
is something that

00:29:46.911 --> 00:29:50.780 align:middle line:84%
is going to be directly affected
by the society you live in.

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:53.430 align:middle line:84%
Today, the relationships
between people

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:57.860 align:middle line:84%
are dictated by the society
that we come out of.

00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:00.860 align:middle line:84%
The societies, the suburbs,
the communities, the schooling,

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:04.160 align:middle line:84%
the upbringing forms
us as individuals.

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And people go into relationships
and into marriages that are

00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:10.740 align:middle line:90%
often not perfectly matched.

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:13.430 align:middle line:84%
And already, there's
a mismatch there.

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:15.780 align:middle line:84%
But often, it is
the rich guy that

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:18.680 align:middle line:84%
walks into a small village,
finds a beautiful girl

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.940 align:middle line:84%
and marries her whisks
her off, and this

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:23.310 align:middle line:84%
is her prince and
knight in shining armor,

00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:25.230 align:middle line:84%
and there's a complete
mismatch there,

00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:28.080 align:middle line:84%
until she meets somebody
else who is her match,

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:32.620 align:middle line:84%
and then suddenly there's ego
and envy and hurt and anger.

00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:34.780 align:middle line:84%
It's a silly example,
but it's a valid one.

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:35.870 align:middle line:90%
It happens all the time.

00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:37.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are
forced marriages.

00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:41.680 align:middle line:84%
People get forced into
marriage because families

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:42.530 align:middle line:90%
decide on things.

00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:44.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is obviously
going to have to change.

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:47.070 align:middle line:84%
How this is going to
change, I can't tell you.

00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:49.140 align:middle line:84%
The communities and
societies will decide

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:50.550 align:middle line:90%
how this is going to change.

00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:52.130 align:middle line:84%
What's going to
happen, however, is

00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:56.590 align:middle line:84%
that the way that our children
grow up into adulthood,

00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:58.590 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be creating
fall more balanced

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:02.190 align:middle line:84%
and well adapted
individuals by the time they

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:03.785 align:middle line:90%
reach the age of 16 already.

00:31:03.785 --> 00:31:05.160 align:middle line:84%
They'll know
exactly what they're

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:06.368 align:middle line:90%
going to do with their lives.

00:31:06.368 --> 00:31:08.370 align:middle line:84%
They'll know what skills
and talents that have.

00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:11.380 align:middle line:84%
They'll be completely
integrated into the community.

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:13.930 align:middle line:84%
They'll know what their
contribution to the community

00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:15.020 align:middle line:90%
already is.

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:17.370 align:middle line:84%
Do you not think that
they'll be far better suited

00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:20.450 align:middle line:84%
to find a partner
or a matching lover

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:22.309 align:middle line:90%
or a life partner at that stage?

00:31:22.309 --> 00:31:24.100 align:middle line:84%
You'll also understand
that that might just

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:25.560 align:middle line:90%
be a transient phase.

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:29.520 align:middle line:84%
It is a higher consciousness
philosophy, this.

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:32.730 align:middle line:84%
So crimes of passion
will change dramatically.

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:35.954 align:middle line:84%
And what about
crimes of insanity?

00:31:35.954 --> 00:31:37.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's another one
that I get often asked.

00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:40.290 align:middle line:84%
Crimes of passion and
crimes of insanity.

00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And the answer to that
is, well, insanity

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:45.360 align:middle line:84%
could be classified
as a disease, right?

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:46.625 align:middle line:90%
There's something wrong.

00:31:46.625 --> 00:31:49.790 align:middle line:84%
There's an imbalance in
your body if you go insane

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:53.030 align:middle line:84%
and you do things based on
the chemical or physiological

00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:53.830 align:middle line:90%
imbalance.

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:57.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, we already know that
we can cure all disease.

00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:01.030 align:middle line:84%
So if we can define crimes
of insanity as a disease,

00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:04.940 align:middle line:84%
then we'll be able to sort
that out, even genetically.

00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:06.690 align:middle line:84%
We'll be able to
sort it out in ways

00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:08.870 align:middle line:90%
that we can't imagine today.

00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:14.000 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of these things can
be answered with the answer

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.590 align:middle line:84%
that money is actually
the root cause

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:20.590 align:middle line:84%
of these crimes of passion and
crimes of insanity as well.

00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't have
enough money today,

00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:24.450 align:middle line:90%
it's not going to be solved.

00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:28.700 align:middle line:84%
But in the new system where
money is no hurdle to progress

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:33.710 align:middle line:84%
or to invention or creation or
healing, everything changes.

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:38.420 align:middle line:84%
Even these two areas that
are a little bit more

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:41.620 align:middle line:84%
fluffy around the edges
that the communities

00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:43.560 align:middle line:84%
are going to have to
deal with themselves.

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:47.820 align:middle line:84%
For example, how are we going
to deal with punishment,

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:51.675 align:middle line:84%
dealing out punishment to
people in our communities

00:32:51.675 --> 00:32:56.150 align:middle line:84%
that break the law or break
whatever guidelines we've set?

00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:57.570 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:32:57.570 --> 00:32:58.960 align:middle line:90%
I don't need to answer that.

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:02.132 align:middle line:84%
The community will decide
through the council of elders.

00:33:02.132 --> 00:33:04.340 align:middle line:84%
This is what's going to
happen, right there and then.

00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:06.710 align:middle line:84%
Every community will
have its own set of laws.

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And every community might
have very different laws

00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:10.600 align:middle line:90%
to what we have today.

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:15.465 align:middle line:84%
Or that town over there will
have far more strict guidelines

00:33:15.465 --> 00:33:18.320 align:middle line:84%
if you accidentally
kill somebody or murder

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:21.072 align:middle line:84%
somebody on purpose,
which I think

00:33:21.072 --> 00:33:23.280 align:middle line:84%
is going to fly out the
window in any case, that kind

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:24.700 align:middle line:90%
of behavior.

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:26.250 align:middle line:84%
But if something
like that happens,

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:30.170 align:middle line:84%
they might have far stricter
rules and way to deal with it

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:32.020 align:middle line:90%
that our town does.

00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:34.070 align:middle line:84%
Who knows how this
is going to happen?

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:35.550 align:middle line:84%
But this is all
part of the growth

00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:37.580 align:middle line:84%
and moving into this
higher consciousness,

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:40.020 align:middle line:84%
and embracing our
own responsibility

00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:42.740 align:middle line:84%
towards the people
in our communities,

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:46.500 align:middle line:84%
and then creating the
guidelines and the structures

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:51.140 align:middle line:84%
within which we then co-exist,
and co-exist by choice, not

00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:52.230 align:middle line:90%
by force.

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:56.350 align:middle line:84%
Today, we exist in the system
by force, not by choice.

00:33:56.350 --> 00:34:00.660 align:middle line:84%
No obstacles or any
hurdles to any progress.

00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:03.350 align:middle line:90%
So our plan of action.

00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:06.700 align:middle line:84%
This is where we start
getting to the exciting part.

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:09.482 align:middle line:84%
How are we going to
get from here to there?

00:34:09.482 --> 00:34:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's what everybody
always wants to know.

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:11.699 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:34:11.699 --> 00:34:12.020 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:12.820 align:middle line:90%
It's a great idea.

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:15.230 align:middle line:84%
OK, now how do we get
from here to there?

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:18.199 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's not going
to happen overnight,

00:34:18.199 --> 00:34:21.790 align:middle line:84%
but that doesn't mean it's
going to take a long time.

00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:23.179 align:middle line:90%
It is a journey.

00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:26.610 align:middle line:84%
It's a journey of discovery,
a growth in consciousness,

00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:31.679 align:middle line:84%
a growth in unity, a
growth in trust and vision,

00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:35.350 align:middle line:84%
applying yourself to the vision,
and getting off our asses

00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:36.860 align:middle line:90%
and doing something.

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:40.050 align:middle line:84%
So it begins, this
journey needs to begin.

00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:42.760 align:middle line:84%
The good news is that the
journey has begun already.

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:44.710 align:middle line:90%
We're already doing it.

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:49.130 align:middle line:84%
Many communities have
started doing amazing things,

00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:52.940 align:middle line:84%
and developing not just
self-sustaining aspects,

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:55.090 align:middle line:90%
but an abundance aspect.

00:34:55.090 --> 00:35:00.310 align:middle line:84%
So our plan of action works
on both community level

00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:02.010 align:middle line:90%
and a political level.

00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And this is very important
to come to terms with.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:10.920 align:middle line:84%
To engage communities and
convert our communities

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:14.860 align:middle line:84%
from the capitalist-driven
system we find ourselves

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:19.670 align:middle line:84%
in today into communities
where everybody contributes

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:21.560 align:middle line:84%
their God-given talents
or their acquired

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:24.560 align:middle line:84%
skills for the greatest benefit
of everyone in the community

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:30.260 align:middle line:84%
is something that is going to
require a transitional phase.

00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And the moment we start
creating abundance for ourselves

00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:37.980 align:middle line:84%
in these communities, the moment
that community projects take

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:41.410 align:middle line:84%
off and they start
threatening the establishment,

00:35:41.410 --> 00:35:43.830 align:middle line:84%
the current establishment,
they'll send them

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:46.290 align:middle line:90%
in with guns to shut you down.

00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:48.700 align:middle line:84%
This is really
important to realize.

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:51.750 align:middle line:84%
So we need to create
a political platform

00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:56.080 align:middle line:84%
to help protect and enforce
the rights of these communities

00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:58.460 align:middle line:84%
to be able to continue
doing what they're

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:01.600 align:middle line:84%
doing for themselves without
the threat of the colored

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.970 align:middle line:84%
current political regime
or the armed forces

00:36:03.970 --> 00:36:07.020 align:middle line:84%
that they control from
coming in and shutting down

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:10.110 align:middle line:84%
what we're creating in
abundance for ourselves.

00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:12.180 align:middle line:84%
It really starts with
understanding that we

00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:14.790 align:middle line:90%
can't change the large cities.

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:17.210 align:middle line:84%
To go into the large cities
and metropolitan areas

00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:20.100 align:middle line:90%
and start this is not possible.

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:23.100 align:middle line:84%
So let's go fish
where the fish are.

00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:27.150 align:middle line:84%
Let's create a model that
is workable and manageable,

00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:29.150 align:middle line:90%
that we know we can achieve.

00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And that starts with the
small towns and villages.

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.810 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot easier to
reach all the people

00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:36.670 align:middle line:84%
in a small town and a small
village, share the philosophy,

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:38.340 align:middle line:84%
share the plan of
action with them,

00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:41.530 align:middle line:84%
and then let's start working
together to implement this.

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:44.990 align:middle line:84%
So the whole Ubuntu
Contributionism model

00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:47.810 align:middle line:84%
is based on working with
small towns and villages,

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:52.040 align:middle line:84%
starting there, and planting
the seeds of this philosophy

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.370 align:middle line:84%
and this consciousness
into those small towns

00:36:54.370 --> 00:36:55.600 align:middle line:90%
and communities.

00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And let those people
embrace it, and start

00:36:57.610 --> 00:37:00.930 align:middle line:84%
by creating what I call
critical community projects.

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:02.620 align:middle line:84%
And the critical
community projects

00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:04.870 align:middle line:84%
are obviously the
things we need.

00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:10.360 align:middle line:84%
Energy, water, food, housing,
arts, recreation, health care,

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:11.200 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.270 align:middle line:90%
Everything comes from there.

00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:16.630 align:middle line:84%
The foundation cornerstones
of our society, our community,

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:18.120 align:middle line:90%
of our basic needs.

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:20.760 align:middle line:84%
So-called Maslow's
hierarchy right except this

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:21.770 align:middle line:90%
is not a hierarchy.

00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:24.460 align:middle line:84%
This is the foundational
cornerstones

00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:29.520 align:middle line:84%
of a united community, not
a hierarchical community.

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:31.060 align:middle line:84%
So that's what
we've got to do, is

00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:34.760 align:middle line:84%
start creating community
projects in all these areas,

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:35.930 align:middle line:90%
and beyond.

00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And this is where it becomes
really important to start

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:42.750 align:middle line:84%
understanding the difference
between what we're promoting

00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:46.770 align:middle line:84%
here or proposing here, and what
has happened many, many times

00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:47.900 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:52.390 align:middle line:84%
We are not proposing creating
sustainable communities.

00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:54.330 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
creating communities

00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:57.200 align:middle line:84%
of abundance, of
infinite abundance,

00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:59.290 align:middle line:90%
and there's a huge difference.

00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:02.599 align:middle line:84%
Just the word sustainable
community smells of,

00:38:02.599 --> 00:38:04.140 align:middle line:84%
well, we're just
hanging on for life.

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:05.330 align:middle line:90%
We're just sustaining ourselves.

00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:05.810 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:08.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be in a
community that just hangs on

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:11.040 align:middle line:84%
for life and somehow,
by hook or by crook,

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:12.570 align:middle line:90%
sustains itself, right?

00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:13.370 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:15.440 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to
sustain ourselves.

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:17.360 align:middle line:84%
We live on a planet
of abundance,

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:19.710 align:middle line:84%
and our abilities
and our talents

00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:21.890 align:middle line:90%
are of infinite abundance.

00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we can create
infinite abundance, no matter

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:26.340 align:middle line:90%
how small the community is.

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:30.450 align:middle line:84%
We were talking about Zimbabwe
earlier before we started here.

00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:32.980 align:middle line:84%
Zimbabwe used to be the
breadbasket of Africa.

00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:34.600 align:middle line:84%
Zimbabwe used to
grow so much food,

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:37.950 align:middle line:84%
they used to export it to the
whole of Africa and beyond.

00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:39.910 align:middle line:84%
And today, it's
completely destroyed

00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:43.160 align:middle line:84%
by the current political
regime that's taken over,

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:45.200 align:middle line:84%
what, 35 years ago
now, or whatever it is.

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's staggering how
the hard participation

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.260 align:middle line:84%
of the people in a country,
in a part of the world that

00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:59.000 align:middle line:84%
was so fruitful, that was
so productive, how that

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.180 align:middle line:90%
can be destroyed by politics.

00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:05.340 align:middle line:84%
And once again, we know by
now, that's not by accident.

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:06.850 align:middle line:90%
It's by design.

00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:08.890 align:middle line:84%
It's not that the
politicians are

00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:10.351 align:middle line:84%
incapable of
running the country,

00:39:10.351 --> 00:39:12.350 align:middle line:84%
or they just don't know
how to deal with things.

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:13.210 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:15.410 align:middle line:84%
It's very specifically
by design.

00:39:15.410 --> 00:39:18.350 align:middle line:84%
Degrading the people's
lives, because we're not

00:39:18.350 --> 00:39:19.280 align:middle line:90%
supposed to be happy.

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:20.780 align:middle line:84%
We're not supposed
to be prosperous.

00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:22.960 align:middle line:84%
We're not supposed to
have everything we need,

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.610 align:middle line:90%
because then we are happy.

00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And if we have everything we
need, we can't be controlled.

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:30.250 align:middle line:90%
So this is why.

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:32.724 align:middle line:84%
It's not creating
self-sustaining communities.

00:39:32.724 --> 00:39:34.390 align:middle line:84%
We're creating
communities of abundance.

00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:38.000 align:middle line:84%
There are thousands of
sustaining or self-sustained

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.820 align:middle line:84%
communities around the
world, or at least hundreds.

00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:41.620 align:middle line:90%
Hundreds.

00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And what effect have these
self-sustaining communities

00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:45.930 align:middle line:90%
had on the world?

00:39:45.930 --> 00:39:46.730 align:middle line:90%
Zero.

00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:47.680 align:middle line:90%
Zero effect.

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:50.910 align:middle line:84%
They've only helped the people
inside those communities.

00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:53.360 align:middle line:84%
A self-sustained
community, in essence,

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:58.360 align:middle line:84%
is a really bad example of
what we should be doing.

00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:00.530 align:middle line:84%
It's just a bigger
version of me, me, me.

00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:01.330 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:02.630 align:middle line:90%
Now it's us, us, us.

00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:04.157 align:middle line:90%
Don't climb over our walls.

00:40:04.157 --> 00:40:05.740 align:middle line:84%
You're not invited
into our community.

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:07.198 align:middle line:84%
We're just looking
after ourselves.

00:40:07.198 --> 00:40:08.560 align:middle line:90%
Screw everybody else.

00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:11.160 align:middle line:84%
So we're not proposing
self-sustained communities

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:11.960 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:14.270 align:middle line:84%
It's the antithesis of
what we're doing here.

00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:18.270 align:middle line:84%
Our community, the first
community of this kind

00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:23.920 align:middle line:84%
will have an infinitely profound
effect on everyone around them,

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:26.030 align:middle line:84%
all the towns and
villages around them,

00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:29.630 align:middle line:84%
and the country around them,
and the neighboring countries,

00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:32.690 align:middle line:84%
and the whole knock on
quantum domino effect.

00:40:32.690 --> 00:40:37.970 align:middle line:84%
Not just a domino effect that
happens like dominoes fall.

00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:40.510 align:middle line:90%
But it'll happen quantumly.

00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:43.100 align:middle line:84%
It'll happen all over the
world at the same time,

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:45.240 align:middle line:90%
once it happens in one place.

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:49.700 align:middle line:84%
That's how powerful the system
is once we get it into place.

00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And this is why it's taken so
long to get off the ground.

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:55.720 align:middle line:84%
It is a huge shift
in our reality,

00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:58.499 align:middle line:84%
and that's why it's so
difficult to achieve.

00:40:58.499 --> 00:41:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And people often write
to me and say, oh, I

00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:02.290 align:middle line:84%
want to come and live in
your Ubuntu community.

00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:02.950 align:middle line:90%
And, hold on.

00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:03.800 align:middle line:90%
Whoa, whoa.

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:05.710 align:middle line:84%
There is no Ubuntu
community anywhere

00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:08.370 align:middle line:84%
in the world of this kind
that we're describing.

00:41:08.370 --> 00:41:10.980 align:middle line:84%
If it was, it would already
be affecting the world

00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:12.270 align:middle line:90%
and changing the world.

00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:13.380 align:middle line:90%
We are working on it.

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:15.830 align:middle line:84%
We are laying the foundation,
allowing the people

00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:18.300 align:middle line:84%
to visualize it,
understand how it works,

00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:20.920 align:middle line:84%
what it is we're doing, how
we're going to implement this.

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:24.110 align:middle line:84%
Because when we do, it's
the end of capitalism.

00:41:24.110 --> 00:41:26.820 align:middle line:84%
The moment we achieve this
in one little town or one

00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:28.165 align:middle line:90%
little village, that's it.

00:41:28.165 --> 00:41:29.920 align:middle line:84%
That's really what
we're striving for.

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's what this
workshop is all about.

00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:34.160 align:middle line:84%
So millions of people
around the world

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:37.480 align:middle line:84%
can take this information
in, absorb it, digest it,

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:38.700 align:middle line:90%
internalize it, and go, OK.

00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:39.500 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:40.420 align:middle line:90%
It can be done.

00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:41.420 align:middle line:90%
Let's go for it.

00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:43.410 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're doing here.

00:41:43.410 --> 00:41:49.140 align:middle line:84%
Creating, laying the foundation
for communities of abundance.

00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:51.200 align:middle line:10%
Now there are
certain things that

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:54.450 align:middle line:10%
have happened in South Africa
as interesting examples.

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:57.920 align:middle line:84%
First of all, South Africa went
from one of the most prosperous

00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:59.640 align:middle line:84%
countries in the
world-- the moment

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:02.072 align:middle line:84%
the ANC government took
over, it started completely

00:42:02.072 --> 00:42:03.030 align:middle line:90%
destroying the country.

00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:05.600 align:middle line:84%
Today, everything we
had that was working

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:08.460 align:middle line:90%
is broken down and destroyed.

00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:12.370 align:middle line:84%
Ask anyone, and they'll
tell you their own story.

00:42:12.370 --> 00:42:13.650 align:middle line:90%
And it's just spectacular.

00:42:13.650 --> 00:42:17.600 align:middle line:84%
From having five-star
sporting facilities,

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:20.470 align:middle line:84%
recreational centers,
they're lying in ruin.

00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:23.000 align:middle line:90%
Actually physically broken down.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.710 align:middle line:84%
Not just standing
there, not working.

00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:26.600 align:middle line:90%
Physically broken down.

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:29.650 align:middle line:84%
So many towns are
completely run down,

00:42:29.650 --> 00:42:32.460 align:middle line:84%
and the current municipalities
are just stealing the money.

00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:35.442 align:middle line:84%
Every municipality gets
money from government

00:42:35.442 --> 00:42:36.650 align:middle line:90%
to run the town with.

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And they're just
stealing the money,

00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:40.940 align:middle line:84%
using it for their own personal
use, buying houses and cars,

00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:43.420 align:middle line:90%
and nothing reaches the people.

00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:47.050 align:middle line:84%
So there have been some towns
that have had enough of this.

00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:49.330 align:middle line:84%
There's no service
delivery whatsoever.

00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:51.510 align:middle line:84%
So people have pooled
together, and they've said,

00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:54.200 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to pay any
more money to the municipality.

00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:56.100 align:middle line:84%
Because whatever
money we pay over,

00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:58.720 align:middle line:84%
it just gets stolen
and misappropriated.

00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:02.380 align:middle line:84%
So let's start pooling our money
and put it into a community

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:04.620 align:middle line:84%
trust fund, and use
the money that we

00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:07.310 align:middle line:84%
pay every month to actually
upgrade our own towns.

00:43:07.310 --> 00:43:10.240 align:middle line:84%
And there have been at least
one or two such examples

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:12.680 align:middle line:84%
in South Africa where towns
have done this, and done

00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:14.890 align:middle line:90%
this reasonably successfully.

00:43:14.890 --> 00:43:17.540 align:middle line:84%
So I'm suggesting that
under extreme conditions,

00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:19.040 align:middle line:90%
that is an option.

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:22.350 align:middle line:84%
So the next step by
step plan of action

00:43:22.350 --> 00:43:25.450 align:middle line:84%
is really to talk about
that kind of approach.

00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:27.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying this is
the perfect approach,

00:43:27.570 --> 00:43:30.090 align:middle line:84%
but in desperate
situations, this

00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:31.677 align:middle line:90%
is what people can resort to.

00:43:31.677 --> 00:43:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't have
to be in South Africa.

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:36.660 align:middle line:84%
It can be in the USA, and
there are many small towns

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:39.790 align:middle line:84%
that are equally mismanaged
here, as they are anywhere else

00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:40.590 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:43:40.590 --> 00:43:42.980 align:middle line:84%
There are people
who've just had enough.

00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:45.060 align:middle line:10%
So take control of your town.

00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:46.790 align:middle line:10%
Appoint a council of elders.

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:48.120 align:middle line:10%
And this is the key thing.

00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:50.810 align:middle line:10%
The council of elders
is a key aspect

00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:53.860 align:middle line:10%
of creating these new
communities of abundance.

00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:58.690 align:middle line:84%
Because you have to have trusted
members of your community

00:43:58.690 --> 00:44:01.230 align:middle line:84%
that everybody trusts
that make the decisions

00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:05.510 align:middle line:84%
for your community, the
decisions that benefit

00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:07.570 align:middle line:90%
everyone, and not individuals.

00:44:07.570 --> 00:44:08.960 align:middle line:84%
So the council of
elders-- and we

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:10.880 align:middle line:84%
suggest everything
that we do, we

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:12.762 align:middle line:84%
base on sacred
geometry, obviously,

00:44:12.762 --> 00:44:13.720 align:middle line:90%
and the flow of nature.

00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:19.580 align:middle line:84%
So we suggest that as in ancient
cultures, the tribal of elders

00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:23.260 align:middle line:84%
or the tribal council, same
thing, council of elders,

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:26.680 align:middle line:84%
the wise and respected and
trusted people in the community

00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:29.660 align:middle line:84%
that are appointed by
the community members

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:32.950 align:middle line:84%
with open votes,
so everybody knows

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:36.240 align:middle line:84%
who voted for that member
of the council of elders.

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:39.530 align:middle line:84%
So if Michael, if
I vote for John,

00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:41.300 align:middle line:84%
my brother, and
everybody knows that John

00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:43.884 align:middle line:84%
is a crook and a
thief, then everyone's

00:44:43.884 --> 00:44:45.300 align:middle line:84%
going to say,
Michael, why are you

00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:47.660 align:middle line:84%
appointing your brother
who's a crook and a thief

00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:48.740 align:middle line:90%
to the council of elders?

00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:51.660 align:middle line:84%
So I've exposed my
motive, haven't I.

00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:54.530 align:middle line:84%
So it becomes a very
transparent process

00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:57.720 align:middle line:84%
of appointing respected
members of your community

00:44:57.720 --> 00:44:59.740 align:middle line:90%
that everybody trusts.

00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And they then make the decisions
that are best for everyone.

00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:05.800 align:middle line:10%
So appoint a council of
elders, a representative body

00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:06.910 align:middle line:10%
of the community.

00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:08.630 align:middle line:10%
Take over the
management of the town.

00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:09.430 align:middle line:10%
Simple as that.

00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:11.740 align:middle line:10%
Great a community bank
account, a trust account.

00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:14.910 align:middle line:84%
Control the collective
payment of all your accounts.

00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:17.550 align:middle line:90%
Electricity, everything.

00:45:17.550 --> 00:45:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And you might come up with
a different plan, you know?

00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:22.135 align:middle line:84%
Everybody might have to
pay a little bit more,

00:45:22.135 --> 00:45:23.430 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:25.465 align:middle line:10%
Identify critical
community projects.

00:45:25.465 --> 00:45:27.340 align:middle line:10%
Then you activate the
projects with the funds

00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:28.720 align:middle line:10%
from this community account.

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually start
this process already,

00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:34.410 align:middle line:84%
just by taking control
of your own town

00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:36.200 align:middle line:90%
under the current conditions.

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:37.930 align:middle line:84%
There's another
interesting thing

00:45:37.930 --> 00:45:40.390 align:middle line:84%
that just happened
recently in South Africa,

00:45:40.390 --> 00:45:42.890 align:middle line:84%
where in the town
of Oudtshoorn, which

00:45:42.890 --> 00:45:44.720 align:middle line:84%
became famous in the
'20s and the '30s

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:47.300 align:middle line:84%
for the ostrich barons-- they
became some of the wealthiest

00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:48.280 align:middle line:90%
people in the world.

00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:49.980 align:middle line:84%
They supplied all
the ostrich feathers

00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:52.570 align:middle line:84%
to Hollywood and all the
shows around the world.

00:45:52.570 --> 00:45:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And they just suddenly-- nobody
knew why they were so rich.

00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And they left behind
these huge mansions

00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:59.530 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of
the Karoo Desert,

00:45:59.530 --> 00:46:02.930 align:middle line:84%
with these huge problems and
these ostrich baron houses,

00:46:02.930 --> 00:46:04.760 align:middle line:90%
the mansions that are there.

00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:07.390 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, the town of Oudtshoorn,
the DA, the Democratic

00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:09.390 align:middle line:84%
Alliance, which is the
opposition party in South

00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:13.970 align:middle line:84%
Africa, overthrew the
ANC, the ruling party,

00:46:13.970 --> 00:46:17.110 align:middle line:90%
through a vote of no confidence.

00:46:17.110 --> 00:46:19.930 align:middle line:84%
And I suddenly went,
oh, my goodness.

00:46:19.930 --> 00:46:24.930 align:middle line:84%
If the DA can do that, the
Ubuntu party can do that.

00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
we are sitting already

00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:31.990 align:middle line:84%
on a pile of gold
in our little town.

00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:35.470 align:middle line:84%
We can actually overthrow
the current municipality

00:46:35.470 --> 00:46:38.240 align:middle line:84%
and the mayor with a
vote of no confidence.

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:39.140 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:41.970 align:middle line:84%
Because more than
two years ago now,

00:46:41.970 --> 00:46:46.430 align:middle line:84%
we started the process of a
petition of putting pressure

00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:50.140 align:middle line:84%
on the municipality and asking
them to provide certain things,

00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:53.320 align:middle line:84%
to provide services to upgrade
the sporting facilities,

00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:54.860 align:middle line:90%
and a whole number of things.

00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:57.240 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't respond,
so we created a petition.

00:46:57.240 --> 00:47:00.140 align:middle line:84%
In that petition, we call on
the mayor to do several things,

00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:04.200 align:middle line:84%
and that he has to
respond, and that the mayor

00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:06.890 align:middle line:84%
and the municipality may not
stand in the way of the people

00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:08.430 align:middle line:90%
to achieve these goals.

00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And we list 24 community
projects, a whole variety

00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:14.660 align:middle line:84%
of them, and these
projects actually

00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:17.740 align:middle line:84%
make the foundation of the
plan of action of the community

00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:18.780 align:middle line:90%
projects.

00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:23.390 align:middle line:84%
And we say that we reserve
the right to take legal action

00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:26.160 align:middle line:84%
if the municipality and
the mayor do not respond,

00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:30.640 align:middle line:84%
or if they prevent us in any
way to achieve these goals.

00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:34.590 align:middle line:84%
We have 3,500 signed
petitions in our little town,

00:47:34.590 --> 00:47:39.410 align:middle line:84%
which has less than
3,000 registered voters.

00:47:39.410 --> 00:47:40.510 align:middle line:90%
It's just amazing.

00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And I just suddenly
realized that we

00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:46.700 align:middle line:84%
can overthrow the municipality
if I take this to court.

00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:51.490 align:middle line:84%
The mayor has not responded
or performed on the task

00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:54.990 align:middle line:84%
that the people handed
him in any way whatsoever.

00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:57.280 align:middle line:84%
So I'm saying that
this is a plan.

00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.910 align:middle line:84%
But we don't want to
pursue this plan right now.

00:47:59.910 --> 00:48:04.910 align:middle line:84%
We want to go into the elections
in 2016, and the plan of action

00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:07.590 align:middle line:84%
has changed
dramatically from what

00:48:07.590 --> 00:48:10.610 align:middle line:84%
we've learned in the political
arena in South Africa.

00:48:10.610 --> 00:48:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And this new plan applies
not just for South Africa.

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:15.840 align:middle line:84%
It applies to the USA,
for Canada, for the UK,

00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:21.030 align:middle line:84%
for Australia, for Germany,
Austria, for Slovenia, Croatia.

00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:22.720 align:middle line:84%
Wherever we have
Ubuntu members that

00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:25.910 align:middle line:84%
want to start Ubuntu parties,
the same system applies.

00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:27.590 align:middle line:90%
No longer going for the head.

00:48:27.590 --> 00:48:28.820 align:middle line:90%
We're going for the heel.

00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:31.700 align:middle line:84%
But I'll talk about
that in much more detail

00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:33.260 align:middle line:84%
in the next episode,
because we've

00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:34.930 align:middle line:90%
come to the end of this hour.

00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:38.260 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to engage
you in a few questions

00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:39.614 align:middle line:90%
or answers or some statements.

00:48:39.614 --> 00:48:41.030 align:middle line:84%
I know, Richard,
you had something

00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:44.720 align:middle line:84%
to say about those
questions, the 13 frequently

00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:46.090 align:middle line:90%
asked questions.

00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:48.470 align:middle line:84%
>>Thank you, Michael,
for the 13 questions

00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:51.320 align:middle line:90%
and this whole process here.

00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:53.200 align:middle line:84%
From the audience feedback
during the breaks,

00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:55.100 align:middle line:84%
you're doing a wonderful
job, so thank you.

00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:57.010 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, thank you.

00:48:57.010 --> 00:49:00.800 align:middle line:84%
>>All of those 13 and
continued on page two, three,

00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:03.345 align:middle line:84%
and four questions,
they all come from,

00:49:03.345 --> 00:49:05.674 align:middle line:84%
to use a metaphysical term--
I think it is anyway--

00:49:05.674 --> 00:49:06.840 align:middle line:90%
it's called ground of being.

00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:08.923 align:middle line:84%
In other words, where does
everything in your life

00:49:08.923 --> 00:49:10.220 align:middle line:90%
come from?

00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And all of this comes from
the intellectual, spiritual,

00:49:15.390 --> 00:49:20.430 align:middle line:84%
financial scarcity created
by the money system.

00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:22.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, who's going
to shovel the crap?

00:49:22.110 --> 00:49:25.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, hold on to the
other end of the shovel

00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:27.590 align:middle line:90%
and take care of your horse.

00:49:27.590 --> 00:49:28.846 align:middle line:90%
Don't you love your horse?

00:49:28.846 --> 00:49:30.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you change
dirty diapers.

00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:30.760 align:middle line:90%
You love your kid.

00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:32.510 align:middle line:84%
You just going to leave
the diapers dirty?

00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:34.680 align:middle line:90%
You aren't going to do that.

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:36.950 align:middle line:84%
There's no ground of
being caring, looking out

00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:41.530 align:middle line:84%
for one another, unity, being
part of a greater whole,

00:49:41.530 --> 00:49:45.110 align:middle line:84%
an individual within a
larger whole of individuals.

00:49:45.110 --> 00:49:48.860 align:middle line:84%
It all is borne out from the
ground of being put in place.

00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:51.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the one
that really got me

00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:53.740 align:middle line:84%
was, like, the scientist
creates the thing for cancer,

00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:57.450 align:middle line:84%
and the corporation comes
in and steals it away

00:49:57.450 --> 00:49:59.930 align:middle line:84%
because they don't
want it on the market.

00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:01.620 align:middle line:84%
It could also be
that the scientist

00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:05.154 align:middle line:84%
hoards the information, pulls it
away, and keeps it for himself

00:50:05.154 --> 00:50:06.320 align:middle line:90%
because he wants to publish.

00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:08.110 align:middle line:84%
Because he can't
publish-- therefore,

00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:10.570 align:middle line:84%
get the funding for his next
thing that he wants to do.

00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:14.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's all layer upon layer
upon layer of scarcity--

00:50:14.650 --> 00:50:15.450 align:middle line:90%
>>And control.

00:50:15.450 --> 00:50:16.250 align:middle line:90%
>>And control.

00:50:16.250 --> 00:50:18.676 align:middle line:84%
And the crimes of
passion, people

00:50:18.676 --> 00:50:20.050 align:middle line:84%
are acting out
against the people

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:23.300 align:middle line:84%
they kill because they're being
controlled from somewhere,

00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:25.800 align:middle line:84%
and they don't want--
it's just one more brick

00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:28.140 align:middle line:90%
and one brick too many.

00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And so if you get that stifling
control out of the way,

00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:33.240 align:middle line:84%
you get the stifling
scarcity out

00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:37.645 align:middle line:84%
of the way, the whole
mindset changes, and the lens

00:50:37.645 --> 00:50:38.900 align:middle line:90%
is completely different.

00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:39.700 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:40.780 align:middle line:90%
Changes everything.

00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:43.140 align:middle line:90%
Thanks very much for sharing.

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:46.300 align:middle line:84%
Anybody else want to
say something or raise

00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:47.640 align:middle line:90%
a comment or a question?

00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:48.910 align:middle line:90%
Go for it.

00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:49.710 align:middle line:90%
>>Hi.

00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:51.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jason.

00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:52.970 align:middle line:84%
In regards to the
13 questions, I

00:50:52.970 --> 00:50:56.260 align:middle line:84%
think it'll be an
interesting perspective when

00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:59.160 align:middle line:84%
we're all sitting
in a group and we

00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:01.070 align:middle line:84%
have these questions
asked, I think,

00:51:01.070 --> 00:51:03.320 align:middle line:90%
from a capitalist perspective.

00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:06.160 align:middle line:84%
It's easy to say, well,
I want 20 mansions,

00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:07.280 align:middle line:90%
I want 20 Ferraris.

00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:10.340 align:middle line:84%
But when the group of
people that's sitting here

00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:12.860 align:middle line:84%
is all in the mindset
of Contributionism,

00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:14.840 align:middle line:84%
there's not going to
be one person that

00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:17.990 align:middle line:84%
wants to step up and
say, I want 20 mentions.

00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:19.637 align:middle line:90%
I want 20 Ferraris.

00:51:19.637 --> 00:51:20.970 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to shovel the crap.

00:51:20.970 --> 00:51:23.490 align:middle line:84%
I want everybody
else to do that.

00:51:23.490 --> 00:51:24.990 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
be the perspective

00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:29.140 align:middle line:84%
that you want to hold
yourself in as a person when

00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:31.110 align:middle line:84%
the rest of your
community is contributing

00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:34.180 align:middle line:84%
to your health and
your benefit, and just

00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:38.860 align:middle line:84%
be the one that sits back
and doesn't contribute.

00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:42.010 align:middle line:84%
I think that'll be an
interesting thing that flips,

00:51:42.010 --> 00:51:43.940 align:middle line:84%
and these questions
will start to drop away.

00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:47.550 align:middle line:84%
Jason I think what you
said there also takes us

00:51:47.550 --> 00:51:53.950 align:middle line:84%
to the realization that in
these new paradigm communities,

00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:56.760 align:middle line:84%
our children are not really
our own children anymore.

00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:58.890 align:middle line:84%
The children belong to
the whole community.

00:51:58.890 --> 00:52:01.410 align:middle line:84%
There's no fear of your children
running around and being

00:52:01.410 --> 00:52:04.640 align:middle line:84%
abducted or molested
or going missing,

00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:08.450 align:middle line:84%
or just like-- that doesn't
even enter the equation,

00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:12.140 align:middle line:84%
because it is absolute
paradise for the children.

00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:14.700 align:middle line:84%
They've got so many activities
and so many things going on,

00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:17.012 align:middle line:84%
they're not wandering around
aimlessly in the afternoon

00:52:17.012 --> 00:52:19.470 align:middle line:84%
in the streets because they've
got no money to do anything.

00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:21.930 align:middle line:84%
They can't play soccer because
they don't have a ball.

00:52:21.930 --> 00:52:23.410 align:middle line:84%
They can't play cricket
because they don't have

00:52:23.410 --> 00:52:24.840 align:middle line:90%
a bat or a field to play on.

00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:27.760 align:middle line:84%
Or they can't do anything,
so they're aimlessly

00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:30.530 align:middle line:84%
wandering and
making the best they

00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:33.280 align:middle line:90%
can do with what they've got.

00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:35.700 align:middle line:90%
And that changes completely.

00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:39.200 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, the children's lives
and their activities changes.

00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And parents don't have
to worry about them.

00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:46.970 align:middle line:84%
And the best possible scenario
you can imagine is presented.

00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:49.840 align:middle line:84%
So the way we grow
up and our children

00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:51.530 align:middle line:84%
grow up in these
communities changes

00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:55.550 align:middle line:84%
dramatically,
virtually overnight.

00:52:55.550 --> 00:53:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very important
thing to remind ourselves of.

00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:03.530 align:middle line:90%
Everything changes dramatically.

00:53:03.530 --> 00:53:06.010 align:middle line:84%
Where we live, how we live,
where we choose to live,

00:53:06.010 --> 00:53:08.320 align:middle line:84%
what kind of houses we
live, what kind of cars

00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:12.760 align:middle line:84%
we drive, what kind of petrol
we use, what kind of health care

00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:15.090 align:middle line:84%
we have, where we
go to work, what

00:53:15.090 --> 00:53:20.380 align:middle line:84%
we do in all the spare time
we've got to do all the stuff.

00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:22.110 align:middle line:90%
Everything changes, what we do.

00:53:22.110 --> 00:53:22.910 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:24.243 align:middle line:90%
How we expand our consciousness.

00:53:24.243 --> 00:53:27.300 align:middle line:90%


00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:29.090 align:middle line:84%
What do people do
when they've got

00:53:29.090 --> 00:53:31.050 align:middle line:90%
so much time on their hands.

00:53:31.050 --> 00:53:35.010 align:middle line:84%
They start practicing their
natural creative ability,

00:53:35.010 --> 00:53:38.640 align:middle line:84%
giving expression to
their creative desires

00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:39.660 align:middle line:90%
and their needs.

00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And that leads to a rapid
rise in consciousness.

00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And this is actually
one of the reasons

00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:47.880 align:middle line:84%
why the elite is
making very, very sure

00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:50.050 align:middle line:84%
that we have very little
time to ourselves,

00:53:50.050 --> 00:53:51.450 align:middle line:90%
why we have to work so hard.

00:53:51.450 --> 00:53:53.408 align:middle line:84%
We've got very little
time for arts and culture

00:53:53.408 --> 00:53:55.010 align:middle line:84%
and recreation,
because that allows

00:53:55.010 --> 00:53:57.050 align:middle line:84%
people to rise in
consciousness and raise

00:53:57.050 --> 00:53:58.840 align:middle line:90%
their collective consciousness.

00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And this is why
it's not happening,

00:54:00.590 --> 00:54:03.360 align:middle line:84%
and people now have to have two
or three jobs just to survive.

00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:05.380 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's insane.

00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:07.430 align:middle line:90%
So that changes instantly.

00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And we'll figure out
in the next episode

00:54:10.510 --> 00:54:14.030 align:middle line:84%
how easy it is to transition
from this insanity

00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:15.010 align:middle line:90%
to that insanity.

00:54:15.010 --> 00:54:18.655 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately, it does
happen in small towns.

00:54:18.655 --> 00:54:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's good
for the people that

00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:22.660 align:middle line:84%
like to live in
small towns, and that

00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:24.790 align:middle line:84%
were very happy to
get out of the city.

00:54:24.790 --> 00:54:26.035 align:middle line:90%
I'm one of those.

00:54:26.035 --> 00:54:28.680 align:middle line:84%
I got out the city more
than eight years ago now,

00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:31.390 align:middle line:84%
and there's just no way
I could ever go back.

00:54:31.390 --> 00:54:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think many people,
although they might say,

00:54:34.070 --> 00:54:36.685 align:middle line:84%
I love the city
life, most people

00:54:36.685 --> 00:54:38.560 align:middle line:84%
try to escape to the
country for the weekend.

00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:40.230 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:41.030 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:44.090 align:middle line:84%
So why are you escaping
the city to the country

00:54:44.090 --> 00:54:46.030 align:middle line:84%
if you love the
city life so much?

00:54:46.030 --> 00:54:48.050 align:middle line:84%
So many people have
cottages in the country,

00:54:48.050 --> 00:54:50.050 align:middle line:84%
and they go to their
cottage for a long weekend.

00:54:50.050 --> 00:54:52.660 align:middle line:84%
They can't wait to get to
the cottage out of the city,

00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:55.530 align:middle line:84%
and then they come rushing
back to the insanity again.

00:54:55.530 --> 00:54:57.510 align:middle line:84%
So that changes
completely as well.

00:54:57.510 --> 00:55:00.260 align:middle line:84%
Let's end this episode
here, and come back

00:55:00.260 --> 00:55:04.640 align:middle line:84%
with the exciting path forward
to our freedom, emancipation,

00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:07.390 align:middle line:84%
and a world without money
where everything is possible

00:55:07.390 --> 00:55:11.159 align:middle line:84%
and everybody lives in abundance
beyond our wildest imagination.

00:55:11.159 --> 00:55:12.200 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being here.
