00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.500 align:middle line:10%
>>Hello, and welcome to the
final episode of the Ubuntu

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.960 align:middle line:10%
Contribution workshop,
shot here in location

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.680 align:middle line:10%
at Gaia in Boulder, Colorado.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.190 align:middle line:84%
Over the last two days, we've
shared some amazing philosophy

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.260 align:middle line:84%
about a world without
money and discussed

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.950 align:middle line:90%
the implementation of it.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And in this episode, we're going
to really take this thing home

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.030 align:middle line:84%
and answer any more unfinished
questions that might still

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.050 align:middle line:84%
be lingering in people's minds
or any hesitation that might

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.730 align:middle line:90%
still be alive in your hearts.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.730 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like to
do is to start off

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.380 align:middle line:84%
with by saying to you is please
make a note of what you think

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.310 align:middle line:84%
is possibly the most difficult
or insurmountable hurdle we

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.990 align:middle line:84%
need to cross in a
world without money?

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.760 align:middle line:84%
Or how will this or that work
in this utopian world of ours?

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And remember, utopian
is a good word, right?

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.330 align:middle line:90%
It's not a bad word.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.930 align:middle line:90%
We should use it more often.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.370 align:middle line:84%
And some people say, oh, this
sounds like a utopian idea.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.800 align:middle line:90%
And I say, yeah, it is.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.660 align:middle line:90%
It's a good idea.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:15.460 align:middle line:90%
Utopian.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.390 align:middle line:84%
Let's say it over
and over again.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.590 align:middle line:84%
So come up with what you think
is the most difficult hurdle

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.460 align:middle line:84%
for us to cross in a
world without money

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.250 align:middle line:90%
or how would this possibly work?

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.210 align:middle line:84%
Or how are we going to
solve these problems?

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.970 align:middle line:84%
Because I'd like us to
leave here today with being

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.830 align:middle line:84%
able to answer any
kind of problem

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.850 align:middle line:84%
that we can throw or
imagine in this environment.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.680 align:middle line:84%
What I'd also like
to continue is

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.970 align:middle line:84%
some of the frequently
asked questions

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.210 align:middle line:84%
that we want to revisit and
see if we can answer those

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.650 align:middle line:84%
with a lot more
ease at this stage,

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.530 align:middle line:84%
without me prompting
anybody, so that it actually

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.650 align:middle line:90%
comes from you and not from me.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.180 align:middle line:84%
But before we get
there, let's look

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.420 align:middle line:84%
at a few of the final subjects
that we haven't reached yet.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.950 align:middle line:84%
And just remind us where
we left off previously.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.600 align:middle line:84%
In a world of Ubuntu
and Contributionism,

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.760 align:middle line:84%
once we implement this
ideology and this philosophy

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.480 align:middle line:84%
and this world of abundance
where everything is possible

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.540 align:middle line:84%
because we choose to
do it so, everything

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.440 align:middle line:84%
becomes recyclable,
renewable, and reusable.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And that is a very important
point of departure for us

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.110 align:middle line:84%
here to kickstart
this final episode.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.570 align:middle line:84%
No more pollution, no more
destroying our planet,

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:40.620 align:middle line:84%
no more being forced to live
in metropolitan urban jungles,

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.440 align:middle line:84%
where people have been
really herded and forced

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.820 align:middle line:84%
to live together, mostly
against their will,

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.670 align:middle line:84%
because of social pressures and
circumstances that drove them

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.360 align:middle line:84%
there beyond what normally
would be their choice,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.380 align:middle line:84%
looking for jobs,
looking for careers,

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.590 align:middle line:84%
looking for opportunities
that they can't find out

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.110 align:middle line:84%
in the country where
people would prefer

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.620 align:middle line:90%
to stay more often than not.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.210 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, how do
we include city slickers

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.780 align:middle line:90%
in this philosophy?

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's an interesting
way of looking and trying

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.210 align:middle line:84%
to bring the people that live
in the metropolitan areas

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.610 align:middle line:84%
and urban jungles, how would
they interact and interface

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.580 align:middle line:84%
with these communities
of abundance

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.160 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to start
to create in the small towns

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.850 align:middle line:90%
and villages?

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.150 align:middle line:84%
What happens to the millions of
people that live in the cities?

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is an
interesting thing,

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.570 align:middle line:84%
because the people
that live in the cities

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.720 align:middle line:90%
all have skills and talents.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.270 align:middle line:90%
They are all good at something.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.140 align:middle line:84%
They don't always do
what they're good at,

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.040 align:middle line:84%
but what happens quite often
with people in the cities

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.890 align:middle line:84%
is that they have a cottage
in the country, isn't it?

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And they can't wait
for the long weekend

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.550 align:middle line:84%
so they can get in
their car and escape

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.490 align:middle line:90%
to their cottage in the country.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.920 align:middle line:84%
So just imagine the
scenario, right?

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.640 align:middle line:84%
So you've got a
cottage in the country,

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.980 align:middle line:84%
and you drive out
to your cottage

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.910 align:middle line:84%
in the country on
one long weekend.

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And you suddenly discover
that the town that you've

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.529 align:middle line:84%
got your cottage in has become
a Ubuntu, or a Contributionist

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:18.574 align:middle line:90%
community.

00:04:18.574 --> 00:04:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And the people have their
own supply of electricity.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.100 align:middle line:84%
And you weren't
even aware of this,

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.641 align:middle line:84%
because you haven't been there
for six months, because you've

00:04:24.641 --> 00:04:26.870 align:middle line:84%
been so busy caught up in
the rat race in the city.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.114 align:middle line:84%
And you arrive in
your little town,

00:04:29.114 --> 00:04:31.030 align:middle line:84%
only to find that they've
got their own supply

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.929 align:middle line:90%
of electricity.

00:04:31.929 --> 00:04:34.470 align:middle line:84%
They've got all these community
projects that they've set up.

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.120 align:middle line:84%
And everybody is getting
everything for free,

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.240 align:middle line:84%
because they've set it up
to benefit the community.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And you're a part
of that community,

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.600 align:middle line:90%
because you have a house there.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.540 align:middle line:84%
And they suddenly call
you into the council

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:52.980 align:middle line:84%
of elders or the group that is
managing or guiding that town

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.490 align:middle line:84%
and that community and
say, Michael, listen.

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.910 align:middle line:84%
You're a homeowner here and
you belong to our community,

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.820 align:middle line:84%
so we'd like to tell you
about the latest developments.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.980 align:middle line:84%
And we'd like you to know that
you can benefit from everything

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.410 align:middle line:84%
that we've set up and created
here, but all you have to do

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.300 align:middle line:84%
is participate in one of
the community projects.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.420 align:middle line:90%
What are you going to say?

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.644 align:middle line:90%
What are you going to do?

00:05:11.644 --> 00:05:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And well, the
question is probably

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.880 align:middle line:84%
going to be firstly, if you're
new to this, well, what's

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:16.680 align:middle line:90%
in it for me?

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.650 align:middle line:90%
What do I have to do?

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.212 align:middle line:90%
And what do I get in return?

00:05:19.212 --> 00:05:20.670 align:middle line:84%
Because that's how
we think, right?

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.030 align:middle line:90%
Well, what's in it for me?

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is-- you all
know the answer already, right?

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, you're
going to get free electricity.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And you can run your
household and don't

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.210 align:middle line:84%
worry about paying
electricity ever again.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think everybody will
be pleasantly surprised

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.870 align:middle line:84%
when they get confronted
by that kind of offer.

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:40.670 align:middle line:90%
And say, what?

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:41.260 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so what do I have to
do for that free electricity?

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.380 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is well,
just, these are the projects

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.180 align:middle line:90%
that we've set up.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.679 align:middle line:84%
And all you need
to do is every time

00:05:48.679 --> 00:05:52.390 align:middle line:84%
you come out, spend
three hours per week

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:55.230 align:middle line:84%
in one of these
community projects.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.936 align:middle line:84%
And I think the answer
to that is going

00:05:56.936 --> 00:05:58.060 align:middle line:90%
to be, wow, that's amazing.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.560 align:middle line:90%
And then what else?

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.722 align:middle line:90%
What else?

00:06:00.722 --> 00:06:01.930 align:middle line:90%
Are there any other benefits?

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.550 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is yeah.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.054 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you spend
three hours a week

00:06:07.054 --> 00:06:08.470 align:middle line:84%
in one of the
projects, that means

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.360 align:middle line:84%
that you can get whatever else
we're creating and developing.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.420 align:middle line:84%
That means food and
clean water and we've

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.720 align:middle line:84%
got a textile factory, so
you can get some fabrics

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.500 align:middle line:84%
and you can make
clothing and whatever.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And you start
realizing, hold on.

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:28.270 align:middle line:84%
So I live in the city,
I work like a slave.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, when I come
out to my little cottage

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:36.124 align:middle line:84%
in the country, I can work
for three hours a week

00:06:36.124 --> 00:06:38.040 align:middle line:84%
in these community
projects and I can actually

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:44.280 align:middle line:84%
live for free in my little town
in my cottage in the country.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.957 align:middle line:84%
So the question is going to
start playing on your mind

00:06:47.957 --> 00:06:53.680 align:middle line:84%
as to why am I going to go
back to the city, right?

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.860 align:middle line:84%
So what's going to happen,
I think, as this unfolds,

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.060 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea how
it will unfold.

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.660 align:middle line:84%
But something along
these lines, where

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.410 align:middle line:84%
people are going to escape
to the little cottage

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.460 align:middle line:84%
in the country, and at
some stage they're just

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.680 align:middle line:90%
going to stay there.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.471 align:middle line:84%
They're going to say,
well, why the hell am

00:07:10.471 --> 00:07:11.810 align:middle line:90%
I going to go back to the city?

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:13.050 align:middle line:90%
To do what?

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:15.420 align:middle line:84%
Let me sell my place
in the city-- that's

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.850 align:middle line:84%
if they have a place--
or just give up the rent

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:20.350 align:middle line:84%
and move into my little
cottage in the country

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.209 align:middle line:84%
and live in paradise
and help to contribute

00:07:23.209 --> 00:07:25.000 align:middle line:84%
towards that community,
because I'm already

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.430 align:middle line:90%
getting all the benefits.

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's an interesting
way of looking

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.970 align:middle line:84%
at what will happen to
people in the city moving out

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.110 align:middle line:90%
to the country.

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:38.570 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is people,
young people, that are maybe

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:42.560 align:middle line:84%
not married or individuals that
have got skills and talents,

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.300 align:middle line:84%
working farms have become
quite popular, right?

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.450 align:middle line:84%
People go on holiday
and they no longer just

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.720 align:middle line:84%
want to go on holiday
and become observers

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.470 align:middle line:84%
on a tourist bus looking
at all the people

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:59.490 align:middle line:84%
in their environment, which is
like a really strange voyeur

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:01.380 align:middle line:90%
kind of mentality, right?

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:05.620 align:middle line:90%
And people in a zoo, right?

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:07.800 align:middle line:84%
On a bus looking at the
animals in their homes

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.490 align:middle line:84%
and doing things
while the tourist bus

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.180 align:middle line:90%
goes through your town.

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:14.430 align:middle line:84%
I've always found
that really bizarre.

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:17.940 align:middle line:84%
But so this is why these
working farms have become quite

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.720 align:middle line:90%
a major thing around the world.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.900 align:middle line:84%
People want to go to another
country or a town or a village

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.400 align:middle line:84%
and integrate, become
part of that community,

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.570 align:middle line:90%
and go and do something.

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:28.350 align:middle line:90%
And that's how you meet people.

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:30.860 align:middle line:84%
You get to know about
the community, the people

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:33.184 align:middle line:84%
in the town, and the
village, and understand

00:08:33.184 --> 00:08:34.309 align:middle line:90%
a little bit more about it.

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:35.642 align:middle line:90%
So you actually go do something.

00:08:35.642 --> 00:08:37.900 align:middle line:84%
So that's exactly what
will happen as well.

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.120 align:middle line:84%
So these towns and
communities will

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.809 align:middle line:84%
become like working farms
or working villages,

00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:46.110 align:middle line:84%
where the people in
the city are going

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:49.480 align:middle line:84%
to be given the opportunity
to come out there.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And what are they going
to get in exchange?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.820 align:middle line:84%
Come out for the weekend,
work for three hours in one

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.540 align:middle line:84%
of the community projects,
and you get free accommodation

00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:59.670 align:middle line:90%
and free food.

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:02.740 align:middle line:84%
So that's a win-win situation
for everybody, isn't it?

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:04.170 align:middle line:84%
So slowly but
surely, you're going

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:06.140 align:middle line:84%
to get these city
slickers that work

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:09.290 align:middle line:84%
in offices and
these horrible jobs

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:10.810 align:middle line:90%
that they don't really like.

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And they're going
to start ascribing

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:16.320 align:middle line:84%
more and more to these little
towns all over the place.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.640 align:middle line:84%
And the more of these
little towns there are,

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.990 align:middle line:84%
the more opportunity is
going to be presented

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:23.240 align:middle line:90%
to people that live in cities.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.500 align:middle line:84%
So well, this weekend
I'm going to go

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:25.960 align:middle line:90%
to that little town over there.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.500 align:middle line:84%
Next weekend, I'm
flying over there.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.390 align:middle line:90%
And then I'm going to go there.

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:29.806 align:middle line:84%
And sooner or
later, they're going

00:09:29.806 --> 00:09:33.080 align:middle line:84%
to find a town that they
fall in love with, say wow,

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:33.960 align:middle line:90%
I love this place.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.645 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to go
back to the city.

00:09:35.645 --> 00:09:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to be
given an opportunity.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:38.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, you don't have
to go back to the city.

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:40.260 align:middle line:90%
You can stay in our community.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.370 align:middle line:90%
Just contribute to the projects.

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:46.980 align:middle line:84%
So this is how I think,
something like this,

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:50.920 align:middle line:84%
we will start getting the
people to leave the cities

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:54.280 align:middle line:84%
and feel free to go
integrate into small towns

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.110 align:middle line:84%
and small communities,
because of the opportunities

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:59.320 align:middle line:90%
that naturally get presented.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And they will bring their
own set of talents and skills

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:06.080 align:middle line:84%
to that community that
will automatically benefit

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.770 align:middle line:90%
the people in that community.

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:10.390 align:middle line:90%
So everybody benefits.

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:14.294 align:middle line:84%
It is a win-win
situation for everyone.

00:10:14.294 --> 00:10:16.210 align:middle line:84%
There will be other
things that happen that we

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:18.300 align:middle line:90%
can't predict right now.

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.130 align:middle line:90%
And that's the beauty of this.

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:22.370 align:middle line:90%
It is that unknown factor.

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:25.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's what makes
it even more exciting.

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And this will only be
exposed and show itself

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:33.600 align:middle line:84%
once we start actually doing
this in these communities.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.085 align:middle line:84%
That's when it
becomes so exciting.

00:10:36.085 --> 00:10:39.420 align:middle line:84%
So another interesting
area of opportunity

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:43.460 align:middle line:84%
is in countries that have
tribal leaders and tribal lands.

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And that includes the United
States, Canada, South Africa,

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:50.190 align:middle line:84%
Australia, and other
parts of the world,

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:53.500 align:middle line:84%
South America, countries
that have tribal leaders

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.140 align:middle line:90%
and tribal lands.

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.120 align:middle line:84%
Because many of
these tribal leaders

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.670 align:middle line:84%
have already been under
attack by their governments.

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:02.400 align:middle line:84%
Their land is
constantly being stolen,

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.380 align:middle line:84%
they are under constant threat
of their tribal land being

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:08.200 align:middle line:84%
taken away from them,
and d being bribed

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.590 align:middle line:90%
and cheated out of their land.

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And especially in
South Africa, where

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:18.190 align:middle line:84%
there are around 200 tribal
lands and tribal chiefs

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:22.600 align:middle line:84%
and tribal leaders, many of them
have been bribed and corrupted

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.910 align:middle line:90%
by the government.

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
loss of this tribal land

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:29.750 align:middle line:84%
that the government
has really stolen

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:31.650 align:middle line:90%
from these tribal leaders.

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:34.630 align:middle line:84%
But many of them are
wise to this activity

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:35.430 align:middle line:90%
of the government.

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:37.263 align:middle line:84%
And they are holding
onto their tribal land.

00:11:37.263 --> 00:11:40.500 align:middle line:84%
But it's not easy, because
many of these tribal chiefs

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.430 align:middle line:90%
and leaders are very poor.

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:44.620 align:middle line:90%
They're very poor individuals.

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.410 align:middle line:90%
And they have very little.

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:49.176 align:middle line:84%
And in most
instances, their lands

00:11:49.176 --> 00:11:50.800 align:middle line:84%
have been destroyed
by the government--

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:54.580 align:middle line:84%
again, by design, to
force the people to leave

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:57.920 align:middle line:84%
the tribal lands to move to
the cities in search of jobs.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's when they
get stuck and trapped

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:03.430 align:middle line:84%
in those metropolitan
jungles and become slaves

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:04.920 align:middle line:90%
to the system.

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:08.000 align:middle line:84%
So the tribal leaders
are more and more

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.390 align:middle line:84%
increasingly losing people
from the tribal lands that

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:14.510 align:middle line:84%
are leaving because
there's very little to do

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:17.637 align:middle line:84%
and they have no idea how to
solve that problem they haven't

00:12:17.637 --> 00:12:19.470 align:middle line:84%
figured this out, that
we've discussed here,

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:22.370 align:middle line:84%
how easy it is when you start
working together, right?

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And so they are losing people,
especially young people

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:26.940 align:middle line:90%
are being lured to the cities.

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And they're becoming
leaders to nobody.

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And all this tribal land--
the most beautiful land

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.530 align:middle line:90%
that you can imagine.

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:36.080 align:middle line:84%
So many of these
leaders have now

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.450 align:middle line:84%
been finding out
about what we're

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:41.270 align:middle line:84%
doing with Ubuntu and this
philosophy and they love it,

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:44.850 align:middle line:84%
because they realize that this
can save their tribal lands

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:47.540 align:middle line:84%
and help bring the people
back to their communities

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:52.090 align:middle line:84%
to start participating in
this collective, cooperative

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:55.540 align:middle line:84%
structure to bring abundance to
the people in the tribal lands

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.840 align:middle line:90%
and reactivate the tribal lands.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:01.110 align:middle line:84%
So this is a really
interesting opportunity,

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:03.520 align:middle line:84%
because also in
the tribal lands,

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.910 align:middle line:84%
it's the chief that
makes the final decision.

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.400 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
ask permission.

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.290 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
win an election.

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:11.260 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
go to the polls.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.410 align:middle line:84%
You just have an
agreement with the chief

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:17.049 align:middle line:84%
and the tribal leaders say
this is what we'd like to do.

00:13:17.049 --> 00:13:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And then the chief
can call a meeting

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:21.320 align:middle line:84%
of all the elders and
the headmen and say,

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.870 align:middle line:90%
this is what I propose we do.

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And I must tell you
that at this stage,

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:28.710 align:middle line:84%
there are probably around
12 tribal leaders in South

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:33.300 align:middle line:84%
Africa that have either
requested a meeting with me

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:36.140 align:middle line:84%
and I've already met with
one or two or three of them.

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:38.450 align:middle line:84%
The interest is
growing so quickly

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:40.420 align:middle line:90%
that I'm absolutely amazed.

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.070 align:middle line:84%
I believe the same
can happen in the USA,

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:47.920 align:middle line:84%
in the Native American
tribal lands, and Canada,

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.680 align:middle line:84%
and Australia, and South
American countries,

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:52.910 align:middle line:84%
wherever there are still
tribal leaders that

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:58.130 align:middle line:84%
hold on to the pride of
their natural custodianship.

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:00.090 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to just
leave that there,

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:02.210 align:middle line:84%
because this is an
evolving process.

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:04.310 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that's in development.

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:08.870 align:middle line:84%
Obviously it's going to
require money and funding,

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:12.630 align:middle line:84%
setting up the community
projects in those tribal lands,

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:14.450 align:middle line:84%
because those people
are all very poor.

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:16.380 align:middle line:84%
These are the poorest
of the poor people.

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:17.510 align:middle line:90%
They have very little.

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:19.410 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be an
interesting challenge.

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:21.440 align:middle line:90%
But we'll see how this unfolds.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And this is possibly
where international

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.630 align:middle line:84%
or global crowdfunding
could come into play.

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:31.940 align:middle line:84%
Or this is where you can find
these conscious millionaires

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:33.710 align:middle line:90%
or billionaires that say, wow.

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:37.850 align:middle line:84%
I want to help this tribal,
this traditional chief here,

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:41.810 align:middle line:84%
and come and put some money into
setting up these projects that

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:46.020 align:middle line:84%
really start to help the people
in these very, very rural areas

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:49.000 align:middle line:84%
and create those pockets
of abundance that

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.810 align:middle line:84%
start to affect all the other
tribal lands around them.

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:54.470 align:middle line:84%
There's quite a
lot of stuff that

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:58.520 align:middle line:84%
needs to be done to really
take the ownership back.

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.310 align:middle line:84%
For example, one
of the suggestions

00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:03.910 align:middle line:84%
I've made to the
one chief is that we

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:07.410 align:middle line:84%
make signs, little billboards,
that we actually put up

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:12.620 align:middle line:84%
on all the roads as you enter
that traditional land to say,

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:16.270 align:middle line:84%
you're entering the tribal
land of chief so-and-so,

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:18.560 align:middle line:84%
and have a picture of
him, and show the land,

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.437 align:middle line:84%
show the geographical
area of that tribal land.

00:15:21.437 --> 00:15:23.270 align:middle line:84%
So when people drive
in there, they actually

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:25.500 align:middle line:84%
know that you're driving
into the tribal land.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.140 align:middle line:84%
Because at the moment,
it's not designated.

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:28.940 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knows.

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:30.900 align:middle line:90%
So it's this gray area.

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.580 align:middle line:84%
So just by doing
that, it's taking back

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:36.440 align:middle line:84%
and claiming the land
for those tribal leaders

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.240 align:middle line:84%
is a very important
point of departure.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And that automatically
gives them

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:47.060 align:middle line:84%
a sense of more pride
and elevating them

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:49.300 align:middle line:84%
to the prominent
status that they

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:50.710 align:middle line:90%
should hold in their community.

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:53.790 align:middle line:84%
This is a really exciting and
challenging, at the same time

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:56.480 align:middle line:84%
challenging, opportunity
that faces us, especially

00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:00.280 align:middle line:84%
in South Africa, where there
is an absolute determination

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.490 align:middle line:84%
to destroy the tribal chiefs
and the tribal leaders

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:06.680 align:middle line:84%
and take the land away
from them and put it

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.890 align:middle line:84%
into the hands of
the government.

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:11.100 align:middle line:84%
We need to stop
that at all costs.

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:16.690 align:middle line:84%
This is just one of the recent
tribal activities in our town.

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:18.530 align:middle line:90%
There was a coronation.

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:20.710 align:middle line:90%
A new chief was appointed.

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:23.220 align:middle line:84%
Just some of the ceremonies
and activities that took

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:27.460 align:middle line:84%
place and I was an invited
special guest at this event.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:31.920 align:middle line:84%
At this stage, I'd like to come
back to the 13 frequently asked

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:32.790 align:middle line:90%
questions.

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:34.410 align:middle line:10%
Well, actually more than 13.

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And just go through
them and see if there

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:38.080 align:middle line:84%
are any these
questions that you'd

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.720 align:middle line:84%
like to have a stab at that
we didn't answer before.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.290 align:middle line:84%
I think we sort of
covered most of them.

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:46.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm just-- who's going
to shovel the crap?

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:48.360 align:middle line:84%
I think we've dealt
with that, right?

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:52.120 align:middle line:84%
If everything is free, I'll just
sit on my ass and do nothing

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:53.500 align:middle line:90%
and people must bring me stuff.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:57.950 align:middle line:84%
I think, does anybody
have a problem with it?

00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:59.210 align:middle line:90%
We all now know, right?

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:01.660 align:middle line:84%
We've gone beyond
wondering how are we

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:03.320 align:middle line:90%
going to solve this, right?

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:06.560 align:middle line:84%
The 50 Ferraris and 20
mansions is a beautiful one.

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.000 align:middle line:84%
Anybody still have
a problem with

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.500 align:middle line:84%
that, not really understanding
how we deal with that?

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:13.220 align:middle line:84%
Are we going back
to the dark ages?

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:14.280 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:17.099 align:middle line:90%
Is that a valid question?

00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:18.790 align:middle line:84%
No, I think we've
made it very clear

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:20.670 align:middle line:90%
that we're going to the stars.

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:23.150 align:middle line:84%
We're unlocking the
infinite potential

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:26.660 align:middle line:84%
of the human spirit of
creation and creativity

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:28.420 align:middle line:90%
by taking away the money.

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:29.900 align:middle line:90%
Is this a lawless society?

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.140 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely not.

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.110 align:middle line:84%
We have our council
of elders that

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:36.270 align:middle line:84%
creates the structure
and the foundation

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:38.450 align:middle line:84%
and the guidance
for our community.

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:41.510 align:middle line:84%
But the laws are made by
the people of the community,

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:42.820 align:middle line:90%
not the council of elders.

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:43.990 align:middle line:90%
They don't make the laws.

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:47.410 align:middle line:84%
They just guide
and apply the laws

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:49.710 align:middle line:90%
that are made by the people.

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:51.360 align:middle line:90%
So it's not a lawless society.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:57.340 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in a world
with infinite freedom

00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:02.140 align:middle line:84%
comes a responsibility
of infinite control.

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:04.890 align:middle line:84%
But control within
the guidelines

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:06.420 align:middle line:84%
that we've set
for ourselves, not

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:09.860 align:middle line:84%
controlled by somebody outside
of us that controls us.

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:12.880 align:middle line:84%
So we set the guidelines
for ourselves.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:16.676 align:middle line:84%
And we know what is
good for our community

00:18:16.676 --> 00:18:18.050 align:middle line:84%
and what's bad
for our community.

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it will
be imposed by ourselves

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:22.820 align:middle line:90%
on ourselves.

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:25.600 align:middle line:84%
We become our own
disciplinarians,

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.610 align:middle line:84%
if you can use that
word, to make sure

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:30.680 align:middle line:84%
that we don't step out
of line or infringe

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:33.810 align:middle line:84%
on the rights of anybody
else in our community.

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>>I guess a lot of the
teenagers are rebellious and are

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:39.100 align:middle line:90%
getting out of control, right?

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And they've destroyed some of
the facilities that are close

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:46.870 align:middle line:84%
to and in your community,
and you're looking forward

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:48.410 align:middle line:90%
to rebuilding them.

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:50.435 align:middle line:84%
But somebody has
vandalized a great deal

00:18:50.435 --> 00:18:51.720 align:middle line:90%
and a great many things.

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:54.250 align:middle line:84%
>>You don't have that kind
of vandalism in societies

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:56.990 align:middle line:84%
where you have a beautiful
home built for you by the best

00:18:56.990 --> 00:19:00.250 align:middle line:84%
architects that money can't
buy, by the best builders

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:02.820 align:middle line:84%
that money can't buy,
by the best materials

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:04.320 align:middle line:90%
that money can't buy.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.750 align:middle line:84%
The way you want it
built for yourself--

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:08.650 align:middle line:84%
either by the river
up on the mountain,

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:10.340 align:middle line:84%
in a community of
your own choice.

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:13.010 align:middle line:84%
Vandalism and the
rebellion doesn't even

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:14.780 align:middle line:90%
enter the equation.

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:17.062 align:middle line:90%
That is completely not part of--

00:19:17.062 --> 00:19:19.270 align:middle line:84%
>>I just live in a city
called Chicago and things can

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:21.470 align:middle line:90%
be pretty crazy there.

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:24.700 align:middle line:84%
>>So this is again why
people in the cities

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:27.570 align:middle line:84%
are going to probably make
a very quick move away

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:30.150 align:middle line:84%
from the cities into
these small towns

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:33.170 align:middle line:84%
where we take control
of our communities,

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:35.150 align:middle line:84%
we know everybody
in the community,

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:39.000 align:middle line:84%
we've collectively
decided what we're doing,

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.760 align:middle line:84%
we have a council of elders
that manages and controls

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.530 align:middle line:84%
the situation on
behalf of the people.

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:47.960 align:middle line:84%
That council of elders
can be changed every day

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:52.360 align:middle line:84%
if necessary by the people if
one of them steps out of line.

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:55.050 align:middle line:84%
It's not an elected
parliament that

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:56.800 align:middle line:84%
has to be there for
four years and there's

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.640 align:middle line:90%
nothing you can do about them.

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.780 align:middle line:84%
This is an important point
that I may not have mentioned.

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:05.800 align:middle line:84%
The council of elders is
there by choice of the people.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And if any one of those
members of the council

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:12.560 align:middle line:84%
is seen to be
suspicious or doing

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:15.190 align:middle line:84%
things that is not
necessarily for the benefit

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:18.360 align:middle line:84%
of the whole community, the
community votes him out, says,

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.450 align:middle line:84%
sorry, we don't think you
deserve to be on the council

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:23.770 align:middle line:84%
anymore because you've
done x, y, and z.

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
replace you by John,

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:31.060 align:middle line:84%
who's an honorable, respectable
member of our community.

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:36.660 align:middle line:84%
So it's absolute control of the
community of their own destiny,

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:39.220 align:middle line:84%
of what they do on
a day to day basis,

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:42.520 align:middle line:84%
and the structures and
the legal guidelines

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:43.992 align:middle line:90%
they set for themselves.

00:20:43.992 --> 00:20:46.200 align:middle line:84%
How are they going to deal
with rebellious teenagers?

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.050 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:49.320 align:middle line:84%
It's up to that
community to decide.

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.020 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to have
rebellious teenagers?

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:54.580 align:middle line:90%
In the beginning, maybe.

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:56.080 align:middle line:84%
But they'll be dealt
with in the way

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.730 align:middle line:90%
that that community decides.

00:20:57.730 --> 00:20:59.890 align:middle line:84%
As time goes by, I
don't think we're

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:02.310 align:middle line:84%
going to have rebellious
anybody, because people are

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:04.680 align:middle line:84%
so happy, fulfilling
their lives,

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:09.450 align:middle line:84%
living their lives, not having
the stresses and the anxieties

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:12.350 align:middle line:84%
and the fears that we
grow up with today.

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:15.560 align:middle line:84%
That is not part of
our reality anymore.

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we
can't even begin

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:22.110 align:middle line:84%
to imagine how this balanced
and integrated society

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:25.820 align:middle line:84%
and community is going to
look 20 years from now.

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:29.380 align:middle line:84%
It's almost impossible
for us to try and project

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:33.270 align:middle line:84%
that in this capitalist,
oppressive society

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:37.084 align:middle line:90%
we find ourselves in today.

00:21:37.084 --> 00:21:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>>There's a couple of things
about all the questions

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:42.330 align:middle line:84%
that have been kind
of coming up for me

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:44.780 align:middle line:90%
since we saw this slide first.

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:48.680 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I don't
have a problem

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:54.280 align:middle line:84%
seeing what the answers
can be in the future

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:57.650 align:middle line:84%
when the Ubuntu
community is together.

00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:59.720 align:middle line:84%
Where I see the
challenge is, how

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:03.910 align:middle line:84%
do we talk to people
to bridge that gap?

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And on the issue of
lawlessness, some

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:13.830 align:middle line:84%
of the problems I think
we're going to face

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:19.130 align:middle line:84%
are that the new laws that we
form from this ground to being

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:23.590 align:middle line:84%
will look so different from
what a law looks like now

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:27.170 align:middle line:84%
that we won't be
able to recognize it.

00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:30.080 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the
things I've put

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.960 align:middle line:84%
into a d curriculum for
kids that I've written

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:36.590 align:middle line:84%
is that I always ask them,
where do rules come from?

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And they say, parents and
teachers and principals.

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:41.640 align:middle line:90%
And I say, well, surprise.

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:44.020 align:middle line:84%
That's not where
rules come from.

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:47.780 align:middle line:84%
Rules come through people, but
they don't come from people.

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:50.490 align:middle line:90%
Rules actually come from goals.

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:52.950 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
you can't write a rule

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:54.890 align:middle line:90%
unless you have a goal in mind.

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:58.120 align:middle line:84%
It's actually physically
impossible to do.

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:02.310 align:middle line:84%
So the ground of
being and the goals

00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:08.690 align:middle line:84%
are so different from a
capitalist and the me, me, me

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:14.540 align:middle line:84%
society to a group
society, it was

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:17.150 align:middle line:84%
one of the things that even
knowing this tripped me up

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:19.480 align:middle line:84%
for a little bit,
because I kept looking

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:22.250 align:middle line:90%
for the rule in the old form.

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized, it's
not rule in the old form.

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:26.240 align:middle line:90%
It's process.

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.910 align:middle line:84%
It's essentially the
difference of looking

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:31.770 align:middle line:84%
from one end of the
telescope or the other.

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And when you're looking through
the right end of the telescope,

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:37.450 align:middle line:90%
then you have Ubuntu.

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:39.360 align:middle line:84%
When you're looking
at it backwards,

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:44.420 align:middle line:84%
you've got the other crazy,
economic, hierarchical, bad

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:46.170 align:middle line:90%
hierarchical systems.

00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:48.380 align:middle line:84%
So I think the biggest
challenge that I

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:54.140 align:middle line:84%
see is learning this language
and inventing the language,

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:57.860 align:middle line:84%
so that we can bridge that
gap and bridge it faster.

00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:01.660 align:middle line:84%
Because as you said,
a few years ago,

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:04.480 align:middle line:84%
it took a long time to
convince somebody of this work.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.870 align:middle line:90%
And now, it's going faster.

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:09.290 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have to
learn new terms, new words,

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:11.410 align:middle line:84%
and learn how to
bridge that gap.

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think part of
bridging that gap

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:16.300 align:middle line:84%
is what we're going to
need in those communities,

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:17.910 align:middle line:84%
because we don't
bridge gaps now.

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:20.260 align:middle line:90%
We beat people up.

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:23.095 align:middle line:84%
So the challenge
is one of language.

00:24:23.095 --> 00:24:23.970 align:middle line:90%
>>That's great, Joan.

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:25.120 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for bringing that up.

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:26.203 align:middle line:90%
And language is a problem.

00:24:26.203 --> 00:24:29.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I catch myself all the
time doing these workshops.

00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:32.220 align:middle line:84%
I still somehow,
every now and then,

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:33.900 align:middle line:84%
use expressions that
I've told myself

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:36.670 align:middle line:84%
not to use, and realize,
no, you can't say that,

00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:39.310 align:middle line:90%
because this is old paradigm.

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:42.210 align:middle line:84%
This doesn't apply
to where we're going.

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'll constantly try and find
new expressions and new words

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:49.440 align:middle line:84%
or ways to describe
things without falling

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.910 align:middle line:84%
into the trap of using the
wrong words or expressions

00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:53.400 align:middle line:90%
or definitions.

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's not easy, because we're
creating a whole new reality

00:24:56.730 --> 00:25:00.900 align:middle line:84%
that was going to require new
descriptions, new definitions,

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.140 align:middle line:90%
new words.

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:03.940 align:middle line:90%
And it's great.

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:07.230 align:middle line:90%
It's a great challenge for us.

00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:10.080 align:middle line:84%
>>One of the things we found in
the projects-based curriculum

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:13.930 align:middle line:84%
that I did throughout
the LA school system

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:17.160 align:middle line:84%
was after the kids did the rules
and agreements module where

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:23.330 align:middle line:84%
they came to understand
that rules came from goals,

00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:28.330 align:middle line:84%
whole campuses transformed
within 30 days of just doing

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:31.440 align:middle line:84%
one fourth and
fifth grade class.

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:36.010 align:middle line:84%
Because for example, in the
San Fernando Valley, the minute

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:39.810 align:middle line:84%
I put my foot on campus, I
knew there was a war going on.

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:42.130 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm doing the rules
and agreements module,

00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:44.320 align:middle line:84%
and I asked the kids,
OK, what's the war?

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:45.800 align:middle line:90%
What war?

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.770 align:middle line:84%
The one that's going
on this campus,

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:49.860 align:middle line:90%
because you can't miss it.

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out they didn't
like the playground rules.

00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:56.270 align:middle line:84%
So after learning that
rules came from goals,

00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:58.560 align:middle line:84%
and then taking
the rules, guessing

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:02.020 align:middle line:84%
at what the goals were, and
realizing that they probably

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:04.490 align:middle line:84%
had the same goals
as the principal,

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:08.030 align:middle line:84%
they put a crew
together of five kids,

00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:10.590 align:middle line:84%
went into the principal's
office, and said,

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:13.342 align:middle line:84%
we made a guess as to
what your goals are.

00:26:13.342 --> 00:26:14.760 align:middle line:90%
Are these your goals?

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:17.080 align:middle line:84%
Because we agree with
these kind of goals.

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:21.100 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we could work together to
come up with playground rules

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:23.150 align:middle line:84%
that work for us
and work for you,

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:25.020 align:middle line:90%
because we have the same goals.

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And within six weeks,
that whole campus

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:30.210 align:middle line:90%
was completely transformed.

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:33.900 align:middle line:90%
There was no more war.

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:35.440 align:middle line:84%
>>You just reminded
me of something

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:42.350 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't really touch upon
under the education heading.

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And that was education
for children,

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.840 align:middle line:84%
because we spoke
about how adults

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:49.190 align:middle line:84%
will benefit from
the skills for life,

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:50.730 align:middle line:84%
from the various
community projects.

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:54.400 align:middle line:84%
But the same will apply to
the children of the community.

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:57.070 align:middle line:84%
Slowly but surely from
the earliest of age,

00:26:57.070 --> 00:27:02.260 align:middle line:84%
engaging in playing into action,
but including in their day

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:06.330 align:middle line:84%
to day activity and play and to
action, community activities,

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:11.740 align:middle line:84%
from growing, planting seeds,
learning the love for planet

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:13.130 align:middle line:90%
Earth to start off with.

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:15.660 align:middle line:84%
And I really believe that
that's a very critical point

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:17.740 align:middle line:84%
of departure from
the earliest of age,

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:20.470 align:middle line:84%
teaching children the
love for planet Earth,

00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:23.720 align:middle line:84%
so they grow up into
understanding and being

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:26.260 align:middle line:84%
in harmony with the earth
and not allowing others

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:28.296 align:middle line:90%
to harm our planet.

00:27:28.296 --> 00:27:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
that's desperately

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:32.740 align:middle line:84%
missing in our education
today and starting

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:35.060 align:middle line:90%
from that point of departure.

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And then slowly as
they grow older,

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:41.060 align:middle line:84%
they are exposed
to little workshops

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:43.580 align:middle line:84%
and little internships if
you want to call it that,

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:49.120 align:middle line:84%
from planting seedlings to
all kinds of activities.

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And it grows from an
hour a day to two hours

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:52.800 align:middle line:90%
to longer and longer.

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And by the time they are 10 12,
14 years old, they are engaging

00:27:57.150 --> 00:28:00.200 align:middle line:84%
in activities of their
choice that they naturally

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:03.690 align:middle line:84%
are drawn towards, whether
they like to work with wood,

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:06.270 align:middle line:84%
they'll go spend more time
with in the carpentry shop

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:10.450 align:middle line:84%
and learning from the
master wood craftsman

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:12.050 align:middle line:90%
and learning those skills.

00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:16.160 align:middle line:84%
So by the time a child is 16
years old in this community,

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:20.390 align:middle line:84%
it would have been exposed to
every facet of life, from arts

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:22.790 align:middle line:84%
and culture to science
and technology,

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:25.980 align:middle line:84%
from creating new materials
to building rockets

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:28.300 align:middle line:84%
to developing free
energy devices

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:32.110 align:middle line:84%
and having a complete
understanding and hands

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:34.540 align:middle line:84%
on experience in
all these areas.

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:38.430 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine a 16-year-old
in this Contributionism

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:42.310 align:middle line:84%
community will be wiser and more
balanced and more integrated

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:46.870 align:middle line:84%
into their community, won't
have any of the imbalances

00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:50.180 align:middle line:84%
that our teenagers have today,
because they would grow up

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:53.340 align:middle line:84%
in a community where everything
is provided that they can

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:58.270 align:middle line:84%
express their natural
born talents and skills,

00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:00.320 align:middle line:84%
and they can choose
what they do.

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:04.690 align:middle line:84%
So by the time they're 16, I
say that any 16-year-old will

00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:08.270 align:middle line:84%
have more knowledge than all the
professors in the world today,

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:11.500 align:middle line:84%
because they would
have done it hands on

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:13.300 align:middle line:90%
and they will know how it works.

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:17.480 align:middle line:84%
They didn't sit-in a classroom,
reading theory from a book,

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:20.320 align:middle line:84%
not understanding what they say,
trying to remember the stuff

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:22.300 align:middle line:84%
so they can cram
it into an exam,

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:24.870 align:middle line:84%
so they can pass and get
an A on their report,

00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:27.250 align:middle line:90%
so they can find a job.

00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:29.220 align:middle line:90%
That flies out the window.

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:31.140 align:middle line:84%
So now you've got
real knowledge,

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:35.310 align:middle line:84%
real hands on skills,
and a deep understanding,

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:38.980 align:middle line:84%
and an integrated individual
into the community.

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:41.210 align:middle line:84%
By the time you're
16, you'll already

00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:43.440 align:middle line:84%
be pursuing your
passions and your love.

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And all the people
in your community

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:48.700 align:middle line:84%
will already recognize
you at that young age

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:51.344 align:middle line:84%
of what you are contributing
to your community,

00:29:51.344 --> 00:29:52.760 align:middle line:84%
because you'll
probably already be

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:56.750 align:middle line:84%
doing that as part of
your passion in your day

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:58.440 align:middle line:90%
to day activities.

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:00.920 align:middle line:84%
>>Rebellion will be a
less likely endeavor.

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:05.240 align:middle line:84%
>>There is zero possibility
of youthful rebellion,

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:08.640 align:middle line:84%
because now you're actually
giving the children

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.600 align:middle line:84%
an opportunity to
express themselves

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.210 align:middle line:90%
the way they want to.

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:14.890 align:middle line:84%
Today's society
prevents our youth

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:16.650 align:middle line:90%
from expressing themselves.

00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:18.680 align:middle line:90%
We do exactly the opposite.

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:23.360 align:middle line:84%
>>There is a saying in the
'80s, in a personal development

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:24.890 align:middle line:84%
seminar, that when
people don't feel

00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:28.305 align:middle line:84%
that they can make a difference,
they try to be different.

00:30:28.305 --> 00:30:30.850 align:middle line:90%


00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:33.950 align:middle line:84%
>>So my question is, is
from your perspective,

00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:36.070 align:middle line:84%
obviously most of
this seems to be

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:38.100 align:middle line:90%
relative to transition period.

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:41.920 align:middle line:84%
We can see where things will be
when all this is established.

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:47.370 align:middle line:84%
But in regards to
the military and what

00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:50.370 align:middle line:84%
do you think as far as
how that will transition?

00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:56.990 align:middle line:84%
How that will eventually become
irrelevant or something else,

00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:59.610 align:middle line:90%
useful for something else?

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:04.840 align:middle line:84%
How is all that going to
become transitioned into this,

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:11.490 align:middle line:84%
and either become obsolete
or useful in that sense,

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:13.430 align:middle line:84%
relative to how things
are going to be?

00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:15.880 align:middle line:84%
Because that's a big--
there's a lot of people,

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:18.460 align:middle line:84%
a lot of jobs, a lot of
people that are really

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:21.760 align:middle line:84%
in the mindset of we need
military, we need defense,

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:22.960 align:middle line:90%
we need all of these things.

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:25.561 align:middle line:90%


00:31:25.561 --> 00:31:26.810 align:middle line:90%
>>Thanks for bringing that up.

00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:28.590 align:middle line:84%
It's a very important
question that

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:31.960 align:middle line:84%
applies to the police force,
and all the so-called forces.

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:34.180 align:middle line:84%
The Defense Force,
the Air Force.

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:36.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, the word force is a part
of all those words, right?

00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:38.750 align:middle line:84%
>>And a big part
of the fear factor

00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:43.480 align:middle line:84%
that maintains the
dependent mindset that we're

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:47.840 align:middle line:84%
all-- there again, once
we're all empowered,

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:50.762 align:middle line:84%
there's not going to
be a sense of that.

00:31:50.762 --> 00:31:53.970 align:middle line:84%
>>Again, that's part of
the natural progression

00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:58.810 align:middle line:84%
and the natural
dissolution or dissolving

00:31:58.810 --> 00:32:01.680 align:middle line:90%
of those parts of our society.

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:04.750 align:middle line:84%
Also because all the people
in the military and the police

00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:06.740 align:middle line:84%
force and the Air Force
and all these forces,

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:09.580 align:middle line:84%
they're all somebody's
sons and daughters.

00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And sooner or
later, these people

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:14.380 align:middle line:84%
are going to also wake up to
what their brothers and sisters

00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:16.630 align:middle line:84%
and fathers and mothers are
doing in their small towns

00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:17.570 align:middle line:90%
and communities.

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:19.986 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to hear about
the abundance that they're

00:32:19.986 --> 00:32:24.520 align:middle line:84%
creating and these incredible
places of harmony and unity

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:27.460 align:middle line:84%
and abundance, and they're going
to be amazed by this, realizing

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:30.950 align:middle line:84%
that these guys are developing
technology that is matching

00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:35.410 align:middle line:84%
the technology of the military
that is run by the government,

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:37.400 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to
say, well, hold on.

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to point
a gun at my grandmother.

00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:41.155 align:middle line:90%
She's done nothing, right?

00:32:41.155 --> 00:32:42.530 align:middle line:84%
So sooner or later,
there's going

00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:45.580 align:middle line:84%
to come a time, which I
think has come already.

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:47.850 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people in
the current military,

00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:51.950 align:middle line:84%
and especially in Europe and I
know in Germany, for example,

00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:54.249 align:middle line:84%
and Austria I think
as well, a lot

00:32:54.249 --> 00:32:56.290 align:middle line:84%
of the members of the
police are saying, hold on.

00:32:56.290 --> 00:32:58.522 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to march
against or we're not

00:32:58.522 --> 00:33:00.230 align:middle line:84%
going to get violent
with the people that

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:03.860 align:middle line:84%
are standing up against the
oppression of the society.

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:06.350 align:middle line:10%
And there have been some
interesting examples

00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:08.850 align:middle line:10%
where the police actually
take off their helmets

00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:11.980 align:middle line:10%
and they march with the people.

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:13.087 align:middle line:90%
So that's happening more.

00:33:13.087 --> 00:33:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to start
happening more and more.

00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:18.400 align:middle line:84%
These soldiers and
people in those positions

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.010 align:middle line:90%
are also human beings.

00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:24.690 align:middle line:84%
They've been brainwashed
and shoved into situations

00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:25.750 align:middle line:90%
that are not natural.

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:28.570 align:middle line:84%
They're not natural
to our human spirit

00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:31.440 align:middle line:84%
and to this unity
consciousness that's evolving.

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to
find that very quickly

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:36.090 align:middle line:84%
and feel far more
at home and resonate

00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:38.820 align:middle line:84%
with what's happening on the
ground with their families

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:41.260 align:middle line:84%
and their friends in these
towns and villages that

00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:42.679 align:middle line:90%
are creating this new reality.

00:33:42.679 --> 00:33:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And they're going
to believe, they're

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:47.120 align:middle line:84%
going to find themselves
attracted to that automatically

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:50.020 align:middle line:84%
and naturally, than rather being
attracted toward supporting

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:54.200 align:middle line:84%
a fascist regime that is trying
to invade other countries

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.200 align:middle line:84%
and force themselves
on other people.

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:59.100 align:middle line:84%
Say, well, why are we doing that
when we live in paradise here?

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:01.530 align:middle line:90%
No one's threatening us.

00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:03.080 align:middle line:90%
We don't have any money.

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:04.690 align:middle line:90%
We don't need money.

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:10.790 align:middle line:84%
Once again, all this war
mongering and violence

00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:14.710 align:middle line:84%
is all driven by money
and the control of money.

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:15.510 align:middle line:90%
>>That's the goal.

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:17.449 align:middle line:84%
>>Invasion of countries
and governments

00:34:17.449 --> 00:34:18.600 align:middle line:90%
taking over government.

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:19.766 align:middle line:90%
Remember, we discussed that.

00:34:19.766 --> 00:34:23.040 align:middle line:84%
John Perkins in his book
"Confessions of an Economic

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:26.590 align:middle line:84%
Hitman," makes it very clear how
this has happened in the past.

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:27.830 align:middle line:90%
So that flies out the window.

00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:29.354 align:middle line:90%
That no longer applies.

00:34:29.354 --> 00:34:31.880 align:middle line:84%
So this is a rapid
transition from that kind

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:35.860 align:middle line:84%
of violent, invasive
mentality towards an embracing

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:37.389 align:middle line:90%
cooperative mentality.

00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:41.409 align:middle line:84%
>>And once we stop discarding
people and everybody is

00:34:41.409 --> 00:34:44.980 align:middle line:84%
made to have a worth, that
they're, like you said before,

00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:49.429 align:middle line:84%
that every human being is born,
you're already successful.

00:34:49.429 --> 00:34:51.369 align:middle line:90%
You can't fail.

00:34:51.369 --> 00:34:52.550 align:middle line:90%
>>You're breathing.

00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:54.110 align:middle line:84%
You're alive, you're
walking around.

00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:56.219 align:middle line:84%
>>So when we give that
back to everybody,

00:34:56.219 --> 00:34:59.260 align:middle line:84%
because we don't take away
their worth by saying,

00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:02.020 align:middle line:84%
well, your worth is
based on what you have

00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:06.970 align:middle line:84%
or we give them their worth back
by their ability to contribute.

00:35:06.970 --> 00:35:09.920 align:middle line:84%
>>What I think may also
happen-- and again, this

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:13.740 align:middle line:84%
is just hypothetically
and theory--

00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:18.227 align:middle line:84%
but some of these
soldiers and police forces

00:35:18.227 --> 00:35:19.810 align:middle line:84%
are going to actually
start protecting

00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:24.390 align:middle line:84%
the communities from
invasion and collapse

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:26.980 align:middle line:90%
from outside forces.

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:29.334 align:middle line:84%
Once they see that these
are united communities

00:35:29.334 --> 00:35:31.500 align:middle line:84%
doing amazing things, they're
going to say, hold on,

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:33.280 align:middle line:84%
we're going to start
protecting this.

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, they're going to
start serving the community,

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:39.290 align:middle line:84%
serving the people, which is
what they're supposed to do.

00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:41.490 align:middle line:84%
Serve to protect the
people, not serve

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:44.970 align:middle line:84%
to protect a fascist
regime and government.

00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And so that's a turn
around in the way

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:53.260 align:middle line:84%
that that structure of
balance or balancing equation

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:55.270 align:middle line:90%
will play itself out.

00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:56.635 align:middle line:90%
>>Civil war of kindness.

00:35:56.635 --> 00:35:59.174 align:middle line:90%


00:35:59.174 --> 00:36:00.090 align:middle line:90%
>>Once again, Michael.

00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:00.660 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:01.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm Richard.

00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:02.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'm glad he brought
that up, because I

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:04.070 align:middle line:90%
was going to ask the question.

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And during the
conversation, the question

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:06.820 align:middle line:90%
started answering itself.

00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:08.430 align:middle line:84%
Because one of
the arguments when

00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:11.160 align:middle line:84%
I've talked about any
of this kind of thing,

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:14.180 align:middle line:84%
not specifically Ubuntu,
at the risk of stepping

00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:16.790 align:middle line:84%
on some politically
correct toes,

00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:19.000 align:middle line:84%
there are people
out there that think

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.130 align:middle line:84%
they're called to a
higher thing or whatever

00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:26.150 align:middle line:84%
and do real aggressive
meaningful damage to people.

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:28.687 align:middle line:84%
Not for money, not for
any reason, other than you

00:36:28.687 --> 00:36:30.770 align:middle line:84%
don't believe like I
believe, and so therefore I'm

00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:32.020 align:middle line:90%
going to kill you.

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:33.150 align:middle line:90%
How does that change?

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:34.260 align:middle line:90%
And what does that change?

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And can that change
in this format?

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:40.700 align:middle line:90%
>>This is a huge subject.

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And some people are going
to struggle with this.

00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to
find it a lot easier

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:50.760 align:middle line:84%
to accept once you start to work
in these united communities,

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:53.850 align:middle line:84%
because then they realize,
well, nobody wants to attack us.

00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:55.940 align:middle line:90%
They just want to live like us.

00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:58.520 align:middle line:84%
And now they know how
to do it, so they're

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:01.380 align:middle line:84%
going to do it for themselves
in their own country.

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And when we start creating
these communities in the USA,

00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:08.460 align:middle line:84%
they'll be created in
Afghanistan and Iraq

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:13.120 align:middle line:84%
and in Syria and in Iran
and in Russia and in China

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:16.140 align:middle line:84%
and in Australia and in Germany
and in all the countries

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:17.160 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:19.000 align:middle line:90%
People are going to do the same.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.930 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
be able to stop it.

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:24.770 align:middle line:84%
No amount of guns are going
to be able to stop this.

00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:26.170 align:middle line:90%
That time is over.

00:37:26.170 --> 00:37:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And the people that drive
around wielding their guns

00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:32.620 align:middle line:84%
are going to stop doing
that, because there's

00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:34.710 align:middle line:90%
no payoff for them.

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:37.240 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to get any
more money, because we're going

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:39.530 align:middle line:90%
to destroy the money supply.

00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:41.500 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to flow anymore.

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:44.970 align:middle line:84%
So there's no real reason
for them to be doing it.

00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:47.260 align:middle line:84%
One of the questions here
that we haven't covered,

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:49.420 align:middle line:84%
and somebody asked
me this question

00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:51.940 align:middle line:84%
I think it was in Austria
when I was there recently,

00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:52.740 align:middle line:90%
the last one today.

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:54.550 align:middle line:84%
What about the
elderly and taking

00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:56.510 align:middle line:84%
care of people
with disabilities?

00:37:56.510 --> 00:38:00.480 align:middle line:84%
Anybody want to
handle that answer?

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:03.540 align:middle line:84%
>>As far as helping
the elderly and taking

00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:06.840 align:middle line:84%
care of people with
disabilities and really

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:10.530 align:middle line:84%
taking care of anyone, I think
will become a huge part of what

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:12.090 align:middle line:90%
empowers people.

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:15.860 align:middle line:84%
The more we're all
OK, the more everybody

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:21.850 align:middle line:84%
feels good and benefits and
there again, it's empowerment.

00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:25.505 align:middle line:84%
If our main idea in society
is empowerment means

00:38:25.505 --> 00:38:27.130 align:middle line:84%
how much money you
have in your pocket,

00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:32.220 align:middle line:84%
then we've really deterred
our whole evolution

00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:33.710 align:middle line:90%
and our whole mindset.

00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that,
out of all the questions,

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:40.380 align:middle line:90%
should be one of the easiest.

00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:42.640 align:middle line:84%
You take care of the
people that you love.

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And so the people that
have taken care of us,

00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:48.490 align:middle line:84%
by the time they get to the
point where they need some help

00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:51.740 align:middle line:84%
and taken care of, I think
that's a process that everybody

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:53.720 align:middle line:90%
will be happy to contribute to.

00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:57.470 align:middle line:84%
Kids are great as far as
doing things like that.

00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:58.614 align:middle line:90%
>>So thank you.

00:38:58.614 --> 00:38:59.530 align:middle line:90%
That's a great answer.

00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:01.800 align:middle line:84%
But let's take it even
a bit further, right?

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:05.860 align:middle line:84%
So let's just remind ourselves
of the kind of community

00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:06.680 align:middle line:90%
we are in.

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:08.888 align:middle line:84%
We are in a community where
we have the best possible

00:39:08.888 --> 00:39:11.980 align:middle line:84%
healthcare, where we're
curing disease, where

00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:14.730 align:middle line:84%
we have community projects
that deal with every aspect

00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:19.240 align:middle line:84%
of our community, and dealing
and helping with elders

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:22.270 align:middle line:84%
and looking after the elders is
part of the community project

00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:23.889 align:middle line:90%
and community activity.

00:39:23.889 --> 00:39:25.430 align:middle line:84%
So there will be
people that actively

00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:29.640 align:middle line:84%
do that all the time,
nonstop, providing

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:32.260 align:middle line:84%
the elders and the
disabled-- first of all,

00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:35.110 align:middle line:84%
with healthcare that will
cure their disability.

00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:37.850 align:middle line:84%
You know that the technology
is there to regrow organs,

00:39:37.850 --> 00:39:39.680 align:middle line:90%
to regrow limbs.

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:41.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can't
even start this.

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:43.310 align:middle line:84%
Some people find that
too weird to believe,

00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:46.660 align:middle line:84%
and yet that the knowledge
and the know how exists.

00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:47.580 align:middle line:90%
That will come out.

00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:52.630 align:middle line:84%
So we will not have that many
disabled and sickly people.

00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that
elderly people are today,

00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:58.230 align:middle line:84%
they're a problem to
the current system.

00:39:58.230 --> 00:40:01.020 align:middle line:84%
The current governments wants
to get rid of the old people,

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:02.510 align:middle line:90%
because they cost them money.

00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:04.837 align:middle line:84%
So we put our old people
into old age homes

00:40:04.837 --> 00:40:06.670 align:middle line:84%
and we hope they die
as quickly as possible,

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:09.950 align:middle line:84%
so that the government can stop
paying their monthly looking

00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:12.450 align:middle line:84%
after them, because
it's just too expensive.

00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:14.580 align:middle line:90%
This changes completely.

00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:17.430 align:middle line:84%
In integrated,
united communities,

00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:18.530 align:middle line:90%
the elderly are the wise.

00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:19.550 align:middle line:90%
These are the wise people.

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:21.591 align:middle line:84%
They've got the most
experience and the knowledge

00:40:21.591 --> 00:40:23.650 align:middle line:84%
and the wisdom,
especially if they grow up

00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:24.910 align:middle line:90%
in these kind of communities.

00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:26.660 align:middle line:90%
They've got the most experience.

00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:28.865 align:middle line:84%
They pass on their knowledge
and their experience.

00:40:28.865 --> 00:40:30.990 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing is that
just because you're old

00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:32.560 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean you don't
want to do stuff.

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:34.090 align:middle line:84%
Just because you
can't walk too well

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:35.980 align:middle line:84%
or carry stuff or
pick things up doesn't

00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:39.720 align:middle line:84%
mean you don't like to paint
or do pottery or do things

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:41.670 align:middle line:84%
that you can sit and
chitchat around a table,

00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:44.970 align:middle line:84%
have a great time, and spend the
whole day creating things that

00:40:44.970 --> 00:40:46.980 align:middle line:90%
actually benefit the community.

00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:49.420 align:middle line:84%
So again, it is
up to the elderly

00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:51.860 align:middle line:84%
to decide what they will
do for the community

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:54.790 align:middle line:84%
and they'll be supported
in every possible way.

00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And if people need
wheelchairs, they'll

00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:58.130 align:middle line:90%
have the best wheelchairs.

00:40:58.130 --> 00:40:59.650 align:middle line:90%
They'll be levitating.

00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:03.370 align:middle line:84%
They don't need somebody
to push them along,

00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:05.580 align:middle line:84%
because that
technology is there.

00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:09.420 align:middle line:84%
So this reminds me of something
that I wanted to come back

00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:11.100 align:middle line:90%
to about the security.

00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:13.750 align:middle line:84%
Because let's just backtrack
a little bit and talk

00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:15.750 align:middle line:84%
about the technology
and the scientists

00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:17.695 align:middle line:84%
and the inventors
and the-- what are

00:41:17.695 --> 00:41:19.890 align:middle line:84%
we going to-- our
research laboratories

00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:22.520 align:middle line:84%
and the free electricity
and all that kind of stuff.

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:25.100 align:middle line:84%
With all these crazy
scientists and inventors,

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:27.120 align:middle line:84%
do you not think
that there are people

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:31.190 align:middle line:84%
that understand advanced
knowledge in weaponry and laser

00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:33.829 align:middle line:84%
beams and saser beam
technology and how

00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:35.370 align:middle line:84%
to create a laser
beam that takes out

00:41:35.370 --> 00:41:37.390 align:middle line:90%
a satellite in a split second?

00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:39.710 align:middle line:84%
This is very easy
stuff for people

00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:41.520 align:middle line:84%
that have the know
how, that used

00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:44.740 align:middle line:84%
to work in the secret or
industrial military complex,

00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:47.860 align:middle line:84%
or in the military, that used
to be involved in those things.

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:49.590 align:middle line:90%
And we know those scientists.

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:51.189 align:middle line:84%
We talk to them
on a daily basis.

00:41:51.189 --> 00:41:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And these are the
guys that are going

00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:55.840 align:middle line:84%
to be helping us develop
the technology for our towns

00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:57.260 align:middle line:90%
and our communities.

00:41:57.260 --> 00:42:03.060 align:middle line:84%
So in essence, our knowledge
and our advanced technology

00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:07.000 align:middle line:84%
will become our defense
mechanism as well.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.790 align:middle line:84%
OK, just understand
how quickly these guys

00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:15.080 align:middle line:84%
can develop a weapon
of mass destruction

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:18.060 align:middle line:84%
that uses sound or
saser technology.

00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:20.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know people
who can do that

00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:23.460 align:middle line:84%
in a week, that can put this
together very quickly if you

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:25.230 align:middle line:90%
know how it works.

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is why the moment
you open up this and invite

00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:32.400 align:middle line:84%
these inventors and crazy
scientists into your community,

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:35.860 align:middle line:84%
it becomes your own
protection device as well.

00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:39.265 align:middle line:84%
So again, it's the
moment you take money out

00:42:39.265 --> 00:42:43.120 align:middle line:84%
of the system,
everything changes.

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:45.420 align:middle line:90%
Immediately.

00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:48.660 align:middle line:10%
Dealing with the elderly and
taking care of the people

00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:50.840 align:middle line:10%
with disabilities.

00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:53.320 align:middle line:84%
It's not even a
discussion anymore.

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:55.300 align:middle line:84%
It's so obvious how
that gets handled,

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:58.814 align:middle line:84%
so I'm glad that you all
see it and-- see, already?

00:42:58.814 --> 00:43:00.230 align:middle line:84%
None of these
questions that we've

00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:02.840 align:middle line:84%
posed here-- if I'd
asked you these questions

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:04.759 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning
of this workshop,

00:43:04.759 --> 00:43:06.800 align:middle line:84%
you would have probably
said, yeah, I don't know.

00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:07.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm scratching my head.

00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:09.200 align:middle line:90%
How is this going to work?

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:12.440 align:middle line:84%
By the time we've processed and
gone through these eight hours,

00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:14.710 align:middle line:84%
it's not even a
consideration anymore,

00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:17.150 align:middle line:84%
because it's just
so insignificant, so

00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:19.080 align:middle line:90%
easy to overcome and answer.

00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:22.330 align:middle line:84%
But I've challenged
you to come up

00:43:22.330 --> 00:43:25.620 align:middle line:84%
with possible hurdles and
questions that are really

00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:26.910 align:middle line:90%
difficult to overcome.

00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if
you had something

00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:31.240 align:middle line:90%
that you wanted to raise.

00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:32.710 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you, Michael.

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:37.270 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, a question I have
was one of the things I

00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:39.820 align:middle line:84%
see that causes the most
division in our world

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:41.310 align:middle line:90%
is religion.

00:43:41.310 --> 00:43:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And I'm curious as
to your thoughts

00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:50.420 align:middle line:84%
on how the Ubuntu philosophy
influences religion and vice

00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:51.220 align:middle line:90%
versa.

00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:53.960 align:middle line:84%
When we start to
transition, there's

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:57.670 align:middle line:84%
people with core values, core
beliefs that have been passed

00:43:57.670 --> 00:44:00.080 align:middle line:90%
on for thousands of years.

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:03.210 align:middle line:84%
What impact is
that going to have

00:44:03.210 --> 00:44:06.960 align:middle line:84%
on both religious communities
and Ubuntu communities

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:10.100 align:middle line:90%
and so forth?

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:12.360 align:middle line:84%
>>Very good and a very
important question.

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:13.650 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for raising that.

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:17.870 align:middle line:84%
Again, it is a
part of our society

00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:22.160 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't necessarily
create conflict or division

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:23.280 align:middle line:90%
on its own.

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:26.540 align:middle line:84%
That conflict and division
is imposed on the people

00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:30.350 align:middle line:84%
by religious leaders
that tell their followers

00:44:30.350 --> 00:44:32.610 align:middle line:84%
that those people
over there are bad.

00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:35.310 align:middle line:84%
If you just leave people
to their own device,

00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:37.800 align:middle line:84%
they're not going to pick
up arms and run over there

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:38.970 align:middle line:90%
and kill those Christians.

00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:42.930 align:middle line:84%
It takes somebody to tell them
that somebody is doing bad

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:44.577 align:middle line:84%
or they believe
something different.

00:44:44.577 --> 00:44:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And in essence, when
you start talking

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:49.100 align:middle line:84%
to different religious groups,
fundamentally their core belief

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:50.000 align:middle line:90%
system is the same.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.730 align:middle line:84%
They all believe in a creator,
they all believe in the soul,

00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:56.290 align:middle line:84%
and they all believe in
things that actually you

00:44:56.290 --> 00:44:58.480 align:middle line:84%
find common ground very
quickly when you start

00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:00.020 align:middle line:90%
talking to different religions.

00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:02.100 align:middle line:84%
It's not difficult to
find common ground.

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:04.620 align:middle line:84%
But what happens with this
Ubuntu and contributions

00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:06.480 align:middle line:84%
and philosophy is
that you actually

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:08.710 align:middle line:90%
avoid that, you bypass that.

00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:11.400 align:middle line:84%
You allow people their
own belief system

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:14.620 align:middle line:84%
as long as they don't
impose it on anybody else.

00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:16.520 align:middle line:90%
Again, be part of our community.

00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:18.060 align:middle line:84%
You can believe
whatever you want,

00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:20.980 align:middle line:84%
as long as your belief system
doesn't impose negatively

00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:23.470 align:middle line:84%
on the people that contribute
towards the well-being

00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:24.830 align:middle line:90%
of your community.

00:45:24.830 --> 00:45:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And what that does,
it allows people--

00:45:28.070 --> 00:45:32.600 align:middle line:84%
first of all, the oppressive
conditions under which people

00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:34.440 align:middle line:84%
live in many of
the countries that

00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:37.780 align:middle line:84%
have these sort of
fascist religious belief

00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:40.690 align:middle line:84%
systems imposed on
them, that gets lifted.

00:45:40.690 --> 00:45:45.290 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, they no longer have
this desperate oppression

00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:47.330 align:middle line:84%
through religion
imposed on them.

00:45:47.330 --> 00:45:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And that changes their way,
their personal reaction

00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:54.280 align:middle line:84%
and relationship with their
own religious beliefs.

00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:57.120 align:middle line:84%
So that evolves
very quickly itself.

00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:00.600 align:middle line:84%
How that will happen
I can't predict.

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:03.541 align:middle line:84%
But what I do know is
that by nature, people

00:46:03.541 --> 00:46:05.290 align:middle line:84%
don't want to run out
and kill each other.

00:46:05.290 --> 00:46:07.060 align:middle line:90%
That is not the human spirit.

00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:10.950 align:middle line:84%
That is the inhumane part of
what has been imposed on us.

00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:13.420 align:middle line:84%
The way people
behave, or the way

00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:17.420 align:middle line:84%
we send our young
people into war

00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:20.190 align:middle line:84%
to kill other people
in other countries,

00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:23.060 align:middle line:84%
because our governments
have been lured into it

00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:24.820 align:middle line:90%
by the banking families.

00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:26.510 align:middle line:90%
That's the problem.

00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And religion is being
used as the tool

00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:30.080 align:middle line:90%
of division and separation.

00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:32.600 align:middle line:90%
It's one of the best tools.

00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:34.470 align:middle line:84%
The moment you get
rid of money, you also

00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:38.460 align:middle line:84%
get rid of that divisive tool
that separates and divides

00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:40.895 align:middle line:84%
people through religious
belief systems.

00:46:40.895 --> 00:46:43.020 align:middle line:84%
I believe we will overcome
that very, very quickly.

00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
see a unification

00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:49.480 align:middle line:84%
of different religions
that start to form around

00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:53.810 align:middle line:84%
the common denominator
belief structures that

00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:55.090 align:middle line:90%
start to unite the people.

00:46:55.090 --> 00:46:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And very quickly,
we're going to have

00:46:56.770 --> 00:47:00.560 align:middle line:84%
one global, spiritual
belief system that

00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:03.950 align:middle line:84%
forgets about the
indoctrinating religions

00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:08.350 align:middle line:84%
that we've seen over the
last few thousand years.

00:47:08.350 --> 00:47:09.150 align:middle line:90%
>>Hi.

00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:11.030 align:middle line:90%
My name is William.

00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:12.850 align:middle line:84%
And I want to
thank you, Michael,

00:47:12.850 --> 00:47:16.540 align:middle line:84%
and I want to thank my
divinity for choosing

00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:18.050 align:middle line:90%
me to be here today.

00:47:18.050 --> 00:47:21.670 align:middle line:84%
I feel very honored
and special to be

00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:27.500 align:middle line:84%
part of this beautiful group
of people and everybody here.

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:28.660 align:middle line:90%
We have been chosen.

00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And this is beautiful to be
part of this manifestation that

00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:37.430 align:middle line:84%
is already in progress
and nothing can stop it.

00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:39.690 align:middle line:90%
I can feel that energy already.

00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:41.430 align:middle line:90%
And it's beautiful.

00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:44.170 align:middle line:84%
And I was going to ask the
same question as Aaron,

00:47:44.170 --> 00:47:48.250 align:middle line:84%
but now I'm inspired to
also add to the answer

00:47:48.250 --> 00:47:50.580 align:middle line:90%
that Michael gave you.

00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And I just feel that freedom
to experience ourselves

00:47:54.690 --> 00:47:58.420 align:middle line:84%
from our heart and
doing the services

00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:04.480 align:middle line:84%
and creating the products
to better humanity,

00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:08.440 align:middle line:84%
there's God himself for
those who believe in God.

00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:13.780 align:middle line:84%
There's divinity itself
being manifested here.

00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:17.900 align:middle line:84%
I feel the wonderful,
wonderful loving energy

00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:23.420 align:middle line:84%
that is transpiring right now in
this beautiful work being done.

00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:24.220 align:middle line:90%
>>Thanks, William.

00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:25.020 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you.

00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:27.120 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you for sharing that.

00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:32.850 align:middle line:84%
Any other shattering
questions or hurdles

00:48:32.850 --> 00:48:37.060 align:middle line:84%
that might collapse
our philosophy here?

00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:39.390 align:middle line:84%
>>In reference to the free
energy that you're offering,

00:48:39.390 --> 00:48:42.130 align:middle line:84%
you said you've got technology
that operates with the rivers

00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:42.930 align:middle line:90%
and streams.

00:48:42.930 --> 00:48:44.120 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:46.830 align:middle line:84%
>>So the small communities-- for
example, Northeast Kansas where

00:48:46.830 --> 00:48:50.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm at-- there's several
small communities,

00:48:50.170 --> 00:48:53.270 align:middle line:84%
Native American tribes, that
are quite a distance away

00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:55.980 align:middle line:90%
from any rivers or streams.

00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:58.170 align:middle line:84%
Is there other technology
that's going to offer

00:48:58.170 --> 00:49:00.155 align:middle line:90%
that electricity as well?

00:49:00.155 --> 00:49:01.030 align:middle line:90%
>>Of course there is.

00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:06.570 align:middle line:84%
We all know that the
alternative, eccentric, new

00:49:06.570 --> 00:49:10.110 align:middle line:84%
age, whatever word you want to
throw at it technology exists.

00:49:10.110 --> 00:49:12.310 align:middle line:84%
Free energy devices
have been developed.

00:49:12.310 --> 00:49:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Nikola Tesla's obviously
the most famous inventor

00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:18.720 align:middle line:84%
of free energy, that
gave us all free energy

00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:21.670 align:middle line:84%
and free electricity around the
world that was removed from us.

00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:23.160 align:middle line:90%
And there have been many others.

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And same goes for healing
and curing all disease.

00:49:25.830 --> 00:49:28.520 align:middle line:84%
The moment we open our
doors to those inventors

00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:31.090 align:middle line:84%
and those scientists that
have got those technologies,

00:49:31.090 --> 00:49:33.390 align:middle line:84%
they'll be coming
out of the woodwork.

00:49:33.390 --> 00:49:37.650 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be like
green grass on a spring day

00:49:37.650 --> 00:49:39.180 align:middle line:90%
after the first rain.

00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:42.260 align:middle line:84%
You open your doors up
and invite these inventors

00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:43.080 align:middle line:90%
and scientists.

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:44.705 align:middle line:84%
They're going to come
out of every nook

00:49:44.705 --> 00:49:47.800 align:middle line:84%
and cranny, out of every
country, out of every city.

00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:50.570 align:middle line:84%
There are thousands
of them out there.

00:49:50.570 --> 00:49:52.820 align:middle line:84%
Right now, they live
in fear, because they

00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:56.260 align:middle line:84%
know what has happened to
others that came before them.

00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:58.010 align:middle line:84%
Many of them were
quite ignorant.

00:49:58.010 --> 00:50:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And they discovered this
technology and the energy,

00:50:00.410 --> 00:50:02.660 align:middle line:84%
and then they come out
thinking that the world's going

00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:04.997 align:middle line:84%
to sing their praises and
they're going to become famous

00:50:04.997 --> 00:50:07.330 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to make
billions of dollars out of it,

00:50:07.330 --> 00:50:11.255 align:middle line:84%
only to find out that their
inventions get bought up,

00:50:11.255 --> 00:50:13.630 align:middle line:84%
their patents get bought up,
they get offered some money,

00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:17.350 align:middle line:84%
they get bribed or threatened,
and they simply disappear.

00:50:17.350 --> 00:50:20.470 align:middle line:84%
So that technology, I believe--
and this is why, again,

00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:23.880 align:middle line:84%
if you do it from a
political authority,

00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:25.270 align:middle line:90%
everything would change.

00:50:25.270 --> 00:50:28.400 align:middle line:84%
If I, as a mayor, go
out there and put out

00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:31.660 align:middle line:84%
a global invitation to the
inventors and scientists that

00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:35.130 align:middle line:84%
have got free energy and
alternative electricity

00:50:35.130 --> 00:50:39.830 align:middle line:84%
devices to come out and
share it with us in our town

00:50:39.830 --> 00:50:42.360 align:middle line:84%
or come and work in the
research laboratories

00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:45.840 align:middle line:84%
that we set up for them to
perfect what they've started

00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:51.950 align:middle line:84%
working on, they're going
to be coming to us in droves

00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:55.310 align:middle line:84%
to share with us their
inventions, because ultimately

00:50:55.310 --> 00:50:56.790 align:middle line:90%
they're creative souls.

00:50:56.790 --> 00:50:59.700 align:middle line:84%
They're doing this
because they were either

00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:02.690 align:middle line:84%
given this information or
they discovered it or found it

00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:07.470 align:middle line:84%
in a dream or somehow came upon
this knowledge and information.

00:51:07.470 --> 00:51:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And they want to share
it with the world.

00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And just like other
creative people,

00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:13.170 align:middle line:84%
they've been
prevented from sharing

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:14.970 align:middle line:90%
their creation with the world.

00:51:14.970 --> 00:51:17.880 align:middle line:84%
They want their creations
to be shared by the people.

00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:19.930 align:middle line:84%
They want it to land in
the hands of the people.

00:51:19.930 --> 00:51:22.245 align:middle line:84%
They don't want it to land
in some obscure room hidden

00:51:22.245 --> 00:51:23.045 align:middle line:90%
from society.

00:51:23.045 --> 00:51:25.240 align:middle line:90%


00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:26.040 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:29.200 align:middle line:84%
This might open up a
whole other can of worms,

00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:30.980 align:middle line:84%
so you might need
to edit this out,

00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:37.160 align:middle line:84%
but earlier you alluded to the
fact that above the banksters

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:41.140 align:middle line:84%
and above the families,
there's another sort

00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:46.760 align:middle line:84%
of power structure, which
maybe you might think of as ETs

00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:47.560 align:middle line:90%
perhaps.

00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:51.070 align:middle line:90%
But what happens with that?

00:51:51.070 --> 00:51:51.970 align:middle line:90%
What happens to them?

00:51:51.970 --> 00:51:55.340 align:middle line:84%
What's the vision
for-- I totally

00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:57.910 align:middle line:84%
have a vision of this
enlightened society,

00:51:57.910 --> 00:52:01.710 align:middle line:84%
and I even have a vision for
the banksters to come aboard,

00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:04.800 align:middle line:84%
many of them, except maybe
the sociopathic ones.

00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:10.360 align:middle line:84%
But do you have
a sense or do you

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:16.870 align:middle line:84%
have a vision or an inside
view to this potential future?

00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
to-- I just can't

00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:23.180 align:middle line:84%
imagine these beings
giving up control

00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:27.210 align:middle line:84%
of this planet, this garden
that we have, that we live on,

00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:30.180 align:middle line:90%
this beautiful planet.

00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:33.690 align:middle line:84%
I know that's a huge
question, but I just

00:52:33.690 --> 00:52:35.420 align:middle line:84%
thought I'd toss that
out there to you.

00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:36.220 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:37.260 align:middle line:90%
That is a big question.

00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure if
I have a very clear

00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:41.640 align:middle line:90%
and definitive answer for that.

00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:44.040 align:middle line:84%
What comes to mind
immediately is

00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:49.010 align:middle line:84%
that whoever these beings are
that have been somehow pulling

00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:53.620 align:middle line:84%
the strings over
those that impose

00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:57.310 align:middle line:84%
their control over humanity
here from a higher level

00:52:57.310 --> 00:53:02.290 align:middle line:84%
seem to be utilizing or using
humanity in various ways,

00:53:02.290 --> 00:53:05.200 align:middle line:90%
possibly using people as food.

00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:07.370 align:middle line:90%
That's a definite possibility.

00:53:07.370 --> 00:53:10.400 align:middle line:84%
They're possibly using
us as an energy source.

00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:14.520 align:middle line:84%
And that energy source comes
from our state of being,

00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:17.950 align:middle line:84%
our lower consciousness,
fear-based beings.

00:53:17.950 --> 00:53:20.760 align:middle line:84%
The moment we elevate ourselves
to a higher consciousness,

00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:23.200 align:middle line:84%
a unity consciousness,
lose the fear,

00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:27.340 align:middle line:84%
and understand that we are
part of the infinite creation,

00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:32.020 align:middle line:84%
that we never really
die, and lose the fear,

00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:36.970 align:middle line:84%
we start to dissolve any of
this potential control that

00:53:36.970 --> 00:53:40.580 align:middle line:84%
is imposed to us by lower
consciousness beings that

00:53:40.580 --> 00:53:43.060 align:middle line:84%
might have had
developed technology

00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:44.940 align:middle line:90%
that can traverse space.

00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:47.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're going to
get there very quickly

00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:49.110 align:middle line:84%
and get to higher
levels of consciousness

00:53:49.110 --> 00:53:51.480 align:middle line:84%
and higher levels of
technology and understanding

00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:55.150 align:middle line:84%
and utilizing our ability
to reverse space as well.

00:53:55.150 --> 00:53:57.830 align:middle line:84%
So not only are we going
to match their ability

00:53:57.830 --> 00:54:01.490 align:middle line:84%
to control us, we're going to
surpass that very, very quickly

00:54:01.490 --> 00:54:04.760 align:middle line:84%
by elevating ourselves to a
higher state of consciousness,

00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:07.570 align:middle line:84%
a state of unity
consciousness, and overcoming

00:54:07.570 --> 00:54:13.070 align:middle line:84%
any of the negative control that
has been imposed on us because

00:54:13.070 --> 00:54:15.660 align:middle line:90%
of being an unconscious species.

00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:19.400 align:middle line:84%
The moment we become conscious,
that kind of level of control

00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:22.170 align:middle line:90%
can no longer be imposed on us.

00:54:22.170 --> 00:54:23.970 align:middle line:90%
That's how I see it.

00:54:23.970 --> 00:54:25.690 align:middle line:84%
I might be completely
off the mark.

00:54:25.690 --> 00:54:27.780 align:middle line:90%
I hope I'm not.

00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:31.820 align:middle line:84%
So I suppose that brings us
to the end of this workshop,

00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:35.940 align:middle line:84%
and ending with a really
heavyweight question, which

00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:39.830 align:middle line:84%
I think is probably an
appropriate way to end this,

00:54:39.830 --> 00:54:44.450 align:middle line:84%
because we've covered in the
last two days and eight hours

00:54:44.450 --> 00:54:49.120 align:middle line:84%
a huge, vast areas of
information that started

00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:53.510 align:middle line:84%
with some really informative
and enlightening information,

00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:56.800 align:middle line:84%
opening up a deep understanding
of the origins of money

00:54:56.800 --> 00:55:00.750 align:middle line:84%
and how it became a tool of
control, how it was imposed

00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:03.170 align:middle line:84%
on humanity, the rise
of the banking families

00:55:03.170 --> 00:55:05.740 align:middle line:84%
and the royal
bloodlines and the dark,

00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:07.760 align:middle line:84%
sinister activities
of the governments,

00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:11.604 align:middle line:84%
which could be seen as a
depressing lot of information.

00:55:11.604 --> 00:55:13.020 align:middle line:84%
But I think we've
come out of that

00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:18.410 align:middle line:84%
and seen it as a foundation and
a part of liberating knowledge

00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:21.370 align:middle line:84%
and information that gives us
the foundation from which we

00:55:21.370 --> 00:55:23.870 align:middle line:84%
can build these
future communities

00:55:23.870 --> 00:55:27.210 align:middle line:84%
of abundance and united
people that create

00:55:27.210 --> 00:55:30.230 align:middle line:84%
abundance in beautiful
communities that work together

00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:32.890 align:middle line:84%
in cooperation
and collaboration,

00:55:32.890 --> 00:55:37.750 align:middle line:84%
getting to the point of how to
do it, how to use communities,

00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:40.890 align:middle line:84%
and the political
arms to work together.

00:55:40.890 --> 00:55:43.070 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the
political arena

00:55:43.070 --> 00:55:46.060 align:middle line:84%
is a tool we can
use and should use

00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:50.460 align:middle line:84%
and must use to help us
possibly fast track this much

00:55:50.460 --> 00:55:52.960 align:middle line:84%
quicker than we could have
imagined, because we use

00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:56.400 align:middle line:84%
the tools that they created
against us to actually serve us

00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:57.370 align:middle line:90%
for a change.

00:55:57.370 --> 00:56:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And the political arena
can serve us very quickly

00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:02.850 align:middle line:90%
if we use it cleverly.

00:56:02.850 --> 00:56:04.840 align:middle line:90%
So I suggest that we do that.

00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:07.650 align:middle line:84%
And we can see
the implementation

00:56:07.650 --> 00:56:11.050 align:middle line:84%
of these first utopian
communities very,

00:56:11.050 --> 00:56:13.450 align:middle line:84%
very quickly,
possibly within months

00:56:13.450 --> 00:56:16.390 align:middle line:84%
based on the elections coming
up in various countries,

00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:19.370 align:middle line:84%
including South Africa, the
local municipal elections

00:56:19.370 --> 00:56:21.440 align:middle line:90%
in 2016.

00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:24.320 align:middle line:84%
So to end on a
high note, I would

00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:28.070 align:middle line:84%
like to say this-- that all
this knowledge that we've

00:56:28.070 --> 00:56:31.900 align:middle line:84%
taken and brought together into
this room and into the studio

00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:35.840 align:middle line:84%
and shared with ourselves and
captured on camera for others

00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:42.420 align:middle line:84%
to share and absorb and resonate
with, it ends on the high note.

00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:49.740 align:middle line:84%
We can achieve all of this-- and
it starts in one little town.

00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:53.940 align:middle line:84%
That's how powerful this
simple philosophy is.

00:56:53.940 --> 00:56:57.720 align:middle line:84%
It starts with one little town
that will be the first domino

00:56:57.720 --> 00:57:02.590 align:middle line:84%
to fall and start to bring down
the global, capitalist control

00:57:02.590 --> 00:57:07.880 align:middle line:84%
over humanity and allow us
all to live in communities

00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:11.780 align:middle line:84%
of our choice, in utopian
societies of abundance

00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:13.970 align:middle line:90%
and harmony and unity.

00:57:13.970 --> 00:57:17.290 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for participating
in this workshop.

00:57:17.290 --> 00:57:19.770 align:middle line:84%
I really appreciate
your time and energy.

00:57:19.770 --> 00:57:21.490 align:middle line:84%
It was fantastic
sharing it with you

00:57:21.490 --> 00:57:24.550 align:middle line:84%
and everyone that is going to
be watching this in their homes.

00:57:24.550 --> 00:57:26.170 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for watching this.

00:57:26.170 --> 00:57:27.850 align:middle line:90%
And let's make this a reality.

00:57:27.850 --> 00:57:31.260 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we are the
creators of our own reality.

00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:34.750 align:middle line:84%
It's up to us what we
do with this information

00:57:34.750 --> 00:57:35.930 align:middle line:90%
into the future.

00:57:35.930 --> 00:57:39.240 align:middle line:84%
Let's start manifesting
this reality for ourselves.

00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:40.250 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for watching.

00:57:40.250 --> 00:57:42.730 align:middle line:84%
Go out there and share this
with everyone you know,

00:57:42.730 --> 00:57:46.410 align:middle line:84%
because once they've heard
it, they can never unhear it.

00:57:46.410 --> 00:57:47.210 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:57:47.210 --> 00:57:50.613 align:middle line:90%


00:57:50.613 --> 00:57:51.413 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

00:57:51.413 --> 00:57:53.960 align:middle line:90%


00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:54.760 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, everyone.

00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:57.832 align:middle line:90%


00:57:57.832 --> 00:57:59.126 align:middle line:90%
Cheers.

00:57:59.126 --> 00:58:02.160 align:middle line:90%
Thanks so much.

00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:08.368 align:middle line:90%
