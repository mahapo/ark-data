Humans together with dinosaurs, Surgeries on the heart of open bodies, unexplainable maps with rivers and coast lines. Often accused to be falsifications of the present day, analysis of geologists have found out, that the engraving of some incredible motives lie under a oxidation layer which is many thousands years old. As a surgeon, Cabrera operated on poor Indians who could not afford to pay for the medical procedure. They thanked <br/>with dusty figurines and engraved stones, which Cabrera himself originally classified as fakes. Until the year 1966 Cabrera did not care about archaeology at all. But he received more and more of these strange stones. Asking back the local Indios, they only told him, that they are out of underground depots, which have to be kept secret - otherwise they would be destroyed by the officials.  The more intensively Cabrera studied his collection of curiosities, the more suspicious he became. And the story became even more complicate, as the the forger Basilo Uschuya had confided to a journalist named Andreas Faber-Kaiser that the engraved stones were genuine except for the few hundred that he had imitated to sell to tourists. However, he would always publicly claim that everything was fake. Asked why he was playing this fake game, Uschuya replied: If I sell stones with real, old engravings, I have to deal with the local Indians, and they cant take a joke when it comes to their cultural heritage. Plus, Im going straight to jail. Cabrera, unsure of what was ancient and what was modern, took four stones that he suspected must be old and had two surveys done. The first was done by geologist Dr. Eric Wolf of the Mauricio Hochschild mining company in Lima, and the second by the Facultad de Minas of the Lima Technical University (signed on behalf of the faculty by Dr. Fernando de la Casa and Dr. Cesar Sotillo). Both expertises confirmed the great age of the engravings. This statement was possible because the engravings were covered by a fine but natural oxidation layer, which must be many millennia old. In 1976 Erich von Däniken visited Dr. Cabrera together with the chief designer of NASA at that time, Joseph Blumrich. He gave them four samples of ancient and modern engravings. Photos under the microscope proved the glaring difference between the false and the genuine engravings.</td></tr><tr><td>Place</td><td></td><td>Ica</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td></td><td>Peru</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/ramar/Artefact.png","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.5,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[-75.729471,-14.064424,0]}},{"id":11,"name":"Ancient galvanic battery","description":"<!--HTML-->\r\n<table><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><img src=\"http://ramar.space/wp-content/uploads/formidable/5/Bild-023.0001.jpg\" alt=\"Ancient galvanic battery\" style=\"width:360px\"></td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td></td><td>Ancient galvanic battery</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td></td><td>The National Museum in Baghdad, Iraq, displays a device consisting of a terra-cotta vase, eighteen centimters high, with a bronce and metalic inlay construction.

So there was an original, the model, and a copy made by Moses.<br/><br/>But the ark was dangerous. Only specially trained priests, the Levites, were allowed to operate it. In connection with it, several deaths are recorded in ancient Jewish literature. After many aberrations, the Ark of the Covenant arrived in the Temple of Jerusalem. There it was stolen by a son of King Solomon, and taken to Ethiopia in a flying chariot. In faraway Ethiopia, the Queen of Sheba ruled, and she had an intimate relationship with Solomon. All this can be read in the Ethiopians Book of the Kings: Kebra Nagast.<br/><br/>When also in Ethiopia 3000 soldiers died because they came too close to the Ark of the Covenant, the Queen of Sheba had the Ark buried deep in the ground. Today, the Chapel of Mary in the city of Axum stands on the same spot. (Coptic Church) Ethiopian tradition reports that the contents of the Ark were divine and not made by human hands.

A very interesting idea is that they could represent the 5 platonic solids (Keith Critchlow Time Stands Still: New Light on Megalithic Science). They could have been used to study spherical geometry.

The first one is from Eric von Danikens book Return to the stars in 1969. The second source is from ISRPPA homepage (International Society for the Research and Preservation of Paranormal Artifacts).<br/><br/>Summary from Eric von Daniken Return to the stars (Excerpt is limited due to the length of text):<br/>Kassantsev reported especially about the strange findings in the Chinese mountain massif Baian Kara Ula. A story that seems like a fairy tale. Now this is Kassantsevs report: It was in 1938 when the Chinese archaeologist Tschi Pu Tei discovered in the mountain caves of Baian Kara Ula in the Chinese-Tibetan border area some row graves. He found small skeletons of beings with diminutive physique, which nevertheless possessed rather large skulls. On the walls of the caves he discovered petroglyphs depicting beings with round helmets. The celestial bodies, the sun and moon, were also carved into the rocks and<br/>connected by bundles of pea-sized dots. Tschi Pu Tei and his helpers were able to find, and this is the sensational thing, 716 plates of granite rock. Plates that are two centimeters thick and look very much like our long-playing records. These stone plates have a hole in the center, from which a double-tracked grooved writing spirals lead out to the edge of the plate.<br/>The Chinese archaeologists knew that in this deserted area the the Dropa and Kham (Sikang) tribes had once lived in this deserted area. And of these hill tribes anthropologists said that they had been had been of small stature, growing to an average height of only 1.30 meters tall.... ...Dr. Vyacheslav Saizew just published now excerpts from the stone plate report in the magazine Sputnik. The report is kept in the Beijing Academy and in the Taipei Historical Archives of Taipei in Formosa.<br/>And what is so explosive and shocking about the Stone Plate Report?<br/>The report is only exciting and strange for those who are reluctant to look at new perspectives of our ancestry. The dropa stone report claims that, going back from today, 12,000 years ago a group of their people were transported to the third planet of this system. Their air vehicles - that is an exact translation of the grooved hieroglyphs - would not have had enough power or strength to leave this world again. They would have been in the in the mountains, which are far away and difficult to access.<br/>Means and possibilities to build new air vehicles would not have existed  ... .... Are there any additions that corroborate the stone plate report in its real content? There are the row graves, the petroglyphs, and the stone plates themselves. But there are also the Chinese sagas, which come precisely from the the Baian Kara Ula area and narrate of small spindly yellow creatures  who descended from the clouds. The myths also narrate that the alien creatures were avoided by the Dropas because of their ugliness, and that they were killed by the men nimble creatures .<br/><br/>Excerpt form ISRPPA:<br/>In 1938, an archeological expedition led by Dr. Chi Pu Tei into the Baian-Kara-Ula mountains of China made an astonishing discovery in some caves that had apparently been occupied by some ancient culture. Buried in the dust of ages on the cave floor were hundreds of stone disks. Measuring about nine inches in diameter, each had a circle cut into the center and was etched with a spiral groove, making it look for all the world like some ancient phonograph record some 10,000 to 12,000 years old. The spiral groove, it turns out, is actually composed of tiny hieroglyphics that tell the incredible story of spaceships from some distant world that crash-landed in the mountains. The ships were piloted by people who called themselves the Dropa, and the remains of whose descendents, possibly, were found in the cave.<br/><br/>According to Dr. Tsum Um Nuis translations, one of the lines of the hieroglyphs read,<br/><br/>The Dropas came down from the clouds in their aircraft. The men, women and children of the neighboring peoples (Ham) hid in the caves ten times before sunrise. When at last they understood the sign language of the Dropas, they realized that the newcomers had peaceful intentions....<br/><br/>Another section of the writings expressed regret by the Ham tribe that the aliens spaceship had crash-landed in such a remote and inaccessible mountains and that there had been no way of building a new one to enable the Dropas to return to their own planet. In the years since the discovery of the first disk, archeologists and anthropologists had learned more about the isolated Bayan-Kara-Ula area. Much of what they learned seemed to corroborate the bizarre story recorded on the discs. Legend still preserved in the area spoke of small, gaunt, yellow faced men who came from the stars, long, long ago.<br/><br/>Current Location<br/>There are no completly intact stones known to remain in existance.

In it he claimed that together with some colleagues he had found traces of beings on a fossilized sandy beach in Rockcastle County, Kentucky, USA, which must have been human-like. Burroughs: The footprints are impressed into the horizontal surface of a hard, massive gray sandstone. There are three pairs of tracks showing impressions from the left and right feet...each footprint has five toes and a pronounced arch.<br/><br/>The site of the find, along with the footprints, was authenticated by several experts. Geologist Prof. C. Gilmore confirmed that the prints were in a rock layer that definitely belonged to the Carboniferous era. This was flatly impossible. The age of Carboniferous the  was some 320 million years in the past, and at that time there could have been no human-like creatures that also walked on two legs. An ethnologist noted, probably the footprints were carved into the ground by an indigenous tribe. So the prints were examined microscopically. The images showed grains of sand between the toes and on the heels that were more closely packed together than the grains next to the feet. This proved the pressure of the body on the heels and the toes. Moreover, the images under the microscope showed no traces of any artificial processing. Nevertheless, all the expert anthropologists declared that the prints must be fakes because bipeds did not exist in the Carboniferous era. The June 1939  magazine wrote: We admit that we do not know exactly how the tracks were made, but we do know that one creature could not have been, and that is man in the Carboniferous. And in the journal  a Dr. Albert Ingalls scoffed: Asking a scientist about man in the Carboniferous is like asking the historian about diesel engines in ancient Sumer. Science knows that these prints are not from a man in the Carboniferous unless 2 and 2 are 7 or the Sumerians would have had airplanes and radios.<br/><br/>Source: Burroughs, W.G.: Human like footprints, 250 million years old.

Though these propositions have been questioned, it is considered likely by some scholars that the tool was used for simple mathematical procedures or to construct a numeral system.<br/><br/>Also, during earlier excavations at the Ishango site in 1959, another bone was also found.

The artifact possibly held a piece of quartz like the more well-known bone or it could have been a tool handle. The 14-cm long bone has 90 notches on six sides, which are categorized as major or minor according to their length. Jean de Heinzelin interpreted the major notches as being units or multiples and the minor notches as fractions or subsidiary. He believed the bone to be an interchange rule between bases 10 and 12.

A. Cremo & Richard I. Thompson:<br/>GROOVED SPHERE FROM SOUTH AFRICA <br/><br/>Over the past several decades. South African miners have found hundreds of <br/>metallic spheres, at least one of which has three parallel grooves running around its equator. <br/>According to an article by J. Jimison, the spheres are of two types — one of solid bluish <br/>metal with white flecks, and another which is a hollow ball filled with a white spongy <br/>center. Roelf Marx, curator of the museum of Klerksdorp, South Africa, where some of <br/>the spheres are housed, said: The spheres are a complete mystery. They look man-made, <br/>yet at the time in Earths history when they came to rest in this rock no intelligent life <br/>existed. Theyre nothing like I have ever seen before. <br/><br/>We wrote to Roelf Marx for further information about the spheres. He replied in a <br/>letter dated September 12, 1984: There is nothing scientific published about the globes, <br/>but the facts are: They are found in pyrophyllite, which is mined near the little town of <br/>Ottosdal in the Western Transvaal. This pyrophyllite is a quite soft secondary mineral with <br/>a count of only 3 on the Mohs scale and was formed by sedimentation about 2.8 billion <br/>years ago. On the other hand the globes, which have a fibrous structure on the inside with a <br/>shell around it, are very hard and cannot be scratched, even by steel. The Mohs scale of <br/>hardness is named after Friedrich Mohs, who chose ten minerals as references points for <br/>comparative hardness, with talc the softest (1) and diamond the hardest (10). <br/><br/>In his letter to us, Marx said that A. Bisschoff, a professor of geology at the <br/>University of Potchefstroom, told him that the spheres were limonite concretions. <br/>Limonite is a kind of iron ore. A concretion is a compact, rounded rock mass formed by <br/>localized cementation around a nucleus. <br/><br/>One problem with the hypothesis that the objects are limonite concretions concerns <br/>their hardness. As noted above, the metallic spheres cannot be scratched with a steel point, <br/>indicating they are extremely hard. But standard references on minerals state that limonite <br/>registers only 4 to 5.5 on the Mohs scale, indicating a relatively low degree of hardness. <br/>Furthermore, limonite concretions usually occur in groups, like masses of soap bubbles <br/>stuck together. They do not, it seems, normally appear isolated and perfectly round, as is <br/>the case with the objects in question. Neither do they normally appear with parallel grooves <br/>encircling them.  <br/><br/>For the purposes of this study, it is the sphere with three parallel grooves around its <br/>equator that most concerns us. Even if it is conceded that the sphere itself is a limonite <br/>concretion, one still must account for the three parallel grooves. In the absence of a <br/>satisfactory natural explanation, the evidence is somewhat mysterious, leaving open the <br/>possibility that the South African grooved sphere — found in a mineral deposit 2.8 billion <br/>years old — was made by an intelligent being.</td></tr><tr><td>Place</td><td></td><td>Ottosdal</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td></td><td>South Africa</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/ramar/Artefact.png","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.5,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[26.051332,-26.820292,0]}},{"id":111,"name":"Legends and Mysteries of the Aborigines Australia","description":"<!--HTML-->\r\n<table><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><img src=\"http://ramar.space/wp-content/uploads/formidable/5/Aborigines01.png\" alt=\"Legends and Mysteries of the Aborigines Australia\" style=\"width:360px\"></td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td></td><td>Legends and Mysteries of the Aborigines Australia</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td></td><td>The Aborigines talk about the so called Dreamtime but a more precise translation would be Time of the Gods.

Also, the Aborigines have many legends about Gods, so called Wandjinas that came from the sky to teach the young human-race about culture and art and science. There is also an interesting legend from the Great Sandy Desert area in the northern part of Western Australia comes a story that explains how the Wolfe Creek Crater, or Kandimalal, was created by a star falling from heaven, creating a crater in which a Rainbow Serpent took up residence, though in some versions it is the Serpent which falls from heaven and creates the crater. (Source: Sanday, Peggy Reeves (2007). Aboriginal Paintings of the Wolfe Creek Crater: Track of the Rainbow Serpent. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology). Interestingly, the serpent is sometimes ascribed with a having crest or a mane or on its head, or being bearded as well (Source: Brandenstein (1982), p. 64) which is very similar to descriptions and depictions of Quetzalcoatl, the feathered serpent in the Aztec Culture.<br/>Another legend from of the Aborigines tells the following story:<br/>The Yolŋu people of northern Australia say that the constellation of Orion, which they call Julpan (or Djulpan), is a canoe. They tell the story of three brothers who went fishing, and one of them ate a sawfish that was forbidden under their law. Seeing this, the Sun-woman, Walu, made a waterspout that carried him and his two brothers and their canoe up into the sky. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginal_astronomy<br/>There are other aboriginal legends that feature a similar theme:<br/>The Wirangu people of the west coast of South Australia have a creation story embodied in a songline of great significance based on the Pleiades. In the story, the hunter (the Orion constellation) is named Tgilby. Tgilby, after falling in love with the seven sisters, known as Yugarilya, chases them out of the sky, onto and across the earth. He chases them as the Yugarilya chase a snake, Dyunu. The Boonwurrung people of the Kulin nation of Victoria tell the Karatgurk story, which tells of how a crow robbed the seven sisters of their secret of how to make fire, thus bringing the skill to the people on earth. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginal_astronomy<br/><br/>There are many depictions of strange beings and objects in the aboriginal rock-art and petroglyphs which look a lot like modern extraterrestrials and ufos. The great mystery of these rock arts lies in the fact that no one can say with certainty what our ancient ancestors wanted to illustrate with the pictorial representations of these mysterious beings. Where did our ancestors get the inspiration to depict these beings?

In 1958 Victor, Lord Rothschild, sold it to the British Museum, where it is on display ever since.<br/><br/>The mystery of the cup lies within the glass material that it s made of. To be precise, dichroic glass, which shows a different colour depending on whether or not light is passing through it: red when lit from behind and green when lit from in front. It is the only complete Roman glass object made from this type of glass, and the one exhibiting the most impressive change in colour. This effect is achieved by making the glass with tiny proportions of nanoparticles of gold and silver dispersed in colloidal form throughout the glass material. Even on the  Wikipedia website it s stated: Quote: The process used (to create this type of glass) remains unclear!<br/><br/>How could an ancient culture possess the knowledge of nanoparticles and also know how to use it to achieve this effect?</td></tr><tr><td>Place</td><td></td><td>British Museum</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td></td><td>United Kingdom</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/ramar/Artefact.png","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.5,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[-0.126957,51.519413,0]}},{"id":119,"name":"Machine of Antikytera","description":"<!--HTML-->\r\n<table><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><img src=\"http://ramar.space/wp-content/uploads/formidable/5/Bild-478.0005.jpg\" alt=\"Machine of Antikytera\" style=\"width:360px\"></td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td></td><td>Machine of Antikytera</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td></td><td>This mechanism was found in wreck near the island of Antikytera in 1900.

The monastery is settled in the picturesque valley of the Bistrica river surrounded by the mountains and forests of the Prokletije mountain range It is the largest and best preserved medieval monastery in Serbia. During its turbulent history the Monastery was an important spiritual centre with developed artistic and intellectual activities.

Two objects with figures inside can be in the top left and top right of the fresco. Enlargements of these objects are shown above. The fresco is located above the altar at the Visoki Decani monastery in Kosovo, Serbia. The angel top left shows a bright female personification while gesturing to the Sun. The opposite shows a dark personification on the other side of the Moon. This juxtaposition of light and dark, positive and negative, Yin and Yan is central to interpretation of picture as representing mans redemption through Christs death. <br/><br/>The meaing of the symbols in the picture are heavily debated in the scientific community and the true interpretation of these images is still very controversial.<br/><br/>Dragana Van de moortel-Ilic mentions in her research-paper that on the Serbian television Pink news broadcast of 7 December 2009, witnesses stated that they spotted unidentified flying objects in the sky above Novi Sad, resembling lights in the shape of triangles.

He listened to the Indios: for hours, or even days if need be.

Religious artifacts of the kind that aren’t exactly approved of by the Catholic Church; artifacts that their families had kept hidden from the white men for hundreds of years. Father Crespi initially placed the objects against the wall of his inner courtyard. But as their number increased, he was forced to start piling them up in a shed behind the church. The flow of gifts, however, didn’t let up and Crespi was forced to open up two further rooms in which he piled up some of the most amazing treasures that I have ever seen.

At the time, like Yikesell, Wallace Lane, and Virginia Maxey were looking for minerals and were particularly on the lookout for geodes. The three owned a souvenir shop in Olancha, and they knew very well that geodes could be sold for a lot of money. This is because there are magnificent crystals inside a geode. About 120 meters above Owens Lake, the three discovered an irregularly shaped geode and laboriously hauled their find home. The next day, Mike Mikesell wanted to saw the rock in half to get to the crystals on the inside. As always, he used a diamond saw. Suddenly the saw snapped. A new saw blade suffered the same fate. Now the hard-working finders suspected that there might be a particularly valuable mineral inside the geode, perhaps even a diamond. They finally succeeded in splitting the geode in half with a great deal of effort and the assistance of a hammer and chisel. Their surprise could not have been greater: The outer skin consisted of a layer of sea fossils. This was followed by a layer that reminded them of petrified wood. Finally, there were two rings of a porcelain-like material, which in turn contained a plain pin 2 millimeters in diameter and 17 millimeters in length. That is what had broken the diamond saw. Geologists, none of whom want to reveal their name, estimate the age of the geode at about 500,000 years.</td></tr><tr><td>Place</td><td></td><td>Olancha, California</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td></td><td>United States</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/ramar/Artefact.png","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.5,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[-117.920821,36.499254,0]}},{"id":198,"name":"The Manna Machine","description":"<!--HTML-->\r\n<table><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><img src=\"http://ramar.space/wp-content/uploads/formidable/5/Mana_Machine01.jpg\" alt=\"The Manna Machine\" style=\"width:360px\"></td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td></td><td>The Manna Machine</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td></td><td>Description of the Manna machine from exceprt of George Sassoons Text in the magazine Sagenhafte Zeiten Issue No. 2/2002:<br/>The Manna Machine is mentioned in the book entitled The Kabbalah Unveiled by S. L. MacGregor Mathers which was first published in London in 1887 and has been reprinted and purchased ever since. It is a translation of various parts of the Sohar, an ancient Jewish mystical work, and it contains for the most part descriptions of an entity known as The Ancient of Days. According to Gershom Scholem, the worlds foremost expert on Kabbalah, the Sohar was originally written around 1290 by Moses de Leon, a Spanish Jew. The Sohar circulated in the Jewish community since then in manuscript and later in printed form.<br/>The Ancient of Days consisted in principle of three skulls, an outer one containing two others within it, one of which sat on top of the other. In the center of this arrangement was the main lamp with a brightness that exceeded any brightness. The object had a beard whose hair grew out of one part of the face and back in at another; no body is mentioned, but there is a strong right arm, there are six feet, and between them two testicles and a penis. A substance known as dew or the oil of the great deity ran down from the upper part of this object to be collected in the testicles and finally to run out of the penis. Eventually, some possible clues to the function of this Ancient of Days were found. He did not speak, did not move by himself, was carried through the desert and placed on various thrones that had to be dismantled to the next transport. We learn that its function was to produce manna. Couldnt it have been some kind of machine?<br/>The next question now is: Would it be possible to construct such a machine to produce a basic food using our current know-how - or a possible extrapolation? George Sassoon, Rodney Dale, and Martin Riches suggested that a manna-like substance could be obtained by intensive cultivation of some microscopic aquatic plants such as chlorella, a type of pond weed that reproduces extremely rapidly under appropriate environmental conditions. The main requirements for growth for Chlorella-like organisms are: Water, carbon dioxide, nitrogen and light. As for water, the upper part of the Ancient of Days consists of a surface that could extract water even from the dry air of the Sinai Desert, accumulating as dew; carbon and nitrogen would be available from the atmosphere and could be obtained for culture by circulating through the whiskers (tubes) in contact with the air through a semipermeable membrane. As for light, son the Sohar repeatedly mentions the main lamp inside the old one. Furthermore, of course, energy is required. Assuming an Israelite population of 600 families, one arrives at an amount of about 500 kg per day, which would be within the capacity of a small nuclear reactor. Such a reactor could easily convert nuclear energy into light energy, e.g., by using a neutron-charged laser light. Heat would thus also be produced, so that thermoelectric methods of obtaining electricity for controls and other auxiliary functions would be available. In turning algal sludge into edible manna, a cooking process must have been involved, for which the excess heat could be used, as well as for burning waste products. These waste products were secreted from the nose of the Ancient of Days, an exhaust pipe that caused the column of smoke and fire seen above the tabernacle when the machine was in operation.<br/><br/>With todays technology, it would be absolutely possible for us to produce such a machine to obtain a superfood from algae. But where did the ancient Jewish communities get this high-tech knowledge from or were even in possession of such a machine?</td></tr><tr><td>Place</td><td></td><td>Sinai Desert, Israel</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td></td><td>Egypt</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/ramar/Artefact.png","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.5,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[34,29.5,0]}},{"id":199,"name":"The map of admiral Piri Reis","description":"<!--HTML-->\r\n<table><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><img src=\"http://ramar.space/wp-content/uploads/formidable/5/Bild-021.0002.jpg\" alt=\"The map of admiral Piri Reis\" style=\"width:360px\"></td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td></td><td>The map of admiral Piri Reis</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td></td><td>The Piri Reis map was found at renovation works in the Topkapi-Palace in Istanbul.

She was buried with 19 jars of offerings.<br/><br/>Elongated Skulls have fascinated Palaeo-SETI researchers for a long time. However, contrary to the public perception, it is not the statement of the paleo-SETI experts that the elongated skulls must necessarily have an extraterrestrial origin, because it is known that many ancient cultures elongated their skulls using a technique known as fronto-occipital compression likely done with a cradleboard. The big question is, what inspired the ancient cultures to do so. Why did they use this technique to elongate their skulls?<br/>If it was possibly an ideal of beauty, where did the view that elongated skulls were considered beautiful come from? Could it be that our ancient ancestors actually encountered gods who had such elongated skulls and people wanted to conform to this ideal through this technique of skull elongation?</td></tr><tr><td>Place</td><td></td><td>Teotihuacan</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td></td><td>Mexico</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/ramar/Artefact.png","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.5,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[-98.872119,19.685267,0]}},{"id":214,"name":"Tomb plate of Pacal, Palenque","description":"<!--HTML-->\r\n<table><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><img src=\"http://ramar.space/wp-content/uploads/formidable/5/Bild-277.0001.jpg\" alt=\"Tomb plate of Pacal, Palenque\" style=\"width:360px\"></td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td></td><td>Tomb plate of Pacal, Palenque</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td></td><td>7 meters under the foundation of the temple of inscriptions (Templo de las inscriptiones) lies a triangular door with a cave behind.

Dr. Svetlana Balabanova proved by forensic tests the occurrence of New World alkaloids for mummification purposes in more than 3.000 Egyptian mummies. Dr. Görlitz wrote his doctor thesis about the out of place plants and artefacts, which must have been traded specifically over the oceans. <br/>In 1992 Dominique Goerlitz discovered the Lee-Board-Sailing-Technique on rock drawings in Upper Egypt dating from approximately 5,500 years ago. These lee boards were used as a keel on modern yachts. They allow the raft to sail across and even against the wind. In four big reed boat expeditions he experimentally proved the functionality of these lee-board for tacking across and against the wind. So, he already sailed with his reed boats across the North Atlantic, Mediterranean and Black Sea.<br/>Vanilla, pineapple, cocain, tobacco - including pipes - Agave and many more relicts have been found in Middle East, Africa and Europe. How did they get here? A coincidental travel over thousands of miles over the oceans is not possible for certain reasons, which Dr. Görlitz explains in his thesis.
