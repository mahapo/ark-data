Angkor Wat is built out of around 5 million sandstone blocks with a weight up to 1,5t, transported from a quarry at least 40km away, which is an inredible achievement that still cant be explained up to day. Also does the conventional archological thesis propose that 1 ton of blocks would have been processed per minute for 37 years, which doesnt sound realistic to experts like Mohan Praveen. The main temple complex is sourrounded by a moat ( 1,5km x 1,3km). The centerpiece consists of a temple with 5 towers representing a Quincunx. The main tower is 65m high and hides a secret. A 27m deep vertical shaft leads to a stone box. What was the purpose of this box? The midday sun shines exactly in this deep shaft. Furthermore there is an alignment to spring equinox, when the sun rises exactly over the central tower. Angkor Wat is huge, yet all the walls are beautifully decorated with carvings showing scenes of the Ramayana and Mahabharata.

Photographs that were made from an Airplane showed strange spiral- and circular- shaped Structures. They were distributed over an area with a Diameter of 250 Kilometers. The Site was designated a cultural reservation in 1991.<br/>Although the settlement was burned and abandoned, much detail is preserved. Arkaim is similar in form but much better preserved than neighbouring Sintashta, where the earliest chariot was unearthed. The site was protected by two circular walls. There was a central square, surrounded by two circles of dwellings separated by a street. The settlement covered ca. 20,000 m2 (220,000 sq ft). The diameter of the enclosing wall was 160 m (520 ft). It was built from earth packed into timber frames, and reinforced with unburned clay brick, with a thickness of 4–5 m (13–16 ft). and a height of 5.5 m (18 ft). The settlement was surrounded with a 2 m (6 ft 7 in)-deep moat.<br/>Arkaim is dated around the 17th century BC and around 1,500 to 2,500 people could have lived in the settlement. Zdanovich also states that the whole complex was built according to the laws of Astronomy and Cosmology to use it as an Observatorium and Templecity. Arkaim is often called the Stonehenge of Russia.<br/>The People of Arkaim used Copper to create Weapons, sickles, axes, Arrows and Spearheads. Further Evidence shows that also Gold was manufactured in this Area. Scientists also discovered a Skeleton with an elongated Skull in Arkaim.<br/>Even though the site has been researched extensively, It s still unknown what Arkaim originaly was used for and why Arkaim was presumably burnt down and why it s citizens disappeared without a Trace.</td></tr><tr><td>Place</td><td></td><td>Kazakh Steppe, Bredinsky District, Chelyabinsk Oblast, Russia</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td></td><td>Russia</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/ramar/Site.png","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.5,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[59.571214,52.64916,0]}},{"id":20,"name":"Avebury henge","description":"<!--HTML-->\r\n<table><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><img src=\"http://ramar.space/wp-content/uploads/formidable/5/Alan-Sorrell.jpg\" alt=\"Avebury henge\" style=\"width:360px\"></td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td></td><td>Avebury henge</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td></td><td>Avebury henge was build 2.600 - 2.500 BC and is one of the largest neolithic stone circles of the British Islands. The henge is situated in the south west of England in the county of Wiltshire and consists of one big circle and two smaller circles surrounded by a large earth wall. Originally there where 154 sandstones building up the henge, today only 36 are remaining. Most of the stones where destroyed on instruction of the christian church in the 14th century, they considered this Pagan site as something evil. Four entrances lead inside the henge, two of them starting points for long Menhir roads. Archaeologists assume that Avebury was used as a ritual place but there is no clear evidence for that. Could these structures had an astronomical purpose or did the stones strengthen the earth energie? There is no question, this must have been an important place otherwise such efforts would not have been taken. There are a lot of older monuments nearby such as Silbury Hill, West Kennet Long Barrow and Windmill Hill. This prehistoric landscape is one of a kind you can find so much peace there. Maybe that is why our ancestors had chosen this special place for their unique Structures.<br/><br/>Excerpt from Maria Wheatleys homepage:<br/>As Avebury wasn’t included in their studies, Rodney Hale, David Webb, Busty Taylor and myself conducted a series of tests to investigate the background ionising radiation levels at selected locations within the Avebury Henge complex.<br/>Rodney Hale was one of the original members of the Dragon Project and developed some of the instruments used in their researches. I was delighted that he could join us. Using a recording Geiger counter we selected an area close to Avebury’s Obelisk marker stone, which marks the near centre of the southern inner circle. The area was monitored for 20 minutes, followed by 20 minutes at a point some 3 metres to the south. The readings were analysed by Rodney using the statistical ‘T-test’ to determine if there were any significant differences between the readings taken at the two locations. The expression ‘significant’ is commonly used when there is a probability of 95% or more that the difference really exists. However, no significant difference was detected at the Obelisk marker stone. <br/><br/>The next location was a central position near the North West end of the West Kennet Stone Avenue, which was monitored for 18 minutes, followed by 18 minutes outside of the avenue. The mean count within the avenue was 68.3 and outside it was 70.1, which does not calculate any difference but did register changes that we followed up. <br/><br/>Energy investigations at Avebury<br/>I suggested that we go to the Sanctuary on Overton Hill. According to the antiquarian, Dr. William Stukeley, the Sanctuary was the ‘Head of Avebury’s Serpent Temple’. The centre of the monument was chosen as it was sited above the crossing point of two earth currents, a geospiral and numerous fissure systems radiate from the centre making the location a geodetic hot-spot. <br/><br/>The Sanctuary – the stones were removed in 18th century. Today concrete markers depict their former positions and also the location of large timber posts. <br/><br/>It was monitored for 20 minutes, then 20 minutes outside of the site, and finally a further 15 minutes at the centre. When the readings were analysed by Rodney the results were startling as the levels of radiation were significantly higher at the centre than outside of the stone circle. Statistically there was a probability of about 98% that there was a real difference. Plotting the counts per minute at the Sanctuary showed an interesting effect seen clearly on the graph. <br/>Interestingly, this was the opposite result to the Dragon Project’s findings, which noted lower radiation within stone circles. Here we discovered something new and completely different. <br/><br/>Researchers have noted that natural radiation levels at ancient sites can produce strange and mysterious effects, such as flickering lights and even mirages have been reported. Mysterious lights are still being seen at the Sanctuary and one person told me that he saw a small flickering light emerge from the centre of the monument, which darted around for a while before suddenly disappearing.</td></tr><tr><td>Place</td><td></td><td>Avebury</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td></td><td>United Kingdom</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/ramar/Site.png","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.5,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[-1.8542,51.428541,0]}},{"id":22,"name":"Şona pyramids","description":"<!--HTML-->\r\n<table><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><img src=\"http://ramar.space/wp-content/uploads/formidable/5/sona1-1.jpg\" alt=\"Şona pyramids\" style=\"width:360px\"></td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td></td><td>Şona pyramids</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td></td><td>On the right bank of the Olt, 5 kilometers from the city of Făgăraş, in a village like any other, Şona, some extremely high elevations of earth have lasted for thousands of years, which look very much like some pyramids.<br/><br/>The pyramids at Şona are 8 mounds up to 30 meters high, arranged in two rows and, very interestingly, are arranged in order of height. The eight mounds can be seen from afar, but only after you approach them can you realize their impressive size. The perfect placement of the pyramids on two parallel lines was one of the starting points that gave rise to speculation.<br/><br/>Some historians assert that these mounds are nothing more than tombs of Celtic cheftains, who arrived in Transylvania before the Dacians. The population of those times used to bury their chiefs in large mounds of ground with their jewels and precious objects, but also used to make more such graves to discourage the thieves and evildoers. But the locals say out and loud that these ground mounds’ formation due to giants, who lived many years ago on this territory. The legend says that this land was ruled by a princess, whose name was Sona. One day, her kingdom was attacked by some giants came from Fagaras Mountains, went through the Olt River’s water and reaching this place, shook the mud from their feet and the threw away ground created these mounds. Villagers say that strange things are also happening in this area.  For example, meat won’t rot even if it’s left in the area for days while water will stay fresh and even become curative. Also, some locals were very curious to find out what’s hiding inside and therefore tried to dig into the mound, but they were stopped by the authorities.

The caves at Barabar and Nagarjuni are the earliest examples of rock-cut architecture in India and most of them consist of two chambers, carved entirely out of very hard granite, with a highly polished internal surface, the so called Mauryan polish also found on sculptures, and exciting accoustic resonance effects.<br/><br/>Scientists are still not sure how the caves have been carved out of the very hard granite rock and how they achieved such a mirror-like polish of the cavewalls (see picture section). Another mystery is the fact that the caves resonate to very specific frequencies and would therefor had to been built with a very high knowledge in accoustics and architecture.<br/><br/>Just recently, the BAM- (Builders of the ancient mysteries) research team did some very elaborate research at the caves including 3D-laserscans and archaeoaccoustic measurement. They found out that the architecture of the caves is very precise in their dimensions (2 to 8 milimeters on a length of more than 13 meters) and subsequent builders have never managed to achieve the same level of precision and finish again. We can see this mysterious fact in many places around the world, where the oldest structures are often the most precise and perfect. The accoustic properties of the caves are also highly sophisticated because the shape of the caves leads to a suppression of the echo in the caves in favor of accoustic resonance. The caves behave like resonance chambers and tests show that when you are standing in the center of the room, certain frequencies make precise body parts vibrate. The Karan Chopar cave resonates at a frequencies of 200 Hz, 400 Hz, 800 Hz, 1000 Hz and 1200 Hz. The Gopika cave resonates at 200 Hz, 400 Hz, 800 Hz and 1200 Hz.

Egyptology dates the Bent Pyramid back to the 4th dynasty, Old Kingdom, build by king Sneferu (2670-2620 B.C.). In his reign (approx.30 – 50 years) he built 3 pyramids, two of them are so called failures, the one in Meidum and the Bent Pyramid. His last one, the Red Pyramid in Dahshur was a succes. One of the facts that make the Bent Pyramid so special are the two different angles of its construction. At the lower part it starts with 55° to a height of 45m then the angle was changed to 43°. Due to foundation and construction problems the steep angle had to be changed to a flatter one. In 2014 a project named Time Scanners scanned the exterior of the Bent Pyramid. As a result they stated that the pyramid was designed like this, there where no foundation problems. A lot of casing stones are still in place because they are slightly sloping inwards. This pyramid is one of the best preserved ones in Egypt but sadly the least explored. The first exploration was done in 1839 by Perring. In 2012 the ISIDA-Project made the first colour pictures of the interior. And since 2019 the pyramid is open to tourists.The pyramid has two entrances one in the north and one in the west with two independent shaft systems. The northern entrance has a descending passage, an antechamber, a main chamber and a so called chimney. The chimney is quite interesting, it was build closely to the central pyramid axis, it has a deep shaft now covered with stones. It is not yet known how deep this shaft goes.The western entrance has also a descending passage a horizontal corridor with two blocking stones wich could me moved up and down. The upper chamber is in a very bad condition, there probably had been a lot of modification and even destruction during the last 4.500 years.Today the two shaft systems are connected by the winding passage (a roughly cut shaft). A lot of questions come to mind: did Sneferu really build 3 huge pyramids in 30-50 years? If the Bent Pyramid was a failure why finish it, why building a satellite pyramid, a valley and pyramid temple and even an enclosure wall. Why is this pyramid still standing and the shaft systems is not collapsed? Why two entrances? What was the purpose of the strange chimney? A lot of research should be done to answer this questions.</td></tr><tr><td>Place</td><td></td><td>Dahshur</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td></td><td>Egypt</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/ramar/Site.png","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.5,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[31.209497,29.790228,0]}},{"id":42,"name":"Chaco Canyon - Anasazi","description":"<!--HTML-->\r\n<table><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><img src=\"http://ramar.space/wp-content/uploads/formidable/5/Chaco_Canyon_Anasazi_Title.png\" alt=\"Chaco Canyon - Anasazi\" style=\"width:360px\"></td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td></td><td>Chaco Canyon - Anasazi</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td></td><td>The Anasazi people once lived in the southwestern United States. They left behind for posterity sites as fascinating as they were mysterious in the steep, impassable canyons of the barren land. Archaeologists puzzle over who designed the master plan for these astronomically oriented sites, which was followed for generations until the day the sacred centers were suddenly abandoned. Were the Anasazi following divine instructions?<br/><br/>Todays archaeologists are perplexed and intrigued by a phenomenon they have named the Chaco Phenomenon. Seemingly without transition, the Anasazi find themselves carrying out a building project that must have been designed, planned and executed by an entire team of architects, astronomers, mathematicians, civil engineers, masons, artists, designers and surveyors. If they had just built simple pit houses, now suddenly grandiose stone metropolises, Great Houses, as they are admired by archaeologists, were created, which look as if they had been designed on a drawing board.<br/><br/>Archaeologists are faced with a mystery: How could such a sudden cultural leap have happened? Who or what could have triggered it? The whole thing must have been deliberate, intelligent planning. A gigantic, interwoven, designed and planned construction project. Everything is in the exact place intended and calculated beforehand. Among Southwest archaeologists, there was talk of the mysterious master plan - but who had been these intelligent and high-level master planners? Where from all of a sudden this astonishing building logistics of people who shortly before knew only primitive earth-stone walls? These simple basket makers should have suddenly applied highly developed architecture, astronomy and engineering? What troubled archaeologists most was the suddenness of this cultural leap, which occurred sometime shortly before or after the year 800.<br/><br/>Studies and research by the Solstice Project, an interdisciplinary group of scientists focusing on archaeoastronomy, and other experts have revealed intriguing geometric-astronomical patterns in the Anasazi region since the 1980s. Archaeologists speak enthusiastically of cosmic landscape architecture or solar and lunar geometry. On a large scale, the master plan reflected the cycles of the sun and moon. Not a single building in the Chaco phenomenon stands in its place without a metric reason. There are several lines in Chaco Canyon alone that have been aligned to specific dates of the solar cycles, more often designed to lunar cycles. These connect Great Houses and Great Kivas with each other and cross each other, also including Outlier-Great-Houses. No archaeologist has yet found an answer to the question for what purpose all these lines were laid out.<br/><br/>But the most important question is this: Who were the mysterious master planners who were apparently suddenly there and had the master plan ready and waiting? There are traditions about Katchinas, culture bringers from the stars, who are said to have lived among the Indians for some time and then left again. Localities of the Chaco phenomenon appear again and again in the traditions about these Kachinas. In addition, strange star beings appear on petroglyphs of the period after the end of the Anasazi culture. Why has no Southwest archaeologist yet suspected a connection here? So, if no other known culture and not even the simple pit house Anasazi come into question as master planners - who then? Are we dealing with an intervention by representatives of an alien intelligence here?</td></tr><tr><td>Place</td><td></td><td>Chaco Canyon</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td></td><td>United States</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/ramar/Site.png","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.5,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[-107.955924,36.053,0]}},{"id":31,"name":"Bosnian Pyramids Visoko","description":"<!--HTML-->\r\n<table><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><img src=\"http://ramar.space/wp-content/uploads/formidable/5/bosnian_pyramid_full.jpg\" alt=\"Bosnian Pyramids Visoko\" style=\"width:360px\"></td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td></td><td>Bosnian Pyramids Visoko</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td></td><td>As the business man and alternative historian Semir Sam Osmanagich announced at an international press conference in October 2005 that he had visited Visoko in todays Bosnia-Herzegovina, and that he found the remains of two giant pyramids and ancient underground tunnel networks, it was the starting signal for a unique science crime, which continues to this day.<br/>There are many people, no doubt, from various scientists.

Many passages are very narrow and normal sized people have to crouch and squeeze through very small doorways.

The original two huge statues have been carved out of one single stone, after an earthquake they have been partially reconstructed. Erich von Däniken states that measurements gave 21 meters of height and each of them weighs a staggering 1000 tons of quartzite sandstone. The stones have been transported over 600 kilometeres away from the Mokkatam Hills.<br/><br/>Up to date it is not clear how these stones or statue have been transported and how this task has been accomplished with the methods and engineerings skills back then. For better understanding the following example is given, to give an impression, what labour and engineering skills must have been available back then. As example the relocation project of the Abu Simbel Temple is given. The Abu Simbel had to be relocated during the building process of the Aswan Dam. Multiple countries were involved in the planning and relocation project. 3000 measurements were made for the relocation plan and all parts of the temple, including statues as well, had to be cut into many parts. It was a giant challenge to accomplish. Also the most powerful cranes of the world were challenged as the cranes stock capabilities were maxed out and further assistance through machinery with hydraulic technology was required to achieve the goal. Now the question arises how the people over 3000 years ago did achieve this incredible task, where no hydraulic assisted super powerful cranes existed.<br/><br/>Dr. Erich von Däniken points out and emphasizes that the transportation and entire building process of the Colossi of Memnon statues was an impossible task to accomplish back in these ages where people lived in simple houses, in consideration with their engineering skills, level and technology available back then. Hence there must have been a kind of knowledge transfer to the ancient people, how to plan and construct. The possibility is given, that the information how to plan and construct at this level of engineering has been given from extra terrestrials, as well do countless stories exist in different cultures, how knowledge from so called gods or other beings has been transfered to humans. Until we dont know for sure how this extremely heavy statue has been transported back then or how they managed to aquire the necessary knowledge and the possibility exists for real, that extra terrestrials may have been involved, it remains a great mystery.</td></tr><tr><td>Place</td><td></td><td>Thebes, Egypt</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td></td><td>Egypt</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/ramar/Site.png","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.5,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[32.610433,25.72039,0]}},{"id":77,"name":"Fort Victoria - Zimbabwe","description":"<!--HTML-->\r\n<table><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><img src=\"http://ramar.space/wp-content/uploads/formidable/5/Bild-409.0001.jpg\" alt=\"Fort Victoria - Zimbabwe\" style=\"width:360px\"></td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td></td><td>Fort Victoria - Zimbabwe</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td></td><td>Is it a castle or residence?

The construction consists of smaller standing stones which carry large cap stones weighing up to 10t. A lot of the granite boulders were flattened on one side, finally the stones were covered with an earth mound. How did they move, carve and transport these massive boulders? We have to overthink our view towards the neolithic people. They were able to plan and organize such projects, furthermore they knew about the celestial movements and aligned the tombs to special days of the year (equinoxes, solstices). In some constructions the megalithic yard can be detected ( 0,83m), it was a standard measure used all over europe in the neolithic.

Their dimensions, the straight lines and angles, are a unique contrast that sets the structure apart from the surrounding rocks. Like in a created order amidst the natural surrounding chaos. This structure is a testament to technological ingenuity in a distant intangible past. Reverentially, we enter the mighty entrance of the 12.7 x 7.7 m building ... and stand in a huge hall. One feels very small and marvels at the floating giants above. How was this gorgeous work accomplished, on a barren mountain, with the worst possible conditions? For each lifting, crane, trees would have had to be carried to the summit, each tool, each rope. Unimaginable.<br/>Even if the vegetation and climatic conditions were different at the time of construction, the monstrosity remains mysterious in terms of construction. The largest cover plate above the entrance measures 4 x 2 x 0.34 meters. We explore the walls and find countless slabs that have been worked into polygonal shapes for the purpose of better wedging.

It seems they build up a huge ring (2km diameter), not a perfect circle. The dimensions and the relation between the Durrington Shafts and other monuments  again show a deep understanding of mathematics and astronomy. These shafts were probably built by the Grooved Ware Culture between 2670 - 2550 B.C. For what purpose? One theory is that the pits could have been sound resonators for low frequency sound ( Durrington Shafts: 10 - 15 Hz). This sound could influence the state of consciousness and could be responsible for paranormal experience. The waves of low frequency sound travel through the earth, could the pits have been used for communication between distant points?<br/><br/>Excerpt from www.ancient-origins.net:<br/>Stonehenge Experiments<br/><br/>Supporting the idea that the ring of pits at Durrington might have functioned as sound resonators is work carried out in 1999 by chartered engineer Rodney Hale in the Stonehenge landscape. At two round barrows (Amesbury 43 & 47) he used an induction coil interacting with the earth’s magnetic field to measure the presence of low frequency activity. Resulting signals were amplified and recorded. Each tumulus was found to produce oscillatory readings showing the constant presence of ultra-low frequency (ULF) sub-audible sound vibrations in the range of 18 Hz in the first tumuli and 11 Hz in the second.* The amplitude of the sound could be increased by stamping on the ground, although Hale suspects that this could be quite easily affected by other factors including wind blowing across the surface of the tumulus.<br/><br/>Stonehenge tumuli vibrations.

(Image credit: Rodney Hale)<br/><br/>Stonehenge tumuli vibrations. Waveforms showing ultra-low frequency activity recorded by Rodney Hale during an experiment in 1999 at two round barrows in the Stonehenge landscape. (Image credit: Rodney Hale)<br/><br/>Tests showed that the ULF activity was present everywhere on the barrows, yet dropped off sharply around 30 centimeters (a foot) from the edge of the mounds. What these trial tests implied was the existence in each of a large hollow cavity or internal structure easily able to generate sound. Was it possible that other tumuli in the Stonehenge landscape had similar internal structures? Had this been part of their original design, to generate low frequency sound?<br/><br/>The resonant frequency of the pits making up Durrington Shafts was found to be in the range of 10 to 15 Hz, low enough to produce not only very low frequency activity, but also infrasound. This has been linked with everything from the creation of altered states of consciousness in human subjects to a go-to explanation for paranormal experiences such as the feeling of presences and the seeing of ghosts.<br/><br/>ULF activity as well as infrasound has been detected in the underground chambers of the Great Pyramid in Egypt, suggesting that this might have been a factor in the architectural design of such monuments. It should be recalled that the Great Pyramid dates to circa 2600 BC, exactly the same time as Durrington Shafts. That its pits generated a similar frequency range adds weight to the idea that they too acted as sound resonators. If so, then how might this have been amplified? And more importantly, to what end?</td></tr><tr><td>Place</td><td></td><td>Durrington</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td></td><td>United Kingdom</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/ramar/Site.png","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.5,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[-1.786984,51.192719,0]}},{"id":65,"name":"Easter Island","description":"<!--HTML-->\r\n<table><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><img src=\"http://ramar.space/wp-content/uploads/formidable/5/Bild-082083.0019.jpg\" alt=\"Easter Island\" style=\"width:360px\"></td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td></td><td>Easter Island</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td></td><td>Not only the impressive Moais (statues) are mysterious on this Island - carving, transport, purpose?

In 1889 Flinders Petrie found the entrance to the underground tunnel systems which are located on the north side of the pyramid. There is no direct connection between the pyramid and the tunnel system. Could the underground structure be much older and later the pyramid was build on top of it? There are 4 independent shaft systems but only through the so called tomb 10 one can get access to the pyramid (under the pyramid). The tunnels are very precisely cut into the bedrock. Most interestingly is tomb 10, the main chamber is build out of red granite and has a voulted ceiling (similar to the Menkaure Pyramid at Giza). The sarcophagus is an astonishing piece of work, it is so precisely and its corners are very sharp. Even for modern times it would be quite difficult to work so precisely. Strangely the sarcophagus is tilted 10cm to one side. If they could work so precisely, this was surely not by chance so what purpose had this tilt ? There is also no trace of a lid. The tunnels are very small, how could they bring  this massive granite block into place?

But it is actually not a single stone but a Trilith. As the word itself contains. It is a composition of three gigantic stone blocks. Officials are still disputing if it is naturally laid from the Reuss-glacier, or if its man made. We have stone hard proof, that the ancient giants were set up artificially. The formation is built on a moraine hill. This is loose gravel and stones, and the construction would just have submerged over the millennia. So, Georg Brunner (+) - he spent his whole life reevaluating this formation - was able to do a geo radar measurement. It clearly shows that there is a base construction for those giants.<br/><br/>A fourth stone plate is set up aside. Its purpose is to be a projection wall. Every year twice, in spring after March 21st (Equinox) and after September 21st a phantastic light show is displayed. In the afternoon from 4.45pm to 5.10pm the sun stands in an angle to send the light through the formation and displays a head of a wolf. Just for a few minutes.<br/><br/>The weight of the head stone is 55.3 tons ( 19.752 cubic meters) The approximate weight of the granite is 2.8 tons/cubic meter. This stone is on only three points in contact with the ones below, and this since the end of the last ice age. <br/>We also calculated the volume and weight of the carry-stones (only the part which is above ground). Boulder A is 43.95 tons, and boulder B, which carries the biggest part of the weight, is 14.29 tons. We dont know at the moment, how deep they go into the ground, where the foundation starts. The amazing thing is that block B has a footprint of only 2.78 square meters at floor level. But it holds the main load of the capstone.

Juan Armenta Camacho (in 1959) Hanna Marie Wormington (in 1962), Cynthia Irwin Williams (in 1962, 1964, 1966) and Virginia Steen-McIntyr (in 1966), Marshall Payn (in 1997) and Nick Carter (in 1997) analyzed several specimen in order to date the archeological site where ancient stone tools have been found. They analyzed the remains with different kind of age-dating methods, all dating methods suggested the remains where over 250000 and up to 500000 years old. This age dating is very controversial to the modern anthropological view point in science which says humans settled in Central America around 12000-13000 years ago. Also Virgina Steen-McIntyr has been dismissed from the archeological community after publishing these controversial age-dating numbers, which makes this mystery even more profound. Michael Cremo and other researchers mention this case deeply. Also extremely strange but not less interesting is that all artifacts disappeard which have been found at this site, which seem to corroborate that a conspiracy has been going on in this case. Stories as of Jose Lorenzo exist where this man has sent armed guys to chase away the archeologists working on the site, because he wanted to stop the project because of the dating results which were contrary to mainstream science.

It is the center of one of the most important prehistoric cultures. At the site of Lepenski Vir, the remains of sacral architecture were discovered from 7000 to 6000 years before the new era. What Lepenski Vir makes famous today and recognizable in the world are discoveries that are chronologically linked to the Mesolithic. Planned lifted settlements with habitats and sanctuaries of the trapezoidal base, necropolises that point to special funeral rituals, monumental stone sculptures and numerous finds of bones and stone testify that this site was not only a settlement, but also a sacral center. At the time when it was discovered, Lepenski Vir was an isolated phenomenon, and this situation did not change significantly until today. Unlike other parts of Europe, in which there are only scarce testimonies of the Mesolithic, remains of Lepenski Vir have been found that enable the complete reconstruction of culture, art and society of that period.<br/><br/>Archaeoastronomical research was also carried out at the site of Lepenski Vir. The first archaeoastronomical surveys were conducted during the winter solstice in 2014. They pointed to the possibility of a double sunrise occurring during the summer solstice. The volcanic hill Treskavac, which is located across the Danube from Lepenski Vir, has a rocky outcropping near the top and an inclination higher than the inclination of the Suns apparent orbit. The Sun appears above Treskavac, then goes behind the outcropping and reappears again. The phenomenon was observed and confirmed during the summer solstice of 2015. The phenomenon was investigated by Pavlović and Aleksandra Bajić, who published their findings in 2016 book The Sun of Lepenski Vir. The results show that the double sunrise was visible from the northernmost part of the settlement. Viewed from the southernmost part, the summer solstice Sun rose on the southern part of the flattened top of Treskavac. So, the whole settlement was accurately measured with respect to the astronomical event.<br/><br/>The people of Lepenski Vir also depicted strange Fish-like Beings in their scupltures. Was this due to the close proximity of the site to river Danube and the sculptures represent some kind of God of the River or maybe even perceived ancestors which were half human, half fish?<br/><br/>For more information about the archeological literature, see Dragoslav Srejović.</td></tr><tr><td>Place</td><td></td><td>Boljetin</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td></td><td>Serbia</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/ramar/Site.png","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.5,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[22.026558,44.556839,0]}},{"id":113,"name":"Lepsius-I-Pyramid","description":"<!--HTML-->\r\n<table><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><img src=\"http://ramar.space/wp-content/uploads/formidable/5/Lepsius_Pyramid_Pic01.jpg\" alt=\"Lepsius-I-Pyramid\" style=\"width:360px\"></td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td></td><td>Lepsius-I-Pyramid</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td></td><td>The base length of the pyramid, according to calculations by archaeologist Nabil M.

The pyramid was constructed of simple mud bricks without straw as filler around a large rock core. The courses of the bricks slope inward at 75°-76°, similar to the stone courses of the stepped pyramids of the 3rd Dynasty.<br/><br/>What makes this mighty pyramid a great mystery is the fact that archaeologists do not know exactly when it was built and by whom (it owes its enigmatic name to the Egyptologist Karl Richard Lepsius, who placed it first in his list of pyramids of Egypt).

The mound of Maeshowe is 7 m high and 35 m in diameter, it has a main chamber (4,7m x 4,7m, 3,8 m high) and 3 side chambers build out of  sandstone blocks, the heaviest weighs 3t. In the 12 century A.D., vikings carved 30 inscriptions in the sandstone walls, it is one of the largest collection of runes in Europe. There is a special alignment at Maeshowe, at winter solstice the last sun rays shine through the 11 m long passage, illuminating the main chamber (same as Newgrange, Ireland). It marks the end of the darkest time of the year, when the light is returning again. Another interesting fact is the acoustics at Meshowe, there are parts of extrem high and low sound which have been analyzed by Dr. Aaron Watson. The West Mainland of Orkney has a lot more ancient monuments such as the Standing Stones of Stenness, the Ring of Brodgar and Skara Brae.<br/><br/>Excerpt from http://www.orkneyjar.com:<br/>After repeated visits to measure and record audio data, Dr Watson is of the opinion that sound played an integral part in the rituals and ceremonies surrounding sites such as Maeshowe and the Ring of Brodgar.<br/><br/>His research shows that certain prehistoric monuments exhibit specific sonic effects – effects that would have been impossible for Neolithic man to explain. As such, were they interpreted as having an “otherworldly” source?<br/><br/>At Maeshowe, for example, specific pitches of vocal chant, as well as drumming, inside the cairn produced specific, unsettling, effects in those present.<br/><br/>In the chamber, the behaviour of sound was seen to be considerably different from that of the outside world, with the ancient stone walls amplifying noise to create a variety of audio effects.<br/><br/> One of these effects is the phenomenon known as standing waves. These produce distinct areas of high and low intensity as the sound waves interact – either cancelling each other out, or combining to enhance, the sound.<br/><br/>This effect means that by moving through the chamber, the listener experiences areas of high and low volume that appear to have no relationship to the source of the sound. <br/><br/>....  In Maeshowe, a drum was used and the researchers discovered that the correct frequency was 2 hz. This is an infrasonic frequency which means that, although inaudible to humans, it can be felt as distinct physical, or psychological, sensation.<br/><br/>Test subjects reported the feeling that sounds were emerging from inside their head and body. They experienced feelings of dizziness, nausea, headaches, flying sensations and also that their pulse-rate was being affected.<br/><br/>Dr Watson suggests that prolonged exposure to these sounds could have had a profound effect - an effect that Neolithic man could only ascribe to the supernatural.<br/><br/>So were the tombs built with these scientific phenomena in mind?</td></tr><tr><td>Place</td><td></td><td>Mainland Orkney, Scotland</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td></td><td>United Kingdom</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/ramar/Site.png","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.5,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[-3.187881,58.996549,0]}},{"id":122,"name":"Masuda-no-iwafune - Gigantic boulder with perfect carvings - Age unknown","description":"<!--HTML-->\r\n<table><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><img src=\"http://ramar.space/wp-content/uploads/formidable/5/Masuda-no-iwafune-Masudas-Berg-Schiff-5-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Masuda-no-iwafune - Gigantic boulder with perfect carvings - Age unknown\" style=\"width:360px\"></td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td></td><td>Masuda-no-iwafune - Gigantic boulder with perfect carvings - Age unknown</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td></td><td>Masuda-mountain-ship?

Many prehistoric settlements and sacred sites of the ancient peoples of this area, which disappeared into nothingness, are still waiting here for their explorers.<br/><br/>One of these sites, inappropriately named Stone Tomb, is located not far from the city of Melitopol, on the bank of the Molochnaya River. Some researchers believe that this consecrated site would have had another name, Bog-Gora, the God Mountain, even in the times of the Kyiv Old Russia epoch. In the course of thousands of years this land has been shrouded in legends. As Herodotus tells, Heracles is said to have come here in Cimmerian times to perform his heroic deeds; the pugnacious Amazons lived here, and later the royal Scythians buried their kings on this territory. The Celtic legends ascribe to the druid Merlin that he was born in this mystical land, and so it is not surprising that until our present time Brahmins and sensitive people make pilgrimages to the ancient stone tomb.<br/><br/>Excavations indicate that this huge stone mound may be the oldest sanctuary on earth, as the prehistoric site has existed for about 22000 years. On the walls of many caves and grottoes that do not reach very far into the mound, on the altars and ledges formed by nature, our ancestors left rock carvings from long ago. By means of these artistic works they tried to record the events of the fast passing time. It seems that over time, this peculiar archive was also worshipped and venerated by people who lived far outside this area (now called Priazowie).<br/><br/>The petroglyphs, made thousands of years ago, convey information about what our distant ancestors saw and knew. They do not contain distortions of meaning, which inevitably arise in the narrators who pass the traditions from generation to generation. The expeditions of N.I. Vesselovskaya, M.J. Rudinsky, V.N. Danilenko and V.M. Mikhailov, who investigated the Stone Tomb, did a colossal job, excavating the caves and making copies of the petroglyphs.<br/><br/>If one examines the petroglyphs on the walls of the stone tomb more closely, one notices something astonishing: namely, what the orthodox historians prefer to conceal. Thus, an unprejudiced researcher, looking closely at the stone archive of this archaeological monument, is struck first of all by an immense amount of representations, which are apparently based on technological elements. In fact, if we look at the objects and events depicted on the petroglyphs, the result is that their functioning could not have been known at all in the Stone Age or in the Chalcolithic period. The technologies engraved in stone are more comparable to those of the present, and even seem to surpass our present achievements.<br/><br/>The evaluation of the petroglyphs on the walls of the Neolithic stone tomb, which can be considered as an indication for the theory of paleo-Seti contacts, could result in a whole book. Certainly, one can ask whether the enigmatic representations of the stone tomb really reflect those technologies that were secretly observed by our ancestors in arrivals from the cosmos. And, of course, one cannot give a definite answer to this question. But equally one can doubt the interpretations put forward within the framework of traditional theories of the history of primitive societies. But one thing is clear: that the views proclaimed as official cannot ultimately offer a credible alternative when we are confronted with symbols and traditions that are difficult to understand, as we encounter them throughout the earth. The old dogmatic views rather impair the search for truth than contribute to understanding.<br/><br/>The outstanding Ukrainian archaeologist, head of the Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology of the Crimea, Askold Stschepinski, wrote at that time with annoyance in his essay Earth civilization is not unique that the archaeological findings, which speak for the possible visit of the Earth by inhabitants of other planets are unfortunately concealed, because they do not correspond to the paradigm of the existing scientific schools.<br/><br/>Similar like with other worldwide petroglyphs and cave-paintings around the globe, the question remains what our ancient ancestors wanted to communicate or show us with it.</td></tr><tr><td>Place</td><td></td><td>Melitopol</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td></td><td>Ukraine</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/ramar/Site.png","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.5,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[35.470145,46.950257,0]}},{"id":128,"name":"Midad del Mundo - Center of the Earth, Ecuador","description":"<!--HTML-->\r\n<table><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><img src=\"http://ramar.space/wp-content/uploads/formidable/5/midad-del-mundo.jpg\" alt=\"Midad del Mundo - Center of the Earth, Ecuador\" style=\"width:360px\"></td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td></td><td>Midad del Mundo - Center of the Earth, Ecuador</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td></td><td>In 1736 modern/scientific geographs tried to fix the exact location of the Equator -  they measured wrong - but nearby on a hill top, ancient native ruins exist.

While such studies would later determine the exact measure and shape of the world, astronomers involved missed the possibility of encountering the reminiscence of highly sophisticated geographical achievements made on “Equatorial” territory for hundreds of years before their arrival. Throughout the time the astronomers attempted to measure a length of a degree of latitude on that part of the planet, a group of different sorts of ruins (built by the Quitu-Cara culture) were found nearby the territory where they thought the Equatorial line passed through. Years after that, it was brought to light that the Geodesic Mission had been wrong about the exact coordinates where the line passed through—the measurements had indeed proved the world was oblate and not elongated (egg-shaped) at the poles, but their studies to define the placement of the equator were incorrect by 240 meters. The ruins found throughout the expedition between 1735-1745 where actually situated at latitude 0, or the exact position where the Equatorial line crosses.

It  happens  once  again in  a  passage  grave  -  although  here, too,   a   corpse   has   never   materialized. The  place  is  called  Newgrange,  and  it lies  51  kilometers  northwest  of   Dublin   or  about   15   kilometers   west   of   the   town   of  Drogheda.     There,     in     the     county     of  Meath,   in   a   loop   of   the   river   Boyne,   the  original   inhabitants   of   Ireland   set   a   grandiose   memorial   into   the   landscape.   It   is   a  technical   miracle   from   the   Stone   Age.   It   is   not   simply   a   grave   surrounded   by  stones   to   prevent   animals   getting   at   the   corpse.   Newgrange   is   a   masterpiece   of  surveying,   a   lesson   in   astronomy,   and   a   transport   phenomenon.   It   was   built   at   a  time   when,   according   to   orthodox   archeological   opinion,   Egyptian   history   had   not  yet   happened,   there   was   no   pyramid   on   earth,   and   the   cities   of   Ur,   Babylon,   or  Knossos   did   not   yet   exist.   Presumably   the   impressive   stone   circle   of   Stonehenge  had   not   yet   been   planned   when   unknown   astronomers   built   the   passage   grave   of  Newgrange. For   thousands   of   years,   no   one   paid   attention   to   the   round   hill   above   the   river  Boyne,   until   in   1699,   when   the   road   worker   Edward   Lhwyd   swore   mightily.   A  boulder   blocking   the   line   of   the   road   would   not   budge.   When   it   had   been   half- freed   from   the   earth,   the   swearing   road   worker   noticed   two   engraved   spirals   and  some    rectangles    on    the    recalcitrant    block.    Now    everything    became    clear:  Another   one   of   those   damned   graves.   The   message   reached   the   next   pub.  Newgrange had been discovered.<br/>Thorough   excavations   did   not   begin   until   the   1960s.   In   1969,   the   lead   researcher  Professor    Michael    J.    OKelly    from    Cork    University    discovered    a    right-angled  artificial    opening    above    the    two    monoliths    at    the    entrance.    It    was    only    20  centimeters   wide,   but   that   was   enough   for   the   scholar   to   see   the   light.   On   the  day   of   the   winter   solstice   in   1969   -   and   again   one   year   later   -   OKelly   seated  himself right at the back of the vault. Here is his eye-witness account: Exactly   at   9:45,   the   upper   edge   of   the   sun   appeared   on   the   horizon,   and   at   9:58  the   first   shaft   of   direct   sunlight   appeared   through   the   small   roofbox   above   the  entrance.   The   beam   of   sunlight   then   lengthened   along   the   passage   into   the  burial   chamber   until   the   beam   reached   the   edge   of   the   basin   stone   in   the   niche.  When   the   beam   of   light   had   widened   into   a   17-centimeter   ribbon   and   flooded   the  floor   of   the   chamber,   the   reflection   illuminated   the   grave   so   dramatically   that  various details both of the side chambers and of the vaulted roof could   be   clearly   seen.  At   10:04   the   ribbon   of   light   began   to   narrow   and   precisely  at   10:25   the   beam   of   light   was   abruptly   cut   off.   So   for   21   minutes   at   sunrise   on  the shortest day of the year   sunlight   penetrates   directly   into   the   burial   chamber   of   Newgrange.   Not  through   the   entrance   but   through   a   specially   constructed   narrow   slit   above   the  entrance to the passage. As a cautious academic, Professor OKelly did not at the time want   to   give   a   final   answer   to   the   question   whether   the   light   show   was   accidental  or intended. The question has meanwhile been ticked off by others.</td></tr><tr><td>Place</td><td></td><td>Newgrange</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td></td><td>Ireland</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/ramar/Site.png","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.5,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[-6.482633,53.694744,0]}},{"id":145,"name":"Ollantaytambo, Peru","description":"<!--HTML-->\r\n<table><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><img src=\"http://ramar.space/wp-content/uploads/formidable/5/Bild-170.0015.jpg\" alt=\"Ollantaytambo, Peru\" style=\"width:360px\"></td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td></td><td>Ollantaytambo, Peru</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td></td><td>Six perfect shaped stone blocks of each 50 tons.

Strangely, the monolith seems to be floating above a pond of water but its just an optical illusion. Also, no traces of tool machining, known to humans, can be found on the monolith itself, but tool machining traces can be found on the rock below the monolith. Like with many ancient unexplainable sites and artifacts, this one is also associated with legends about the ancient gods, in this case to the legends of the japanese Shinto religion.<br/>One of the legend tells of a god called Amatsu who ordered two gods, Oonamuchi and Sukunahikona, to bring peace to the area where the monolith is located. They were ordered to build a stone palace in just one night. When they were halfway done with the work, another group of gods attacked them, so they could not finish their work. The entrance they built from the monolith, tipped over in west-wast direction. Even though, the two gods could not finish the work, they said that their souls will stay in the monolith for eternity and will bring peace and calmness to the area.<br/><br/>The monolith existed long before the priests of the japanese Shinto-religion began to worship the stone so no one knows for sure what this huge monolith was originaly used for nor how or when it was originaly constructed or created.</td></tr><tr><td>Place</td><td></td><td>Ooshiko-21 Amidacho, Takasago, Hyogo 676-0823, Japan</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td></td><td>Japan</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/ramar/Site.png","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.5,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[134.795074,34.782579,0]}},{"id":147,"name":"Osiris Shaft","description":"<!--HTML-->\r\n<table><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><img src=\"http://ramar.space/wp-content/uploads/formidable/5/DSC_0542-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Osiris Shaft\" style=\"width:360px\"></td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td></td><td>Osiris Shaft</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td></td><td>The Osiris Shaft is one of many shafts on the Giza Plateau.

In 1999 Zahi Hawass did a full scale excavation ( FOX TV Opening the last tobs) and they pumped out the water. There are 3 shafts and 3 chambers up to a depth of 30m. These shafts and chambers were carved out of the bedrock, one can still see the parallel working marks ( very similar to a lot of ancient places all over the world).The first chamber in 4m depth measures 2,5 x 6m. The second chamber is 14m deeper below and has 6 niches in two of them precisely cutted stone sarcophagi can be found. One is made out of dacit, which cannot be found in Egypt. How did they transport and move them into this chamber? The second sarcophagus is made out of red granite and behind it there is supposed to be a tunnel leading in the direction of the Sphinx. Today the tunnel is not visible because the entrance is blocked by the sarcophagus. The 3rd chamber in a depth of 30m is unfortunately floodet with water today. One can barely see a lid of a massive granite sarcophagus. In the middle oft the chamber a rectangular structure is carved out of the bedrock with the granite sarcophagus in the centre, 4 columns once surrounded the structure. In the eastern wall there is a tunnel in the direction of the Khufu Pyramid. This tunnel is yet not completely discovered because the tunnel narrows ( 40x40cm) after a few meters. Today the tunnel is also flooded and no further exploration takes place. In his Histories Book II Herodotus describes a very similar shaft system wich was known as the tomb of Khufu.

Many thesis or alleged facts and also rumors exist, its a difficult task if you have to decide, what is a fact and what is fiction or really evident from countless sources.<br/><br/>In mainstream science it can still be said up to this date that no final evidence exists for what purpose Stonehenge has been built nor how it has been built including the transportation of the stones. 1952 the godfather of radio carbon-14 radioisotope dating method Willard Libby from the University of Chicago has found a piece of charred oak from an excavated pit at Stonehenge dating Stonehenge at around ~4000 B.C (3800 years old, plus or minus 275 years). As archeologists have found nearby remains of bones in the pits called the 56 Aubrey Holes an accepted purpose of the site is alleged to be a burial site. Nonetheless both facts, the dating and proposed purpose as a burial site could be wrong. The Ludwig Boltzman Institute - Archeological Prospection and Virtual Archeology did a magnetometry at Stonehenge dating human activity starting at 10000 years ago.<br/><br/>At Mindspectra they propose a planetary constellation of Stonhenge on circles or the different levels of the radius at the site, as shown in the pictures of Mindspectra.de, beginning with the moon, Mercury, Mars, Venus and earth.<br/>Maria Wheatley narrates about Dr. Aubrey Burl, who describes in his work or book A Brief History of Stonehenge, that the stones also have a particular alignment to lunar cycles. Also Gerald Hawkins, a professor of astronomy at Boston University in the 1960s proposed the Aubrey Holes depict a lunar cycle in described in his book Stonehenge Decoded. Wikipedia: Hawkins theory was that three 18.61 year cycles multiply out to 55.83, which is much closer to an integer and therefore easier to mark using 56 holes. Hawkins argued that the Aubrey Holes were used to keep track of this long time period and could accurately predict the recurrence of a lunar eclipse on the same azimuth, that which aligned with the Heel Stone, every 56 years. Going further, by placing marker stones at the ninth, eighteenth, twenty-eighth, thirty-seventh, forty-sixth and fifty sixth holes, Hawkins deduced that other intermediate lunar eclipses could also be predicted. <br/><br/>Furthermore Maria Wheatley mentions that the Stonehenge is surrounded by ~16 military sites, the GB area 51 which also encounters many crop circles occurrences and UFO sightings.<br/><br/>Maria Wheatley also concludes in her presentation and book The Elongated Skulls of Stonehenge, that the nearby found skeletons with elongated skulls are people related to several sites in these area, also to the elongated mounds. The remnants of the people with elongated skulls are a great mystery, who were they, from where and why are their skulls elongated?<br/><br/>Upon Geoffrey of Monmouth (1095 – c. 1155) a cleric and major chronicler of GB wrote in the twelfth-century Historia Regum Britanniae (History of the Kings of Britain):<br/>From iversity.org:<br/>The legend of King Arthur provides another story of the construction of Stonehenge. It is told by the twelfth century writer, Geoffrey of Monmouth, in his History of the Kings of Britain that Merlin brought the stones to the Salisbury Plain from Ireland. Sometime in the fifth century, there had been a massacre of 300 British noblemen by the treacherous Saxon leader, Hengest. Geoffrey tells us that the high king, Aurelius Ambrosius, wanted to create a fitting memorial to the slain men. Merlin suggested an expedition to Ireland for the purpose of transplanting the Giants Ring stone circle to Britain. According to Geoffrey of Monmouth, the stones of the Giants Ring were originally brought from Africa to Ireland by giants (who else but giants could handle the job?). The stones were located on Mount Killaraus and were used as a site for performing rituals and for healing. Led by King Uther and Merlin, the expedition arrived at the spot in Ireland. The Britons, none of whom were giants, apparently, were unsuccessful in their attempts to move the great stones. At this point, Merlin realized that only his magic arts would turn the trick. So, they were dismantled and shipped back to Britain where they were set up (see illus. at right) as they had been before, in a great circle, around the mass grave of the murdered noblemen. The story goes on to tell that Aurelius, Uther and Arthurs successor, Constantine were also buried there in their time*.<br/><br/>A famous story or rather rumor is the disappearance of five tourist or so called hippies, who visited Stonehenge in 1971 and then disappeared. The claimed names of the hippies were:     Ms. Julia Ashton, Mr. Lucas Addams, Ms. Shary Wilson Jr.,  Mr. Danniel Wilson,  Ms. Wilma Rupert. Some ufologists believe Ms. Wilma Rupert was a psychic and in touch with the UFO or aliens. However this story probably originated in the 70s TV series Quatermass titled episode Ringstone Round by professor Quatermass and there seems no existing evidence that proof this story true. If it were true many statements and interviews of local involved relatives should exist. <br/><br/>Last but not least a crop circle occured near Stonehenge on the 8th of July 1996 called Julia Set. This crop circle occured extremely fast by daylight and couldnt be explained. It consisted of 149 circles and each circle had an own center. It was 279m in diameter and witnesses like a pilot or nearby security man at Stonehenge did verify that the crop circle didnt exist some hours before.</td></tr><tr><td>Place</td><td></td><td>Salisbury Plain</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td></td><td>United Kingdom</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/ramar/Site.png","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.5,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[-1.826215,51.178882,0]}},{"id":154,"name":"Puma Punku","description":"<!--HTML-->\r\n<table><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><img src=\"http://ramar.space/wp-content/uploads/formidable/5/Bild-232.0025.jpg\" alt=\"Puma Punku\" style=\"width:360px\"></td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td></td><td>Puma Punku</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td></td><td>When the first conquerors saw Puma Punku, with its gigantic platforms and detailed chiseling’s - they asked the natives, who built such constructions - the Spanish were not able to do a such work at that time.

The temple also contains different very heavy remains of statues, the largest found one is from Ramses 2, wars have destroyed the huge statue that has been carved out of one single stone, but some fragments have remained. Erich von Däniken states that measurements of the original statue gave a weight of 1200 tons, the stones have been transported 600 kilometeres away from the Mokkatam Hills.<br/><br/>Up to date it is not clear how these stones or statue have been transported and how this task has been accomplished with the methods and engineerings skills back then. For better understanding the following example is given, to give an impression, what labour and engineering skills must have been available back then. As example the relocation project of the Abu Simbel Temple is given. The Abu Simbel had to be relocated during the building process of the Aswan Dam. Multiple countries were involved in the planning and relocation project. 3000 measurements were made for the relocation plan and all parts of the temple, including statues as well, had to be cut into many parts. It was a giant challenge to accomplish. Also the most powerful cranes of the world were challenged as the cranes stock capabilities were maxed out and further assistance through machinery with hydraulic technology was required to achieve the goal. Now the question arises how the people over 3000 years ago did achieve this incredible task, where no hydraulic assisted super powerful cranes existed.<br/><br/>Dr. Erich von Däniken points out and emphasizes that the transportation and entire building process of the Rames 2 statue was an impossible task to accomplish back in these ages where people lived in simple houses, in consideration with their engineering skills, level and technology available back then. Hence there must have been a kind of knowledge transfer to the ancient people, how to plan and construct. The possibility is given, that the information how to plan and construct at this level of engineering has been given from extra terrestrials, as well do countless stories exist in different cultures, how knowledge from so called gods or other beings has been transfered to humans. Until we dont know for sure how this extremely heavy statue has been transported back then and the possibility exists for real, that extra terrestrials may have been involved, it remains a great mystery.</td></tr><tr><td>Place</td><td></td><td>Edfo, Luxor Governorate, Egypt</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td></td><td>Egypt</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/ramar/Site.png","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.5,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[32.610794,25.727274,0]}},{"id":158,"name":"Red Pyramid of Sneferu (father of Cheops)","description":"<!--HTML-->\r\n<table><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><img src=\"http://ramar.space/wp-content/uploads/formidable/5/Bild-505.0003.jpg\" alt=\"Red Pyramid of Sneferu (father of Cheops)\" style=\"width:360px\"></td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td></td><td>Red Pyramid of Sneferu (father of Cheops)</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td></td><td>Cheops    father    was    called    Sneferu    and    was presumably  older  than  his  son.

The stone ring is a perfect circle of around 72 or so stones, although legend says the stones cannot be counted! Originally, there may have been around 100 stones, standing shoulder to shoulder, creating an almost wall-like enclosure. There was once an avenue or at least four portal stones that stood just outside of the circle forming a processional way and entrance into the stone circle. <br/><br/>In the 1970s, The Dragon Project found that the country lane running by the Rollright stone circle had abnormally high Geiger counts along a few hundred metres stretch. The Dragon Project was monitoring the fast moving beta particle counts, which are natural radiations from the earth due to disintegration of atomic nuclei by cosmic ray bombardments.<br/><br/>On several occasions my late father dowsed the lane and located an intense area of radiation - a ‘hot-spot’. He carefully used dowsing to count the exact emissions and claimed gamma radiation was being detected. In 1996 the late Art Brickell and Geoff Woolford checked his dowsing results and the radioactive ‘hot-spot’, measuring for the gamma ray counts per minute with a gamma ray radiation monitor.<br/><br/>Radiation and the ‘Spook Road’<br/>The gamma ray radiation monitor revealed the measurements which were taken along the adjacent road to the Rollright Ring following the dowsing results. The normal background count for the region is 60–80 counts per minute. Our findings revealed huge differences ranging from a cold spot of 71 to a high spot of 302. The results were significant and also confirmed that my late father’s dowsing was as accurate as a Geiger counter.<br/><br/>One intriguing anomaly was noted in 1979 at the Rollright stone circle, Oxfordshire.

The ancients observed how the moon affected the tides and by tracking it alongside of the sun, they developed calendars to predict agricultural rhythms. Even today, farmers plant seeds during certain phases of the moon cycle. It is believed that moisture is pulled toward the top layer of the soil and improves germination.

He ruled for several hundred years until about the time when Sanxingdui was abruptly abandoned. According to ancient chinese legends (Handbook of Chinese Mythology, Oxford University Press), he had golden silkworms in his luggage, of which he gave one to each family. Can Cong taught silkworm breeding and everything related to silk. The golden silkworms had to be returned to Can Cong when normal silkworms came out of them. Can Cong had strikingly strange eyes, according to ancient texts.

It is written at Wikipedia that obelisks in Egypt have been transported on a specially designed barge and moved with sand and ropes. This thesis is still scrutinized and challenged by Erich von Däniken with the following real world facts in regard with the relocation of the Abu Simbel temple, which has been moved only around 180 meters.<br/><br/>Up to date it is not clear how these stones or obelisks have been transported and how this task has been accomplished with the methods and engineerings skills back then. For better understanding the following example is given, to give an impression, what labour and engineering skills must have been available back then. As example the relocation project of the Abu Simbel Temple is given. The Abu Simbel had to be relocated during the building process of the Aswan Dam. Multiple countries were involved in the planning and relocation project. 3000 measurements were made for the relocation plan and all parts of the temple, including statues as well, had to be cut into many parts. It was a giant challenge to accomplish. Also the most powerful cranes of the world were challenged as the cranes stock capabilities were maxed out and further assistance through machinery with hydraulic technology was required to achieve the goal. Now the question arises how the people over 3000 years ago did achieve this incredible task, where no hydraulic assisted super powerful cranes existed.<br/><br/>Dr. Erich von Däniken points out and emphasizes that the transportation and entire building process of the obelisk was an impossible task to accomplish back in these ages where people lived in simple houses, in consideration with their engineering skills, level and technology available back then. Hence there must have been a kind of knowledge transfer to the ancient people, how to plan and construct. The possibility is given, that the information how to plan and construct at this level of engineering has been given from extra terrestrials, as well do countless stories exist in different cultures, how knowledge from so called gods or other beings has been transfered to humans. Until we dont know for sure how these extremely heavy obelisks have been transported back then or how they managed to aquire the necessary knowledge and the possibility exists for real, that extra terrestrials may have been involved, it remains a great mystery.</td></tr><tr><td>Place</td><td></td><td>Karnak, Luxor, Luxor Governorate, Ägypten</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td></td><td>Egypt</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/ramar/Site.png","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.5,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[32.65832,25.718367,0]}},{"id":210,"name":"Tiahuanaco","description":"<!--HTML-->\r\n<table><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><img src=\"http://ramar.space/wp-content/uploads/formidable/5/Bild-076-078.0015.jpg\" alt=\"Tiahuanaco\" style=\"width:360px\"></td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td></td><td>Tiahuanaco</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td></td><td>This temple complex is linked to the mysteries of Puma Punku and the Titicaca Lake.

Both rest on a base of native Jurassic limestone, with the larger one supporting the smaller “turtle head” in such a way that the latter is kept balanced since thousands of years.<br/>We photogrammetrically scanned this formation in winter 2021, without foliage. From this footage, a 3D model was created with the exact volume data from which the weights can be calculated. With the “turtle” we now have a discrepancy of +/- 5 mm. With the new analyses, our 3D specialist Boris Ambiel was able to calculate the cubature (the geometrically measurable volume). The “turtle body” has a total volume of 59.938 m3. With an average weight of about 2.8 t/m3 of granite – the erratic blocks come from the lower Rohne Massif (Canton Valais) 200 kilometres away – we get a total weight of 167.8 tonnes! The considerably smaller head still measures 8.679 m3 and thus weights 24.3 tonnes. These are respectable figures if we assume that these stones were placed, or rather arranged, by our fur-covered ancestors. There is something missing in our historiography. The image of the “Stone Age man” must be revised. We owe that to our ancestors. The astronomical orientation is a further indication of the high level of knowledge in prehistoric times. <br/><br/>On the other hand, we noticed on the drone pictures that the head protrudes at an angle of about 100 degrees SSW to the body. This also makes the explanation that a glacier deposited it this way by coincidence absurd. The smaller block would have slipped away under the larger one and would have fallen out of the artificial suspension. Here, connection points and exact friction surfaces were meticulously tested out. <br/><br/>Georg Brunner (+) proved this mathematically and precisely with the Erdmannlistein in Wohlen, Canton Aargau.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the giants were placed on plinths of native rock. A soil survey could provide evidence as to whether the pedestals are connected to the parent rock or have been artificially added/underlaid. Initial photo analysis suggests that they are not connected to the parent rock.<br/>We do not believe that this and many other prehistoric arrangements were designed by extraterrestrials. We are all the more interested in the question behind it: If it is man-made, i.e. not of natural origin, then: how in “Odins name” did they move these colossi? If we assume, for example, that a hemp rope can withstand about three tonnes, depending on its strength, then it would take 56 such ropes to move 168 tonnes. And if not lifted, but rolled onto the “mound of earth” (which was then removed again) with wooden rollers: What tree can withstand a weight of 168 tons? For me, some things are still inconclusive, and I would like to discuss this topic with other specialists, because I have a few critical questions. The answers could also be of interest for other megalithic structures around the world that are the focus of palaeo-SETI research. <br/>Furthermore, we intend to contact the stone museum in Solothurn (the only one in Switzerland) as well as the Solothurn cantonal archaeologists and make our data available to them. It is not a question of proving the mystery for better or worse, but in cooperation with specialists we would like to gain clarity and at the same time stimulate curiosity for the spectacular “not yet explained” on our doorstep.<br/><br/>Perhaps we will find a sponsor for the stone museum – the 3D models could be displayed on a large touchscreen TV, and the visitor could virtually rotate the stone or formation as desired. A walk to the original in the forest (30 minutes walk) could motivate people to get to know their own region and go in search of explanations or support deeper research.<br/>Excerpt from an article of Ramon Zürcher, PA to Erich von Däniken, in SAGENHAFTE ZEITEN (Legendary Times) 4/2021</td></tr><tr><td>Place</td><td></td><td>Solothurn, Switzerland</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td></td><td>Switzerland</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/ramar/Site.png","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.5,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[7.550499,47.228617,0]}},{"id":220,"name":"UFO mysteriy entrance in underground","description":"<!--HTML-->\r\n<table><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><img src=\"http://ramar.space/wp-content/uploads/formidable/5/IMG_20161101_163325-3.jpg\" alt=\"UFO mysteriy entrance in underground\" style=\"width:360px\"></td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td></td><td>UFO mysteriy entrance in underground</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td></td><td>I found this 2 objects by google earth.

This kind of combination is very rare and makes this site a special place where over thousands of years funerals have taken place. At that time period they had a different view of the relation between life and death. There was no eternal rest for the dead the bones where often rearrenged and cleaned, probably for ritual purposes. In midsummer you can see the southernmost full moon shining through the entrence of the passage grave. During excavations a lot of stones covered with motivs of the sun (sun stones) where found nearby. Was this place a sun worshiping site ? The  langdysse Vasagård is a very unique and special place its history goes back 6.000 years. Today very little is known about it, many questions must be answered.

It is listed as pyramid number XIII in Karl Lepsius list of pyramids (1842). In 1904 Alessandro Barsanti made the first excavations at this side. He discovered a huge pit in the centre of a rectangular superstructure. This pit is most interesting, its dimensions being: 28 m long, 4,50 m wide and 19 m deep. The pit was filled with limestone blocks from a enclosure wall. During the excavation a staircase was found which leads to the bottom of the pit. Fife monolithic granit blocks surrounded by limestone blocks form the pavement of the great pit of Zawyet el-Aryan. A large oval tank is carved out of one granit block (sarcophagus). As Barsanti discovered the oval tank it was protected with lime and clay surrounded by limestone blocks which wrapped the tank as a kind of insulating building. The lid was plastered to the tank, inside was nothing except a 10 cm black band lining the side walls. There wasn´t just one layer of fine cut stones building up the floor there where four layers in total (up to 26 m depth). Why did they build such a massive floor of interlocking blocks like a complicated puzzle? Unfortunately Barsanti displaced a lot of stones and never put them back into place. Today the pit is nearly forgotten and a military area is built around this site. In the movie: The land of the Pharaohs 1955  is a short scene in which the pit is shown. Was it really an unfinished pyramid or did it had an another function such as astronomical or technical ?</td></tr><tr><td>Place</td><td></td><td>Zawyet el-Aryan</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td></td><td>Egypt</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/ramar/Site.png","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.5,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[31.151572,29.940581,0]}}]}
