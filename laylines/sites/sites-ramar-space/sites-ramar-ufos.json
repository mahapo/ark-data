The phenomenon has been interpreted by some modern UFO enthusiasts as an aerial battle of extraterrestrial origin.<br/><br/>Original Text:<br/>In the morning of April 14, 1561, at daybreak, between 4 and 5 a.m., a dreadful apparition occurred on the sun, and then this was seen in Nuremberg in the city, before the gates and in the country – by many men and women. At first there appeared in the middle of the sun two blood-red semi-circular arcs, just like the moon in its last quarter. And in the sun, above and below and on both sides, the color was blood, there stood a round ball of partly dull, partly black ferrous color. Likewise there stood on both sides and as a torus about the sun such blood-red ones and other balls in large number, about three in a line and four in a square, also some alone. In between these globes there were visible a few blood-red crosses, between which there were blood-red strips, becoming thicker to the rear and in the front malleable like the rods of reed-grass, which were intermingled, among them two big rods, one on the right, the other to the left, and within the small and big rods there were three, also four and more globes. These all started to fight among themselves, so that the globes, which were first in the sun, flew out to the ones standing on both sides, thereafter, the globes standing outside the sun, in the small and large rods, flew into the sun. Besides the globes flew back and forth among themselves and fought vehemently with each other for over an hour. And when the conflict in and again out of the sun was most intense, they became fatigued to such an extent that they all, as said above, fell from the sun down upon the earth as if they all burned and they then wasted away on the earth with immense smoke. After all this there was something like a black spear, very long and thick, sighted; the shaft pointed to the east, the point pointed west. Whatever such signs mean, God alone knows. Although we have seen, shortly one after another, many kinds of signs on the heaven, which are sent to us by the almighty God, to bring us to repentance, we still are, unfortunately, so ungrateful that we despise such high signs and miracles of God. Or we speak of them with ridicule and discard them to the wind, in order that God may send us a frightening punishment on account of our ungratefulness. After all, the God-fearing will by no means discard these signs, but will take it to heart as a warning of their merciful Father in heaven, will mend their lives and faithfully beg God, that He may avert His wrath, including the well-deserved punishment, on us, so that we may temporarily here and perpetually there, live as his children. For it, may God grant us his help, Amen.

The Basel pamphlet of 1566 describes unusual sunrises and sunsets. Celestial phenomena were said to have fought together in the form of numerous red and black balls in the sky before the rising sun.<br/><br/>Original Text:<br/>It happened in 1566 three times, on 27 and 28 of July, and on August 7, against the sunrise and sunset; we saw strange shapes in the sky above Basel. During the year 1566, on the 27th of July, after the sun had shone warm on the clear, bright skies, and then around 9 pm, it suddenly took a different shape and color. First, the sun lost all its radiance and luster, and it was no bigger than the full moon, and finally it seemed to weep tears of blood and the air behind him went dark. And he was seen by all the people of the city and countryside. In much the same way also the moon, which has already been almost full and has shone through the night, assuming an almost blood-red color in the sky. The next day, Sunday, the sun rose at about six oclock and slept with the same appearance it had when it was lying before. He lit the houses, streets and around as if everything was blood-red and fiery. At the dawn of August 7, we saw large black spheres coming and going with great speed and precipitation before the sun and chattered as if they led a fight. Many of them were fiery red and, soon crumbled and then extinguished.<br/><br/>The report itself was written by the Zurich typesetter/printer and art student Samuel Coccius (actually Samuel Koch, born Essig) in the Year 1566, the pamphlet was illustrated and published by the book printer and music publisher Samuel Apiarius (1530 - 1590).<br/>The original medieval pamphlet can be viewed in the Central Library in Zurich.

Davies had an encounter with a UFO while deplloyed with an Anti-Submarine Squadron aboard a CVE class carrier. The incident occurred while he was flying at nicht at 5000 feet.<br/><br/>He picked up a target, which had been circling the fleet, on his radar scope. Upon leaving the fleet, it took up a position behind his wingman, flying about 3 miles astern, and held about the same position relative to Daviess plane as the wingman. The ship also reported the target on their radars. After approximately 5 minutes, the target left at a speed of over 1000 mph and was observed on the radar scope by Davies out to 200 miles, the maximum range of his radar. After his flight, Davies learned that the target had been held for about 7 hours, then trail a plane for 5 minutes, and then fly off at a high speed.“<br/><br/>In the unclassified report „Preliminary Assessment: Unidentified Aerial Phenomena“ of  the „OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE“ published at the 25th June in 2021, five explanations are described which would be responsible for the phenomenon of UAPs, namely these are: „airborne clutter, natural atmospheric phenomena, USG or industry developmental programs, foreign adversary systems, and a catchall “other” bin.“ What if under the last category also extra terrestrial  encounters are a realilty and extra terrestrials really exist, flying their space ships around our world?

As the pilot abandoned the chase, heading back toward the base, the UFO followed him. When another F-84 was scrambled on the object, chasing it for 160 mils, it obtained a radar lock-on (automatically guiding the plane toward the UFO). However, the pilot became frightened and asked to break the intercept when a red light began blinking on his radar-ranging gunsight, indicating that a solid object was ahead of him. The climax of the sighting came when both the UFO and the F-84 were clearly seen on the GCI radar screeen, and the pilot saw a white, unidentified light speeding in front of him.

He describes in his conclusion of the biblical story how Ezekiel, a great temple priest, sighted how a space ship landet in front of him and other people. Also does Mr. von Däniken mention how the so called gods or maybe aliens spoke to Ezekiel and took him with them into the skies inside their space ship up to a mountain far away. He describes how the space ship landed unto a landing platform inside a city and instructed Ezekiel to measure the whole building complex, as described in the bible.<br/><br/>Erich von Däniken had a speech at NASA, where a group of highly qualified space engineers attended his speech and went afterwards for dinner with him. The NASA engineers told Mr. von Däniken that they dont believe in his theory. But the chief development engineer called Josef F. Blumrich told Mr. von Däniken that although he doesnt believe in Mr. von Dänikens theory he agrees to read the chapters of Ezekiel in the bible. Later on NASAs chief engineer Josef F. Blumrich read the story of Ezekiel in many different bibles due to different wordings in different published bibles. Finally he was completely stunned about the story of Ezekiel and agreed with Dr. Erich von Däniken. He then wrote the famous book The Spaceships of Ezekiel in 1974 in where he analyzes and describes his findings about the space ship that Ezekiel probably saw.<br/><br/>The case doesnt end here. In 1985 an engineer called Hans Herbert Beier publishes a book in where he reconstructs the measurements which Ezekiel made of the building. The result is compelling as it clearly shows how the space ship that chief engineer Blumrich designed upon the bible fits exactly inside Mr. Beiers reconstructed building complex from Ezekiels measurements.<br/><br/>Translated excerpt of Ezekiels story in the bible:<br/>It happened in the thirtieth year, on the fifth day of the fourth month, while I was in the river Chebar among the exiles, the heavens opened.... But I saw a storm wind coming from the north, and a great cloud, surrounded by a radiance and an unceasing fire, from the midst of which it was flashed like bright ore. And in the midst of it appeared figures like four living beings appeared, - they were to be seen like the figures of men. And each one had four faces and each had four wings. Their legs<br/>were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the soles of the feet of a calf, and they sparkled like bright brass.... Further I saw next to each of the four living creatures a wheel on the ground. The appearance of the wheels was like the gleam of a chrysolite and the four wheels were all of the same shape and they were worked as if one wheel were in the middle of the other, as if you could walk on all four sides without turning while walking. And I saw that they had rims, and their rims were full of eyes all around on all four wheels. When the living beings walked, so did the wheels beside them, and when the living creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose up...  and I heard behind me a mighty roar noise behind me, when the glory of the Lord rose up from its place, the rustling of the wings of the living creatures touching each other, and the rattling of the wheels at the same time with them was a tremendous roar.<br/><br/>Is it possible, that Dr. Erich von Däniken, NASA engineer J. F. Blumrich and engineer Beier are right with their theories? If its really god meant in the bible, why would god require a space ship at all?</td></tr><tr><td>Place</td><td></td><td>Babylon</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td></td><td>Iraq</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/ramar/UFO.png","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.5,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[44.420891,32.542288,0]}},{"id":216,"name":"Travis Walton UFO Abduction Case","description":"<!--HTML-->\r\n<table><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><img src=\"http://ramar.space/wp-content/uploads/formidable/5/Title_Picture_FinalX.jpg\" alt=\"Travis Walton UFO Abduction Case\" style=\"width:360px\"></td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td></td><td>Travis Walton UFO Abduction Case</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td></td><td>The Travis Walton UFO incident was an alleged alien abduction of American forestry worker Travis Walton by a UFO on November 5, 1975, while he was working in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests near Snowflake, Arizona. Walton was missing for five days and six hours. After days of searching with scent dogs and helicopters, Walton says he reappeared by the side of a road near Heber, Arizona. The Walton case received mainstream publicity and remains one of the best-known alien abduction stories.<br/><br/>On November 5, 1975 Walton and six of his coworkers were working with a timber stand improvement crew in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest near Snowflake, Arizona. After work, when they decided to drive home in their working-truck, they encountered a saucer-shaped object hovering in the forest, approximately 110 feet away, making a strange blend of low- and high-pitched mechanical sounds. Travis Walton and the other six men claimed that after Travis had approached the object, a beam of blueis light suddenly appeared from the craft and knocked him unconscious. The other six men were frightened and supposedly drove away. Walton claimed that he awoke in a hospital-like room, being observed by three short, bald creatures. He claimed that he fought with them until a human, wearing a helmet, led Walton to another room, where he blacked out as three other humans put a clear plastic mask over his fact. Walton has claimed that he remembers nothing else until he found himself walking along a highway five days later, with the flying saucer departing above him.</td></tr><tr><td>Place</td><td></td><td>Snowflake, Arizona</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td></td><td>United States</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/ramar/UFO.png","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.5,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[-110.643456,34.300874,0]}},{"id":219,"name":"UFO Case Bahia Blanca","description":"<!--HTML-->\r\n<table><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><img src=\"http://ramar.space/wp-content/uploads/formidable/5/22-1962-La-Nueva-Provincia.jpg\" alt=\"UFO Case Bahia Blanca\" style=\"width:360px\"></td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td></td><td>UFO Case Bahia Blanca</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td></td><td>Argentina, on the 21st of May 1962 in the city of Bahia Blanca south of Buenos Aires a UFO mass sighting occured.

One or more creatures dressed all in black then approached the children and telepathically communicated to them a message with an environmental theme.<br/><br/>The children who witnessed the incident were interviewed by several professionals including Cynthia Hind, Tim Leach and Harvard University professor of psychiatry John Mack. Throughout the 1990s Mack had investigated UFO sightings and had a particular interest in the alien abduction phenomenon. According to the interviews of Hind, Leach and Mack, 62 children between the ages of six and twelve claimed to have seen at least one UFO. Not all of the children at the school claimed a sighting. The basic details of the sightings were quite consistent although not all the details were. One or more silver objects, usually described as discs, appeared in the sky. They then floated down to a field of brush and small trees just outside school property. Between one and four creatures with big eyes and dressed all in black, exited a craft and approached the children. At this point many of the children ran but some, mostly older pupils, stayed and watched the approach. According to Macks interviews the creature or creatures then telepathically communicated to the children an environmental message, before returning to the craft and flying away.<br/><br/>Two days prior to the incident at Ariel there had been a number of UFO sightings throughout southern Africa. There had been numerous reports of a bright fireball passing through the sky at night. Many people answered ZBC Radios request to call-in and describe what they had seen. Although some witnesses interpreted the fireball as a comet or meteor, it resulted in a wave of UFO mania in Zimbabwe at the time.</td></tr><tr><td>Place</td><td></td><td>Ariel School, Ruwa, Zimbabwe</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td></td><td>Zimbabwe</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/ramar/UFO.png","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.5,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[31.291281,-17.86421,0]}}]}
