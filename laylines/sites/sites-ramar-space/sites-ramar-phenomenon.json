The survivors swim thousands of miles and eventually return to their natal beach after about 20 years. There are a total of seven different species of turtles in the world, all of which are lung breathers and must surface every 30 minutes while diving to take in fresh oxygen. Sea turtles evolved from land turtles during evolution and adapted to life in the water by developing salt glands and changing their body structure. Their shell changed, in the process sea turtles lost the ability to hide their large head under their shell when in danger, something their relatives, the land turtles, still practice today. The birth process of sea turtles is repeated on different continents.<br/><br/>Erich von Däniken states following questions and conclusions:<br/>- What forces loggerhead turtles to their birth beach in Florida, even though they are eaten by the tens of thousands there? And hawksbill turtles return to a completely different destination: the Atlantic island of Ascension?<br/>- All turtles are lung breathers. Diving is against their nature. Slow adaptation of their lungs, which oxygenate their blood underwater, is not possible.<br/>- Evolution is supposed to create advantages for the life form. But the sea turtles can no longer pull their head under their shell in case of danger - an evolutionary step backwards compared to the land turtle.<br/><br/>Erich von Däniken proposes, it could be to conclude that the sea turtles properties and behaviour didnt evolve in time over an evolutionary process but rather was written in their DNA since their beginning. Then the question remains for the DNA, from where or whom did the information originate from?</td></tr><tr><td>Place</td><td></td><td>Sea Turtle Beach, Stuart, FL, Vereinigte Staaten</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td></td><td>null</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/ramar/Phenomenon.png","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.5,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[-80.180052,27.255941,0]}},{"id":7,"name":"Alaise","description":"<!--HTML-->\r\n<table><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><img src=\"http://ramar.space/wp-content/uploads/formidable/5/Bild-065.jpg\" alt=\"Alaise\" style=\"width:360px\"></td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td></td><td>Alaise</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td></td><td>In a wood near Alaise you find ancient ruins from the Celtic times.

They reported that during the night of Thursday 15 August, they had witnessed an amazing display of dancing lights over the field which kept darting about, spiralling down to the ground and then back up again; then going round in circles, then down and coming back up again before disappearing like a shooting star.“<br/><br/>„On Sunday 25 August, I had a telephone call from Marie Wakelam whose house, Crabtree Farmhouse borders onto the Crabwood field. When she telephoned me she had just returned from visiting the formation and had fallen into conversation with a family who had shown her stalks of wheat taken from inside the formation that were slightly singed and blackened. Marie thought this was curious as at about 11-11.30 pm on the evening of Thursday 15 August she had been surprised to smell a strong smell of burning, like a bonfire coming from the field. Her bedroom backs onto the field and her bedroom window was open at the time.“<br/><br/>„The lay in the Alien was one I had seen only once before, in the Chilbolton Face of 2001 it seemed as though the flattened, swirled crop around each standing tuft had been laid individually. A task that would surely be beyond the ability of man during the short hours of darkness at this time of year? None of the stalks were broken in either formation, they were bent at the base.“<br/><br/>„One noticeable aspect of the dish was that there no evidence of a single seed head missing from any of the standing clumps of wheat inside the circular shape . In order to construct a circle, it is likely that a person would stand at a central point holding a rope and his accomplice would hold the other end of the rope whilst describing the perimeter of the circle. In ripened crop, when the seed heads are heavy and hanging down against the stem, they are very fragile and any movement of a tightened rope stretching across the standing wheat will catch against the seed heads, flicking them off as it passes. I examined the circular dish minutely and did not find a single wheat stalk with a missing head.“<br/><br/>Feel free to visit Lucy Pringles homepage to read her reported case completely, the link is provided under links. There are still much more findings in this particular case. Also Dr. Horace Drew,  Paul Vigay, Eltjo Haselhoff and many other crop circle related experts stated intriguing facts about this particular case. If the experts interpratations are true, and after all these persons seem credible and authoritative, we maybe should think really about the entire topic of crop circles and their messages as remarkable call up from other beings from other worlds and or dimensions.<br/><br/>Roger Holzer collected 33 facts about crop circles, which he presented in his presentation in 2017 in Suhl DE at the one day meeting of the A.A.S association:<br/>1. half-bent grain, which according to the Merlin-1 project of the A.A.S. cannot be realized by humans.<br/>2. straight grain from the surrounding field, which bends after being carried into the crop circle. This was a reproducible anomaly from the Merlin-1 project of the A.A.S.<br/>3. accurately formed pictograms in Canola fields or corn and many other plant species, where with the known forgery techniques, no accurate shapes could be realized, as well as clear traces of human intervention would be evident.<br/>4. compass needle anomalies, spinning within fresh pictograms or aligning themselves strangely, even vertically. This known phenomenon could be verified by the A.A.S project group Merlin-1.<br/>5. pictograms that are created in a very fast time. Like e.g. the Julia Set at Stonehenge, where it would not be possible that humans could have created it in this short in such a short time.<br/>6. the same recurring pictograms, which were not studied by humans, because the farmer has mowed the field before. This finding has been observed by Colin Andrews the first crop circle researcher.<br/>7. undamaged grain and flowers, which would have been damaged by the trampling of the visitors according to physicist Dr. Eltjo Haselhoff and many crop circle researcher.<br/>8. bent grain, which is not folded or broken according to physicist Dr. Eltjo Haselhoff and many crop circle researcher.<br/>9. acoustic phenomena, observed or heard by many crop circle visitors as also investigated by Colin Andrews and Pat Delgado on site. They were able to record the acoustic signals. One can listen to the sounds in the Internet e.g. on Youtube.<br/>10. most pictograms appear according to a visual statistic of Colin Andrews within an isosceles triangle in England between, Wantage in Oxfordshire, Winchester and Wiltshire. This area is also the territory of the observed UFO phenomena in England. According to a detailed analysis by the astronomer Prof. Gerald Hawkins, many of the<br/>pictograms have diatonic relations.<br/>12. the TLB crop circle research team, as well as Glenn Broughton have statistically analyzed that most pictograms originate over groundwater.<br/>13. magnetic anomalies could be found with magnetometers, which were by 120% higher than usual and showed the same pattern as the pictograms according to a study by Colin Andrews.<br/>14. so-called ghost crop circles, where the same pictogram reappears in the same place the next season because the new crop grows differently in the former place.<br/>15. temporal anomalies of plants within pictograms, which show a rejuvenated growth stage compared to plants in the surrounding field according to Dr. Levengood from the TLB crop circle research team.<br/>16. over 170% elongated apical nodes of plants also in standing remaining plants according to analyses by Dr. Levengood from the TLB crop circle Research team and Dr. Eltjo Haselhoff.<br/>17. cellular alteration of plants by analyses of Dr. Levengood from the TLB crop circle research team.<br/>18. impregnated magnetic material (meteorite dust) according to analyses by Dr. Levengood and Dr. Eltjo Haselhoff.<br/>19. Exploded apical nodes showing internal genetic modification by Dr. Levengood of the TLB crop circle research team.<br/>20. deformation of the crop heads according to Dr. Levengood from the TLB crop circle-research team and crop circle visitors.<br/>21. insects fused with plants according to Dr. Levengoods analyses.<br/>22. faster germination of grain according to Dr. Levengoods analyses.<br/>23. radioactive isotopes contained according to analyses by Dr. Levengood.<br/>24. up to 40% larger grain and roots according to observations by TLB crop circle research team.<br/>25. electrostatic anomalies experienced by many crop circle visitors and analyzed by Dr.Hein analyzed.<br/>26. failing electronic devices and electromagnetic anomalies at fake crop circles according to a study by Dr. Hein.<br/>27. failing electronic devices experienced by many crop circle visitors and crop circle researchers.<br/>28. discharges of batteries inside pictograms, even of brand new batteries were noted by crop circle researchers and visitors.<br/>29. phenomenal light anomalies observed by many people, mostly light spheres that can shift or disappear abnormally fast.<br/>30. many reports of people who had visions of a pattern or wished to see a crop circle or wished for a crop circle with a particular shape, which manifested shortly thereafter. There have also been various meditation groups that projected symbols, which actually appeared, e.g. in the meditation group of Dr. Steven Greer.<br/>31. some crop circle visitors experienced physical healings inside authentic crop circles.<br/>32. some crop circle visitors experienced physical healings inside fake crop circles.<br/>33. many crop circle visitors and researchers had the a strange feeling to get observed within the pictograms.</td></tr><tr><td>Place</td><td></td><td>England, Winchester, Crabwood</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td></td><td>United Kingdom</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/ramar/Phenomenon.png","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.5,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[-1.36224,51.064252,0]}},{"id":15,"name":"Answer to Frank Drake Arecibo Message at Chilbolton Observatory","description":"<!--HTML-->\r\n<table><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><img src=\"http://ramar.space/wp-content/uploads/formidable/5/LucyPringle_Chilbolton01.jpg\" alt=\"Answer to Frank Drake Arecibo Message at Chilbolton Observatory\" style=\"width:360px\"></td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td></td><td>Answer to Frank Drake Arecibo Message at Chilbolton Observatory</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td></td><td>On November the 16th 1974 at 01:00 a.m. AST (Atlantic Standard Time), a message was sent from the Arecibo in Puerto Rico with the largest radio telescope in the world until 2016, which was written by the astronomer and astrophysicist Frank Drake.

One year before, a pictogram appeared in the same field, which appears as visualizing their communication technology. The message provided information about our physical composition, which, in comparison to ours, contains silicone. Also is their DNA much more complex than ours, as well as their population is about 3 times as big than ours. They are a lot smaller than us and their solar system is of course also different. Their communication device is about three times as large as ours in Puerto Rico.<br/><br/>One year before this crop circle manifested, a crop circle appeared in the same spot which likely was depicting the communication device of our, maybe, star-neighbours. A further mystery is, that days before the crop circle appeared, a crop circle appeared in the same field, which is showing the face of mars.</td></tr><tr><td>Place</td><td></td><td>England, Chilbolton Observatory</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td></td><td>United Kingdom</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/ramar/Phenomenon.png","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.5,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[-1.440435,51.144063,0]}},{"id":40,"name":"Cave paintings worldwide - Gods and Halos","description":"<!--HTML-->\r\n<table><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><img src=\"http://ramar.space/wp-content/uploads/formidable/5/Bild-058-061.0021.jpg\" alt=\"Cave paintings worldwide - Gods and Halos\" style=\"width:360px\"></td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td></td><td>Cave paintings worldwide - Gods and Halos</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td></td><td>Hominide beings with halos!

Mr. Bert Janssen from www.cropcirclesandmore.com, a mathematician and agriculture engineer, deciphered the constant of PI. Also he could decipher the impossibility of the squaring of the circle due to the alignment of 3 spheres which can be seen in the crop circle, that are placed in a specific way to achieve the squaring of the circle within an accuracy of 99,96 % which is considered mind blowing by himself.<br/><br/>Squaring the circle is a problem in geometry first proposed in Greek mathematics. In 1882, the task was proven to be impossible, as a consequence of the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem, which proves that pi ( π pi ) is a transcendental number. In 1989 Miklos Laczkovich tried to prove to solve the circle-squaring problem of Alfred Tarskis from 1925 whether a disc is equidecomposable to a square. But Miklos Laczkovich’s proof was non-constructive and depended critically on the axiom of choice. Moreover, the pieces he used were not measurable. Some pieces are like jig-saw pieces, others are curves and others are collections of points, which makes his solution unsatisfactory. Andrew Marks and Spencer Unger presented a constructive solution of the circle-squaring problem in 2017 with measurable pieces with the quantity of 10 to the power of 200 (Borel sets), which also makes their solution inaccessible for daily use without high-tech computers.<br/><br/>It appears to be a great mystery how the creators of this crop circle incorporated the number of PI into a pictogram on a barley field and probably solved the problem of the squaring of the circle with geometrical alignments. With this never been seen before geometrical solution of the squaring of the circle the creator of this crop circle could have gotten famous, why or who did create such a incredible achievement in art, geometry and mathematics? The accuracy of the build and deeper meaning of the encoded message is stunning. Bert Janssen also associates this crop circle with the queens chamber and the great pyramid of Giza, the queens chamber and Gnostics knowledge.</td></tr><tr><td>Place</td><td></td><td>Barbury Castle</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td></td><td>United Kingdom</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/ramar/Phenomenon.png","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.5,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[-1.803329,51.486065,0]}},{"id":58,"name":"Dr. Rober Plot about ancient crop circles","description":"<!--HTML-->\r\n<table><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><img src=\"http://ramar.space/wp-content/uploads/formidable/5/dr.robertPlot_cropcircle.png\" alt=\"Dr. Rober Plot about ancient crop circles\" style=\"width:360px\"></td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td></td><td>Dr. Rober Plot about ancient crop circles</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td></td><td>In a book written by Robert Plot in 1686 in England, entitled The Natural History of Stafford-Shire it is written about a man named Nicolae Lang-Bernhard, who was walking home in the afternoon of August 8, 1590, when he saw a group of people who possessed hooves instead of feet, dancing in a field before rising into the sky and disappearing.

Something was pushing them to run away, without any clothes or supplies. The investigators follow the trail to the edge of the forest and found all 9 hikers dead! Their bodies were mutilated in very strange ways. They were burned, radiated, poisoned, prematuraly aged, their skin had turned orange, their hair had turned gray. Some of them had internal injuries and one of them was missing his tongue.<br/>An unknown force had hit the hikers, it was very selective in hitting only the hikers, leaving untouched the snow, the trees and everything else around.<br/>Years later, members of the search-party spoke out.

Only how? All three species of electric eels master this electrical weapon, some with a little more voltage than others. But the command to create the electricity-producing organs must have existed in the animals genomes more than 23 million years ago. Otherwise, not all three electric eel varieties distributed across the globe would have mastered the ability to generate high voltage. How these organs are supposed to have evolved in a process of millions of years remains obscure. Did it slowly tickle the stomach? And if the animal touched another animal, why did the electric shock discharge only on the prey animal and not also on the electric eel? After all, both animals are in water. And every child knows that water conducts electricity. Did an electric shock suddenly strike an electric eel in the course of evolution? Why didnt he die from it himself and interrupt the evolutionary chain? Shouldnt the first high-voltage shock have been a moment of tremendous fright for the electric eel itself? How does the little brain of the eel measure whether a very strong or a weak charge of electricity is necessary to knock the enemy cold? After all, decisions would have to be made in a flash -current from one or all three organs? Otherwise, the eel is eaten. I have great difficulty in imagining a slow development of something like electricity in the body of an electric eel....„<br/><br/>Erich von Däniken proposes, it could be to conclude that the high voltage electricity of the electric Eel didnt evolve in time over an evolutionary process but rather was written in their DNA since their beginning.

Over a mysterious way the wasp conducts, through the feeler of the cockroach, the cockroach to her own grave into a burrow. The cockroach crawls like a zombie down into her demise. After reaching the burrow, the wasp lays an egg into the cockroach and builds a ridge around the cockroach with little stones. After 4 weeks a new Emerald cockroach wasp emerges out of the cockroach and a new mysterious reproduction cycle starts from new.<br/><br/>According to Dr. Erich von Däniken it is extremely questionable which evolutionary processes must have taken place to accomplish such a reproduction cycle! How should a wasp come to the conclusion that this is her best way for reproduction? And how did the wasp develop this process to paralyse a cockroach and know where the nervous systems area is to sting this particular spot with a specific chemical blend to conduct the cockroach as zombie with her own feeler into a burrow? - If the wasp would sting in the wrong area, the much larger (10 times) cockroach would kill the wasp easily. Also, why should a wasp choose such a strange way for reproduction at all? How should have this reproductive cycle ever started or where? How has this knowledge of a rather complex reproduction cycle been inherited onto the next generation? It remains a great mystery why and how these great circumstances have been chosen for reproduction and fit into todays evolution theory as well.</td></tr><tr><td>Place</td><td></td><td>Hawaii, Moloka‘i</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td></td><td>United States</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/ramar/Phenomenon.png","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.5,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[-156.971818,21.14055,0]}},{"id":71,"name":"Epic of Gilgamesh","description":"<!--HTML-->\r\n<table><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><img src=\"http://ramar.space/wp-content/uploads/formidable/5/Statue-of-Gilgamesh.jpg\" alt=\"Epic of Gilgamesh\" style=\"width:360px\"></td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td></td><td>Epic of Gilgamesh</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td></td><td>In the classic Paleo-SETI documentary of the 70s called Erinnerungen an die Zukunft (English, Chariots of the Gods) Dr. Erich von Däniken presents the following mysterious case of the epic of Gilgamesh.<br/><br/>In Bagdad in the museum of Iraq a new trace was found, because inside the museum important stone tablets with cuneiform writing are beeing preserved. The stone tablets are at least 5000 years old. They narrate of mysterious creatures who descended to earth under clouds of smoke and rolling thunder sounds. By the turn of the century 12  cuneiform tablets were found which narrated the epic of Gilgamesh. The epic of Gilgamesh narrates the history of creation which is very similar to the biblical Genesis, but the people who wrote the epic of Gilgamesh lived 2000 years earlier than the authors of the bible. The heroic character of Gilgamesh himself is described as a mixed creature between human and god. The seventh stone tablet narrates something amazing, Enkidu a friend of Gilgamesh gives us the first eyewitness report of space flight. He stayed 12 hours inside a space ship that ascended from earth to space. It is narrated and translated literally: look down to the land, how does it look? Look at the sea, how does it appear? And the land seemed like gruel and the sea like a water trough. Nearly with the same words astronauts did describe their visual impression from earth out in space.<br/><br/>Here is a brief summary of the story of the Gilgamesh epic:<br/>The Epic of Gilgamesh is an ancient Mesopotamian epic poem that dates back to the 3rd millennium BCE. It tells the story of Gilgamesh, the king of Uruk, who is two-thirds god and one-third human. Gilgamesh is a powerful but oppressive ruler who is disliked by his people.<br/><br/>To curb Gilgameshs abuses, the gods create a wild man named Enkidu to challenge him. Enkidu and Gilgamesh fight, but ultimately become friends and go on a quest to defeat the demon Humbaba and gain immortality. Along the way, they encounter various challenges and obstacles, including a visit to the underworld and a confrontation with the goddess Ishtar.<br/><br/>In the end, Gilgamesh fails to achieve immortality, but gains wisdom and learns to accept his mortality. The story emphasizes the importance of friendship, the inevitability of death, and the search for meaning in life.<br/><br/>The Epic of Gilgamesh is considered one of the earliest surviving works of literature and offers valuable insights into the culture and beliefs of ancient Mesopotamia. It has been studied and translated by scholars for centuries and continues to be a significant cultural artifact.<br/><br/>In this real x-file case we are probably looking at at least two anomalies, ancient historical records of extra terrestrial interaction and traces of ancient advanced technology. If we take such narrations not as mythological but as a real happened story, it would change the officially recognized history of humanity.</td></tr><tr><td>Place</td><td></td><td>Iraqi National Museum, Baghdad, Irak</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td></td><td>Iraq</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/ramar/Phenomenon.png","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.5,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[44.384895,33.328085,0]}},{"id":75,"name":"First lieutenant Robert Salas - UFOs over military base","description":"<!--HTML-->\r\n<table><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><img src=\"http://ramar.space/wp-content/uploads/formidable/5/GLOSSY_CROPPED.jpg\" alt=\"First lieutenant Robert Salas - UFOs over military base\" style=\"width:360px\"></td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td></td><td>First lieutenant Robert Salas - UFOs over military base</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td></td><td>First lieutenant Robert Salas stated following at a speech in Sindelfingen DE in April 2015:<br/>On March 24, 1967, I was first lieutenant on the air force base in Malmstrom, Montana / USA.

Seen from the Vlajkovac circles, which are located on the other side of the mountain, at an angle of 90 degrees, the sun also rises at the foot of the highest peak, which, looking from that perspective, is the hill on which the Vršac Tower is located. This indicates that Vatin could have served as a winter sanctuary, and Vlajkovac as a summer sanctuary.</td></tr><tr><td>Place</td><td></td><td>Vatin, Vrsac</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td></td><td>Serbia</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/ramar/Phenomenon.png","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.5,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[21.287255,45.210351,0]}},{"id":140,"name":"Nasa scientist Silvano P.

As biophysicist and IT-expert at the research center Ames Research Center in California he points out after a new study and results of the Kepler-project, that much older solar systems as 10.4 Gyr with earth like planets exist than our solar system with about 4.5 Gyr. This means it’s very probable that on these planets an alien species exist which may be much more developed than we are and they may have the technology for interstellar travel or aren’t based on a carbon based organism like we are. He also mentions in his white paper that the SETI program has ignored the phenomena of the UFO sightings and gives them recommendations how to research and analyze in future those issues e.g to study UFO reports as a low signal to noise ratio phenomenon.<br/><br/>RAMAR clearly sees the fact that NASA scientists and astronauts claim that it’s very possible that aliens exist and provide factual data which support this fact.<br/><br/>Dr. Silvano Colombano works in the Computational Sciences Division at NASAs Ames Research Center, where he leads a group<br/>in Evolutionary Biotronics.

Joao Américo Peret documented their legend in 1952, before the first man in space. (Juri Gagarin, 1961)<br/>Until today, the tribe unites once a year and do the dance around their leader in a straw suit. He holds a stick in his hands, which is called kop. The legend the dancing tribe sings is roughly as following: A tremendous thundering appeared in the sky and all people and the animals from the forest tried to hide. The next day a big being stood in the middle of the village. It had no opening for mouth, nose or ears. It was huge, but friendly – it presented gifts to the natives and they offered some as well. He later teached the Kayapo in astronomy, agriculture, some tricks to melt stone (soft surface, which hardens again after a few minutes) and so on. His stick turned out to be a paralization weapon, which he demonstrated on an attacking Jaguar. When Bep Koroti left, he promised to return once in far time. That’s why the tradition is still living – to prepare the far generations for the return of their heavenly teacher.<br/><br/>We find this kind of straw suits also in German traditions, for example in Bad Herrenalb or Ebhausen in the Black forest.

Sometimes she would speak during these trance-like states, and one day in July she predicted that she would die three days later.  When the predicted day (July 19) came, she seemed to die. At least members of her family and other villagers considered her dead, because she was pulseless and apneic, and her face was drained of blood like that of a dead person. They had begun grieving and also preparing for Sumitras funeral, when she unexpectedly revived. After a period of confusion, she stated that she was one Shiva Diwedi who had been murdered in another village.<br/><br/>She gave enough details to permit verification of her statements, which corresponded to facts in the life of another young married woman called Shiva. Shiva had lived in a place called Dibiyapur about 100 km away, and she had died violently there - either by suicide or murder -about two months before Sumitras apparent death and revival. Subsequently, Sumitra recognized 23 persons (in person or in photographs) known to Shiva. She also showed in several respects new behavior that accorded with Shivas personality and attainments.<br/><br/>For example, Shivas family were Brahmins (high caste), whereas Sumitras were Thakurs (second caste). After the change in her personality Sumitra showed Brahmin habits that were strange in her family. Extensive interviews with 53 informants satisfied the investigators that the families concerned had been, as they claimed, completely unknown to each other before the case developed and that Sumitra had had no normal knowledge of the people and events in Shivas life.

This species and some other species of butterflies possess a strange reproduction procedure. <br/><br/>The females of the dusky large blue butterfly lay their eggs in the not yet fully bloomed buds of the great burnet (Sanguisorba officinalis ) to which the butterfly owes its name. These caterpillars eat the flowers and in due time they drop to the ground. After the third molt, the butterfly caterpillar suddenly looks almost like the larva of a knotted ant. And not only that: the caterpillar also smells like the ant larva and even makes the same sounds. Therefore, it is no wonder that the adult knot ants immediately adopt such a motherless butterfly caterpillar and bring it home to their burrow. Normally, ants would actually eat caterpillars and feed them to their brood themselves. But the caterpillars of the dusky large blue butterfly give off a certain sugar juice. Because ants are gourmands, they let these caterpillars live. A mistake that costs the ants dearly. The foundling turns out to be a killer. It eats the ant larvae, up to 600 of them in the course of ten months. After the winter, the caterpillar pupates and the time approaches when the hoax must be busted. Now the pressure is on. Barely out of the cocoon, the butterfly must leave the ant nest as quickly as possible. Otherwise it will quickly become food for the brood of ants.<br/><br/>Dr. Erich von Däniken states, its very difficult to explain which evolutionary process must have taken place to bring up a living entity like a butterfly that went through 4 development stages in one single life. From an egg to a caterpillar, then into a cocoon and finally the butterfly itself. Similar to most other insects this is an incredible genetic program. This is actually a kind of macro evolutionary transformation in one single living entity. Macroevolution is what Charles Darwin stated has to be proven over time and this prove has never taken place until today, e.g that wales originated from seals or a fish became a reptile through evolutionary cycle. - Hence it shows actually that the whole development is written already in the DNA of the species. Other than that it seems also to be a great mystery how this particular caterpillar found out this rather strange, risky and difficult method for reproduction.</td></tr><tr><td>Place</td><td></td><td>Rajon Riwne</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td></td><td>Ukraine</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/ramar/Phenomenon.png","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.5,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[26.113042,50.707584,0]}},{"id":194,"name":"The four of paradise and the JAHWE spaceship or Merkaba of Ezekiel","description":"<!--HTML-->\r\n<table><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><img src=\"http://ramar.space/wp-content/uploads/formidable/5/Kfar_BarAm02-3.png\" alt=\"The four of paradise and the JAHWE spaceship or Merkaba of Ezekiel\" style=\"width:360px\"></td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td></td><td>The four of paradise and the JAHWE spaceship or Merkaba of Ezekiel</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td></td><td>In the 5th edition of the Legendary Times magazine in the year 2022 Mrs. Gisela Ermel found interesting informations in her research about the Hekhalot literature and the four of paradise.

In a other passage of the text it is mentioned about a latter into heaven which may appear conflicting.<br/><br/>Seven stations are described in the Hekhalot texts, which the four of paradise did have to pass. At these stations it is written that chariots of fire were present with flames emitting underneath them. <br/><br/>At all stations the four of paradise were questioned to speak particular words, codes or maybe passwords and also prayers. Modern researchers suggest these were certain incantations which had to be spoken to pass through a gate into the next station. E.g of one „seal“ who angel Suriah did issue as responsible gate keeper according to the text of Siddur Rabba is „SWRTQ DRGYNT ,RK NZYR SWRTYN RDYDYH“.<br/><br/>Is this entire case showing remarkable parallels of ancient historical records of extra terrestrial interaction, narrated in nearly all ancient cultures? – Interaction with heavenly entities in flying objects. <br/><br/>As well it can be interpreted and understood that the involved four persons did encounter sophisticated technology which they didnt have words for. <br/><br/>What if such cases arent just mythologic in nature but real happened history in our distant past? <br/><br/>This story or case is strongly connected with the even older story of Ezekiel, which is also reported at RAMAR. Please read also the story and case of Ezekiel if still unknown.</td></tr><tr><td>Place</td><td></td><td>Bar'am, Israel</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td></td><td>Israel</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/ramar/Phenomenon.png","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.5,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[35.433235,33.058979,0]}},{"id":196,"name":"The hopi eagle dancer crop circle","description":"<!--HTML-->\r\n<table><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><img src=\"http://ramar.space/wp-content/uploads/formidable/5/kachina_eagle_dancer02.jpg\" alt=\"The hopi eagle dancer crop circle\" style=\"width:360px\"></td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td></td><td>The hopi eagle dancer crop circle</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td></td><td>Many know the Kachina figures of the Hopi Indians.

Canola sticks in the fields together and breaks immediately when force is applied to bend it according to many statements of farmers, hence makes it impossible to forgery or to realize exact forms with boards or rolls, the tools of forgers or crop circle artists. This fact has been verified within the Merlin-1 crop circle project of the A.A.S association.  This Menorah type is the oldest type with the three-legged foot. Zechariah asks an angel in the Bible 4:2-6 what the Menorah is. The angel replied It shall not be by my army or by my power, but by my Spirit, saith the LORD of hosts. Zebaoth is a God attribute of YHWH. Is an extra-dimensional intelligence reminding us here that we should reminisce the Holy Spirit, the Tree of Life? 2 years earlier, a Kabbalah tree manifested in the same field, also in Canola.

For many years he worked for Romes Saint Paul press as a Bible translator providing with great precision the literal meaning of Hebrew words for Vatican approved Interlinear Bibles. He wrote several famous books like „Ancient Aliens in the Bible: Evidence of UFOs, Nephilim, and the True Face of Angels in Ancient Scriptures Ancient Aliens in the Bible: Evidence of UFOs, Nephilim, and the True Face of Angels in Ancient Scriptures “ or „The Naked Bible: The Truth about the most famous book in history“. <br/><br/>On his Youtube Channel Mauro Biglino states together with Paul Wallis, an internationally best-selling author, researcher and Scholar of ancient mythologies and senior Church man, that in the Bible many words are translated wrong. Hence the meaning is completely distorted into something mythological and that the translators of the old bible did this consciously to supress the ancient aliens origin of human kind.<br/><br/>Mauro Biglino and Paul Wallis state the word „Ruach“ would mean a physical flying object in the context of the Bible, when translated correctly. This is playing a huge role in the first chapter of Genesis, the story of Elijah or in the story of Ezekiel, as this would mean that not the spirit of god, but rather a space ship would be meant.<br/><br/>Erich von Däniken already made this suggestion about biblical misinterpretation of words in the 70s and that actually space ships or sophisticated technology was meant instead of mythological or spiritual interpretations. His thesis is being supported in the meantime by many scholars.<br/><br/>Here are some excerpts of Mauro Biglino and Paul Wallis statements:<br/>„….The Elohim hovered over the waters using this medium that is called ruach.  <br/>Ruach means wind, the air that moves or even something that moves in the air.  <br/>These  flying objects always have a precise location: in this case the ruach is above the waters therefore at that moment it is not on dry land, therefore it is something limited in a space and in movement. This is a characteristic that cannot be attributed to the spirit of God which would obviously be present everywhere. ….the ruach of Yahweh had physically taken Elijah and according to them may have dropped him somewhere in the surrounding territory. …..The Hebrew language like all others is polysemic:  that is, each word can have several meanings. The problem arises when, for religious and dogmatic reasons, only one of these meanings ends up being used more than the others. It is  surely the case of theological exegetes whom have always translated ruach as Spirit of God. This is a mistake…..Now when the ruach appears in Genesis 1 it hovers over the waters to begin the work of terraforming. So Id flag right away that the story we think of as a creation narrative is really a recovery story because the planet already Exists.</td></tr><tr><td>Place</td><td></td><td>Khirbet Qumran Caves, Kalya, Israel</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td></td><td>Palestine</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/ramar/Phenomenon.png","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.5,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[35.459676,31.741453,0]}},{"id":205,"name":"The salmon run","description":"<!--HTML-->\r\n<table><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><img src=\"http://ramar.space/wp-content/uploads/formidable/5/sockeye_salmon.jpg\" alt=\"The salmon run\" style=\"width:360px\"></td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td></td><td>The salmon run</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td></td><td>Until today the salmon run remains an unsolved mystery.

It is unbelievable how they find their way back home. What kind of navigation system exist in these fishes? Magnetic iron oxide has been found in their cells, hence the theory came up that they navigate upon the magnetic field of the earth. But after multiple proven pole reversals this theory doesnt hold water.  Also do so many countless arms of these rivers exist which makes this theory even more questionable. Other theories like the navigation upon a starmap doesnt hold water as well, after the precession of the earth would change their starmap navigation system over time and eons.<br/><br/>Is it to conclude that this whole reproduction or living cycle of the salmons didnt evolve in the time over an evolutionary process but rather was written in their DNS since the first salmon?</td></tr><tr><td>Place</td><td></td><td>British Columbia</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td></td><td>Canada</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/ramar/Phenomenon.png","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.5,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[-122.586211,54.119877,0]}},{"id":207,"name":"The triple Julia Set crop circle appeared 2 nights after intensely bright objects have been sighted","description":"<!--HTML-->\r\n<table><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><img src=\"http://ramar.space/wp-content/uploads/formidable/5/tripljuliaset01.jpg\" alt=\"The triple Julia Set crop circle appeared 2 nights after intensely bright objects have been sighted\" style=\"width:360px\"></td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td></td><td>The triple Julia Set crop circle appeared 2 nights after intensely bright objects have been sighted</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td></td><td>The triple Julia Set crop circle appeared on the 07.27.1996 shortly after the original Juliat Set crop circle in Stonehenge (appeareance on 07.08.1996).

With 194 circles which centers were laid differently, even in the smallest circles at the border, it makes this crop circle an incredible mystery which cant be explained by any natural phenomenon or man made labour.</td></tr><tr><td>Place</td><td></td><td>Windmill Hill, Wiltshire</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td></td><td>United Kingdom</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/ramar/Phenomenon.png","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.5,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[-1.827297,51.432988,0]}},{"id":212,"name":"Time travel through Gods power 2500 years ago described in Apocrypha book “Remains of the Words of Baruch” (4th Baruch)","description":"<!--HTML-->\r\n<table><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><img src=\"http://ramar.space/wp-content/uploads/formidable/5/Abimelech.jpg\" alt=\"Time travel through Gods power 2500 years ago described in Apocrypha book “Remains of the Words of Baruch” (4th Baruch)\" style=\"width:360px\"></td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td></td><td>Time travel through Gods power 2500 years ago described in Apocrypha book “Remains of the Words of Baruch” (4th Baruch)</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td></td><td>The biblical book “Remains of the Words of Baruch” (4th Baruch), which is not part of the Bible, transmits an alleged time travel. <br/>The writing belongs to the apocrypha of the Old Testament and the plot takes place at the time of the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple of Solomon by the Babylonians in the 6th century BC.<br/>At that time there had lived a man named Abimelech, who is also mentioned in the Old Testament. A servant of the king in Jerusalem. Since the latter had previously saved the prophet Jeremiah, the latter did not want him to have to witness the destruction of the city. So he and God arranged for his protection.<br/>For this purpose, God planned that Abimelech should leave the city under a pretext before the destruction. Then he would “hide” him, as the saying goes. Before that, however, they buried the Ark of the Covenant and other sanctuaries from the Temple at night in the Temple Mount for safety from the coming enemies.<br/>The following day it happened that Abimelech was to be “hidden” by the power of the Lord. He fell asleep outside he city while gathering fruit and did not wake up until 66 years in the future.<br/>Back in Jerusalem, he no longer recognized anyone in the city. Even the city itself was strange to him, since even the temple no longer existed. The Babylonians had completely destroyed it. He no longer recognized it. With the help of an old man and an angel, the miracle cleared up: a time travel. As if to prove it, Abimelech still had with him the fruit he had gathered 66 years earlier (figs), which were still juicy and fresh. Although at that time of year, the plant was far from bearing fruit.<br/>Thus the prophet Jeremiah was informed in the exile in Babylon with the help of an eagle as a messenger and the captivity of the Jews in Babylon approached the end.</td></tr><tr><td>Place</td><td></td><td>Jerusalem</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td></td><td>Israel</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/ramar/Phenomenon.png","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.5,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[35.51416,32.78555,0]}},{"id":230,"name":"Wandering Eel","description":"<!--HTML-->\r\n<table><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><img src=\"http://ramar.space/wp-content/uploads/formidable/5/wandering_eel.jpg\" alt=\"Wandering Eel\" style=\"width:360px\"></td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td></td><td>Wandering Eel</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td></td><td>In the book „Alles Evolution – oder was?“ or in English „Evolution Is Wrong“ Dr. Erich von Däniken states that there isnt yet a  explanation of satisfactory for the wandering of the Eels, similar as the Salmons run in the fields of evolutionary developmental biology. Until today the wandering of Eels remains an unsolved mystery why they wander from the rivers around 6500 Kilometers to the far distant Sargasso sea.<br/><br/>Here is a freely translated excerpt of Erich von Dänikens book „Alles Evolution – oder was?“:<br/>„...they do exactly the opposite of what the salmon do. The latter swim from the salt water towards the headwaters of the rivers, their birthplace. The eels practice it the other way around: they swim from the rivers to the distant, salty Sargasso Sea - their birthplace. The Sargasso Sea lies between Florida, the Bahamas and Bermuda and is larger than the Mediterranean Sea. There, the female eels spawn and die. The males bring their sperm over the spawn, and tiny eggs grow. These become larvae, which drift with the ocean currents to Europe. Here they mature into juvenile eels that fight their way up the rivers in large schools. After a few years, the females among them become sexually mature. Then their appearance changes: The dark eel becomes a shiny silvery fish body adapted to the sea. <br/><br/>The eels want to return to their birthplace and swim down the rivers. Sometimes there are problems in doing so. In an article about eel migrations, Carsten Jasner writes: „If the way to the river is cut off because the animals live in ponds or pools, they unceremoniously meander overland.“ This is made possible by the animals fantastic adaptation to their environment by means of special gills and the fact that they can breathe through their (moist) skin. Moreover, they can exist in both freshwater and seawater. As with salmon, wide-awake scientists are searching for the reasons behind eel migration. Norwegian researchers around, marine biologist Caroline Durif put the animals in closed tanks and exposed them to different magnetic fields. Depending on the magnetic field and water temperature, the eels oriented themselves in different directions. <br/><br/>But what inner compulsion steers them year after year to leave their optimal conditions, nutrient-rich river environment and head for the Sargasso Sea thousands of kilometers away? With the huge distances and different ocean currents, the version of the smell of home does not help. The proposed solutions that it is due to the food supply, the water temperature or the magnetic field also arent a satisfactory explanation. Countless other species of life would be just as affected, but they dont think to adapt their behavior to that of the eels....„<br/><br/>Erich von Däniken proposes, it could be to conclude that this whole reproduction or living cycle of the Eels didnt evolve in time over an evolutionary process but rather was written in their DNS since the first Eel.</td></tr><tr><td>Place</td><td></td><td>Sargasso Sea, North Atlantic Sea</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td></td><td>null</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/ramar/Phenomenon.png","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.5,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[-69.287813,31.457438,0]}}]}
