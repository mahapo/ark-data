{"name":"Pyramids","description":"<img src='images/catalog/pyramids.jpg' width='100%' alt='Sphinx at Giza Cairo, Egypt With Khafre Pyramid Behind'><br/>A pyramid is a structure whose outer surfaces are triangular and converge to a single point at the top, making the shape roughly a pyramid in the geometric sense. The base of a pyramid can be trilateral, quadrilateral, or any polygon shape, meaning that a pyramid has at least three outer triangular surfaces (at least four faces including the base).","type":"czml","url":"api/points/leylines/view_poi/Pyramid"}
