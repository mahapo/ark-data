There used to be at lest one other stone near the middle one, but that was used to make a nearby bridge a great many years ago. The stones are of millstone grit and were brought nearly 7 miles from Knaresborough. The legend associated with the megaliths states they are arrows fired by the Devil to destroy the nearby town of Aldborough, but have fallen short of their target.","type":"czml","url":"api/line/leylines/lines/devils-arrows-line/50/255,255,66","dataCustodian":"https://leyhunters.co.uk"},{"id":"leyhunters-glastonbury","name":"Glastonbury Ley - Avon/Somerset","description":"The name of Glastonbury immediately conjures up images of King Arthur and mystic Avalon: a sacred centre shrouded in delicate mists. As it happens, Glastonbury provides exactly this appearance in real life, with the whole area dominated by the extraordinary Glastonbury Tor - a sacred hill if ever there was one. This ley passes through Glastonbury and the Tor, commencing in the N of what used to be Somerset (now Avon) through to Butleigh near the heart of the Glastonbury zodiac. It is a development of research by Janet Roberts and John Mitchell, who has shown it to be part of a system of leys around Glastonbury defining the cryptic geometry of the 'New Jerusalem'.","type":"czml","url":"api/line/leylines/lines/glastonbury-line/50/255,255,66","dataCustodian":"https://leyhunters.co.uk"},{"id":"leyhunters-long-man","name":"Long Man of Wilmington Ley - Sussex","description":"This ley runs SSW-NNE for just over two miles from Friston Forest, over Windover Hill and the Long Man, to the village of Wilmington. It seems as if other leys may pass through and near the Long Man, and we in no way claim this to be the best.","type":"czml","url":"api/line/leylines/lines/long-man-line/50/255,255,66","dataCustodian":"https://leyhunters.co.uk"},{"id":"leyhunters-maiden-castle","name":"Maiden Castle Ley - Dorset","description":"Stretching for just over 8 miles SE-NW across the countryside immediately S of Dorchester, this ley runs from Warmwell Church to tumuli at Winterborne Steepleton.","type":"czml","url":"api/line/leylines/lines/maiden-castle-line/50/255,255,66","dataCustodian":"https://leyhunters.co.uk"},{"id":"leyhunters-mayburgh","name":"Mayburgh Ley - Cumbria","description":"This alignment is on the East fringe of the Lake District.

We have already mentioned Michell's Boscawen-un ley (p.46) as an alignment of such precision that it takes the question of the existence of leys clear outside the realm of statistical probability. This one, from Men-an-tol, runs fractionally N of E for 3 3/4 miles.","type":"czml","url":"api/line/leylines/lines/men-an-tol-line/50/255,255,66","dataCustodian":"https://leyhunters.co.uk"},{"id":"leyhunters-montgomery","name":"Montgomery Ley - Powys/Shropshire","description":"This ley runs for 53/4 miles SE-NW through unspoilt countryside in and out of the border between Shropshire and Powys (Wales).","type":"czml","url":"api/line/leylines/lines/montgomery-line/50/255,255,66","dataCustodian":"https://leyhunters.co.uk"},{"id":"leyhunters-old-sarum","name":"Old Sarum Ley - Wiltshire/Hampshire","description":"This is another classic alignment originating with Sir Norman Lockyer, though in this case we have modified the line by extending it to the S and marginally changing its angle.","type":"czml","url":"api/line/leylines/lines/old-sarum-line/50/255,255,66","dataCustodian":"https://leyhunters.co.uk"},{"id":"leyhunters-rollrigth","name":"Rollright Ley - Northamptonshire/Oxfordshire","description":"From an earthwork by Chipping Warden in Northamptonshire, the ley runs from 16 3/4 miles SW to the Rollright stone circle in Oxfordshire. A difficulty to watch for when attempting to plot leys through the Rollright Stones is that their relative positions on the 1:50,000 and 1:25,000 scales do not quite tally. A small difference, but enough to seriously affect ley hunting.","type":"czml","url":"api/line/leylines/lines/rollright-line/50/255,255,66","dataCustodian":"https://leyhunters.co.uk"},{"id":"leyhunters-rudston","name":"Rudston Ley - North Yorkshire/Humberside","description":"The ley runs NW-SE for just over 10 miles across the undulating wolds of what used to be called the East Riding of Yorkshire.","type":"czml","url":"api/line/leylines/lines/rudston-line/50/255,255,66","dataCustodian":"https://leyhunters.co.uk"},{"id":"leyhunters-silbury-hill","name":"Silbury Hill Ley - Wiltshire","description":"This ley runs for 13 miles NNE-SSW through Avebury and Silbury Hill.","type":"czml","url":"api/line/leylines/lines/silbury-hill-line/50/255,255,66","dataCustodian":"https://leyhunters.co.uk"},{"id":"leyhunters-st-paul","name":"St. Paul's Cathedral Ley - London","description":"This church alignment stretches for just under 3 1/4 miles WSW-ENE across the heart of Old London.

The orientations of all the churches approximate - sometimes very closely to the bearing of the ley, but do not coincide exactly.","type":"czml","url":"api/line/leylines/lines/st-pauls-cathedral-line/50/255,255,66","dataCustodian":"https://leyhunters.co.uk"},{"id":"leyhunters-stonehenge","name":"Stonehenge Ley - Wiltshire","description":"This is the classic line discovered by Sir Norman Lockyear and extended by K.H.
