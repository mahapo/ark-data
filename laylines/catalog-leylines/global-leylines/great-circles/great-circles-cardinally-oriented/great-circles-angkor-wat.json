It is the largest freshwater lake by volume in the world, containing roughly 20% of the world's unfrozen surface fresh water. With 23,615.39 km3 (5,700 cu mi) of fresh water, it contains more water than all the North American Great Lakes combined. With a maximum depth of 1,642 m (5,387 ft), Baikal is the world's deepest lake. It is considered among the world's clearest lakes and is considered the world's oldest lake — at 25 million years. It is the seventh-largest lake in the world by surface area.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width: 120px; padding: 4px\">Wikipedia:</td><td style=\"width: 240px\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Baikal\">Lake Baikal</a></td></tr><tr><td style=\"width: 120px; padding: 4px\">Custodian:</td><td style=\"width: 240px\">www.leylines.net</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width: 120px; padding: 4px\">Country:</td><td style=\"width: 240px\">Russia</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/icons/star_255-255-255.svg","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.15,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[103.773224,51.674672,0]}},{"id":112,"name":"Angkor Wat","description":"<!--HTML-->\r\n<p>\r\n<table><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><img src=\"/images/popup/Angkor_Wat.jpg\" alt=\"Angkor Wat\" style=\"width:360px\"></td></tr><tr><td style=\"width: 360px; padding: 4px\" colspan=\"2\">Angkor Wat is a temple complex in Cambodia and the largest religious monument in the world, with the site measuring 162.6 hectares (1,626,000 m2; 402 acres). It was originally constructed as a Hindu temple for the Khmer Empire, gradually transforming into a Buddhist temple toward the end of the 12th century.[2] It was built by the Khmer King Suryavarman II in the early 12th century in Yaśodharapura, the capital of the Khmer Empire, as his state temple and eventual mausoleum. Breaking from the Shaiva tradition of previous kings, Angkor Wat was instead dedicated to Vishnu. As the best-preserved temple at the site, it is the only one to have remained a significant religious center since its foundation. The temple is at the top of the high classical style of Khmer architecture.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width: 120px; padding: 4px\">Wikipedia:</td><td style=\"width: 240px\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angkor_Wat\">Angkor Wat</a></td></tr><tr><td style=\"width: 120px; padding: 4px\">Custodian:</td><td style=\"width: 240px\">www.leylines.net</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width: 120px; padding: 4px\">Country:</td><td style=\"width: 240px\">Cambodia</td></tr></table>\r\n</p>","billboard":{"eyeOffset":{"cartesian":[0,0,0]},"horizontalOrigin":"CENTER","image":"/images/icons/star_255-255-255.svg","heightReference":"CLAMP_TO_GROUND","pixelOffset":{"cartesian2":[0,0]},"scale":0.15,"show":true,"verticalOrigin":"CENTER"},"position":{"cartographicDegrees":[103.86661,13.41237,0]}}]}
