We have already mentioned Michell's Boscawen-un ley (p.46) as an alignment of such precision that it takes the question of the existence of leys clear outside the realm of statistical probability. This one, from Men-an-tol, runs fractionally N of E for 3 3/4 miles.","type":"czml","url":"api/line/leylines/lines/men-an-tol-line/50/255,255,66","dataCustodian":"https://leyhunters.co.uk","points":[{"id":"document","name":"simple","version":"1.0"},{"id":"Men-an-tol Ley 1c","name":"Men-an-tol Ley 1","description":"Men-an-tol - Boskednan 4 cairn","corridor":{"width":100,"height":0,"material":{"solidColor":{"color":{"rgba":["255","255","66",64]}}},"outline":false,"positions":{"cartographicDegrees":[-5.60462,50.1584,0,-5.59256,50.159,0]}}},{"id":"Men-an-tol Ley 1p","name":"Men-an-tol Ley 1","description":"Men-an-tol Ley 1","polyline":{"width":3,"followSurface":true,"material":{"polylineGlow":{"color":{"rgba":["255","255","66",64]},"glowPower":0.2}},"positions":{"cartographicDegrees":[-5.60462,50.1584,0,-5.59256,50.159,0]}}},{"id":"Men-an-tol Ley 2c","name":"Men-an-tol Ley 2","description":"Boskednan 4 cairn - Boskednan 3 settlement","corridor":{"width":100,"height":0,"material":{"solidColor":{"color":{"rgba":["255","255","66",64]}}},"outline":false,"positions":{"cartographicDegrees":[-5.59256,50.159,0,-5.58351,50.1592,0]}}},{"id":"Men-an-tol Ley 2p","name":"Men-an-tol Ley 2","description":"Men-an-tol Ley 2","polyline":{"width":3,"followSurface":true,"material":{"polylineGlow":{"color":{"rgba":["255","255","66",64]},"glowPower":0.2}},"positions":{"cartographicDegrees":[-5.59256,50.159,0,-5.58351,50.1592,0]}}},{"id":"Men-an-tol Ley 3c","name":"Men-an-tol Ley 3","description":"Boskednan 3 settlement - Ty Menhir","corridor":{"width":100,"height":0,"material":{"solidColor":{"color":{"rgba":["255","255","66",64]}}},"outline":false,"positions":{"cartographicDegrees":[-5.58351,50.1592,0,-5.55813,50.1602,0]}}},{"id":"Men-an-tol Ley 3p","name":"Men-an-tol Ley 3","description":"Men-an-tol Ley 3","polyline":{"width":3,"followSurface":true,"material":{"polylineGlow":{"color":{"rgba":["255","255","66",64]},"glowPower":0.2}},"positions":{"cartographicDegrees":[-5.58351,50.1592,0,-5.55813,50.1602,0]}}},{"id":"Men-an-tol Ley 4c","name":"Men-an-tol Ley 4","description":"Ty Menhir - Carnequidden Farm","corridor":{"width":100,"height":0,"material":{"solidColor":{"color":{"rgba":["255","255","66",64]}}},"outline":false,"positions":{"cartographicDegrees":[-5.55813,50.1602,0,-5.54705,50.1606,0]}}},{"id":"Men-an-tol Ley 4p","name":"Men-an-tol Ley 4","description":"Men-an-tol Ley 4","polyline":{"width":3,"followSurface":true,"material":{"polylineGlow":{"color":{"rgba":["255","255","66",64]},"glowPower":0.2}},"positions":{"cartographicDegrees":[-5.55813,50.1602,0,-5.54705,50.1606,0]}}},{"id":"Men-an-tol Ley 5c","name":"Men-an-tol Ley 5","description":"Carnequidden Farm - Chysauster","corridor":{"width":100,"height":0,"material":{"solidColor":{"color":{"rgba":["255","255","66",64]}}},"outline":false,"positions":{"cartographicDegrees":[-5.54705,50.1606,0,-5.54041,50.1609,0]}}},{"id":"Men-an-tol Ley 5p","name":"Men-an-tol Ley 5","description":"Men-an-tol Ley 5","polyline":{"width":3,"followSurface":true,"material":{"polylineGlow":{"color":{"rgba":["255","255","66",64]},"glowPower":0.2}},"positions":{"cartographicDegrees":[-5.54705,50.1606,0,-5.54041,50.1609,0]}}},{"id":"Men-an-tol Ley 6c","name":"Men-an-tol Ley 6","description":"Chysauster - Castle-an-Dinas","corridor":{"width":100,"height":0,"material":{"solidColor":{"color":{"rgba":["255","255","66",64]}}},"outline":false,"positions":{"cartographicDegrees":[-5.52279,50.1616,0,-5.54041,50.1609,0]}}},{"id":"Men-an-tol Ley 6p","name":"Men-an-tol Ley 6","description":"Men-an-tol Ley 6","polyline":{"width":3,"followSurface":true,"material":{"polylineGlow":{"color":{"rgba":["255","255","66",64]},"glowPower":0.2}},"positions":{"cartographicDegrees":[-5.52279,50.1616,0,-5.54041,50.1609,0]}}}]}
