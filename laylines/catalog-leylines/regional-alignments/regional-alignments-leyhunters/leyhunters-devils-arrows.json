{"id":"leyhunters-devils-arrows","name":"Devil's Arrows Ley - North Yorkshire","description":"The Devil's Arrows (39126650) are three Bronze Age standing stones, giant monoliths ranging in height from 18 feet to 221/2 feet, the tallest stones in Britain apart from the Rudston monolith. There used to be at lest one other stone near the middle one, but that was used to make a nearby bridge a great many years ago. The stones are of millstone grit and were brought nearly 7 miles from Knaresborough. The legend associated with the megaliths states they are arrows fired by the Devil to destroy the nearby town of Aldborough, but have fallen short of their target.","type":"czml","url":"api/line/leylines/lines/devils-arrows-line/50/255,255,66","dataCustodian":"https://leyhunters.co.uk","points":[{"id":"document","name":"simple","version":"1.0"},{"id":"Devil's Arrows Ley 1c","name":"Devil's Arrows Ley 1","description":"Devil's Arrows - Cana henge","corridor":{"width":100,"height":0,"material":{"solidColor":{"color":{"rgba":["255","255","66",64]}}},"outline":false,"positions":{"cartographicDegrees":[-1.40342,54.0929,0,-1.44856,54.1415,0]}}},{"id":"Devil's Arrows Ley 1p","name":"Devil's Arrows Ley 1","description":"Devil's Arrows Ley 1","polyline":{"width":3,"followSurface":true,"material":{"polylineGlow":{"color":{"rgba":["255","255","66",64]},"glowPower":0.2}},"positions":{"cartographicDegrees":[-1.40342,54.0929,0,-1.44856,54.1415,0]}}},{"id":"Devil's Arrows Ley 2c","name":"Devil's Arrows Ley 2","description":"Cana henge - Tumulus","corridor":{"width":100,"height":0,"material":{"solidColor":{"color":{"rgba":["255","255","66",64]}}},"outline":false,"positions":{"cartographicDegrees":[-1.44856,54.1415,0,-1.45762,54.1512,0]}}},{"id":"Devil's Arrows Ley 2p","name":"Devil's Arrows Ley 2","description":"Devil's Arrows Ley 2","polyline":{"width":3,"followSurface":true,"material":{"polylineGlow":{"color":{"rgba":["255","255","66",64]},"glowPower":0.2}},"positions":{"cartographicDegrees":[-1.44856,54.1415,0,-1.45762,54.1512,0]}}},{"id":"Devil's Arrows Ley 3c","name":"Devil's Arrows Ley 3","description":"Tumulus  - Hutton Moor henge","corridor":{"width":100,"height":0,"material":{"solidColor":{"color":{"rgba":["255","255","66",64]}}},"outline":false,"positions":{"cartographicDegrees":[-1.45762,54.1512,0,-1.46217,54.1562,0]}}},{"id":"Devil's Arrows Ley 3p","name":"Devil's Arrows Ley 3","description":"Devil's Arrows Ley 3","polyline":{"width":3,"followSurface":true,"material":{"polylineGlow":{"color":{"rgba":["255","255","66",64]},"glowPower":0.2}},"positions":{"cartographicDegrees":[-1.45762,54.1512,0,-1.46217,54.1562,0]}}},{"id":"Devil's Arrows Ley 4c","name":"Devil's Arrows Ley 4","description":"Hutton Moor henge - ","corridor":{"width":100,"height":0,"material":{"solidColor":{"color":{"rgba":["255","255","66",64]}}},"outline":false,"positions":{"cartographicDegrees":[-1.47964,54.1749,0,-1.46217,54.1562,0]}}},{"id":"Devil's Arrows Ley 4p","name":"Devil's Arrows Ley 4","description":"Devil's Arrows Ley 4","polyline":{"width":3,"followSurface":true,"material":{"polylineGlow":{"color":{"rgba":["255","255","66",64]},"glowPower":0.2}},"positions":{"cartographicDegrees":[-1.47964,54.1749,0,-1.46217,54.1562,0]}}}]}
