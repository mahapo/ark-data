{"id":"leyhunters-rollrigth","name":"Rollright Ley - Northamptonshire/Oxfordshire","description":"From an earthwork by Chipping Warden in Northamptonshire, the ley runs from 16 3/4 miles SW to the Rollright stone circle in Oxfordshire. A difficulty to watch for when attempting to plot leys through the Rollright Stones is that their relative positions on the 1:50,000 and 1:25,000 scales do not quite tally. A small difference, but enough to seriously affect ley hunting.","type":"czml","url":"api/line/leylines/lines/rollright-line/50/255,255,66","dataCustodian":"https://leyhunters.co.uk","points":[{"id":"document","name":"simple","version":"1.0"},{"id":"Rollright Ley 1c","name":"Rollright Ley 1","description":"Rollright Circle - Madmarston Hill Camp","corridor":{"width":100,"height":0,"material":{"solidColor":{"color":{"rgba":["255","255","66",64]}}},"outline":false,"positions":{"cartographicDegrees":[-1.57106,51.9755,0,-1.43782,52.0472,0]}}},{"id":"Rollright Ley 1p","name":"Rollright Ley 1","description":"Rollright Ley 1","polyline":{"width":3,"followSurface":true,"material":{"polylineGlow":{"color":{"rgba":["255","255","66",64]},"glowPower":0.2}},"positions":{"cartographicDegrees":[-1.57106,51.9755,0,-1.43782,52.0472,0]}}},{"id":"Rollright Ley 2c","name":"Rollright Ley 2","description":"Madmarston Hill Camp - Castle Bank Camp","corridor":{"width":100,"height":0,"material":{"solidColor":{"color":{"rgba":["255","255","66",64]}}},"outline":false,"positions":{"cartographicDegrees":[-1.40916,52.0646,0,-1.43782,52.0472,0]}}},{"id":"Rollright Ley 2p","name":"Rollright Ley 2","description":"Rollright Ley 2","polyline":{"width":3,"followSurface":true,"material":{"polylineGlow":{"color":{"rgba":["255","255","66",64]},"glowPower":0.2}},"positions":{"cartographicDegrees":[-1.40916,52.0646,0,-1.43782,52.0472,0]}}},{"id":"Rollright Ley 3c","name":"Rollright Ley 3","description":"Castle Bank Camp - Wroxton Church","corridor":{"width":100,"height":0,"material":{"solidColor":{"color":{"rgba":["255","255","66",64]}}},"outline":false,"positions":{"cartographicDegrees":[-1.39242,52.0727,0,-1.40916,52.0646,0]}}},{"id":"Rollright Ley 3p","name":"Rollright Ley 3","description":"Rollright Ley 3","polyline":{"width":3,"followSurface":true,"material":{"polylineGlow":{"color":{"rgba":["255","255","66",64]},"glowPower":0.2}},"positions":{"cartographicDegrees":[-1.39242,52.0727,0,-1.40916,52.0646,0]}}},{"id":"Rollright Ley 4c","name":"Rollright Ley 4","description":"Wroxton Church - Cropredy Bridge","corridor":{"width":100,"height":0,"material":{"solidColor":{"color":{"rgba":["255","255","66",64]}}},"outline":false,"positions":{"cartographicDegrees":[-1.31503,52.1148,0,-1.39242,52.0727,0]}}},{"id":"Rollright Ley 4p","name":"Rollright Ley 4","description":"Rollright Ley 4","polyline":{"width":3,"followSurface":true,"material":{"polylineGlow":{"color":{"rgba":["255","255","66",64]},"glowPower":0.2}},"positions":{"cartographicDegrees":[-1.31503,52.1148,0,-1.39242,52.0727,0]}}},{"id":"Rollright Ley 5c","name":"Rollright Ley 5","description":"Cropredy Bridge - Arbury Camp","corridor":{"width":100,"height":0,"material":{"solidColor":{"color":{"rgba":["255","255","66",64]}}},"outline":false,"positions":{"cartographicDegrees":[-1.27968,52.1333,0,-1.31503,52.1148,0]}}},{"id":"Rollright Ley 5p","name":"Rollright Ley 5","description":"Rollright Ley 5","polyline":{"width":3,"followSurface":true,"material":{"polylineGlow":{"color":{"rgba":["255","255","66",64]},"glowPower":0.2}},"positions":{"cartographicDegrees":[-1.27968,52.1333,0,-1.31503,52.1148,0]}}}]}
