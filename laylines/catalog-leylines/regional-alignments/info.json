{"id":"ancient-sites-and-alignments-of-west-penwith","name":"Ancient Sites and Alignments of West Penwith","type":"kml","description":"This is a map of the ancient sites and alignments in West Penwith and in neighbouring areas. The Lizard, Isles of Scilly, Kerrier and East Penwith: these areas form a backdrop to the visual and geomantic landscape of ancient West Penwith. Penwith is a distinctive, mostly cliff-bound, island-like area, with a magical atmosphere and a ruggedness to the land and its residents. Trencrom Hill and St Michael's Mount act as geomantic gateposts to the peninsula. Nowadays, Penwith is at the end of the road, far from metropolitan England, but in ancient times it was a marine node in the Atlantic megalithic world.","url":"leylines-geodata/ancientpenwith.org/Ancient Site Alignments in Cornwall.kmz","dataCustodian":"http://www.palden.co.uk/","legends":[{"url":"http://www.ancientpenwith.org/key.html"}]}
