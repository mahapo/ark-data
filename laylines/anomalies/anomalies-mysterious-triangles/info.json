{"id":"nevada-triangle","name":"Nevada Triangle","type":"czml","url":"api/areas/leylines/anomalies/Nevada","description":"The Nevada Triangle is an area of Nevada and California where many aircraft have vanished. Because Nevadaâ€™s remote wasteland of desert and mountain stretches across more than 25,000 square miles of underpopulated areas, crash sites usually go undiscovered. For the past 50 years or so, nobody is exactly sure how many flights have vanished within the Nevada Triangle. However, many people believe the total is more than 2,000.","rectangle":{"west":-121,"south":35,"east":-114,"north":41}}
