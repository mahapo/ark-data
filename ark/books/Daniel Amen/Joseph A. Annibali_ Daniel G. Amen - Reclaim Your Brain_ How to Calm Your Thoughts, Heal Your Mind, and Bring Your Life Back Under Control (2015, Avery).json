Ahighly trained psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who had already spent decades inclinical practice, Joe isn’t one to rest on his laurels. He continually seeksout knowledge that will help his patients: people who are hurting, from allwalks of life, who come to see him from far and wide. I was so impressed by hisbroad knowledge, kind heart, and open mind that I asked him to join our medicalstaff. Within a short time Joe became the chief psychiatrist in our Reston,Virginia, clinic, just outside of Washington, D.C., and is now a powerful leaderand mentor among our staff of thirty medical professionals.Our story at Amen Clinics began in 1991 when I ordered my first brain SPECTscans on patients with conditions like ADHD (attention deficit/hyperactivitydisorder), severe aggression, and unresponsive anxiety and depression who hadnot improved with standard treatments. Over the years, with Joe’s help, we havebuilt the world’s largest database of brain SPECT scans, now well over 115,000scans on patients from 111 countries. These scans have significantly changed howwe help our patients at Amen Clinics. We’ve learned that psychiatric illnessesare rarely single or simple disorders. Giving someone the diagnosis ofdepression is exactly like giving them the diagnosis of chest pain; thediagnosis does not tell you what the problem is and how serious it might be.Treatment needs to be tailored to the underlying problems in individual brains,not a cluster of symptoms. Significantly, with our approach our patientsunderstand that their problems are medical rather than moral, which hasincreased their willingness to follow the treatment plans and decreased theirstigma about having a psychiatric disorder.The most important lesson we’ve learned from our treasure trove of scans, andthe lesson that has kept Joe and me excited about this work each day, is thatyou are not stuck with the brain you have. As Joe discusses in this crucialbook, if your brain is busy or racing out of control, if your brain isdysfunctional, you can reclaim it. In many thousands of cases, we have seen thatyou can improve brain function, even if you have been really bad to your brain.For example, Amen Clinics did the world’s first and largest brain-imaging studyon active and retired NFL players, where we saw high levels of brain injury.That was not a surprise. Your brain is soft, about the consistency of softbutter, and it is housed in a really hard skull with multiple sharp bony ridges,so it is easily damaged. All of the news about concussions in sports has beenbad, with an increased incidence of depression, suicide, and dementia. But whatreally excited us with our NFL study was that on our program to help the playersreclaim their brains, the same one Joe will outline in this book, 80 percent ofour 170 players showed high levels of improvement, especially in their mood,memory, sleep, and brain function.When Joe and I were in medical school in the late 1970s and early 1980s, we weretaught that the brain doesn’t heal. But now we know that is wrong. If you putthe brain in a healing environment, often it can get better, much better, but itrequires forethought and a great plan. And this healing is not just for footballplayers. We have seen improvement in brain function for people with attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsivedisorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), Lyme disease, addictions,and even improvement in some people with Alzheimer’s disease.In this book, Joe shares many of the important lessons we have learned, while atthe same time giving you his unique perspective on healing. I encouraged Joe towrite this book because of his extensive experiences and perspective as a masterpsychiatrist who integrates the latest thinking about the mind with our work onlooking at and optimizing the brain. Reading this book will be like sitting onthe psychiatrist’s couch of the future.In recent years Joe has also become an expert on the effects on the brain ofLyme disease, in part because his own daughter has had it. Both Joe and Ibelieve infectious diseases, like Lyme, will play a significant role in howpsychiatrists will help people in the future, which you will learn about. Joe isalso an expert on Irlen syndrome, a visual processing disorder, which can beassociated with headaches, anxiety, learning challenges, and irritability.One of the key ideas of this book is that you need first to heal (an injuredbrain if present) and balance the brain before other interventions can workwell. Too often people see therapists to help their minds, when they first needto help their brains work better. Readers will learn a lot about what they cando to help themselves from the tools and approaches presented here. Most readerswill not need to come for a SPECT scan to benefit from the information given inReclaim Your Brain. The book is a great illustration of how much anyone canimprove and heal when we pay attention to the mind and brain at the same time.Reclaim Your Brain is your road map to a better brain and a better life. It ispacked with useful information, powerful stories, and a completely new way ofthinking that can help you feel better quickly as you heal and balance your busybrain, while at the same time teaching you how to protect the most importantpart of you (your brain) for many years to come. I am excited for you as youembark on reading and applying the principles in Reclaim Your Brain. They havechanged my life and the lives of many others. With Dr. Annibali’s expertguidance, I know they will help you change your life for the better.Daniel G.

I haveprofound admiration for Dr. Amen’s trailblazing work, his clinical genius, andhis courage. Thank you, Daniel.I am also grateful to the Washington Psychoanalytic Institute, where I spentfive stimulating years becoming a psychoanalyst and a number of years afterwardas a faculty member. Freud may be dead, but many of his fundamental ideas liveon, nourishing those like me who wish to understand other human beings mostdeeply.Gary Moak, M.D., has been my devoted friend and sounding board for both personaland professional matters for more than forty years. I am grateful for ourfriendship, which started during our college days at Penn, and for his adviceand encouragement about this project that started long before my book proposalever saw the light of day. Gary reviewed many of the chapter drafts, givinguseful feedback that helped enormously to improve areas where my writing andthinking were unclear.Robert Licata, M.D., has been a colleague and dear friend for more thantwenty-five years. Bob’s pithy conceptualization of the relationship between theprefrontal cortex and the limbic system gave birth to a number of the ideas Iexplore in this book. He also graciously reviewed a number of chapter drafts.For many years, Bob and I were members of a study group with our colleagues DaveGebara, M.D., and Larry Spoont, M.D. In this study group we discussed a numberof seminal books and papers and worked over many of the ideas that I explore inthis book.I am grateful to Madame Renelle Gannon, my French tutor of more than a decade,for far more than my reasonably proficient command of the French language. I amindebted to Madame Gannon for her encouragement and support, and for fascinatingtwice-weekly discussions about language, art, politics, history, philosophy,religion, and spirituality, always in French, certainement.My sincere thanks are due to my agent, Celeste Fine, who remarkably obtained forme a book contract in no time flat, and her associate John Maas. This work wouldnot have seen the light of day if my editor, Caroline Sutton, had not stuck withme through my early abortive attempts to learn how to write a book. I amgrateful for her confidence in me and in the ideas I wanted to write about.Thank you as well to her associates Brittney Ross and Brianna Flaherty.Whatever coherence and lucidity exist in this book are due in large part to DediFelman, writer and editor extraordinaire. She, too, was encouraging as shehelped me wrestle my meandering ideas into a conceptual whole. During my momentsof discouragement when I came face-to-face with how little I knew about writinga book that tells a clear story, Dedi told me to “trust the process,” which Idid. Thank you, Dedi.In addition to Daniel Amen, M.D., many other individuals within Amen Clinicshave given me help and support. Dr. Rob Johnson reviewed the chapter onaddiction and gave helpful input on that chapter and on the spiritual themes Idiscuss in the conclusion. Sue Johnston, M.S.W., L.C.S.W., our clinic’smind-body therapist, reviewed the manuscript and gave helpful feedback.I have been wonderfully blessed by the devotion of my wife and children. Mywife, Dianne, has gifted me with her love and positivity, showing me how aloving relationship can heal a wounded soul. A beautiful heart can bring thingsinto your life that all the money in the world couldn’t obtain. For her love,encouragement, and support—both during the writing of this book and throughoutour long relationship—I am eternally grateful. Dianne sacrificed in many ways sothat I could have the time and energy to work on this book. My son, Chris, andmy daughter, Elizabeth, have also been enormously supportive of me as I wrotethis book. I have learned so much about life and love from them. It is awonderful thing to see your children turn out wiser and smarter than you couldever be.I have the most interesting job in the world. I get to talk to people about thethings that matter to them most, as we work to find ways to manage their minds,balance their brains, and unleash their healing processes. I am grateful to thethousands of patients with whom I have had the privilege to work during mycareer of thirty-plus years. At times I’ve felt that I learned and benefitedmore from our relationships than they did. There are many patient stories inReclaim Your Brain. In all cases, the patients I write about have beenthoroughly disguised and/or melded into composites to protect their privacy.As much as I appreciate the significant help and support I’ve received whilewriting this book, any misstatements and mistakes are my responsibility.Joseph A.

Emily told me she had trouble concentrating. Shedescribed her brain as feeling like a “buzzing beehive” of random thoughts.Lately, she said, her claustrophobia was stifling her life.Then there was Josh, a college student, who was skipping class and close toflunking out. He sat down in my office and we tried to talk. But it was hard tocommunicate; Josh was agitated, avoided eye contact, and tapped his feetincessantly. His mind, he said, was “like an out-of-control freight train,”going so fast he couldn’t stop it.Corrine, an advertising executive, was also always on call. She juggled manyaccounts in her job. She felt a bit worried lately; she was mixing up detailsand forgetting crucial appointments. When I asked her how she felt when shetried to relax, she replied, “It’s like I have three radio stations playing inmy head at the same time.” Yet she was confident she could take on even more andbigger projects.Emily, Josh, Corrine, and others like them may have different conditionsincluding stress, ADHD, anxiety, and depression. Yet, fundamentally, theexperience they describe and wrestle with is the same—it’s what I call a “busybrain.” Some people with a busy brain describe their brain as being “in chaos”;others feel that their brain is on fire. In and of itself, a busy braininterferes with attention, concentration, focus, mood, and often much more. Busybrains leave us distracted, preoccupied, or quick-tempered.A busy brain is more than just a description or a feeling. A busy brainliterally is just that: It functions less effectively because of its ownexcessive activity. It can’t do a good job selecting the best course to takebecause it can’t shut off all the mental chatter urging other ways to go.Consequently, a busy brain may lose the ability to solve problems because it’sgoing off on too many wrong or unproductive paths. In fact, I began my ownexploration of busy brains when I noticed that individuals complaining ofextra-busy brains had brain scans that revealed excessive activity in oneparticular area of the brain—the limbic system.As the chief psychiatrist at Amen Clinics in Reston, Virginia, a board-certifiedpracticing psychiatrist for thirty years, and a trained psychoanalyst, I haveworked with thousands of people who report this common sensation—an overloaded,overstimulated, and keyed-up brain, regardless of whether they are ultimatelydiagnosed with ADHD, anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, OCD, or evensubstance abuse or autism. Many people come to my office hoping to learn how tofunction better and to find peace.In this book I want to share with you what I have shared with many of mypatients. As we explore the root causes of a busy brain, you will gain a betterunderstanding of what is going on in your brain and your body. Understanding thebrain’s physical functions will help you more effectively address problems asthey arise. Crucially, you will learn strategies for calming your busy brain andmanaging your mind. Action plans feature steps that you can take immediately.I begin by taking you on a journey of your brain and its activities.Importantly, the busy-brain feeling we experience typically correlates withactual “overactivity” in specific areas of the brain. When you feel stuck, withyour mind going around and around in a loop you can’t seem to get out of, it maybe because an area of your brain called the anterior cingulate is overactive,locked with its pedal to the metal. When you wrestle with anxiety, it may bebecause another area in your brain called the basal ganglia is overactive,revving in high gear. Negativity, anxiety, mood disorders: all of these can beilluminated by understanding how key brain areas function. Understanding what’sliterally happening in your busy brain is key to slowing it down, to taming thechaos.A biological, neuroscientific approach illuminates a great deal about ourbrains. But this is not all we need to know. In order to reclaim your brain—andto best understand the self, the individual, the person, the soul—we need tolook at both psychology and biology, mind and brain. Specifically, we must notoverlook the power we now have to manage our minds.Given what we now know, managing our mind is crucially important—and moreeffective than we ever suspected. Why? In a single word, change. What we nowunderstand better than at any time previously is just how much and in how manyways the brain can be altered, and how the brain can transform itself for thebetter.Many people think our brains are set in stone, but in fact our lifestyles andlife circumstances always affect that three-pound organ in our head. Brainchanges result from many causes, including developmental experiences, emotionaltraumas, substance abuse, physical brain trauma, infections, and many otherthings. Your brain can and does change because of stress—for example, we knowthat cells in the hippocampus die when an individual experiences prolongedstress—and therein lies the risk of more negative changes in a person’s lifewhen they don’t listen soon enough to their too-busy brains. In fact, accordingto a comprehensive survey conducted by the National Institute of Mental Health,more than half of Americans are expected to develop a mental illness in theirlifetimes. Calming your busy brain reduces the chance that things will getworse.But if brain change can be for the worse, it can also be for the better. Thegreat discovery of what we call self-directed neuroplasticity is that the brainis not fixed, but rather in constant flux, and that you can actually change yourbrain for the better. Circuits can be rewired; brain maps can be redrawn. Newneural pathways can sprout to accommodate new functions or new environments.Whatever your experiences in childhood and beyond, it is possible to learn newways of thinking, reacting, and behaving; new patterns can be established.In Reclaim Your Brain, I show you how to rewrite your negative stories, how toslow down your busy brain with mindfulness techniques, how to create healthierrelationships, and ultimately how to bring your brain and life back undercontrol, all of which increase the likelihood for success and joy in life. We’llalso explore how to manage conditions that contribute to a busy brain, such asanxiety, mood problems, ADHD, stuckness and OCD, addictions, and emotionaltraumas.Though I am a psychiatrist and I believe wholeheartedly in the use ofpsychiatric medications where appropriate, my treatment doesn’t begin or endwith my prescription pad. Many times it is better to start with more natural andintegrative interventions such as lifestyle changes, mindfulness exercises,neurofeedback, and nutritional supplements. I will discuss the many naturalinterventions that allow the reader to calm a busy brain without professionalassistance or medication.Throughout these chapters, I give many case examples, approaches, exercises, andsuggestions to help you understand your brain function and find the best ways tocalm and balance your brain. No one solution is right for everyone.One important note: sometimes rebalancing our busy, overactive brain requiresmore than managing our troubled minds. It requires healing what’s broken ordamaged. It may seem obvious that healing the brain must take priority. Butbrain injuries are often missed or not avidly sought out in the first place. Inthe “Healing the Hurting Brain and Body” chapter at the end of the book, Idescribe various, often hidden, injuries to the brain and the body that cancontribute to an overactive brain.Many are quick to believe that their too-busy brains result from today’srapid-fire media culture, digital technology, and modern-world megadistractions.These ever-present distractions have a negative impact, no doubt. But anoveractive brain is not strictly the result of our modern 24/7 device-drivenculture. Hidden contributors to a busy brain can include genetics, vitamindeficiencies, dysfunctional thyroids, heavy metal toxicity, infections, and evenphysical brain trauma.I assess patients by looking at the whole person: their life circumstances,medical histories, diets, habits, and brain activity. When necessary with somepatients, I also use a brain-imaging technique called brain SPECT, described inChapter 12, to detect imbalances in brain-circuit activity, brain injury,physical brain trauma, and other ways in which the brain can be damaged ormalfunctioning without one being aware of it.Please note that although you will hear a good amount about brain SPECT scans inReclaiming Your Brain, you do not need a brain scan to make good use of thisbook. Josh, our student with a mind like a freight train; Emily, with herclaustrophobia and inability to concentrate; and Corrine, our advertisingexecutive who cannot relax, all profited from mind management techniques alone:managing negativity, learning simple mindfulness techniques, and rewriting thestories about themselves and the world that previously had so powerfullydominated their lives and relationships. The tools and approaches I present willbe helpful for most people, regardless of whether you ever have a brain scan.In this book, I offer solutions that will help you feel better, perform moreproductively, experience less stress, and be more fulfilled in life. With a calmmind, you can find clarity, strength, vision, and hope. You can reclaim youroverloaded brain and bring your life back under control. Let’s begin thejourney."},{"pageContent":"[../image/64356.jpg]1[../image/64354.jpg]Balancing the BrainMany of us have at least some familiarity with the “busy brain” feeling of beingoverwhelmed. We all have days when instead of catching up, our task list seemsto grow ever longer. A new work project lands on our desk even as we rush tocomplete the previous one. A young child or elderly parent falls sick, with thecaretaking burden falling squarely on our shoulders. And then comes the laststraw: the transmission on our old reliable car fails, incurring an expense wecan’t afford. With all that is on our plate, we feel revved up and in overdrive,perhaps on the brink of a panic attack. Thoughts go around and around, butinstead of resting somewhere, they continue cycling: How will I catch up on thejob? Take care of my children? Fix my car? Pay my bills?What’s literally going on in our body and brain when we experience thesesensations of a busy brain? What does it mean for our brains to be “revved up,”in overdrive, or, most crucially, unbalanced? A tour of the brain will help usbegin to answer these questions.The cerebral cortex, or the bulk of your brain, houses four lobes: the frontallobe, the temporal lobe, the parietal lobe, and the occipital lobe. Locatedunderneath your temples and behind your eyes on both sides of your brain, thetemporal lobe is essential for speech, language, memory, and emotion; processingimmediate events into recent and long-term memory; and storing and retrievinglong-term memories. It is also involved in processing sounds and images.Traumatic brain injury often involves damage to the temporal lobe, leading tochanges in memory, mood, and personality. The occipital lobe is in charge ofvisual processing. The occipital lobe is also affected by Irlen syndrome, whichis a little-known but common visual processing difficulty that I’ll discusslater. The parietal lobe is a general integration center that processesinformation from your different senses that is then passed to the front of thebrain to use for decision making. It also controls bodily awareness and positionsense, letting one part of your body know where it is in relation to the rest ofthe body and giving you an idea of where your body is located in space.For the purposes of our discussion of balancing the brain, however, the frontallobe, or the part located at the front of your brain, is absolutely crucial. Thepart of the frontal cortex closest to your eyes is called the prefrontal cortex,or PFC. This is the executive control center of your brain; think of it as the“governor” or the “CEO” of the brain. It manages your attention, concentration,short-term memory, organizational ability, impulse control, planning, judgment,learning, motivation, problem solving, and goal setting. Quite a list. Awell-functioning PFC is crucial to your ability to rewrite the negative storiesyou tell yourself. Importantly, the PFC holds the limbic system in check, whichhelps the brain find and maintain its balance.The limbic system is the seat of your emotions. Found in the center of yourbrain, beneath the cortex, it is a more “primitive” brain area compared to yourorganizational, learning, and impulse-controlling PFC. Major components of thelimbic system include the anterior cingulate, the basal ganglia, the amygdala,and the thalamus. The anterior cingulate is your brain’s gearshifter. When theanterior cingulate is too active, you become “stuck.” Problems that involve theanterior cingulate include negative ruminations, obsessions, compulsions, andaddictions. The basal ganglia sets the rate of your body’s idle, much like a carengine. If it’s running too high (and this can be the result of your genetics),you’ll likely feel chronically anxious, worried, and keyed up. Excessivelyactive basal ganglia are often accompanied by panic attacks and unhealthyavoidance of conflict. The amygdala, an almond-shaped area (amygdala means“almond” in Latin) is involved with basic survival issues. It is the equivalentof a primitive emergency alarm system. It quickly assesses threats and thentriggers a fight-or-flight reaction. Problems arise when high levels of stresscreate “amygdala overactivation.” Your executive function center, the PFC, caneven be hijacked and shut down when the amygdala is in overdrive. The result?You’ll be overwhelmed by anxiety, fear, or terror, and your brain won’t be ableto call on your PFC—the thinking part of your brain—to help you calm down. Theproblems we’ll look at associated with the amygdala include post-traumaticstress disorder (PTSD) and other emotional traumas such as early childhoodneglect and abuse. Finally, the thalamus is involved in appetite, sleep,bonding, and sexual desire; this part of your brain colors your emotions.Conditions that are related to a problematic thalamus include depression,bipolar disorder, and even premenstrual problems.I’ve described the busy brain as an unbalanced brain. The balance referred tohere is that between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the limbic system. When thebrain is unbalanced, the evolutionarily more modern PFC is either too strong ortoo weak to counter the more primitive limbic system.On the one hand, if there is too much guidance, too much control by the PFC, youhave somebody who is ruled by his head and not enough by his feelings, passions,and urges. Think of Mr. Spock from Star Trek. He is in such mastery of hisemotions that he sometimes fails to benefit from the insight others naturallyderive from their passions or gut. When the PFC dominates, the brain isunhealthy and unbalanced.On the other hand, if the limbic system is too strong and/or the PFC is tooweak, you have an individual who is ruled by her passions and urges andcontrolled too little by her head, by rationality. This would be an individualwith overwhelming feelings and impulses but insufficient rationality to selectgoals and guide behavior. The Anti–Mr. Spock. Someone out of control, in extremecases maybe even someone manic. Most—but not all—instances of a busy brain fitthis second pattern, a PFC or governing system that is not strong enough tocontrol the limbic system.Critical imbalances between the limbic system and the prefrontal cortexadversely affect mental and emotional stability. Take Sierra, who cares for hermother who has worsening dementia; Sierra is overloaded between ministering toher mother, her duties at work, and the need to keep her own home running. Whenthe April 15 deadline for filing her taxes rolls around, Sierra’s alreadyrevved-up limbic system goes into overdrive as she rushes to complete herreturn. The stress of doing the tax return, an otherwise routine yearly chore,overwhelms the delicate balance between her prefrontal cortex and her limbicsystem. Her PFC is no longer holding back her limbic system. Her feelings andimpulses start to overwhelm her. Sierra begins experiencing panic attacks.Similarly, Thad, who has worked day and night for sixteen months preparing amajor proposal for his company, finds himself becoming sleep-deprived, burnedout, and depressed. With his stress response fully activated for sixteen monthsand his limbic system in sixth gear due to his work on the proposal that willmake or break his career, the delicate balance that Thad’s PFC has struck withhis limbic system is thrown off and Thad can no longer ward off depression.When the limbic system is too strong and/or the PFC too weak, the PFC is notstrong enough to control the wild horses of the limbic system and the herd runsamok. How do we rein in the wild horses if the prefrontal cortex isn’t doing itsjob properly? In the chapters that follow, I will discuss strategies forbalancing an unbalanced brain. In essence, we can manage our minds. You may haveheard that meditation has a positive impact on the brain, a finding supported byresearch and verified by brain scans. Similarly, in learning to rewrite thenegative stories we tell ourselves, we can also have a positive impact on thebrain: we can strengthen the control of the PFC over the wayward limbic areas,bringing the brain into better balance. Simultaneously, by learning new modelsof relationships, we may calm our hyperarousal and create new patterns ofbehavior.—But before we turn to the specifics of how we can exert more control over arunaway limbic system, there’s another piece to the brain puzzle we must grasp.And that has to do with the necessity of healing a broken brain. For not allbusy brains are equal. And if a brain has sustained significant injury, it mustbe treated and healed before we can effectively apply techniques of mindmanagement.Earlier in my psychiatric career, I was often stumped because I found that somepatients markedly improved with treatment, whether via rewriting their stories,implementing mindfulness approaches, talk therapy, psychiatric medications, orother treatments, while other patients didn’t get better at all, or they had aresponse to treatment opposite to what I expected. It wasn’t supposed to be thisway. After all, I was a well-trained psychiatrist and I really wanted to help mypatients. But despite my professional knowledge and experience, and my sincereattempt to be of assistance, I wasn’t always helping my patients as much as I’dhoped to. I wondered why this was so. I was prescribing the newest medications;I kept up with the advancements in the field. But few of the basic scientificdiscoveries had yet been translated into the field of psychiatry, and my owntreatments continued at times to fall short. What I was missing became clearerwhen I met Bill, a patient who came to me for treatment shortly after I startedworking at Amen Clinics. Bill’s case gave me the conviction that a brain must behealed and balanced before mind-management techniques can succeed.Bill first came to see me after attempting suicide in his dorm room. Atwenty-year-old Yale student, Bill was bright and had always beenself-motivated, even as a kid. He taught himself to read and devoured sciencebooks. As a three-year-old, he seemed to know nearly as much about dinosaurs asprofessionals who had spent their lives studying them. Despite his intellectualgifts, Bill nonetheless experienced bouts of severe, extreme depression. And hisoverdose at Yale had nearly killed him.While home on winter break from Yale, Bill “borrowed” his mother’s Ambienwithout her knowledge. Back at school, he took a potentially lethal cocktail ofAmbien, Effexor XR, and a fifth of whiskey. Bill left a suicide noteunderscoring the seriousness of his wish to die. Fortunately, Bill vomited thepills and whiskey, probably because he was not used to consuming that muchliquor. That saved him from a likely fatal overdose. Unfortunately, Billaspirated the vomit and developed aspiration pneumonia. It was touch and go forhim in the ICU for several days.Bill’s roommate called 911 when he discovered Bill unconscious and covered withvomit. Bill was rushed to the hospital, which notified his shocked parents. Theyimmediately drove to New Haven to be with him. Bill’s mother said, “I worry thatI’ve let my son down somehow. We’ve tried to do everything we could to help him,but we’ve failed.” Understandably, Bill’s mother felt guilty, as mothers tend todo. Once Bill was stabilized and discharged from the hospital, his familyinsisted that he take off a semester from Yale and get psychiatric help, whichwas when Bill came to see me.I attempted to treat Bill with antidepressant medication, taught him techniquesto rewrite his negative stories about himself and the world, and met with Billfor twice-weekly psychotherapy. Bill improved, but only moderately so. He smiledmore and was able to laugh a bit, but he continued to feel down and depressed.Antidepressant medications—and we tried several with Bill—really never alteredhis fundamental negativity and his proneness for severe depressive dips. Inpsychotherapy, we explored his underlying rigid and unreasonable expectations ofhimself—in essence trying to help him rewrite his internal narrative, hisstory—but this was not sufficiently useful. Bill cooperated with treatment, butour treatment had not made enough progress to help Bill move toward being fullyfree of depression and able to return to Yale.Because Bill had not made sufficient progress, I told him about brain SPECTscanning, a way to look at what the brain is doing, and asked him to considerit. I hoped that SPECT might reveal something about the root of Bill’s problemsthat we were missing. Bill and his parents agreed, and Bill had his brainscanned a week later.We were not disappointed. The SPECT results showed that Bill’s brain was hurtingin a way none of us had anticipated. He had significant damage to his lefttemporal lobe. Bill’s brain wasn’t just unbalanced; it was injured, even broken.I knew that temporal lobe problems, especially on the left side, can contributeto or cause marked depression and negativity—and also rage at times, whichfortunately Bill didn’t have. Bill’s SPECT findings showed me whyantidepressants hadn’t helped him; antidepressants don’t fundamentally addressbrain injury, especially injury in the temporal lobes.I carefully questioned Bill and his parents about whether he had a history ofhead injury. They had no specific recollections of head trauma, but they didtell me that Bill played soccer throughout high school. This was consistent withmy experience with other patients; I’ve seen quite a few soccer players who hadhead injuries from playing that sport. Heading a hard soccer ball is not a goodthing for the brain.The evidence of physical brain injury reduced Bill’s parents’ guilt. They hadn’tfailed him. Bill’s problems weren’t the result of lack of adequate effort orlove on their part or bad parenting; rather, there was a clear physical problemwith Bill’s brain. And Bill needed to reexamine the unhealthy negative storieshe believed about himself, that he was weak and fundamentally flawed. Thisdramatic shift in understanding about the causes of one’s difficulties istypical when brain SPECT reveals significant but previously unknown braininjury.With this new information provided by SPECT, I put Bill on Lamictal, amedication that targets temporal lobe problems. Lamictal was the answer to ourprayers. Gradually, Bill improved. Eventually, after several months, he wasclose to 100 percent, with hardly any trace of depression. Bill continuedLamictal, returned to Yale the following semester, and ultimately graduated withhonors. Following Yale, Bill attended and graduated from a top-notch law schooland now works as a fourth-year associate for a large law firm. Without muchexaggeration, SPECT imaging allowed me to save Bill’s life; I am certain that,given the severity of his depression and suicidal urges, he would have ended upkilling himself if we had not found successful treatment for him. Detecting andstabilizing his left temporal lobe was the key step in Bill’s successfultreatment. And it obviously impressed me that I was on the right track inlooking at brain function, especially in individuals who did not respondpreviously to “treatment as usual.”As stressed here, hurting brains must be healed before we can proceed withmanaging the mind. But your brain isn’t always broken, and none of this is meantto say that readers will need a SPECT scan. Further, due to neuroplasticity,mind management alone can result in important changes to the brain. Most readerswill and can effectively employ the tools of mind management that follow.With a better picture of the workings of the brain, let’s get started with allthat you can do by yourself to change and rebalance your overactive brain."},{"pageContent":"MANAGING THE MIND"},{"pageContent":"[../image/64356.jpg]2[../image/64354.jpg]Conquering NegativityWhen I first began to explore the busy-brain phenomenon, I quickly recognizedanother pattern in those who have it. Many of these individuals also struggledwith excess negativity. It was as if not only were their brains caught in aloop, but that loop was almost uniformly negative. Remember Thad, who had beenworking sixteen months on a career make-it-or-break-it proposal? He wastypically overwhelmed by his busy brain. The balance between his PFC and limbicsystem was thrown off. The wild horses had seized control. But even morestriking, Thad was sinking into depression as his negative thoughts began toovertake his confidence. His busy brain was caught in a loop of feelinginadequate to the task, panic about the future, and general negativity.There is an undeniable connection between the busy brain and the negative brain.Why, and what can be done about it? Gwen’s story may provide some instructivelessons. Gwen, twenty-nine years old and single, consulted me for help with herrelationships with men. To be more specific, she hadn’t had a relationship witha man for six years. Gwen was well educated, stylishly dressed, attractive,outgoing, even playful; I couldn’t understand what the problem was. Gwen said itwas depressing not to be able to have relationships with men, but she was notdepressed. Her health was good, she did not abuse drugs or alcohol, and she hadnever been physically or sexually abused. What was happening? Here was a womanwho said that she wanted to find a life partner, marry, and have children. Therewas obviously a roadblock, but what was it?Gwen wanted to meet with me weekly for psychotherapy to work on her relationshipissues, which we did. Our discussions centered on her stories about differentmen becoming interested in her, their initial approaches, and reciprocatedinterest on Gwen’s part, which were followed by Gwen’s abruptly breaking offcontact when things got too close. Whenever a relationship was close to becomingsexual, Gwen would end it. Gwen reported a number of satisfying collegerelationships that had included sexual intimacy. So why now the dismissals ofotherwise viable partners?As her pattern with men became clearer, I was able to point out to Gwen that shebroke off the budding relationships for reasons that did not ring true. In onecase, it was because the fellow couldn’t attend her college reunion with her; heneeded to be out of town for an important business trip. In another case, theguy didn’t call her when he promised; it later became apparent that he’d losthis phone, but she terminated their relationship nonetheless.Soon, Gwen felt safe enough with me to share that she had a secret that she’dnever told anyone. She wasn’t willing to tell me the secret, at least not yet.But she did say that the secret was so horrible, so disgusting, that she wassure that I would not want to continue seeing her if I knew it.We continued meeting, reviewing her aborted attempts at forming relationships.The pattern became clearer and clearer. Gwen broke off each relationship justbefore it would have become sexual. And she continued to hint that her importantsecret had something to do with this. From time to time I commented thatwhatever the secret was, it seemed so important that it needed to see the lightof day. Could we find a way to discuss it?Finally, after six months, Gwen consented to tell me her secret. She first mademe promise that I would not stop seeing her once I learned the secret. And shesaid that she would tell me the secret only if she turned her back on me, so shewould not see what she imagined would be the disgust on my face when she told meher secret. I knew it was important to make it safe for Gwen to tell me hersecret, so I agreed to her requests. And then she finally told me the secret.What was it? What had such a powerful hold on Gwen that it derailedrelationships and made her so strongly fear rejection from me? The answer: thatshe had herpes. Her last boyfriend, whom she’d met in college, had herpes andpassed on the infection to Gwen.Let’s be clear: no one who gets herpes is going to rejoice about it. Oncediagnosed, it is not uncommon to have an initial reaction of shame or feelingdirty. Many also are angry at the person who infected them. They may feeloverwhelmed by the idea of having a lifetime of symptoms and the need to managethe disease over such a long time.But few also react to the news quite as catastrophically as Gwen did. After aninitial period of adjustment, most individuals infected with genital herpeslearn to talk to existing and potential partners about it, to incorporate thenew medication regimen into their daily routine, to avoid sex during periods ofinflammation, and to generally move on with their lives. Genital herpes is morecommon than diabetes or asthma; about one in five Americans is infected. Mostpeople, by necessity, learn to cope.For Gwen, the problem was not the herpes itself; it was her thinking about it.Once diagnosed, Gwen believed that the herpes was so bad, so horrible, thatnobody would want her. And as she held on to the secret, its impact on her onlygrew. As a result, that initial period of adjustment that most go through lastedsix years for Gwen. During that time, she pushed away potential partners andcould barely bring herself to tell me, the doctor she’d come to for help. Gwenwas caught in an exceptionally bad case of negative thinking.Why do some people seem to possess a natural optimism, while others spindownward in a negative spiral? What causes the brain to busy itself withnegative thoughts rather than positive ones? Negative tendencies aren’t all bad.They often reflect a realism that springs from experience. Whatever path weplot, obstacles may arise and mistakes can happen. On the upside, planning forthe worst forces us to be prudent and to attend to the details. And detailsmatter. Richard III said, “For want of a nail the shoe was lost . . . ,” leadingto the loss of his kingdom. Modern life is adorned with problems because someoneneglected to take care of the little things. Perhaps you’ve been feeling toobusy to take care of a toothache until it becomes an after-hours dentalemergency. Or your friend was thinking a water spot on the ceiling isn’timportant until water floods through the roof during the next big storm. Ormaybe you missed the first charge on your credit card bill made by someone whostole your account number. The caution and vigilance associated with negativitycan serve as an effective preventive.But excessive negativity can also be a self-fulfilling prophesy. There seemssomething true about sending out negative vibes and having the universe respondin kind. Plus, seeing only the negative can blind us to positive lessons to belearned from our experiences. Individuals who are stuck in negativity and feelthat the world is against them often get locked in a vicious circle. Preciselybecause they feel powerless to combat what they see as the unfairness of life,they don’t engage in the solid planning, persistence, and frank hard work thatwould allow them to attain realistic goals.We may never really know all the factors that have contributed to our tendencyto be negative. What’s important to understand is that negativity is notunalterable. In fact, later I’m going to share with you approaches to counteractnegativity that have worked for many people, including myself. It’s alsoimportant to understand that negativity is not a defect. In fact, negativity isthe default position of the human psyche, part of the brain’s survival system,which is why it’s so hard to eradicate.Blame Our Wiring for the Intransigence of NegativityWhy would our brains make us so negative? The reality is that the brain ishardwired for negativity. Studies of brain development and observations aboutearly traumas support this.First, let’s look at brain development. We have two brain hemispheres—the rightand the left. To simplify greatly, the right hemisphere deals more than the leftwith emotions and the gist of sensory experience and pattern recognition, whilethe left hemisphere deals with language, logic, and problem solving. Now itturns out that the right hemisphere is more negative than the left; the lefthemisphere—to the extent that it does deal with emotions—is more positive thanthe right. Strokes in adults in the left hemisphere reduce positivity, and theindividual often becomes depressed. Likewise, adult strokes in the righthemisphere reduce negativity, and the individual often becomes inappropriatelyhappy or manic.The left hemisphere orients itself toward positive emotions related to approach,exploration, and connection with others. The right hemisphere, as we havediscussed, is oriented toward negative emotions related to withdrawal andself-protection. It is more closely related to the limbic system and to the restof the body than is the left hemisphere.Think of emotions as experiences that move us toward or away from something orsomeone. Emotions are the ways we experience and interpret the impact of ourbrain networks on our body states. The negative emotions we experience—thinkfight or flight—are more primitive and basic than our positive emotions. Andnegative emotions—grounded as they are in the right hemisphere and the primitiveamygdala—can even override the more positive and logical left hemisphere when weare threatened. Situations of significant threat or danger can literally renderus speechless—the left (verbal) hemisphere shuts down, and the right hemisphereand the amygdala dominate our experience.The kicker is that in an ironic twist of fate, Mother Nature has seen fit todevelop the negative right hemisphere before the more positive left hemispheredevelops. Because in typical brain development the right hemisphere comes onlinefirst, infants and toddlers experience the world with a negative tinge and ofcourse have no language or logic with which to understand or correct their earlyperceptions. Thus, a baseline, a foundation, of negativity is set early in life.Later, the left hemisphere matures and we develop language and an ability toapply logic to otherwise emotionally driven situations. But the foundation ofnegativity has already been set in stone. Because so much of early emotionallearning is guided by the right hemisphere, negative experiences early in lifecan have a detrimental and long-lasting impact on how we feel about ourselves,our personality structure, and how we tend to experience the world.The development of our memory system also hardwires us for negativity. To againsimplify greatly, we have implicit and explicit memory systems. Implicitcorresponds to nonverbal. Think of riding a bicycle. We remember how to do it,but we cannot explain it in words. That’s implicit. Explicit corresponds toverbal. We can remember the name of our fourth-grade teacher or the date wememorized for the attack on Pearl Harbor.The implicit memory system is centered on the amygdala, which learns quickly andcrudely about dangers but seems to hold on to them like a steel trap because itdeals with threats to existence. The amygdala is for the most part not plastic;its memories are relatively fixed and rigid. The explicit memory system is basedin the hippocampus, which is “plastic,” or changeable, so we can learn newthings and forget what is nonessential. The problem is that the explicit system,like the reasoning left hemisphere, takes longer to develop, leaving the infantonce again prone to negatively tinged experiences of the world provided by theearlier-developing amygdala system.The perceived dangers from early traumas, branded into the more primitive partsof the nervous system, including the amygdala, can last a lifetime. We all wishthat love would triumph over fear, but neurobiologically speaking, that’s a tallchallenge. The infant and young toddler have only the amygdala memory systemactive in their brain. So they have the right hemisphere, which tends tointerpret things negatively, and they have their only memory system being theamygdala. The amygdala’s steel trap just won’t let go of early traumas.Later, as language skills begin to develop, young children begin to develop aneffective explicit memory system centered on the hippocampus, in which memoriescan be modified and even forgotten. In fact, full development of the hippocampuslikely occurs only in early adulthood. But until they are at least past thetoddler stage, the only memory system children have is the amygdala system,which holds on to traumatic memories like the proverbial elephant—neverforgetting.Experiences early in life about relationships, trust, security, and love areunder the control of the right hemisphere because the left is less functional atthat point. We do not recall early traumas in words. That is to say, we do notrecall them verbally, at least not in the familiar left hemispherelanguage-based way of remembering. But the impact of these traumas may be therenonetheless, in the nonverbal right hemisphere and amygdala, having asignificant impact on us and affecting our functioning and relationships. Weoften thus repeat an early relationship pattern without being fully consciousthat we’ve retained those feelings and patterns, a phenomenon that Freuddescribed as transference. As Freud said, we repeat, rather than remember.These issues have much to do with why psychotherapy can fail: nonverbal andpreverbal issues are intrinsically more difficult to address than those thatarise out of the more logical left hemisphere. It’s difficult to interruptdeep-rooted right hemisphere patterns of behavior, especially patterns of whichyou’ve only recently become aware. Again, that the implicit memory systemdevelops before the explicit memory system means that any kind of negativeexperiences early in life can have far-reaching and often unrecognized effects.A negative foundation is established, often without our conscious awareness.A Busy Brain Is Most Often a Negative BrainThat we are hardwired for negativity goes a long way toward explaining why abusy brain is almost always a negative one. As the PFC loses control over thelimbic system, the result is a flood of often negative thoughts and emotions.Let’s look a bit more closely at what exactly is going on inside your busybrain.Let’s first take a big-picture view of how the brain works. Think of the brainas a modified reflex arc. With a simple reflex arc, we have an environmentalstimulus (say, tapping on the kneecap tendon with a reflex hammer). The stimulusis relayed to the spinal cord and processed minimally, and then a nerve impulseis sent to the muscles of the leg to cause a jerk. This reflex arc is a simplemechanism to protect the organism from danger, with minimal processing of thestimulus. Now consider the brain as a more complicated reflex arc system tomanage stimuli from the environment. We have stimuli that come into the brain,processing occurs, and then the brain orders a response. The pattern is STIMULI[../image/62862.jpg] PROCESSING [../image/62865.jpg] RESPONSE. Stimuli from theenvironment enter the brain. The brain has to process the stimuli and decidewhat, if anything, the organism should do. The brain “wants” to be calm (i.e.,no pressure to decide or to act). But the brain becomes aroused, goes on alert,and springs into action when there is uncertainty, a threat, and also apotential reward (food, sex). When the brain is aroused, we eventually will bepressed to do something (run away or fight, gather the food, pursue our sexualobject . . .). The pressure to do something is tension. It is unpleasant. Thisis the connection to negativity.In a busy brain, the pressure and tension to do something are amplified, andthus the negativity is amplified. As mentioned earlier, in a busy brain, thelimbic system and prefrontal cortex are out of balance. The prefrontal cortexpotentially brakes the limbic system’s pressure for us to feel an emotion or acton an urge, to take some action in response to environmental stimuli. It’s likebeing in your car and pressing on the accelerator and brake pedal at the sametime. The revving of the limbic system is the busy brain; we experience theexcessive limbic activity as too-muchness and displeasure. If the prefrontalcortex is up to the task of managing and guiding the revving—the urges of thelimbic system, the wild horses I mentioned earlier—we’ll be in good shape. Butif the prefrontal cortex is too weak, we’re in trouble and the revving of thelimbic system is too strong, resulting in an out-of-control busy brain.This out-of-control brain is inherently a negative one. Think about the limbicsystem revving up: a busy brain often results from people being overloaded withstimuli, threats, demands, and so on. They have too much to process withinsufficient guidance from the prefrontal cortex. They are overloaded, flooded.This is a dysphoric, unpleasant state, and negative almost by definition.Being stuck in a negative loop is also how patients with a busy brain describetheir emotional states. They complain about their busy brains and comment thatthey are usually focused on the negative. For example, Sarah, twenty-three,seeing me for ADHD, attacked herself for not being able to complete her termpapers. Over and over, she’d say to herself, “I should be able to sit down andwrite those papers.” And to top it off, Sarah then berated herself for attackingherself about her inability to do the term papers: “OK, I struggle to do thepapers, but it is so stupid that I keep attacking myself over it. What a wasteof time and energy. It’s bad enough that I can’t write the papers, but then Ifoolishly waste time and energy ruminating about it. I mean, there are worsethings in the world. I’m not hurting anybody.” People stuck in these negativeloops continuously beat themselves up.When we examine brain SPECT scans of individuals stuck in these negative loops,the data tends to back up the individuals’ self-reports. Busy brains as observedon brain SPECT correlate closely with reported subjective negativity. Also, abusy brain on SPECT often—but not always—includes overactivity of the anteriorcingulate. An overactive cingulate usually makes one stuck on negative thoughtsand feelings. Sarah had markedly overactive anterior cingulate activity thatcontributed to her stuckness and her tendency to get stuck on attacking herselffor being stuck. The negative thoughts in her mind were like the mirrors in ascary fun house, bouncing off one another in troubling ways.Why Is There More Dysfunctional/Negative Thinking Nowadays?One interesting question raised by the prevalence of busy brains is whetherthere is more dysfunctional thinking now than previously, and if so why thatmight be case. If the busy-brain problem seems more widespread than ever, couldthat be connected to a modern plague of negativity? Evolution might hold someanswers.Let’s go back to the model of the brain as a sophisticated reflex arc. Theguiding principle of evolution vis-à-vis brain function seems to be to ensuresurvival and reproduction. Because of the ever-present threats to an organism’sexistence, the brain is biased to first interpret stimuli as negative. Thisnegative bias optimizes chances for survival because behavior is based on theprinciple of “better safe than sorry.” But the cost—in terms of negativethoughts and feelings—can be high. What increases our chances of survival maynot be the same thing as what makes us happy.Though we don’t live in the jungle or the savannah anymore, the oldevolutionarily determined patterns are still there, bred deep in our beings. Butthe threats to existence (lions, other hostile tribes) faced by our long-agoancestors are minimal to nonexistent. Our modern lives are safer. So why wouldthe modern-day world have more negative/dysfunctional thinking? Why would ourbrains feel even busier, as if the threats were multiplying rather thandecreasing?In part, we feel the pressure because the threats are still there. They’vemerely taken new forms. Threats come from credit card companies trying tomanipulate us into signing up for high-interest-rate cards, hackers stealing ourfinancial information, banking houses that are manipulating the stock market,potential employers who promise the moon and don’t deliver when you take thejob, and so on. In a sense, the modern world is akin to a magician—the threatsare not obvious; we must always worry about what’s up their sleeve. And we haveto acknowledge that there continue to be real threats to safety and existence.Physical abuse, sexual assaults, and violence remain daily possibilities formany, especially females, the young, and those of us who are vulnerable to beingpreyed upon. Life can be difficult and dangerous.Going back to the stimulus-response model of brain function, apart from theselegitimate threats to health, safety, and even existence, consider that we arenowadays flooded with many more stimuli. Everyone is wedded to their iPhones,iPads, and iWhatevers. So many iStimuli. We have too much to process, most of itnot essential for survival, not to mention successful, fulfilling relationships.We may never be able to get an accurate measure of the overall increase indysfunctional thinking brought on by the iWorld. But it does seem clear that theinformation overload can contribute to the arousal of the primitivefight-or-flight mechanisms we have been discussing. And our brains can become soflooded, so overwhelmed, so scattered by the endless flood of information, thattrue cognitive impairment, or “digital dementia,” can be the result.We should not lose hope, however. As stated earlier, negativity, if not curable,is treatable. Let’s look first at the common forms that negativity can take. Asyou begin to recognize the patterns of negative thinking, you’ll be betterprepared to address them and manage your negative thoughts.What Is Negativity?As those stuck in its viselike grip know well, a negative outlook encompassesgloominess, pessimism, a lack of hope. Negativity includes the way we view theworld, the past, and the future. In our mental worlds we are critical or hostiletoward ourselves or others. We judge rather than understand. Negativity isdestructive; it would rather curse the darkness than light a candle. I mighteven go so far as to say that negativity is the opposite of love for oneself andothers.Here are some examples of negative thoughts: “I’m a total loser because I didn’tmake the basketball team.” “Nobody will ever love me.” “Everybody is againstme.” “I can’t do anything.” “If I apply to college, they’ll never accept me.”“If I ever got a flat, I could never change the tire.” “She didn’t want to gowith me to the prom; I’ll never get a date.” “Bill is frowning; I bet it’sbecause of what I said.”Negative thinking is typically a species of black-and-white thinking, in whichthe nuances, the shades of gray, are left out. Cognitive behavioral therapy(CBT) is a widely accepted treatment for anxiety, depression, and other issues.It focuses on changing unhealthy thinking patterns that contribute to ourdifficulties. Specialists in CBT define a number of different negative-thinkingproblems that they call cognitive distortions.All-or-none thinking relates to defining yourself in extreme black-and-whitecategories and is related to perfectionism. Take the example of a student with abad case of the flu who did poorly on her exam and then thought, “Now I’ll neverget into law school,” ignoring her otherwise stellar academic record andforgetting the impact her severe flu had on her exam performance. Perfectionistsoften fear failure or making mistakes. As all-or-none thinkers, they hence tryto avoid situations in which they might fail. Unfortunately, however, this alsomeans they cut off meaningful opportunities to grow.Another kind of negative thinking is the mental filter. This is where we focuson one small piece of the puzzle to the exclusion of all else. I have a largenose. If I focused constantly on my large nose, thinking I’m ugly because of it,I wouldn’t see the rest of what others (my wife, at least!) say is reasonablygood-looking. Mental filters can also turn otherwise positive experiences intonegative ones. Corey held a dinner party that was by all accounts a smashingsuccess. But he couldn’t stop focusing on the fact that one of his colleagueshad to leave early. Though his guest reassured Corey that it was because he hadto be up early the next morning, Corey worried that the real reason was that thecolleague had been offended by something said at the dinner. His colleague’searly departure colored Corey’s whole view of the evening. Despite the guests’protestations that they’d all had a great time, Corey’s mental filter led him tosee the party as an utter failure.When we’re trapped in a negative loop, we often overgeneralize. We think that ifsomething happens once, it will happen again and again. A teenage boy who askeda female classmate to the prom was devastated when she declined. “I’ll never geta date,” he said. Once he overcame his overgeneralization and asked anothergirl, the next girl he asked actually gladly accepted.Another kind of negative thinking is disqualifying the positive, or refusing tosee or recognize the positive implications of what you’ve done. For example, theresearch proposal you slaved over for weeks was accepted immediately, yet youreject the evidence of the great work you did on the proposal and continue tosee yourself as a loser who doesn’t deserve his job.Catastrophizing is imagining the worst, expecting disaster. You lose a documenton your computer. “Oh no,” you think. “That will make the project fail.” You goimmediately to the imagined catastrophe, rather than problem solving andrealizing that your coworker likely has a copy of the document you lost.We may also jump to conclusions or arrive at a negative conclusion not justifiedby the facts. Your boss fails to say hello to you and you conclude that your jobis in jeopardy. What you don’t realize is that your boss was distracted becauseher toddler was up all night with the flu. When you jump to conclusions, you areperforming mind reading, but badly.Labeling is the toxic application of labels to yourself. “I am a completefailure,” you tell yourself. Complete? Really? No positive achievements? We canalso destructively apply negative labels to others: “He never does any goodwork.”Emotional reasoning refers to concluding that your feelings are accuratedescriptions of how things really are. How we feel about something may or maynot reflect the actual situation. Feelings are just that—feelings. They are notnecessarily a representation of reality. “I feel like this presentation didn’tgo well,” I might say to a colleague, later to find out that my colleague—andour boss—thought the presentation was quite good.Finally, there are the Shoulds. Later we’ll see how destructive should andshouldn’t can be. “I should be able to do this without any struggle.” “He shouldnot go on vacation; rather, he should stay home and study.” “I shouldn’t begay.” These statements generate internal pressure and create personal guilt andshame when we direct them at ourselves. When we direct them toward others, theymake us judgmental and even toxic. Can we ever really know what we or others“should” do?What can be done to combat rampant negativity? First, it’s important torecognize that we all have an inner critic or judge inside our heads. It oftenfeels like a stranger has invaded us, a stranger who judges others harshly andtortures or even hates us. Second, it’s important to understand that thecritical stranger actually is an invader. Because the negativity isn’t you; it’syour brain activity. And the two are not the same.Let me reemphasize that—you are not just your brain, you are not just yourthoughts. Why do I make this claim? Well, the whole is greater than the sum ofthe parts. The brain is a key part of who we are, yes. But we find that the realus is beyond our thoughts. This is why Buddhist and other meditative traditionsclaim that we find ourselves only beyond our thoughts, apart from our thoughts,in a state of mental peace, often in meditation or silence. Our heart beats, butwe are not our heartbeat. Our brain thinks, but we are not our thoughts.That’s why, as we’ll see shortly, you can learn to separate yourself from therampant negativity in your brain. And in separating yourself from your poisonousnegativity, you can calm your busy brain.Managing NegativityManaging negativity rebalances a brain that is out of balance or leaning towardthe negative. The techniques to manage negativity strengthen the capacity of thePFC to offset the limbic system; they help to offset the negative defaultposition of the brain. You are literally strengthening your PFC when you dothese exercises. When you distract yourself and manage to get distance from yournegative thoughts, and counteract the negative thoughts with more rationalresponses, you are enhancing your PFC’s control over the limbic system. And astronger PFC ultimately helps check the emotional turmoil we feel from anout-of-control limbic system. A stronger PFC not only reins in the horses, ithelps prevent them from bolting in the first place.How Do We Manage Negativity? 1. Distance and Detach: Remember, “You are not just your brain, you are not your thoughts.” Thoughts arise automatically, just like the heart beats automatically and we breathe automatically. We don’t control our thoughts. And yet they can control us if we let them. If we remind ourselves that our brain makes our negative thoughts, that we are not our brain, we gain much-needed distance from our negative thoughts. They happen; that’s it. Don’t fight them. But we can think about our thinking. We can put things into perspective: Our thoughts are not facts. With practice and experience, we can learn to more automatically gain distance from our negative thoughts. Try observing the flow of negativity in your mind, the way you might sit on the bank of a stream and watch the water flow by. You might even view your negativity as a scientist would: “Oh, how interesting that there are self-critical thoughts occurring now.” Another way to create distance and detachment is what I call the “Ronald Reagan Approach.” In his presidential election debates with Walter Mondale, Mr. Reagan repeatedly and quite effectively said to Mr. Mondale: “There you go again.” Tell yourself: “There’s my brain being negative again.” 2. Distract Yourself: Pour yourself into something productive and positive or at least seek out a change of gears. When we are preoccupied with something we enjoy (a crossword puzzle, a good book, a game of catch) or even just find something to absorb us (take a coffee break or talk to a colleague), it gives our system a chance to calm down and our thoughts a chance to refocus from negative to more neutral, if not positive. Another distraction technique is something I call “Sole Therapy”: Focus on the bottom of your shoes as you walk. It moves your attention away from the negativity, distracting you. 3. Remember Your Values: Remind yourself what your values are. If you are ruminating over negative thoughts and decisions, refocusing on your core values will help reduce the negativity. 4. Practice Gratitude: Embrace an attitude of gratitude. Write down three things for which you are grateful. Studies show that simply writing down what you are grateful for can really change the brain and improve mood, moving you away from negativity. 5. Shun the Shower of Shoulds: Get out of the “Cold Shower of Shoulds.” Among the torment of negative thinking that afflicts us often is a constant flood of “shoulds”—“I should do this . . . I should do that . . .” This cold shower of “shoulds” is nothing but destructive. Once we become more aware of our tendency to stay too long in this destructive shower, we have a better chance of stepping out of this negative shower stall. 6. Twist the Dial: Imagine that there is a dial on the side of your head that you could use to turn down the negative thoughts. Imagine yourself turning down the negativity by twisting the dial. 7. Have a Laugh: Can you find the humor in what the negative critic is saying to you? Laughter can be the best medicine. Make fun of the negative thoughts. Laugh at them and yourself for believing them . . . but make sure that you do so gently. 8. Power Up Your Problem Solving: If the negative thoughts relate to a clear problem (e.g., a serious health issue), make a list of the steps you can take to deal with the situation. Break down the potential solution into small, achievable steps you can take to improve things. 9. Find the Positive: Try to find the positive in what seems to be a negative situation. Turning around a negative thought often shows us another side of the situation. A problem or crisis can even be an opportunity. Search for it. 10. Breathe: Take slow, deep breaths. This relaxes the body and the brain and reduces brain overactivity. We’ll talk more about breathing in later chapters. 11. Move: Do something physical; exercise. Don’t stay stuck and immobile, literally and metaphorically.When Gwen, my patient with herpes, first revealed her secret, her reaction totelling me was striking. She told me some of the details. Then she wasn’t ableto discuss it for another several weeks. I gave her the time she needed to feelsafe before we circled back. Eventually, we were able to begin to explore whatit meant to her.Gwen needed to overcome her persistent, terrifying negative belief that shewould be rejected immediately and permanently if she told any prospectivepartner about her herpes. First, I helped Gwen realize that her incrediblystrong negative thoughts about herpes were just thoughts. They were not her,just her brain. Her brain made these thoughts just like her heart madeheartbeats. When Gwen noticed the thoughts that “Any man will reject me if Itell him about my herpes,” she learned to create distance by telling herself,“These are just my thoughts. They are not me. They are not true.” Frankly, ittook some doing to get her to accept this point of view, but she did eventually.Reminding herself of her intrinsic values and of the good she brought to thelives of others, especially through her volunteer work tutoring immigrants inEnglish, helped soften the strength of the negative blows Gwen delivered toherself in her psyche. Writing down things for which she was grateful alsohelped move Gwen away from her negativity. She wrote down things such as “I amgrateful for my health,” “I am grateful for my good job,” and “I am grateful formy supportive friends.”Gwen embraced examining her “shower of shoulds.” She imagined her negativecomments, such as “I shouldn’t have herpes” and “I should accept that I’ll besingle my whole life,” coming out of the shower nozzle. This helped Gwen toimagine herself stepping out of this cold shower of shoulds, getting away fromthese comments and wiping them off with a towel.Focusing on her breathing also helped Gwen distract herself from her negativethoughts. At first, she thought my idea of imagining turning down a dial on theoutside of her head was silly, but she tried it one day and it helped.Finally, Gwen, who loved shoes, effectively used sole therapy, focusing on thesoles of her shoes as she walked, to distract herself from thoughts like “I’llnever be happy because nobody could want or love a woman like me with herpes.”It took time and hard effort, but eventually the approaches above were quitesuccessful for Gwen. Her negative thoughts declined about 90 percent over aten-month period as she used the preceding approaches. We were finally able tospeak openly about herpes. Gwen could feel comfortable enough to talk with herdoctor to get antiviral medication to use to try to prevent herpes outbreaks. Wepracticed how she could tell a potential partner that she had herpes and how shemight answer his questions. Ultimately, Gwen was able to stop aborting herrelationships with men just as they were about to become sexual. She told meabout the first time that, with trepidation, she risked telling a man about herherpes. Fortunately, he was sympathetic and accepting of Gwen, and they wereable to deepen their relationship, which eventually included satisfying sexualintimacy.Gwen did have to put in the work to tackle her negativity. I admired Gwen forbeing willing to face her secret and work it through. Freud wrote that you can’tslay a dragon in absentia. Gwen had to look her dragon in the eye in order toslay him, and slay the dragon she did. Eventually, Gwen became engaged to a goodman. I was happy to receive a note from her with a wedding picture of the happycouple.[../image/59906.jpg]ACTION PLAN[../image/59900.jpg] * Detach: Don’t fight your negativity. Rather, practice stepping back from your thoughts five times each day. * Shun the Shower of Shoulds: Pick one half day per week and notice and total up the number of times you have a thought like “I should . . .” or “I shouldn’t . . .” This will help you become more aware of how often you are attacked by these thoughts. * Practice Gratitude: Write down three things each day for which you are grateful. * Have a Laugh: At least three times a day, find the humor in what your inner critic is saying to you. Laugh at it."},{"pageContent":"[../image/64356.jpg]3[../image/64354.jpg]Rewriting Your StoriesWhen I first met Carl, approaching fifty, he’d been an accountant for most ofhis working life. His accounting work was good, but he never seemed to be ableto keep up with the required pace and volume of work that the firm’s partnersassigned him. The April 15 deadlines were killers every year, especially becauseof his severe procrastination. Carl was disorganized, lost documents, and neverturned in the billing sheets used to charge the clients on time; he often forgotto bill clients for legitimate work as well. Accordingly, Carl’s incomesuffered, and he and his wife never met their reasonable financial goals. Carl’spoor attention to detail and inability to concentrate on aspects of work thatwere less interesting to him curtailed his ability to earn a good income. Carlknew that he was struggling, and he had repetitive negative thoughts abouthimself. “I’m next to worthless. Why can’t I keep up and do my work likeeverybody else?” he would ask himself again and again. When Carl’s son wasdiagnosed with ADHD, his son’s doctor suggested that Carl get an evaluation forhimself.Diagnosing Carl with ADHD was straightforward. Lifestyle changes like dietaryoptimization and exercise helped some, but Carl continued to have problems withattention, focus, concentration, procrastination, and other ADHD issues. Carlhad the definition of a busy brain. Ultimately, because lifestyle changes werenot sufficient to help Carl improve, I prescribed Vyvanse for him. Vyvanse is aprescription medication that boosts dopamine, improving function in the brain’sprefrontal cortex, the area often underfunctioning because of ADHD. Vyvanse issimilar in action to Adderall and other stimulant medications, justlonger-acting and smoother in its effects. It didn’t take long to find theoptimal dose of Vyvanse, and Carl had a great response with few side effects.Specifically, Carl noted an immediate, marked improvement in focus, attention,and concentration. His procrastination was reduced. His energy increased, andhis work performance improved significantly. Carl was now able to keep up withorganizational demands like proper completion of client billing sheets; hisincome jumped.All in all, after seeing me for only two months, Carl seemed to have a greatresponse. His brain worked better, clearly, and he was more productive andeffective at work and at home. But Carl still felt bad about himself. Hecontinued telling himself he was a loser, not worth much, next to incompetent,and unable to match his peers at work in productivity and work quality.Medication had remedied Carl’s brain problem. But his old “tapes” kept replayinghis unpleasant story.Carl’s case illustrates a fundamental principle. We can often rebalance a brainwith ADHD, like Carl’s. But even after improving the low functional level of hisPFC, the cause of the ADHD, with the Vyvanse, there was another repair thatneeded to take place. To get Carl’s brain to stop playing the busy tapes, westill needed to heal Carl’s mind, his spirit, his soul. Carl grew up with ADHD,struggling in school, hearing frequently that “You’re not trying hardenough. . . . You are capable of more.” Indeed, Carl was bright—his intelligenceand hard work took him far in school and in his accounting profession. Butbecause of his struggles, Carl’s spirit had taken a big blow. Carl’s personalstory was of being a defective, inadequate, incompetent individual. And thisnegative self-narrative lingered even after the brain problem had been treated.Carl needed more than just an approach that would rebalance his brain withmedication. He also needed to go further than just conquering negativity. Carlneeded to strengthen his PFC in a much more fundamental fashion: he needed tolearn to manage his mind by rewriting his negative stories. Conqueringnegativity and rewriting our stories are obviously connected. However, rewritingour stories is a more thoroughgoing renovation of our psyche than conqueringnegativity is, resulting in even more profound change and healing.The Stories We TellHow do we become so stuck in inaccurate stories about ourselves? One thing wemust understand is that just because we create a story about ourselves andothers doesn’t mean that story is true. We may get attached to a story if werepeat it enough times. Like Carl, we may convince ourselves we’ve created avalid picture of ourselves and the world. But it isn’t necessarily the case. Ourstories are representations of ourselves and the world. But they are not real.These maps, these stories, are simply the best we have. We never can really knowthe world. The best we can do is to learn to better know our thoughts, ourstories.For some individuals, an inability to generate and to tell consistent,meaningful stories is related to attachment problems early in life. Researchshows that children with attachment problems with their mothers or fathers havegreater difficulty generating coherent stories when they grow older. Why?Because a poor attachment relationship to one’s mother or father makes itdifficult to have a coherent sense of oneself in relation to others. Becausetheir mothers or fathers were preoccupied with their own troubles, they rarelyexperienced their child as a separate, developing individual. These childrenthus also could not see themselves as a distinct entity and as a result had anunderdeveloped sense of themselves. Perhaps no one asked them about theirschoolwork or their experiences with friends. Perhaps there were fewopportunities for the children to generate narratives, stories that began with“I.” Healthy attachment experiences are the foundation for a healthy sense ofoneself and others. With unhealthy attachment experiences, we could say thatthere is less of a “self” there, the “I,” about which to generate a story.An example is Lisa, a woman I know who was raised by a disturbed single motherin a chaotic home in which there was extreme poverty, drug and alcohol abuse,legal trouble, and sexual abuse of all the female children, including Lisa. Lisadoes not have ADHD, anxiety, or depression. She is not psychotic. Yet when Lisatalks, it is difficult to understand what she is talking about. Lisa will tell astory, but it is rarely clear if she is talking about herself or another person.Sometimes she will slip from present to past and back to present. It’s as if shecan’t distinguish what happened in the past from a more recent encounter with afamily member; or maybe it’s more accurate to say that she has little experiencetelling stories about herself. Her confusions are most likely related to thefragmented and ambivalent interactions she had with her mother. Lisa simply hastoo little “self” to generate a coherent narrative.When a lack of coherent story-telling ability reflects a more fundamental lackof coherence in one’s sense of self, as it does with Lisa, rewriting your storyon your own may not suffice. Psychotherapeutic assistance may be needed to helpgive birth to and develop a functional self. If you try the storytellingapproach that I present in this chapter, and you find that you are stuck orcannot make progress, consider consulting a psychotherapist for help.Most of us, however, can address the unhealthy stories we tell ourselves and howwe generate them. We can rewrite our stories. And by doing so, we’ll improve ourcapacity to function with fewer internal inhibitions and improved overall brainfunction. We will strengthen our PFC, take a giant step toward reclaiming ourbrain, and move in the direction of bringing our life back under control.Trying to know oneself is like being in a fun house full of mirrors! Which makessense. A perfect, static model of the self is overly ambitious. That said,models can be more or less true. The healthiest stories about ourselves emergefrom our ability to engage in self-reflection.The path to self-reflection begins with the prefrontal cortex. In large part,the prefrontal cortex generates our stories. The temporal lobes generate thememory traces that we call upon when we reflect, and the prefrontal cortex takesthe memory information and generates cause-and-effect relationships. It is thesecause-and-effect relationships that give me so much difficulty when I talk withLisa; I can never figure out who is doing what to whom in her stories.When we retell our stories, we thus recruit the PFC to look at itself. Retellingstories does at least three important things: 1. It counterbalances our intrinsic negative tendencies. In retelling our stories we take a more complex, more nuanced view of the story, overcoming to some extent the brain’s default negativity. 2. It allows us to see our own thoughts. In essence, we are thinking about our thinking, thinking about our stories. If we are true to the task of retelling our stories, we necessarily reexamine what we think about ourselves and others. 3. It strengthens self-reflective capacities. Story-telling and self-reflection are analogous to lifting weights to build muscle strength. The muscles become stronger through the repetitions. Analogously, our PFC can become stronger through retelling our story exercises. And the stronger the PFC becomes, the easier it becomes to self-regulate, self-reflect, and create even more coherent, nuanced, and adaptive stories for oneself.This story-rewriting approach freezes our thoughts. It allows us to meditate andfocus on the stories as if we have put them under a microscope, and essentiallyit recruits the help of the prefrontal cortex to modulate the activity of themore primitive limbic brain centers. We are recruiting the thinking brain tohelp offset the busy, emotional brain.Being able to self-reflect is not just about adjusting our self-narrative andcalming our busy brain. It crucially helps us connect with others. Retellingstories helps integrate us into our social world. And hearing the richly shadedstories of others allows us to identify with their healthy, more balancedworldview. For example, maybe you and your team are down to the wire on animportant presentation when you realize that Bob bungled a key piece of data inthe PowerPoint presentation. Your first reaction might be fury at Bob’sincompetence. Then a colleague explains that Bob is going through a terribledivorce and is under great strain. Your colleague’s version of the story is morecharitable and compassionate than your instantaneous anger. Suddenly, ratherthan seeing Bob as a talentless idiot, you might realize that he’s a hurtingsoul in the midst of a personal crisis. It doesn’t excuse Bob’s mistake per se,but it does help you understand it and put it into a more nuanced context.Through telling and hearing stories, other people can serve as external brainsthat we can use to improve our own brain function and improve our capacity tounderstand the world. We learn to live and let live. To see others’perspectives. To nurture tolerance, empathy, and compassion for others. Beingable to see all sides of a story, being able to see the other person’s position,is advantageous for social organisms like humans because it allows us to getalong better in our social world.It may sound like magic that after years of telling incorrect stories aboutourselves, such as Carl told himself, by rewriting those stories we willsuddenly see the light: we will become less negative, more social, more kind toourselves and to others. But this isn’t magic; it works. And the reason it worksis that just as healing your brain helps calm your overactive mind, changing themind—that is, changing the stories that you tell yourself—can also change thebrain. How? Because the brain is plastic. In essence, we are talking aboutself-directed neuroplasticity. The mind, the self, you, can rewire your braincircuits by rewriting your stories. Brain scans show evidence of brainalterations that resemble the changes brought about by medication in people whoundertake cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which is simply a structuredversion that teaches retelling of your stories. Other brain scan research alsosupports this claim of self-directed neuroplasticity from rewriting your story.For example, the work of Jeffrey Schwartz, M.D., at UCLA demonstrates brainchanges from mindfulness-based interventions for obsessive-compulsive disorder(OCD). Schwartz’s mindfulness approach is close to retelling your story. The keypoint is that changing how you talk to yourself, changing what you say toyourself, how you tell yourself stories, changes your brain.By learning techniques to manage our minds and brains, we are breaking oldhabits and patterns (related to particular brain circuits) and causing newercircuits to form. If our new stories are more nuanced, these newer braincircuits are also more adaptive. For example, if we develop the habit of seeingshades of gray in a spouse’s behavior, when our spouse repeats that particularbehavior, our mind more naturally goes to those shades of gray rather than arigid black-and-white interpretation of the event. For example, perhaps at onepoint we viewed a spouse’s unwillingness to talk about their day as a personalrejection. We might come to understand that their quiet doesn’t stem from a lackof desire to share. It’s simply exhaustion after a long day. Now when our spousereturns home lacking their usual talkativeness, we may ask if it’s been a hardday and express compassion. The mind has literally rewired the circuitry of ourbrain in a more nuanced, more adaptive fashion.Self-directed neuroplasticity, changing our brains ourselves, is the basis forhope that we can change. But it requires sustained effort to break old patternsand learn new ones. In fact, co-created story revision is the essence of goodpsychotherapy with a skilled therapist. Intensive psychotherapy may well be oneof the best ways to address intransigent maladaptive patterns.Many story patterns, however, are less deeply ingrained. And you should findsuccess with the techniques I describe next.Rewriting Our StoriesIn order to rewrite our stories we must let go of the negative interpretationsof our lives that hold us back. Think of the goal as trying to move from ablack-and-white story theme to one that includes a palette of many colors.Rewriting our stories, in thinking, appreciating nuance, being able to thinkabout thinking, adds a richness and a dimension to life that would not existotherwise. The whole point is greater inner freedom—we don’t want to be weigheddown by inflexible stories.One of the most important tools for rewriting is self-reflective capacity. Weneed to be able to reflect on the meaning of our experience and on our stories;we must not take our stories at face value. Self-reflection not only strengthensour PFC—our ability to govern ourselves. It also gives us inner freedom. We aretalking about a mindful stance, one that allows us to think about ourthinking—awareness of awareness.Do you have the courage it takes to be one-on-one with your thoughts? It mighttake more courage than we often realize. A series of studies done by TimothyWilson at Harvard University and the University of Virginia showed that mostpeople prefer doing something—even hurting themselves—to doing nothing orsitting alone with their thoughts. Remarkable, isn’t it? Study participants wereasked to quietly be alone with their thoughts for six to fifteen minutes. Manyparticipants found the time alone with their minds to be unpleasant. Two-thirdsof the men and one-quarter of the women preferred self-administered electricshocks to sitting quietly with their thoughts. The researchers suggest that themind’s primary job is to deal with the external world. In primitive times themind was almost always directed outward—for survival reasons, for food, sex,countering attacks, and so on. Once people did not have to worry about suchthings, the individual had the luxury to begin to look inward, to contemplatethe nature of human existence, to create art, literature, and music. But thesestudies suggest that dealing with the inner world, our minds, is still difficultfor many of us.What to Do: Self-Reflecting and Story RewritingIf you have the courage, the will, to look at your thoughts, your stories, howdo you go about it? Here are the steps that I have found helpful for my patientsand myself in trying to sort through the troublesome stories, the soap operas,in the brain.Write It DownIt is important to write down your thoughts and stories.I find that writing down my thoughts and stories on paper or on an electronicdevice helps me freeze my thoughts so that I can assess them. Thoughts areslippery devils. They’re here now, gone in a moment. How can we really work withour thoughts if we can’t grab them, pin them down, and take a focused look atthem? You really need to be able to hold your thoughts still so you can shine aspotlight on them.You may be tempted to talk out your thoughts instead of writing them down. Butgrabbing hold of and nailing down your thoughts in writing is key to theprocess. As Carl, my ADHD patient from earlier, and I began to work together torewrite his negative account of himself, I explained to Carl that becausethoughts come and go so quickly, it would be important to write them down inorder to work on them. He wasn’t too keen on this initially, but he agreed totry it. As he found it useful, his initial reluctance to write down his thoughtsand stories passed.True or False?Pick a simple story. Summarize it in a few lines. Write down whether your storyis true or false.You could select any painful thought, feeling, story, or belief. Anything thatcauses you pain. For example, Carl wrote, “I was a lousy student who didn’t tryhard enough.”If we are honest with ourselves, we recognize that our stories are incomplete,if not untrue. Have you believed your thoughts? Have you believed your stories?I bet you’ve done that. I have. What a change it can make to realize thatthoughts and stories are fiction, a narrative that emerges from brain activity.“He doesn’t like me.” Is that really true? Can I really know for sure? If wewait, take the time really to look inside and be truthful with ourselves, theanswer is almost always no.As I worked with Carl to help him rewrite his story, I suggested that he reallylook at the truth of his statement that he was a lousy student who didn’t tryhard enough. At first, he was quick to say yes, it was true. I asked Carl toslow down, to really look inward, as if this question were a kind of meditation.This time, Carl said no, this story of being a lousy student who didn’t try hardenough was not true. I asked Carl to explain. Carl admitted that he achievedgrades of B or B+ in high school and graduated from a well-regarded stateuniversity. He couldn’t have been lousy. Then I asked Carl about the second partof his statement, that he was capable of more. Again, Carl at first said yes.But I asked him to really reflect on that statement, to look inside to seek thetruth. After a few minutes, with tears in his eyes, Carl said that it wasn’ttrue that he was capable of more. In fact, he said, he knew that he alwaysworked much harder than his peers, but he’d never known why. He stayed up late,missing out on sleep. Often he declined social activities to try to study. He’dassumed his problems were because he was less intelligent, but now Carl wasrealizing that it was the ADHD that was the problem, not whether he was capableof more. I could see the glint of recognition in Carl’s eyes as he saw the morenuanced version of his educational experiences. The truth was that he had notbeen capable of more. He’d figuratively knocked himself out to accomplish whathe had accomplished. He’d used every ounce of energy he had. How could he havebeen capable of more?After you write down your painful thoughts, feelings, stories or beliefs,examine them for their truth. More likely than not you will spot an error in thethought that is causing you pain and affecting how you see yourself and theworld.Time TravelingWhere are you in time? Is your story about now? Or are you more likely stuck inthe past or projecting yourself into the future?We keep talking about wanting to live in the now. But our thoughts go endlesslyinto the past or future. Recognizing this in yourself can bring you back to thepresent.When Carl dwelled on his school struggles, he was stuck in the past. Yet Carlwanted to be more present for his wife and children. When we discussed his “timetravel,” Carl began to realize how much of his mental life was spent away fromthe present. Simply recognizing this made it easier for him to spend less timein the past and more time in the present with the people he cared about most.Ask yourself: Are you spending the time you want to be spending in the present?Are you living in the past or the future, or are you living in the now?JudgmentLook honestly at whether you are judging yourself or others in your story.Christianity and other religious traditions teach leaving judgment in the handsof God. Unfortunately, eschewing judgment is difficult for Christians and mostothers, given human makeup, especially the way brain evolution and the resultingbrain function contribute to our negativity. But it is important to try to avoidjudgment. Judgment usually does little good and often stirs you up. Judgment isoften in the search for who or what is right or wrong, really an extension ofthat negative, black-and-white thinking. Think about the common saying aboutbeing the peace you want to see in the world. Our judgmental tendencies get inthe way of having the internal peace that we need to start with. Why not let goof judgment and just be?When Carl and I talked about judgment, it really struck a chord. Carl realizedthat he’d felt judged harshly in school and that he constantly judged himself,and always negatively. Carl was eventually able to move away from thisjudgmental stance and just be, without criticism or judgment of self and others.It wasn’t easy and it took time, but he was able to do it.Whose Business?Whose business are you in? In your story, your internal drama, whose affairs areyou concerned with? Yours? Somebody else’s? God’s/the universe’s?We can really only change ourselves, and even that is difficult. We’ll neverknow what is best for others. Parents of my teen patients get worked up if theirson or daughter doesn’t want to attend college. Can we really know that someoneshould go to college, even our children? Some people do not attend college andhave wonderful and successful lives, sometimes contributing much to society. Idon’t mean to say we shouldn’t talk with our children, calmly and lovingly,helping them consider and think through the pros and cons of attending college.But after that, what can we do? If our child isn’t inclined to try college rightthen, so be it. It’s the child’s decision, and it should be, after we helpedthem think it through.This is akin to the Buddhist concept of acceptance. In the case of the collegedecision, it’s not my business after I helped my child think it through; it’s mychild’s business. But what about God’s or the universe’s business? Well, thathas to do with situations like whether I have a stroke, or whether a meteorfalls on my house. I owe it to myself and my family to try to remain as healthyas I can and take care of myself, but that might not be enough—I still couldhave a stroke. And, if so, that’s God’s business. It’s also God’s or theuniverse’s business when a tsunami strikes in Asia. I cannot do anything aboutthat, other than donating money and supplies for relief, which I do. These arehorrible tragedies, and they seem to happen far too often. But they are beyondmy control.I asked Carl to consider whose business he was in with his story of being alousy student who didn’t try hard enough. He thought that he was in his ownbusiness; after all, who else was there in this story? I agreed, partially, butCarl was a bit surprised when I told him that I thought he was also in God’s orthe universe’s business. Why? Because Carl didn’t give himself ADHD. It wasthrough no fault of his that he had it. He couldn’t do anything about having it,although he could try to address it via treatment, which he’d done. I agree, itwas a bit of a stretch telling him this, but I wanted to gently shake his senseof excessive responsibility for his problems.AccountingAnalyze the pros and cons of continuing to hold on to and believe that story.Look at the pros and cons of believing the story and tally up the columns.Because Carl was an accountant, the notion of a cost assessment appealed to him.He looked at the cost of believing the story that a colleague didn’t like him.Carl said that the pro was that if he believed it, he might work harder to beliked. The cons were that he became tense and on guard, didn’t sleep well, andwas always ready to counterattack in case the colleague said something thatcould hurt Carl at the upcoming monthly board meeting. What would it be like ifCarl didn’t hold on to “He doesn’t like me”? “Well, I’d feel calmer, happier,really freer. I would not have to worry about what he might do at the boardmeeting.” To total up the accounting, there is a slight benefit from holding onto the story. But there is a significant downside. The negative outweighs thepositive. “Better to give up that story if I can,” said Carl.OppositesBe honest with yourself and think about whether, at least in some ways, theopposite of your story might be true.Carl considered whether a story opposite from the one that he was a lousystudent who didn’t try hard enough might be true. Carl had gotten decent grades.But more important he could now see that he’d functioned with a handicap when hewas in school. A handicap of a paralyzed leg is visible to everybody. But hishandicap was invisible. Realizing he’d done as well as he had despite thehandicap of ADHD was liberating. Suddenly Carl could see the opposite of the “Iwas a lousy student who didn’t try” story. He realized that what he’daccomplished in his life before he knew he had ADHD was actually heroic, likeclimbing a mountain with one hand tied behind your back. You can do it, but itis much more difficult than the usual way.It may seem like these steps could be accomplished in a few minutes.Realistically, Carl and I did go through all the points in one appointment.However, to move ahead and really rewrite his story, Carl needed to return againand again to the approach I’ve outlined. Sometimes I helped or even prodded him.Other times, he worked on his own.You too may need several sessions with this exercise. Always writing down yourthoughts and responses to the various steps will help significantly. As yourepeat the steps, new insights may appear. And at the same time bonds to oldways of thinking may loosen.As with Carl, part of what you may be doing is reframing your development. InCarl’s case, we took a look back at the story of his childhood and schooling.His understanding of what happened had been incomplete because he had not beenaware of having ADHD. My work with Carl helped him reframe and reinterpret hisdevelopmental struggles in a more nuanced and much less self-attacking way. Carlno longer judged himself so harshly. Plus, he gained a developmental historythat was, in my view, more accurate and more healthy. The stories that made uphis newfound developmental history were much more positive and realistic.Ultimately, Carl even could own a sense of pride for surmounting his strugglesthe way he did. To add a postscript, Carl was made partner in the accountingfirm two years after he first came to see me.I hope that by repeating the exercise, you too will reframe and reinterpret yourstruggles in a much more nuanced way and stop judging yourself so harshly.Ultimately, you will be able to write stories that are more positive andrealistic, find relief from inner attacks, and see your own successes multiplyas you do so.In this chapter on rewriting your stories, I wanted to present individuals forwhom rewriting their stories is particularly important and effective, given thattheir brain function is fundamentally healthy. Because ADHD is so common, andbecause rewriting their stories and reframing their development can be sohelpful for someone with ADHD, we discussed Carl. Let’s now look at anothercondition for which rewriting stories can be extremely helpful, a situation inwhich there is no diagnosed psychiatric condition: job loss.Ana, thirty-three, came to the United States from Central America with herparents at age six. Her parents, seeking the American dream, started a cleaningbusiness. They worked six and a half days a week, cleaning the homes andbusiness establishments of the well-to-do. Ana’s parents wanted nothing morethan for her and her siblings to have a good life: an education, a spouse withsimilar values, and the ability to make a contribution to society. Ana pursuedthe goals her parents set for her and did well. Education came easy; she didwell in school and graduated from a good university. After that, Ana,cash-strapped, attended law school at night while working during the day in herparents’ business. Her hard work was rewarded by graduating from law school withhonors.Aiming to contribute to society, to give back, so to speak, Ana took a job as ajunior associate at a firm that specialized in immigration issues. At first, thefirm was flush with work and Ana thrived, working eighty hours per week.Unfortunately, the economy soon fell into recession. Ana was laid off, anotherof the many job casualties experienced by young attorneys across the country.Losing her job was quite a setback for Ana. Until that point, her hard work hadresulted directly in success, in moving toward her important goals. Suddenly,through no fault of her own, Ana was out of work. Her sense of what to do wasshaken. Could she succeed as an attorney? Could she even survive financially?Just as the legal profession was hit hard by the downturn, Ana’s parents’cleaning service lost clients for the same reasons that resulted in her beinglaid off.Not so much anxious, not so much depressed, but shaken, discouraged, and filledwith increasingly negative thoughts and stories about herself, Ana sought myhelp. In the course of a few sessions, I explained to Ana the principles ofrewriting one’s stories, which she used to good benefit. I won’t give as muchdetail as I provided with Carl, but I’ll sketch some of the key points about howAna approached rewriting her stories.First, it was important for Ana to learn to write down her negative thoughts andstories so she could pin them down and work effectively with them. Ana wrotedown thoughts and stories like “I wasted years of schooling and tens ofthousands of dollars” and “I’m a failure.” I asked her to start by clarifyingwhether these stories were true or false. Ana’s initial response was to say thatthey were true. “Can you know absolutely that these stories are true?” I asked.She replied that she couldn’t know for sure that they actually were true.I asked Ana to look honestly at herself, to consider whether she was judgingherself with this story she was telling about being a failure and wasting tensof thousands of hard-earned money. Ana reflected for some minutes. Yes, shesaid, she was judging herself. She had unconsciously absorbed her parents’immigrant ethos of hard work. She wasn’t working hard; in fact, she wasn’tworking at all. Did that mean she was a failure? No, it didn’t necessarily meanthat. Ana recognized that she tended to apply to herself an unfair judgment.Ana had worked hard, but one can’t control everything, even through hard work.Economies falter. I asked Ana to consider whose business she was concerningherself with when she told these negative stories about herself. Ana came torecognize that it was God’s business, or the universe’s, or maybe that of themajor banking houses that contributed to or caused the economic downturn thathurt her and so many others. That didn’t make her a failure. It didn’t mean thatshe wasted her money on a legal education.Ana did an accounting, considering the pros and cons of holding on to thenegative story of herself. She couldn’t find any pros. The cons were that shefelt miserable and defeated. And Ana was able to consider whether the oppositeof her negative story might be true. She concluded that she was not a failure,that she had achieved a lot overall through her hard work, and that she waslikely to find success—somehow—in the future.Rewriting her story helped Ana. It didn’t get her another legal job, of course;that took time. But rewriting her negative thoughts and stories did help herkeep up her morale. A few months after we’d ended our work, Ana let me know thatshe’d been hired by the U.S. Department of Justice as an attorney specializingin immigrant affairs. She thanked me for teaching her how to rewrite herstories, which she said that she’d continue to practice, with good results.Each life story is different. And the stories we tell ourselves are alldifferent. It’s one of the things I love about my work. I am privileged to learnso much as I meet and share the lives of the people I come to know. Because ofwhat we now know about brain plasticity and brain function, the self-reflectionand story rewriting that I encourage you to try likely does more than just helpyou feel better because your negative stories are less burdensome. This approachis likely to change your brain as well, in fundamentally positive ways.[../image/59906.jpg]ACTION PLAN[../image/59900.jpg]At least one time a day, take fifteen uninterrupted minutes and work onrewriting one of your stories. Pick any story, thought, or belief that causesyou discomfort or pain. Write it down. Then work through the steps in thischapter, starting with “True or False?,” writing down your answers as youmeditate on each step in the process, attempting to find the truth within you."},{"pageContent":"[../image/64356.jpg]4[../image/64354.jpg]Becoming MindfulHave you ever noticed that during periods of high work intensity or stress, atthe times when your brain feels busiest, you don’t breathe? Of course, that isnot literally true, or else you would be in an ICU or worse. But the calm deepbreaths, which fill you with oxygen, don’t occur. Rather, you breathe shallowly,not quite hyperventilating, but maybe close to it. Perhaps your balance gets outof control. You become decentered. And at these times, you have too much noisein your head; your brain is overactive. You seem to be reacting to life, ratherthan acting. You are somehow being lived, not living, not managing yourself, notregulating yourself.This is a condition that affects most everybody I know, patient and nonpatientalike, myself included. I’m talking about living life on automatic pilot. Livingmindlessly.The overstimulation of modern life, with our modern information overload, tugsand pulls at us from every direction. We can’t regulate ourselves. We can’tregulate our emotions. Our minds are restless. I hear more and more talk about“monkey brains,” meaning brains in which thoughts jump around every which waylike monkeys do on trees. We are experiencing a mental too-muchness.Yes, modern life bombards us with external stimuli. We are also, however, beingoverwhelmed by inner stimuli, by the noise from our too-active limbic systems.The imbalance we see in a busy brain is caused not merely by a PFC that is tooweak but by a limbic system that has become too strong. We’ve already discussedsome ways to address the PFC–limbic system imbalance by strengthening our PFC.We can manage our negativity. And we can rewrite our stories. On the other sideof the equation, we can also learn to calm our overactive limbic systems.Learning to calm our limbic systems, we learn to tame our hyperarousal andcreate new patterns of behavior. And it is through calming the limbic systemthat we will find more ways to stabilize ourselves within our modern maelstrom.To turn down the noise that keeps us from even hearing ourselves. From findingourselves. From really knowing ourselves.There is a rather nasty joke common among medical trainees. It has to do withwhat the earliest responders need to do at a “code” in the hospital, that is,the crisis when a patient stops breathing or has a cardiac arrest. The joke goessomething like this: “What is the first thing you have to do at a code? Answer:Take your own pulse!”The joke, of course, plays off what one would expect—that is, first take thepulse of the patient. Apart from using humor to help medical professionalsmanage their emotions related to the powerful life-and-death issues they facedaily, this joke underscores a deeper point. We cannot think clearly if ouremotions are running wild. The medical professionals running the code need tohave their wits about them; their own pulse can’t be going a thousand miles anhour. They cannot best help a patient in crisis if their own physiology is outof control. The first—and most important—thing they need to do is make sure thatthey calm themselves. Only then can they have the best chance of making thesplit-second decisions that may spell life or death for the patient whose hearthas stopped.Like the medical professional managing a code, those of us who are attempting toconquer our negativity, rewrite our stories, and improve our relationshipscannot do so if our emotions are out of control. We need ways to calm ourselves,to find peace, to be able to think about our thinking. This is what mindfulnessprovides.Before tackling the mindful approach, however, I’d like to introduce you toJames, an overwhelmed pastor, whose story is almost a parable for ourcontemporary multitasking era. If anyone was a candidate for a busy brain, itwas James.When I first met James, he was married and in his midforties. He served on thelocal school board in his community and performed in an a cappella chorus oflocal renown. He was also continuing the home remodeling business that hisfather started. And, following a religious calling he experienced as a teen,James became the pastor of a small church. The cumulative demands on James, apeople pleaser, were striking. I noticed anxiety within myself as I thoughtabout all the pressures on James. He had four children; the youngest hadcerebral palsy and required time-consuming and expensive physical therapy. Hiswife had multiple sclerosis. The school board demands were significant;budgetary cutbacks created rancor between teachers and the school board, whichwas reluctant to raise taxes to do more in the schools, including givingteachers a raise. James’s remodeling business was successful financially, but itfell to him to deal with customer complaints, of which there were more than afew. Finally, in his church there were the common strains within thecongregation, with various cliques and disputes about the overall direction ofthe church, especially in connection to changes within the nationalorganization, of which James’s church was a member.Not surprisingly, James was stressed to the point of being overwhelmed. Hewrestled with anxiety and feeling down but did not have symptoms severe enoughto warrant a clinical diagnosis. James did experience insomnia, skin outbreaks,gastrointestinal (GI) problems such as nausea and diarrhea, and heartpalpitations. His primary care doctor gave him a clean bill of health; noserious medical problems accounted for James’s issues. But James’s doctor wasconcerned about James’s level of stress. That was when he referred James to seeme.What bothered James most was that he never experienced himself as being present.Counseling the members of his congregation, he struggled with thoughts aboutschool board conflicts. Dealing with customer complaints in his remodelingbusiness, he found himself worrying about the health of his wife and daughter.James, who loved music, found himself not able to pay attention during the acappella rehearsals because he was worrying about church members whom he wascounseling for marital problems. And so it went. James’s busy brain preventedhim from ever feeling like he was there, in the moment, with the people withwhom he wanted to be present. The restlessness of his mind ensured that he wasalways in more than one place at one time, and never really there, where heneeded to be.James needed help. We discussed whether mindfulness approaches could be usefulfor him. Many of my other patients had experienced success in calming their busybrain using mindfulness techniques.What Is Mindfulness?Mindfulness is an approach. It is a deliberate effort to facilitate thedevelopment of an agency, a self, that monitors and regulates our experiences.Mindfulness is a way of being—a way of looking inside oneself, of being aware ofawareness, of paying attention nonjudgmentally to the unfolding of experience.It can be a way of being quiet and of quieting a busy brain.Mindfulness stops you from living life on automatic pilot. You live with moreconscious attention; you’re more aware of the mind itself. Mindfulness isthinking about thinking, awareness of awareness. Both correlate withself-reflection, reflection on inner life, on the events of the mind.Mindfulness slows down the busy brain, in part through anchoring us in thepresent moment. Mindfulness and meditation, which is one form of mindfulness,are important approaches for achieving inner peace.The Benefits of MindfulnessMindfulness approaches improve our ability to regulate our emotions. Mindfulnesspractices reduce our negativity. We find improved relationships in those whopractice mindfulness because mindful individuals are better able to read thenonverbal signals of others. Mindful individuals are better attuned to the innerworlds of others and have greater compassion for others and themselves.Intuition is improved. Fear response is modulated. Insight is better. The listcould go on and on. Many of these benefits stem from strengthened PFC functionand improved PFC–limbic system balance. Brain language networks, especiallythose that involve evaluation, are tamped down, with resulting greater opennessand less judgment. When we engage in meditation, an approach of mindfulness, weturn down the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system and turn up thecalming, parasympathetic branch. As a result, we are less defensive, less in afight-or-flight mode. Thoughtfulness predominates rather than raw feelings andimpulses.The science confirming meditation’s benefits is far-reaching. Here’s just asnapshot taken from hundreds of available studies: * According to a Harvard Medical School study, 80 percent of hypertensive patients who meditated lowered their blood pressure and decreased medications, while 16 percent were able to discontinue using their medication. * Researchers at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago found that people with insomnia who meditated fifteen to twenty minutes twice daily for two months all reported improved sleep; in fact, most of them were able to reduce or eliminate sleeping medication. * Individuals who experienced chronic pain due to injury, surgery, arthritis, or fibromyalgia reduced their physician visits by 42 percent, and open-heart-surgery patients had fewer postoperative complications due to a regular practice of meditation, according to studies conducted at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. * Researchers at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles showed that patients were able to lower their blood sugar and insulin by practicing meditation. * The International Journal of Neuroscience reports that meditators who have been practicing for at least five years are physiologically twelve years younger than their nonmeditating counterparts. The reasons? Studies show that meditators lower their levels of cholesterol, blood sugar, inflammation, and the stress hormone cortisol—all of which are known to contribute to aging. * Studies done by Yale, Harvard, and Massachusetts General Hospital have shown that meditation increases gray matter in the brain and slows down certain kinds of brain deterioration. The Harvard experiment included twenty individuals with intensive Buddhist “insight meditation” training and fifteen who did not meditate. Brain scans revealed that those who meditated had an increased thickness of gray matter in parts of the brain that are responsible for attention. * Meditation helps to eliminate feelings of anxiety and anger. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, researchers at the University of Wisconsin looked at the brains of meditators and discovered that during meditation their amygdala (the part of the brain responsible for the fight-or-flight impulse) switches off, and the prefrontal cortex (the area of the brain responsible for feelings of peace, compassion, and happiness) lights up.Other studies show that meditation decreases depression, anxiety, and moodinessand boosts self-esteem, concentration, and relaxation. Mindfulness meditationmakes people happier. It can remind us of our purpose in life: to experience joyin the here and now.Neurofeedback (NFB) and Biofeedback (BFB)Turning down the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system and turningup the calming, parasympathetic branch may be difficult for those withlow-functioning PFCs or active amygdalas. Neurofeedback can help. Neurofeedback,also called neurotherapy or neurobiofeedback, is brain biofeedback treatmentthat is performed by a neurotherapist trained in the procedure, with the help ofan electroencephalograph (EEG). Neurofeedback allows an individual to controltheir brain wave patterns so that they can learn to generate more calm andfocused brain wave patterns, thereby improving mindfulness. Real-time braintracings from scalp sensors are used to teach self-regulation of brain function.For example, alpha waves in the brain are associated with a calm yet relaxedstate of mind, focused and optimally attentive. If an individual hasinsufficient alpha waves, neurofeedback can increase alpha wave activity, whichis linked to meditative states of mind.There are a number of different NFB approaches; if the approach or therapist youare trying doesn’t work for you, consider switching to another neurofeedbacktherapist or approach.Biofeedback is another way to help us reduce the burden of mental overload.Biofeedback is an approach that teaches individuals how to influence aspects oftheir autonomic nervous systems, such as muscle tension and blood pressure. Itreduces excessive arousal and is helpful for increasing calm. For thoseinterested in an at-home biofeedback approach, consider the Wild Divinebiofeedback system (www.wilddivine.com).James, our overwhelmed pastor, was a perfect candidate for the mindfulnessapproach. And he ultimately successfully used biofeedback and other mindfulnesspractices. But he had some intermediate steps he needed to take first.Like many of those who have a busy brain, by the time James came to see me forhelp, he had simply accumulated too much on his plate. In order to resume ahigher level of function, he was going to need to clear away some of the demandshe had piled on himself. As it stood, James was experiencing “decision fatigue,”which refers to the deteriorating quality of decisions people make when they areoverloaded. For example, evidence suggests that convicts up for parole are morelikely to be granted parole if their case is heard early in the morning ratherthan just before lunch, when parole board members are hungry and tired and maywell have lower blood glucose and “pooped-out” adrenal glands. Think of thebrain as an organ that requires fuel and replenishment. With constant demandsfor decisions, the brain becomes depleted of the resources necessary for optimalfunction. That was the state that James was in all the time.I explained to James my ideas about his being overwhelmed with decision fatigue.He thought about it and acknowledged the problem. James, people pleaser that hewas, hated to give up any of his responsibilities. He asked me to give him amedication to improve his overall function. I told him that no such medicationexisted. Rather, he needed to look at his lifestyle and his demands and see moreclearly how negatively the relationships he cared about were affected.James was willing to consider my points. During several months of exploration,we discussed all the factors that contributed to his people pleasing and takingon too many responsibilities. James recognized that he would have to reduce hiscommitments and demands; this was associated with much grief on his part. Hehated giving up anything he was doing. But he had to. James saw that althoughpeople and relationships were of paramount importance, he would not be able todo justice to these relationships. He was there, but he wasn’t. He wasn’tpresent in a mindful sense.With regret, James decided to resign from the school board, stop his a cappellaparticipation, and speak with the church elders, who arranged for an associatepastor to be hired, one with special expertise in pastoral counseling. Thesechanges, which occurred over a two-month period, significantly reduced thedemands that James bore. James’s sleep improved, his GI problems remitted, andhe no longer had heart palpitations. More important was that James was able tobe present with those he cared about, because he experienced fewer competingdemands for his time, energy, and attention.James’s story underscores the reality that the brain is an organ that, like anyother in the body, can become overtaxed by demands. James had gotten himselfinto a situation in which ever-present demands wore him down. Simply instructinghim in mindfulness approaches would not have been sufficient. He needed to makereal-life changes to reduce his distractions. In making those real-life changes,however, James was also able to benefit from the practices of mindfulness: hewas better able to find quiet, to slow down, and ultimately to function lovinglyand be more present in his important relationships.Mindfulness and RelationshipsJames’s experience that mindfulness made him a better husband, father, friend,and pastor is not unique. Generally, mindfulness improves your relationship withyourself and with others. Attuning yourself to the present moment may enhancehealthy relationships. Evidence suggests that mindfulness may enhance romanticrelationships and the communication in these relationships.Research suggests that mindful individuals are less susceptible to the negativemood states of others, which obviously is useful in romantic relationships.Mindfulness seems to reduce emotional reactivity during conflict. Thus,mindfulness would seem to improve intimate relationships. The overall benefit ofmindfulness for relationships seems to be in the areas of empathy, emotionalbalance, and response flexibility. Moreover, mindful individuals likely do notflee as readily from relationship difficulties, for obvious reasons, increasingthe chances for successful relationships. They have more of an “approachmind-set,” rather than a mind-set of withdrawal.Mindful individuals are more present. When we are present, we are relaxed. Wedon’t feel stressed. We don’t feel pressure. We don’t feel bombarded by stimuli.Extraneous thoughts are reduced. We are open, not defended or defensive. We areable to focus and give our attention to the situation or individual. In the nextchapter, when we take a closer look at relationships, we will see that we aremuch more likely to be present when we are in what I call a horizontal (orequal) mode of relationships. In contrast, we cannot be present in a vertical(or unequal) relationship mode because danger, helplessness, and victimizationmake it impossible to attain the calm attunement, focused attention, and clearperspective that presence requires.When we are present with another, we resonate with them and are empathic. We aretranquil and seek truth. We trust. Presence suggests flexibility. The oppositeof flexibility—rigidity—makes truth and trust more difficult. Presence ismindfulness as applied to relationships. To apply a mindful approach to adifficult relationship, decide that you are not going to argue with the person.Don’t respond defensively. Interrupt your reflexive, self-justifying responses.Rather, when you experience tension in the interaction, take a few moments toreflect before responding. A few seconds is all you need. Get ahold of yourself.Be calm, centered. Don’t struggle to be in control of the experience. Instead,focus on first being aware of what is going on in your mind. Notice what you areexperiencing. What do you feel? What are you thinking? Does this reaction seemfamiliar to you? Perhaps your reaction is rooted more in another relationshipthan in the current one.Digital DistractionMindful living, as James discovered, is not easy in our age of never-ending,always-on, electronic information exchange, which Elkhonon Goldberg has referredto as “digital anarchy.” What does this information flow do to our brain, ourmind, our spirit, our body, our life? With technology available essentiallyeverywhere, all the time, some fear that we are becoming a society of droids. Weread that “digital dementia” is on the rise as young people increasingly rely ontechnology instead of their brains. My wife, who used to work in an elementaryschool library, often observed that her young students didn’t know how to use aphone book to search for phone numbers; they didn’t even seem to know thealphabet well enough to use a phone book. They used Google to find all neededinformation.With the Internet, many are expected to check work e-mail regularly on weekendsand holidays. Everyone is reachable. Anywhere. Anytime. The line between workand leisure is blurred, if there is even a line that remains at all. Can werelax and refuel in our always-connected world? Are we attention-exhausted? Doesthe assault of constant new information coming at us all the time put us into astate of chronic stress with an overactive fight-or-flight response? Humans werenot built to be “always on” every waking hour. Downtime and disconnection arecritical.More important is what these devices may be doing to our relationships. Howpresent are we with others if we are always thinking of checking our phones tosee the latest text, posting, or e-mail? A recent study has linked the use ofsocial media like Facebook to activity in an area of the brain called thenucleus accumbens. This brain area is involved with processing rewards in thebrain, such as food, money, and sex. It may be more than just words when we talkabout the Internet being addictive. I won’t even go into how pornography is adistraction and a potential addiction. Suffice it to say that twenty years ago,few of my patients talked about problems with sex addiction. Now it is a commoncomplaint, especially in men with weaker self-regulation due to ADHD and otherissues.Multitasking is likely better in those raised from birth with this technology,but are those immersed in the digital world losing the capacity to sit with anidea, to ponder it, to tolerate the uncertainty of not knowing?I notice that people fear being left out of the communications loop. An acronymcaptures this fear: FOMO—Fear of Missing Out. Being in the loop is one kind ofrelating, but what about mindfulness and presence? Although modern technologyallows ever-present connectivity, we wonder whether we’re becoming lonelier.Our modern world gives us many benefits. But we must always be clear about ourown personal goals. If being present in important relationships is one of yourgoals, digital distraction may often interfere. Being present with those we careabout is enhanced by less digitalness and more mindfulness.Given our ever-present digital distraction, it may seem as if the modern worldconspires against us to derail our centeredness and further excite our alreadybusy brains. In a way, I think the world really does work against our being atpeace. Texting, information overload, politics, advertising: all of these aremeant to influence us—usually for purposes that someone else has determined.Principles of Mindful Living1. ObservationWhen we practice mindfulness we pay purposeful attention. We focus on thepresent moment. And we attend to the unfolding of experience. We do sononjudgmentally. We have attitudes of curiosity and acceptance. We don’t judgeourselves for our thoughts, feelings, urges, and behavior. We try to get awayfrom the “shoulds” and “ought tos.” We observe. We try to notice our innerexperiences without reacting to them. We seek to be aware, to manifest theopposite of being on automatic pilot. We attend to our behavior and try to tunein to our state of being. Generally, mindfulness helps us attend to our thoughtsand experiences, while freeing us from the urge to immediately respond to them.We seek “reflective delay.” In terms of relationships, this means: Can you putyourself in the mind of the other person? What is their point of view? Get awayfrom those knee-jerk responses we all have. The goal is less reaction and morereflection.2. The Power of HowWestern societies, in contrast to Eastern cultures, are results-oriented. Weseem to act, rather than react. We focus on the goal, rather than the process.Focusing on the goal, although obviously necessary for achievement, moves usaway from the process, from the present. In contrast to The Power of Now, byEckhart Tolle, I like to emphasize “The Power of How.” How we do something isimportant. By this I mean: Do I act mindfully, with presence? Do I almost slamthe door shut without thinking, or do I gently close it, being aware of the doorand my muscles as I do so? Or do I type so fast because I am in a rush that Imake more typos than I would if I typed more slowly? How we shut the door or howwe type in a rush, really the “how” of any action, can be as important as theend result.Dedicate yourself to performing more mindfully whatever action you select. Stoprushing when you perform that activity. Close the door gently, almost as if thedoor were precious. Or walk down the hall more slowly, noticing how your bodymoves, what your muscles are doing; feel the contact of your feet with the flooras you walk. Be more present. Stop performing this action on automatic pilot.3. Finding QuietTry going to a quiet place and listen to the silence. Have you ever really heardwhat silence sounds like? How many of us are actually able to be still, to sitcalmly, to look inside, and to be clear on who we are and what we want? To bequiet inside and out? Garret Kramer calls the ability to attain this kind ofquiet stillpower, or “the clarity of mind to live with freedom and ease; theinner source of excellence; the opposite of willpower.” A mindful individual isa quieter individual. Such may be anathema to the brash American culture we areused to. It may be hard to escape the endless connectivity and buzz. Yet findingsilence and stillness is essential to mindfulness, to inner peace, to calming abusy brain. Increase your quiet time. You need to be alone and undisturbed. Turnoff your electronics. No TV, computer, phone, or other distractions. Just be.4. Slowing DownSlowing down oneself and the mind undergirds many aspects of mindfulness. Whenwe live in the moment, we live and work with deliberate slowness. When you workwith deliberate slowness, at a pace that allows you to pay attention to what youare doing, there is no impatience. You focus more on the moment.Making movements as small and as efficient as possible also helps. As a youngguitar player, it was always my goal to play fast, like my rock idols. However,I soon learned that the only way to learn to play fast was to take smallsections of the music, maybe even one measure, and take the time and effort tolearn to play them slowly, but perfectly. Only if a guitarist can play somethingperfectly at a slow rate can he eventually learn to speed up the pace and playfast. There aren’t shortcuts, at least not for the guitar, and not for life.When it comes to meditation and engaging in other mindful pursuits, it isimportant to emphasize disciplining oneself to keeping things simple and movingslowly. In my own life I’ve focused on how I open a door by turning the knob (doI do it mindfully, or thoughtlessly by rushing?) or how I type (pounding on thekeyboard, or making slower, gentler finger movements?).5. BreathingMonitor your breathing. Make sure you are taking slow, calming breaths. Focus onyour breathing to help you maintain your observational stance. This is somethingI practice myself, because as a psychotherapist, it is important for me tomonitor and be aware—to be mindful—of what I am experiencing when I meet with apatient. I need to prevent my busy brain from taking over. I consciously try toslow down and not be swept away by the emotional force field that my patientgenerates. Monitoring my breathing anchors me, and I don’t lose myself in theflow of whatever is happening with my patient. As guitar teacher Jamie Andreassays, “The peace I feel as I take this breath is how I measure my success.”Breathing properly is something most individuals with busy brains must master.Practicing breathing, even just a few times each day, can make a difference.Breathing ExercisesBreathing is a way to cleanse ourselves from unhealthy emotional and physicalconditions and calm the busy brain. This concept is worth repeating becausebreathing is involuntary; most of us take it for granted—and we do it all wrong.In one year an average adult with bad breathing habits inhales about four tofive tons of oxygen, but only a thousand pounds of it are actually used; wedon’t get enough of the oxygen we need and we expel only half the carbon dioxidewe should, and we end up robbing ourselves of energy.This high level of carbon dioxide in the blood can cause the body’sfight-or-flight mechanism to kick in. On the other hand, when we breathe freelyand deeply, the diaphragm, belly, and chest undulate with the rhythm of eachbreath, and the whole body is energized with oxygen. Watch a young child or ananimal breathe and observe how the body moves when the breathing is natural andrelaxed. As adults, most of us have lost this knack. We breathe shallowly. Wedon’t make full use of our diaphragms.Muscular tension that has evolved over years of poor posture contributes to ourshallow breathing, although sedentary work postures and restrictive clothingcontribute as well. But we may also unconsciously restrict our breathing as away of suppressing painful emotions, because the depth of our breathing is alsorelated to the richness and intensity of our feelings. In the process ofdistancing ourselves from feelings of sadness, anger, or fear, we also block thefree flow of purifying energy in the body and diminish our capacity forpleasure.The following exercises will help you to relax and cleanse your system. Withpractice you may be able to change your negative breathing patterns, gainvitality, and achieve a calmer state of mind. * For full breathing, lie on the floor, resting your hands on the sides of your rib cage just above the waist, and exhale completely. Inhale slowly through the nose, letting your abdomen rise as much as possible for five seconds, expanding and filling your rib cage. Hold for five seconds. Now slowly exhale through the mouth for ten seconds, expelling all the air from your chest down to your abdomen. * Or, lie on your back with your upper body propped up on a pillow at about a thirty-degree angle. Place a book on your stomach, watching the book rise and fall, to make sure you’re breathing with your abdomen and not just your chest. Focus your attention on your nostrils and gently inhale, concentrating on the feeling of taking air in through your nose. Next, gently exhale, and completely relax one group of muscles (shoulders, arms, legs), letting them go limp and heavy. Once you’ve exhaled fully, breathe in again, continue the process, and switch muscle groups for eight to ten minutes. Try this exercise once a day for optimum effects.6. Mindfulness MeditationThere’s an old Zen saying: You should sit in meditation for twenty minutes aday, unless you’re too busy; then you should sit for an hour. Mindfulnessmeditation is a practice of concentrated focus on a sound, an object, thebreath, or attention itself, in order to increase awareness of the presentmoment. Studies show that it tames the runaway busy brain, increasingcreativity, pumping up energy and vitality, reducing muscle pain, loweringstress, boosting organizational skills, and contributing to mental and physicalflexibility.Although meditation has profound effects on our well-being, it doesn’t have tobe a complicated process. Advanced meditators may prefer to sit on a cushion ina lotus or half-lotus position and focus on their breathing or on a particularchakra (one of the seven centers of spiritual energy in the human body accordingto yoga philosophy).Mindfulness Meditation for BeginnersTry these basic steps: 1. Sit in a quiet, comfortable place on a straight-back chair or floor cushion. Relax your muscles; do not lie down. 2. Select a syllable, phrase, or word, such as one, peace, love, or om to focus on. 3. Close your eyes and follow the rhythm of your breath. 4. Repeat your chosen word, either silently or aloud, as you breathe in and out. If your mind wanders, don’t quit. Just let your thoughts go and refocus by repeating your chosen word. 5. Continue for ten to twenty minutes.When you finish, sit quietly for a minute or two—first with eyes closed, thenwith eyes open—and perhaps notice how differently you are experiencing yourbody, mind, and emotions.[../image/59906.jpg]ACTION PLAN[../image/59900.jpg]The following approaches will help you increase your presence, your mindfulness.It takes discipline to carve out the time to pursue these approaches. But theyare worth the effort, and you will reap the benefits as you make the followingmore and more a part of your daily life. * Mindful Meditation: Take fifteen to twenty minutes daily, first thing in the morning or later in the evening before going to bed. * Practice Breathing: Three times a day—midmorning, midafternoon, and early evening—take a few moments, say five minutes, and practice breathing. * The Power of How: Each week, select a different action that you tend to perform mindlessly and focus on slowing down, being minutely aware of how you perform that action. The action you select should be a simple one—closing a drawer in your kitchen or putting down your hairbrush on the counter in the bathroom. * Relationships: Each day, select one interaction with somebody—ideally an individual with whom you’ve experienced stress, tension, or anger—and practice interacting with them mindfully. * Digital Distraction: Make a conscious effort to turn off—or at least minimize—your electronic immersion: TV, radio, mobile phone, texting, Internet, Facebook."},{"pageContent":"[../image/64356.jpg]5[../image/64354.jpg]Righting RelationshipsMany of our most joyful and meaningful moments come about through ourrelationships with others. We gather at weddings and, with tears in our eyes,celebrate the joining of two people; we feel a moment of pure bliss holding ourchildren for the first time—and feel equal joy witnessing many of their anticsthereafter; we sneak off early from work to see the old friend who hasunexpectedly come to town and we revel in our shared memories over a good meal.Bonds with others add depth and great pleasure to our lives. And we are happierwhen we feel connected—to family, to friends, to colleagues, to our fellowcitizens.From a more basic point of view, one could even say that the lone individualdoes not exist in the world. Why? Because humans are social creatures. Eons ofevolution have woven social relations into the fabric of our beings. Asignificant part of brain function is dedicated to regulating our socialrelations. Throughout our lives we need others to help us feel safe, to beinterested in us, and to understand us. Good relationships can make us feelvalued, needed, and accepted. A sense of belonging to a community or groupincreases our well-being, diminishes anxiety, and even boosts our immunity.Connection to others can help soothe our stress and calm our busy brains. Weneed others to thrive.Social relationships are key to brain function, and the relationship goes bothways. That is, all things being equal, those with healthier and appropriatelybalanced brains are more likely to have good relationships; those with unhealthyand less well-balanced brains are more likely to have relationships that arepoor. Moreover, healthy relationships have a positive regulating effect on thebrain, calming brain activity and reducing the tendency to have a busy brain.And less healthy relationships exert a destructive impact on the brain, causinginner tension and turmoil and an increased risk of a busy, unbalanced brain. Itis no wonder that some say that the human brain cannot exist in isolation,underscoring the significant impact of relationships—for good and for ill—on thebrain.Starting at birth, the human brain is prepared to absorb and learn from contactwith caretakers. Even as we grow older, safe and healthy attachments to othershelp us develop our prefrontal cortex; brain growth is activated throughpositive interactions and relationships. We then are more likely to regulateourselves properly, control our impulses, understand others, maintain positiveexpectations, and use our intellectual endowment as a foundation to strive forand achieve appropriate goals and aspirations.By contrast, less healthy or unsafe relationships can be both physically andpsychologically destructive. Brain development is literally stunted; one’spsyche, one’s spirit, may be gravely damaged. When we are in an unhealthyrelationship, we feel the need to be on guard; the world seems like a dangerousplace. We have urges to protect ourselves or retreat. We are suspicious, ill atease; we may distort who we are and what we do. We may be hostile ormanipulative. The fight-or-flight system remains on high alert. Basic concernsfor safety predominate, rather than drives to grow, explore, and reach for ourgoals.Individuals in unhealthy relationships often experience not just psychologicalbut physical symptoms. They have a busy brain that is related to the stress ofthe unhealthy relationship. The lack of safety in the unhealthy relationshipcalls into action the sympathetic nervous system, which is always on guard incase of danger situations. The adrenal gland produces epinephrine and cortisolto help the body prepare for possible fight-or-flight responses. Arousalincreases, and the amygdala revs up. We feel stressed. We don’t focus andconcentrate as well. We are prone to multiple psychosomatic issues, such asirritable bowel problems, headaches, and skin eruptions. We don’t sleep well.We’re more on edge. Even in rather innocuous situations such as when a clerkrings up the wrong item at the grocery store, we overreact with irritation anddistrust.At their worst, unhealthy relationships can be controlling, emotionallyinvasive, and abusive. They are the opposite of the healthy social integrationdiscussed earlier. Rather than strengthen our confidence and ability toactualize ourselves, bad relationships erode those capabilities.In fact, the danger that we will erode our capabilities as much as strengthenthem is why, as fundamental as relationships are, we tackle them after we haveworked on some mastery of our inner states. As anyone who has gotten into ascreaming match with a colleague or a spouse knows, much of our ability tomanage our relationships depends on our own good impulse control. If we havegood impulse control, our actions and reactions are mediated by our PFC, whichallows us to regulate ourselves and calm our own limbic system first, a crucialstep in a high-conflict situation. Without that self-mastery of our innerstates, our ability to master our external relationships is that much moredifficult. We must first manage our own negativity, rewrite our stories, andwork on our mindfulness if we expect to succeed in attaining healthierrelationships.That said, that our brain is as plastic as it is—that we can, as discussedearlier, effectively change our self-narratives—should give us great hope thatwe can change our relationships. If we can rewrite our stories, we can alsoimprove our relationships. If we can regulate our minds and ourselves, we canbetter regulate our interactions with others.The first step, as in managing negativity, is to distance ourselves enough to beable to construct more accurate accounts of what our relationships are. Asdifficult as it is to construct full, truthful narratives of who we are,constructing accurate accounts of our relationships can be equally difficult.Getting perspective on ourselves is tough. Gaining perspective on ourselves plusothers can be even tougher. Yet lacking perspective on our relationships can becostly. Both parties contribute to unhealthy relationships. If we do notunderstand the relationships we are in, we may stick with adversarialrelationships and partners who harm our health rather than improve it.Distinguishing between healthy and unhealthy relationships is a skill many needhelp with.The Horizontal/Vertical Model of Relationships—How to Think About YourRelationshipsHow do we recognize an unhealthy relationship? Let me present a helpful model,one that will help you look at your own relationships and become clearer aboutwhat is going on.We all know what actors do. They play roles. A good actor can play differentkinds of roles. Well, we all play roles, too. There is a difference between theroles we play and those that actors play. When an actor takes on a role, it is aconscious and deliberate choice. The roles we play are less conscious, oftenoutside our awareness. In what follows, I’ll ask you to think of yourself as anactor, playing various roles, and to be more aware of the roles you assume.Interestingly, we can play different roles at different times, with differentpeople and in different situations. For example, although I am generally a mildperson, in the presence of a friend who is particularly passive I notice that mybehavior becomes strong. I am bold with him almost to the point of bullying. Idon’t like this part of myself, but something about my friend’s passivity seemsto evoke this strong reaction in me that can bring out some of my less desirablebehavior. And it is not just my friend’s passivity that is the issue; I am notblaming him. Rather, I am aware of certain aspects of my own psychology thatcontribute to my acting in this strong, almost bullying fashion. I’ll spare youthe details, but the key point is that I, like everybody, am capable of shiftingbetween playing roles that are weaker and those that are more powerful.The horizontal/vertical relationship model helps us think about these points.Imagine a barbell shape—two circles connected by a line. The two circlesrepresent you and another person. The connecting line represents yourrelationship. If the barbell is horizontal, the relationship is a safe one.There is openness and honesty. The relationship partners are equal. Therelationship is cooperative. There is no need to distort the other person, whois accepted as he or she is. Truth can exist in this relationship. Theserelationships grow and develop. Neither party dominates; there is a safeequality. There is a cooperative give-and-take of two subjectivities.Now consider when the barbell is vertical. This represents a hierarchicalrelationship, one in which there is a real or imagined power imbalance. Theparties are seen as unequal. One party is above the other and dominates theweaker party. A vertical relationship is adversarial and competitive. Think oftop and bottom, winner and loser. The roles are opposites. Top representswinning, dominating, controlling the bottom. Bottom is losing, dominated,submissive, controlled, and subordinate. Each category (top, bottom) defines theother.In a vertical relationship, it is difficult to break out of this adversarialpattern. The words that competitors use in a contest (top, bottom) are shaped bytheir need to eliminate truth—in an adversarial relationship, where competitionand struggle exist, opponents jostle for the upper hand. In a verticalrelationship, we behave like spies trying to outmanipulate one another, or likepoker players hiding the truth, the cards we’re holding, from the other players.It’s an adversarial, zero-sum game. If we don’t win, we lose. Language used invertical relationships is used not for the sake of truth but as propaganda,designed to mislead the other. We try to exploit others, to make them helplessby confusing them with lies and uncertainty.The adversarial vertical mode engenders danger, which often is unconscious. In avertical relationship, we behave as if the other is an enemy. The tendency isfor a black-and-white, fixed relationship. Our brain function regresses. Wedon’t use the PFC to manage nuance but to come up with schemes to protectourselves or trick the other, or at least to hide the truth. We regress to amore primitive, limbic system way of functioning—aggression, struggle, lying,self-protection. Our fight-or-flight system is activated because of the struggleinherent in vertical relationships, and a busy brain can be the result.Here are some examples of vertical relationships: The critical boss who alwayshas negative comments about your work, no matter what (critic/criticized). Thetelephone solicitor calling elderly people trying to get their bank accountnumbers to steal money from them (predator/prey). The charismatic—butemotionally and physically violent—male who manipulates his girlfriend intotaking the blame for all relationship problems, even when he hits her(victimizer/victim). The enmeshed mother who manipulates her adult childrenthrough guilt; “You’re breaking my heart,” she says, in response to theirnatural efforts at separating and defining their own lives, especially if theyfind a partner from a different race or religious tradition (guiltor/guilted).The television preacher who presents teachings and dogma in a black-and-whitefashion; he is pure and holy, and unbelievers are dirty sinners (pure/impure).Politicians who devalue their political opponents, not recognizing theiropponents as sincere human beings (idealized/devalued). We could come up withmore role patterns, but you get the point. Vertical relations involve a powerdifferential and an adversarial stance. Manipulation is always just beneath thesurface.Emotional Manipulation and Predatory OthersThe idealist in me wishes that emotional manipulation were not a fact of life.But the reality is that our interactions with others are intended to create acertain emotional state in the other person. Often this occurs partly or whollyout of awareness, for one or both of the parties.We must recognize that such manipulation is ever-present, in ourselves andothers. We try to influence one another because of the needs we have as socialcreatures. We are emotional manipulators. And we are all susceptible to theimpact of such manipulation.Why are we susceptible to emotional manipulation and abuse? Because we all havebasic human needs. And because we all have more primitive aspects to ourfunctioning: the reptilian and limbic brain areas that can make us experiencethe world in black-and-white terms. In part, we are attracted to others (andtheir influence and emotional manipulation) who seem to be able to give us whatwe lack. Cult members are likely attracted to their cult because it promises togive them what they feel they lack (belonging, esteem, self-actualization,etc.). We are strongly attracted to others who seem to offer us safety andcertainty. In a less problematic example, you may even idealize your mentors(they are all-powerful, know everything, have all the answers . . .) and devalueyourself. The world is complex, at times frightening, and can feel unbearable. Apied piper can come along, promising us fulfillment for all of our unmet needs,and we may find him irresistible and follow blindly.Lest I be presenting things too simplistically, let me take a moment tounderscore that relationships are always co-created. Each party, each actor,contributes to the evolving drama. Problems in early attachment relationshipscan predispose an individual to significant difficulties later in life,including major problems in relationships. If one has no history of solidrelationships, a healthy give-and-take—horizontal—relationship pattern is muchmore difficult to achieve. One will most likely have to overcorrect for stunteddevelopment of both brain and psyche, and a template of a safe, healthyrelationship must be created from scratch. No mean feat.Emotional abuse is an extreme example of vertical relationships. Humans can anddo prey on one another, emotionally and physically. Often, in modern,“civilized” society, human predators are well camouflaged, making ourrecognition of them problematic. Most of us are aware of emotionally abusiverelationships between a powerful partner and a dependent partner with fewerresources—emotional or financial. The dependent partner has low self-esteem,which is further attacked by the predatory, emotionally abusive partner whopasses up no opportunity to debase and further lower the dependent partner’spoor sense of self. Everything is the dependent partner’s fault. The abuserisolates him or her from others, further solidifying the abuser’s hold,strengthening the dependence, and deepening the vicious cycle. The victim of theabuser minimizes the problems and refuses to see the nature of the extremelyunhealthy relationship in which he or she is trapped.The cycle may not stop there. Emotionally trapped people may go on to manipulateothers to solidify their sense of control, which seems to have spiraled awayfrom them. Sera’s story below provides an illustration of how difficulties withearly attachment figures and the violation of a child’s innocence can jump-starta vicious cycle of unhealthy relationships.Sera’s Courage to HealSera was in her early thirties when she came to see me because of troubles atwork. Specifically, although she was bright and capable, her subordinates,especially male subordinates, experienced her as devaluing, harsh, andexcessively critical. She knew that behind her back, the men called her a“castrating bitch.” Sera could own that she contributed to troublesomeinteractions at work, but she did not understand why. Intelligent, with a quickwit and a sharp tongue, Sera, who was single, grew up in a third-world countrydominated by strong patriarchal and religious traditions that clearly put womenin second place. Longing to escape her native country, Sera studied hard, won ascholarship to attend university in the United Kingdom, and eventually made herway to the United States, where she worked for a think tank in Washington, D.C.The quality of her analytic and written work was superb; it was the difficultywith male subordinates that was the problem.In our initial meetings I could see, in her relationship with me, what sheenacted with her male subordinates. She could be critical with me, quicklydismissing what I had to say to her. I began to feel helpless and angry, but Iheld my tongue until I thought we had a strong enough relationship that I couldcall Sera’s attention to what she was enacting with me. I began to comment,gently at first, on the harshness of her comments toward me and the way sherejected nearly everything I had offered her.Sera eventually was able to acknowledge that there was something valid in what Iwas pointing out. She began to wonder why her first impulses were to attack meand reject anything I said.Soon thereafter, Sera told me that she had something horrible that had happenedto her during her childhood; she had never told anyone about it, other than herparents when she was a young girl, and they minimized and rejected what she toldthem. She told me that she didn’t know if she could trust me enough to tell me.Sera said that if she shared this horrible thing and I didn’t believe her orreact appropriately, she couldn’t bear it. She would have to break off ourtreatment.Sera worked up the courage to tell me what horrible thing had happened to her.What she told me was that she was sexually abused from ages five to eleven by aprominent older man from her village. He told her that he would kill her and herentire family if she breathed a word of the abuse to anyone; she had reason tobelieve him. Week after week, month after month, year after year, the abusecontinued, ceasing only when the perpetrator died suddenly of a heart attack.Sera, relieved, then worked up the courage to tell her family, but theycompletely rejected her story, saying that this respected man would never dosuch things. They told Sera that something was wrong with her for making up suchwild accusations.Devastated by her family’s rejection of her when she shared the abuse with them,from that moment on Sera never trusted another soul. She vowed to escape herfamily and her country, which she did through devotion to her studies, using herhigh intelligence and rage as motivation.Established in the United States, Sera started at the think tank. But there wasmore to the story. In the U.S., Sera began cruising bars to pick up men. Thiswas her pattern: Sit at the bar, alone; exchange glances with a man; and accepthis offer of a drink. Simple banter progressed to sharing of personal details.Soon, Sera indicated that she would be receptive to spending the night with thisman, and back to Sera’s condo they went. At the condo, there were more drinks,and they would move to Sera’s bedroom. Apparent romance continued, clothing wasremoved, and soon both parties were naked in Sera’s bed. Foreplay continued, theman was erect, and then it happened. Sera would sit up, turn on a light, look athis penis, and say, “You call that a penis? I’ve seen clitorises that are biggerthan that!” With that castrating comment, the man became deflated, literally andfiguratively. “Get out of here,” she’d shout. “Leave, and take your microdickwith you.” The man would grab his clothes and leave. The astonishing thing wasthat Sera, who enacted this drama with dozens of men, was never physicallyassaulted by any of them.Healing the HurtReading this drama, you may wonder, “What now?” What are the keys to healingsuch a deep hurt like Sera’s? What are the keys to healing your own deep hurt?Healing requires courage. It involves being able to acknowledge, bear, and putinto perspective the pain we have experienced. There is no growth, no healing,without pain. And we need courage to face our pain.We also need courage to begin to give up old patterns. As dysfunctional as theycan be, our old patterns worked for us in some ways. These patterns arosebecause they were the best we could do at the time. Beginning to give up old,unhealthy patterns throws us into a state in which we can feel defenseless. Forexample, as Sera contemplated what it would be like to give up her predatorypattern with men, she feared that she would revert to the position of a helplesschild, again threatened, taken advantage of, and exploited by all men. It wasdifficult to realize that there could be another way, a way of living and beingin which she would be neither predator nor victim.Sera’s RecoveryI helped Sera understand how she had turned the passive experience of being thevictim of childhood sexual assault into the active experience of being theperpetrator. I drew for her the diagrams of horizontal and verticalrelationships. She could understand more clearly that as a child she hadexperienced the passive, helpless, bottom side of a vertical relationship. Now,as an adult, she had been enacting the top part of the vertical relationship inher sexual drama and also, in more muted form, with her male subordinates atwork. I was also able to point out how earlier with me and to some extent evenup to this point, she symbolically castrated me by rejecting most of mycomments, making me experience a muted form of the helplessness she experiencedas a little girl.Having laid herself bare, having put all her pain and trauma on the table, so tospeak, Sera asked me, “What now?” I had some ideas, but I reflected Sera’squestion back to her: “What do you want now?” It was important for Sera to findsome answers within herself. And it was important that Sera find within herselfa wish for things to be different, a wish for change.Sera told me that she wasn’t sure that she wanted to change. Part of her did,but it seemed risky. Without her abrasive, attacking stance toward men, not tomention the sexual dramas that she acted out, she might feel helpless and mightbe destroyed by men. She wondered, though, could there be another way? Couldthere be a way in the middle, between predator and victim? Could she find thatwithin herself? Would she want to try?A psychotherapist is often tempted to help a patient by offering advice, urging,prodding, and the like, to help the person move toward more healthy and adaptivebehavior. At times it is useful for a therapist to do all these things. But thiswas not what Sera needed. What Sera needed from me at that point was someone whowas there for her, who cared, but who could allow her the space and time tostruggle, to find the truth about her own wishes and desires. In essence, I wasenacting a horizontal relationship with Sera, neither attempting to control hernor accepting her intermittent attempts to control and devalue me. Indeed,although we had reached the point of a trusting relationship that offered Serathe safety she needed, Sera still at times behaved toward me with her oldattacking and rejecting style. Because we had a good treatment relationship bythis point, I was able to point out to Sera those “There you go again” moments,and she could accept my interventions and analyze the motives behind herbehavior.Over a number of months, Sera and I were able to look at what she might want forherself in relationships toward men and women. What kind of life would she want?Sera, who really had not been close to anyone in her life, said that she thoughtshe would want a life partner, probably a husband. She wasn’t sure aboutchildren, given her own childhood experiences, but she might be willing toconsider children in the future.By this point in our treatment, I began to hear from Sera that her relationshiptoward men at work seemed to have changed. She had become more and more aware ofthe critical, devaluing, and indeed psychologically castrating behavior sheenacted toward men, and she wished to try to change. Her coworkers andsupervisor began to comment that Sera’s relationships with her male subordinateshad improved. They no longer dreaded working with her. She began to have morelighthearted moments at work and began to show an interest in the personal livesof her employees. All of this affected the work output of her unit, which showedincreased efficiency and improved quality of the written analyses that theyprovided.Words are the tools we use in a book, but words cannot easily convey all thenuances of Sera’s path toward healing. There was no quick fix. We workedtogether for months, going back and forth as she dared to make changes and stepahead, only to pull back, returning to her negative thoughts and stories. Buteventually she remained more often in a psychological posture in which she feltpositive about her capacity to have healthy, horizontal relationships withothers, especially men.Out of town for a conference, Sera met Steve, a man who did similar work foranother think tank. They met during a cocktail hour, seemed to hit it off, andSteve signaled his interest and definitely pursued her. Here was an opportunity.Could Sera find a new way of being with a man? Would she revert to the old wayswith Steve? Or would she flee from Steve, feeling unprotected if she dropped herprevious predatory stance? Sera felt scared but took some time and realized thatshe felt safe and secure enough to try a new way.Sera took things slowly with Steve. No quick sexual encounters, no castratingcomments about his penis. Rather, she took the time to get to know him. Shefound him to be outgoing, friendly, modest, and athletic. Steve was notacademically brilliant like Sera, but he was smart enough, and his social andemotional intelligence were good. He laughed easily, which Sera liked, neverfinding that easy herself. That Steve lived in another city seemed to help;there was less pressure to move things along quickly in the relationship. Theykept in touch by phone, Skype, and frequent texting for more than a year. Onceor twice a month, one would fly to the other’s city, where they spent a longweekend together. When winter came, they took a weeklong trip to the Caribbean,the longest time they’d spent together. It was a success, Sera told me.As Sera’s relationship with Steve continued to deepen, they discussed livingtogether. Eventually Steve decided to move to Washington, D.C. When Steverelocated and moved in with Sera, she felt panicked. What if this was a mistake?Maybe it was better to be alone and safe than to risk intimacy and beingcontrolled or controlling him. Although Sera had an upsurge of her old fears,she was able to use the tools she had acquired in our work together. Livingtogether was not a mistake. In fact, she enjoyed the additional closeness thatcohabitating brought to the couple. Their sex life continued to be gratifyingfor both; Sera never acted out with Steve the devaluing and castrating behaviorshe had with her previous conquests several years earlier. Two years after hemoved in, Steve proposed, and Sera and Steve married six months later.Sera and I stopped meeting regularly after the marriage, but I get a note fromher now and then. Things continue to go well, and she continues to expressgratitude for my help. Sera talks about being reborn through our work. As forme, I have silent gratitude for being able to participate in, witness, and learnfrom the struggles on the path toward healing of someone who was severelywounded as a child yet had the courage to face her fears and risk a better wayof living and being. Sera had changed from having a predominantly verticalrelationship style to a horizontal one, in which truth and intimacy abounded,without excessive control, predation, or victimization. A remarkabletransformation.The hurts we suffer early in life can be so severe that they can warp ourcapacity to have anywhere near a normal, healthy horizontal relationship. Thiswas the case for Sera, who was fortunate not to have been assaulted or killedduring her repetitive, compulsive reversal of passive to active in her sexualacting out.Development always involves a mixture of nature and nurture. Nature is what weare born with, which includes our physical, intellectual, and genetic endowment.Nurture refers to our life experiences, including the important relations wedevelop. Nurture can influence which aspects of our nature get expressed. Goodattachment relationships and nurturing can help us overcome even suboptimalnatural endowment. Less good nurturing and attachment relationships can cast adark shadow over the rest of our lives. The good news is that healing ispossible. Rewriting your stories and replacing vertical relationships withhorizontal ones—through self-reflection or psychotherapy—can help you overcomelocked-in brain-behavior patterns and improve your life.Hopefully you did not endure the deprivations and traumas that Sera experienced.Hers is an extreme case. I described Sera’s story in such detail to show howhealing occurs when early wounds are so severe. Insight-oriented psychotherapyor psychoanalysis can be important in helping severely wounded human beings healand grow, actually lifesaving at times. But not everybody needs intensivepsychotherapy. Many people can heal themselves and their relationships withoutthe aid of a therapist, especially if the wounds they carry from early life areless deep than Sera’s.Here are approaches to help you better understand your relationships, heal thehurt, make positive changes, and move from vertical to more horizontalrelationship patterns.Relationship AssessmentRecognize and understand the kinds of relationships you have. Be curious. Thinkin terms of vertical and horizontal relationships. You’ll naturally want tofocus on vertical relationships because they are the ones that give youproblems.Critic/CriticizedAre you a critic, constantly berating your young adult daughter, who seemshelpless? Or in your marriage, are you the criticized one, often feelingpowerless against your dominating spouse?Susan constantly berated her teen son Kyle. He didn’t study enough. He wastedhis time on video games. Kyle’s girlfriend wasn’t smart enough. Susan insultedKyle by saying that he must be a dummy himself to have such a stupid girlfriend.Susan wasn’t used to looking inside herself, to understand that she had absorbedher own father’s critical nature. She took her criticisms of Kyle as statementsof truth, not her own subjective interpretations. In reality, Kyle was much likeany teen, mature at some moments and less mature at others. Susan’s constantcriticism did nothing to help him develop into the confident, functional adultthat he needed to be.Susan, like many critics, justified her disrespect of Kyle by saying she thoughtthat her critiques were helpful to him. After all, he probably should studymore. What she needed to do, however, was to reassess her motivation for theconstant criticism. Was she criticizing to help him or because somehow she feltdisrespected by his inattention to her suggestions? Was she trying to help himimprove his behavior, or did she want to affix the blame on him and away fromherself for his failures? Could Susan look at it from Kyle’s point of view?Could Kyle look at it from Susan’s? Was there a real disagreement between them?If there is a genuine disagreement in approach, rather than blaming the otherperson (or merely accepting the blame if you are the criticized one), it’simportant to see the relationship as a two-way street. Disagreements naturallyarise in any relationship. They should be discussed in a way that therelationship and each party can grow and deepen.In a healthy relationship, both parties intrinsically respect and value theother. They talk out their differences. The fundamental relationship currency ina healthy, horizontal relationship—as opposed to vertical relationship—ishonesty.Parent/ChildThink about your early life experiences that contributed to your havingunhealthy, vertical relationship patterns. Were your parents overbearing, makingit difficult to find and develop your own strength? Did your father devalue you,calling you stupid, because your undiagnosed ADHD made it difficult to succeedin school? Were you a “parentified child,” forced to grow up too early, needingto reverse roles and parent your alcohol-abusing mother?Recognizing the roots of this unhealthy, vertical relationship pattern can helpus catch ourselves from repeating the same pattern in other relationships. Keepin mind that adults do not need to parent one another. In fact, a nonrescuingstance, a horizontal relationship pattern, is a much healthier way to live. Ifyou are someone who goes through life trying to rescue people, recognizing thiscan be a major step forward in permitting yourself to play the part of an equalrather than a parent. Stephan, one of my patients, assumed the adult role earlybecause he needed constantly to rescue his family from his father’s gamblingdisasters. For Stephan, acknowledging that he was always trying to rescue thepeople he cared about allowed him to make a major shift, liberating him from theunconscious prison in which he’d been jailed.Dominant/DominatedAre you troubled because you are always the dominant one in relationships? Oneof my patients, Cecily, was an extraordinarily successful entrepreneur. Shedrove her colleagues and employees to great heights of success. Cecily didn’twant to have to play the same role at home—yet her children and husband allseemed incompetent, virtually demanding that she be a hard-driving executive ofthe family, all the while rebelling against her efforts. Cecily wanted a morehorizontal relationship with her family, at least with her husband and olderteen children. Recognizing this pattern, she realized that the only person shecould try to change was herself. She closely monitored her behavior within thefamily, consciously deciding not to give too much, so that her husband andchildren needed to take on more of life’s responsibilities themselves. Pullingback from her previous do-everything-for-everybody-in-the-family stance,although not so easy to do, gradually helped her husband and children to beginto flower themselves as competent, responsible human beings.Note that complete equality in marriage is most often a mirage. And in fact,some researchers have found that marriages with one dominant partner are oftenmore stable and successful than marriages in which both partners refuse to evertake a subordinate role. Asymmetry can guarantee that decisions on everythingfrom where to go on vacation to what television program to watch are made withminimal conflict and upset. The key here, however, is that the dominant personis tolerant and respectful of his or her partner and that the dominant partner’sefforts are dedicated toward the welfare of the couple or of the other person.Abusive dominance should never be tolerated, in marriage or in otherrelationships. Signs of an abusive relationship include threats, intimidation,insults, and humiliation. If these occur regularly, the relationship is at leastan unhealthy one, if not unsafe.Victimizer/VictimOne of the most striking things about vertical relationship patterns is that ourbehavior can be strongly shaped by our experiences, and yet we may not be fullyaware of the roles we play or why we play them. This was the case for Jessica,who I would eventually learn was unconsciously caught up in her victimhood. Inan attempt to avoid victimization, she tried to keep everyone at arm’s length,resulting in a barren life.Jessica had trouble getting close to anybody. An engineer, forty-three,accomplished in her field but lonely, Jessica had no friends and no romanticinterests. On paper Jessica was a good catch. But we don’t live our life onpaper.Only with trepidation did Jessica come to see me for help; she’d heard from acoworker that I’d helped the coworker’s wife. Jessica wasn’t even sure what shewanted from me. All she knew was that she felt as if she were going through themotions. Although not really depressed or anxious, Jessica realized that herlife felt empty and she wanted something different.I met initially with Jessica for several sessions to begin to get to know her.What was remarkable was how barren our meetings were. Jessica, if not quiteboring, seemed almost robotic. She told me about her work, the projects, hersupervisor, her coworkers. But nobody ever came alive in her descriptions; theyall seemed like cogs in some big machine. When I commented to Jessica that I haddifficulty imaging the people she described, she said she often felt the sameway about the people in her life. This seemed like a good opportunity to lookmore at her intimate relationships, or lack of them. I learned that Jessicawasn’t dating anyone currently. She’d date from time to time, but there was nocloseness, no attachments. Out loud, I wondered why. Jessica said that shewondered too.Our curiosity resulted in Jessica’s telling me more about her mother, who wasdeceased. She had been a cranky woman, even bitter, miserable, complainingconstantly. I learned that when Jessica “misbehaved,” as punishment her motherput dead insects on Jessica’s pillow and shoved her face into the pillow. Ifound this difficult to believe, or maybe I didn’t want to believe that parentscould be so cruel with their children. Regardless, this story seemed legitimateand was one of numerous episodes of cruelty at the hands of her mother thatJessica recounted.As a child, Jessica tried to stay away from her mother. Often she wassuccessful, but not all the time. Jessica’s father, who traveled out of townoften for business, was rarely present to buffer Jessica’s mother’s cruelty.As Jessica grew older, she kept her mother at arm’s length, taking everyopportunity to stay away from her. Applying herself to her studies, she won afull scholarship to an engineering school hundreds of miles from home. Jessicafelt liberated by her college experience away from her mother and rarely visitedher parents.I was pleased that we seemed to be getting to the bottom of Jessica’s issues.She was able to acknowledge, bear, and put into perspective the challenges shefaced growing up in the clutches of her cruel mother. And she began tounderstand more clearly why she kept other people at a distance.It was at that point that something curious happened in our relationship:Jessica canceled three appointments in a row. Then she left a curt message aboutneeding to put her work with me on hold; she said that she would call me back atsome point in the future.I value the autonomy of my patients. Yet I also know from experience thatpatients often develop fears and flee therapy when things start getting “hot.” Icalled Jessica and we spoke briefly. I told Jessica that I wanted to respect herwishes but that I also suspected that something was going on between us that wasimportant to try to understand. I asked if she would be willing to return, atleast for a session or two, so we might think together about what was going on.Jessica told me she needed to give it some thought, which she did. The next day,Jessica called back, telling me that she would see me the following week at ourregular time.At her next appointment, Jessica told me that she had been having upsettingdreams, really nightmares. Anxiously, Jessica began to describe the nightmareshe’d been having for the previous few weeks. In the dream, Jessica enters aclassroom. She is the only one there; she waits for the instructor. Soon, theprofessor enters, and it turns out that the professor is a female cannibal.Jessica is horrified and runs from the classroom. She usually woke up after thisdream, heart pounding.I asked Jessica if she had any thoughts about the dream. As a psychoanalyst,I’ve helped patients analyze thousands of dreams over the years, and it isuseful to begin exploration of the dream with a simple open-ended question.Jessica said that being the only student in the classroom seemed connected tothe fact that she was the only child in her family. Indeed, a classroom insomeone’s dream could represent the learning situation a child faces in his orher family of origin. We talked about how Jessica might have felt as a childthat her mother wanted to devour her. In fact, in a broader sense, Jessica’smother was so overbearing that she seemed to want to consume her life.Psychotherapy can be a powerful relationship, in which old and new emotions andurges are re-created and become directed toward the therapist. I had an inklingthat there was more to the cannibal image in Jessica’s dream. Because Jessicahad more or less fled from our therapy, I decided to take a leap. “Any thoughtsabout ‘C Annibal’?” I asked. Jessica paused. “C Annibal, C Annibal,” she said.And then, suddenly, “Oh my God, ‘C Annibal’ means ‘see Annibali’!”With that realization, we were able to look at how Jessica’s relationship with amother who was likely disturbed and psychologically cannibalistic had warped herexpectations about all future relationships, including the relationship with me.She needed to keep away from everybody because she unconsciously expected themto try to make her a victim and consume her, much as she had experienced withher mother. She unconsciously felt she needed to flee from therapy—from me—tosave herself. Jessica could not imagine that she could have an independentexistence as a human being if she had a relationship with anyone else. Shethought that she could exist only as a separate individual apart from others.Jessica’s cannibal dream, to which we would often return, was the real openingfor Jessica’s healing and growth. Over the next few months we were able todeepen our understanding of what the cannibal theme meant to Jessica. Iexplained to Jessica that we can think about relationships in horizontal andvertical terms. Could she even begin to imagine having horizontal relationships,in which there would be honesty and openness, and neither party controlled ortook advantage of the other? This was difficult for Jessica to imagine. She hadnever before had a horizontal relationship. The only relationship pattern sheknew was the vertical one in which she tried to fend off being devoured by atroubled other person like her mother. Yet Jessica had courage, which I admired.Life had little zest for Jessica, little meaning, and no passion; she was justgoing through the motions, as she’d done all her life. She vowed to try tochange.Healing, change, and growth take time. But Jessica was able to continue intreatment with me, to acknowledge and put into perspective her fears of theall-consuming control of others. She was able to move beyond a reflexiveexpectation of being a victim in a relationship toward a position in which shecould accept and even be open to positive, mutually satisfying experiences withothers—horizontal relationships. Jessica started to do volunteer work teachingEnglish as a second language, which she found gratifying; helping yourself byhelping others is often a good strategy. While teaching in the program, Jessicamet the director, who was fresh off a nasty divorce. He was wounded butexperienced Jessica’s personality as naturally gentle and safe. They would go onto form a long-term, mutually satisfying romantic relationship.How might you recognize your tendency to play the unconscious role of a victim,like Jessica? Here are some indicators: * When around other individuals, you find that you can’t tap into your wants, needs, and values. You can’t find them within yourself. * Around other people, you can’t think clearly, as if your brain is partly frozen. * You have an urge to run away—literally or figuratively—when you are with other people.How can you stop being a victim? Try these suggestions: * If you find that you cannot tap into your wants, needs, and values, stop and reflect on what is happening. What is going on in the relationship that seems to be causing you to lose touch with important parts of yourself? See if you can identify subtle factors in the relationship that are closing you down. Is it a veiled threat? Intimidation? An ultimatum? Identify what the subtle communications are, get clearer on your contribution, and decide how and what you can change. * “Strike while the iron is cold.” Reflect on the relationship when you are not so caught up in the heat of the moment. What specifically is being asked of you in the relationship? How are you responding and possibly contributing to your experience of being a victim? I often say that there can be activity in passivity. For example, in being passive and excusing a partner’s emotional or physical abuse—“because of his work stress”—we enable the victimizing behavior toward us to continue. Take responsibility for your feelings and behavior; be open about what is not healthy for you in the relationship and how you need things to be different. * Identify events or relationships from the past that have shaped you and your victim role. Imagine that you could rewrite those events and relationships. How would you change the old script of victimhood into a healthier one? * Imagine and play out in your mind how you want to change your victimhood role. What kinds of limits can you set? How can you own and communicate your feelings? How can you respond differently to a situation that frustrates you or makes you angry? How can you use “I can” and “I will” statements to empower yourself or to stop being passive in a situation that requires you to step up and be more active? In twelve-step programs, they say, “Fake it till you make it.” That’s not a bad strategy as we seek to grow.Manipulator/ManipulatedKurt was a young but brilliant manager of a financial services firm. His keenlyhoned empathic understanding allowed him to manipulate others, almost withouttheir awareness. Overworked, underpaid employees would schedule a meeting todiscuss their work frustrations with Kurt, including being underpaid and wantingto request a raise. But Kurt was so perceptive and skilled at manipulation thatthe employee would leave the meeting without a raise but with increasedresponsibilities. They never saw it coming. Only the savviest individuals wereable to figure out afterward what Kurt had done to them so masterfully.In an unhealthy, vertical relationship, the other party is interested inthemselves, not you. They might even threaten you as leverage to get what theywant. The threats could be of harm to you physically or otherwise. Kurt, ofcourse, was so skillful at his manipulations that he never needed to utterthreats of any kind.The actions and behavior of others seem naturally to cause us to act in acertain way, sometimes because of our own psychological makeup. Think of thesaying “He brings out the worst in me.” If the other person is a manipulator, doyou too easily fall into the role of the manipulated? Once you have recognizedanother’s manipulations, you must recognize and claim the power within yourselfto reassert your own desires and interests.If someone in your life plays the role of manipulator, try these steps: 1. Create physical distance. Imagine holding out your hand and keeping the other at arm’s length. Perhaps even shout “Stop” to them in your play-acting scenario. 2. Assert your priorities. Once you have established imagined physical distance between the two of you, imagine asking the other person what they want. Then respond with your feelings about what they want and tell them what you want. Imagine another demand that they would make. “Stop” them. Give yourself some space. Then respond with what you desire in the pretend scenario. Remember, you have the right to say no, to assert your needs and desires, to be treated with respect, and to want something different in any given scenario. 3. Put the spotlight back on them. Practice asking the other person if what they are asking of you sounds reasonable or fair. Often forcing them to consider their own request will highlight its unreasonableness in a way that makes them back down or back off. 4. Learn to say no. Be polite but firm. Stand your ground.Remember that though some of this involves play-acting, just the practice ofarticulating what you want in a situation will empower you the next time thatsomeone tries to manipulate you into doing what is good for them rather thanwhat accords with your own values and priorities.It is important to maintain hope. People can change; you can change. Healing andgrowth are possible. Remember that change is rarely quick and healing takestime. Be gentle with your expectations of yourself. Find the goodness withinyourself and others and build on that. Keep in mind that good things come fromdifficult experiences, such as a more profound understanding of yourself and ofall human beings as illuminated by the efforts to improve your relationships. Byrerighting unhealthy relationships, you turn down your fight-or-flight alarms,calming your busy brain.[../image/59906.jpg]ACTION PLAN[../image/59900.jpg] * Think of yourself and the other person as actors in a play. Write down the roles you and the other party are playing. Are you the guilted child to the guilting mother? Are they the idealized to your more devalued self? How does the other person evoke that role in you? Remember that you can play both parts at different times, depending on the situation and the people with whom you are involved. You are shining a spotlight on each actor in the drama to clarify who is doing what to whom. And now that you’ve recognized the dynamic, what can you do to equalize it? * Think about what roles you would like to play in relationships. What would your behavior and life look like if you moved toward more horizontal relationships? * Evaluate your actions and motivations. What actions are taking place in the relationship? What are you doing? What is the other person doing? Think of the words that you and the other person speak as actions designed to do something. If I complain or praise, I am trying to affect the other person emotionally, regardless of whether my actions are a conscious decision. My words and the emotions attached to them are designed to create a certain emotional state in the other person. * Identify and assert your values. Defend yourself from manipulative others by being aware, monitoring yourself. Always remember that you have a choice. Determining what is for you in your life is probably the most important thing you can do. Know who you are; know what you want. Decide on and write down the values that are key in your life. A healthy relationship is one in which there are commonly shared values and beliefs. Reflect on your core values when you feel the gusts of other people’s emotional influence. If a relationship is consistently toxic, end it. We would never eat rotten food. Why should we absorb the toxicity of others if we have a choice? * Seek sounding boards. In less severe cases, turning toward a trusted friend or mentor can help you clarify what you need to do to improve a relationship, to turn one that is vertical into one that is more horizontal. In some cases, you might use your friend’s or mentor’s support or borrow their strength to bring an end to a toxic relationship. * Seek professional help, if needed. Sera had profound early traumas and severe disruptions in early attachment relationships. In cases of relationship difficulties rooted in such early problematic relationships with caregivers and other significant individuals, like Sera’s abuse, treatment with an experienced psychotherapist who understands how to create a safe place to bear, explore, understand, and master issues can make all the difference. * Maintain hope. People can change. Growth and healing are possible."},{"pageContent":"ADDRESSING SPECIFIC ISSUES"},{"pageContent":"[../image/64356.jpg]6[../image/64354.jpg]Bored Brains, Excitable Brains: ADHDJeremy was a bright student who worked hard and succeeded academically. He wasbored easily, but he loved to learn and had done exceptionally well at aprestigious university. As a result, Jeremy attained his dream of being acceptedto med school. He expected that medical studies would be an extension of thesmorgasbord of intellectual challenges he had experienced in college. But Jeremywas soon disappointed. Rather than learning information essential to patientcare, Jeremy had to memorize by rote an extraordinary amount of uninterestinginformation such as the number of proteins on the outer surface of a certainvirus. The memorization of more or less unimportant facts made Jeremy and hisbrain feel half asleep. He resorted to simultaneously listening to both thetelevision and the radio to remain awake enough and have sufficient attention tocommit to memory what he needed to for his exams. That Jeremy’s brain began tofall asleep when confronted with uninteresting information was an important signthat Jeremy had attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).Over more than a century, several different labels have been used to describeADHD. Years ago, the term was minimal brain dysfunction. After that it wascalled attention deficit disorder (ADD). Later, we used the label ADD for theinattentive subtype, and the label of ADHD for the subtype with hyperactivity.Now, officially, it’s all called ADHD, with ADHD subtypes for inattention,hyperactivity/impulsivity, and inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivitycombined. Confusing, I know.Using brain SPECT, we can even carve the ADHD pie into smaller slices, dependingon other aspects that can be present—such as overactivity in different areas ofthe limbic system, temporal lobe problems, and low cerebellar function.Interested readers should refer to the revised edition of Daniel Amen’s HealingADD for more information on ADHD subtypes. For the sake of our discussion here,I am going to focus on ADHD with inattentive features that may or may not beaccompanied by hyperactivity and impulsivity. ADHD is a legitimate braindisorder that results in problems with low stimulation and boredom. Because thePFC, or governing system of the brain, is impaired in ADHD, there is also oftendifficulty with executive functions or common forms of self-regulation,including focus, attention, concentration, goal-setting, planning, organization,and impulse control.Many people assume that individuals with ADHD have overactive brains. After all,people with ADHD often seem scattered; we hear them leaping from one topic tothe next in conversation or see them darting around the room rather thansettling in one place. Yet in many cases, the exact opposite is true. Manyindividuals with ADHD feel understimulated, even bored because the activity inthe front of their brains is too low. Think of Jeremy, frantically pumping upthe volume on his radio and television, all in order to stimulate his brainsufficiently to commit boring facts to memory. Brain SPECT imaging ofindividuals with ADHD typically shows low function in the prefrontal cortex—whatwe’ve called the governor or the CEO of the brain. Other brain areas can beaffected as well.What I’m about to say may surprise you. Even though these individuals have lowstimulation in the front of their brains, they can still have a busy brain. Howis that? Well, remember that when the PFC is understimulated, it is underactiveand less able to rein in the wild horses of the limbic system. And a busy brainresults precisely when the PFC and limbic system are imbalanced. Thus, wecommonly find that individuals like this do experience busy brains, because thelimbic system is poorly regulated by the PFC. Their governing systems areinadequately regulating the wild horses of emotions and impulses that have toomuch free rein.Some individuals with ADHD experience low PFC activity and understimulation toan extreme degree. Activities that would make most of us tremble withanxiety—such as motorcycle racing or skydiving—seem to calm these individuals,probably because these exciting activities boost the low activity in their PFC.For a man I knew who was an airplane wing walker, an extreme amount ofstimulation was required for him to feel calm and comfortable. Most of us wouldbe paralyzed by anxiety walking on the wing of an airplane midflight, but thisman, who normally experienced boring situations as remarkably intolerable, wasoptimally stimulated when engaging in his hobby. He stopped being distracted andbecame simply mindful, alert, and fully aware in the present moment. Why? youmight inquire. Well, the adrenaline pumped out by his adrenal glands boosted histypically very low-functioning PFC, so he felt calm and focused walking on wingsinstead of rattled by his normal state of intense boredom. To each his own, tobe sure. Some individuals, who are more “normal,” like my son Chris, areattracted to action movies containing high-speed car chases, combat scenes, andexplosions. Chris also loves roller coasters and other thrill rides. Thrillrides and action movies probably optimize for Chris what I suspect is mildunderactivity of his PFC.This is the important point I want to make: Many people with ADHD havedifficulty tolerating boredom, and many seek out experiences in which intensityor stimulation is high. Sometimes the stimulation is extreme. The wing walkerovercame his intolerable boredom by walking on the wings of an airplane inmidflight. But the stimulation can also be of a different order. Think of thosewho are “addicted” to their iPhones and other mobile devices, because theconstant pings alert them to new information; novelty stimulates and relievestheir boredom.Every moment of every day, whether awake or asleep, you are bombarded by sensoryinput that stimulates you—sometimes a little stimulation, sometimes a lot.Stimulation means anything that requires the brain and nervous system to payattention. In its simplest form, stimulation acts like a knock at the door. Whenwe hear a knock, we become mentally aroused no matter the outcome. The knockalerts us to a possible need for action. We might decide not to answer theknock, to first look out our peephole before answering, or to open the door tolet the person knocking enter. Regardless of our ultimate decision, we becomeactivated in response to the knock on the door. We need to pay attention to thestimulus of the knocking and decide what, if anything, to do about it.Stimuli can come from the environment (think of the iPhone), from inside ourbody (e.g., hunger, pain, and sexual urges), or our brain (e.g., thoughts,plans, goals, and memories). When stimuli are present, attention needs to paid.We call arousal the increase of attention and brain processing that stimulidemand.Many individuals with ADHD who could barely spend ten minutes doing boringactivities such as paying bills or doing their taxes can easily lose themselvesfor many consecutive hours playing exciting video games. The constant change andfeedback they receive by playing overcomes their boredom. The stimulation,novelty, and excitement gets them paying attention. Without it, they areapathetic, fatigued, or spacy. Some patients with ADHD even become bored intheir relationship with a romantic partner after several months; they break offthe relationship, not because it is a bad one but because they need a newrelationship, a new person, someone fresh, novel.Considering the need for novelty and stimulation, no wonder so many childrenwith ADHD have difficulty in school environments that are boring and repetitive.And no wonder so many adults have difficulty performing the routine aspects oftheir jobs, like completing expense reports. Taking a broad view, many of themundane but important tasks that we all need to accomplish in modern society arenot very interesting. Completing tax returns is a prime example. Many of myadult ADHD patients cannot or will not complete their taxes until the lastminute because the work is so uninteresting. The last-minute deadline of April15 provides just enough adrenaline to help them overcome their boredom andinertia. We see the same pattern in students with ADHD, who wait until the nightbefore to start their term paper or to study for the final.OverstimulationFor every individual like Jeremy—those who have problems withunderstimulation—there are individuals on the other end of the stimulationspectrum. Twenty-two-year-old Penelope and her mother, Lucinda, were barelyspeaking to each other when they first came to consult with me. Emotionally,Penelope took after her historian father; she was quiet and reserved andpreferred solitude over what she found to be superficial interactions with herpeers. Lucinda had a different emotional style altogether. She was intelligent,quick, and witty, and her outgoing personality and sociability had helped herachieve great things in the business world. Yet those same traits worked againsther attempts to connect with Penelope.Lucinda’s emotionality and her perceived intrusiveness pushed Penelope away. Themore Lucinda turned up the emotional volume, so to speak, the more Penelopewithdrew, trying to reduce the excessive stimulation caused by contact with hermother. It quickly became clear that Penelope couldn’t stand talking with hermother, not because Lucinda was a bad person but because Lucinda’s intensity sodestabilized her. Penelope said that her father seemed to know intuitively howmuch or how little to say, especially when it came to questions about herresearch in her Ph.D. program; her mother’s questions, on the other hand,visibly annoyed Penelope. Moreover, given Penelope’s extreme sensitivity,Lucinda’s questions made Penelope feel unpleasantly stimulated, reallybombarded. Lucinda, it seemed, simply couldn’t tune into Penelope’s sensitivityor wavelength.Penelope tried to withdraw from her mother to reduce her excessive stimulation,but the withdrawal resulted in Lucinda chasing her emotionally, which evolvedinto an unfortunate vicious cycle. Lest Penelope’s story be seen as yet anotherexample of unwarranted blaming of mothers, let me point out that Penelope wasexquisitely sensitive to being bombarded by everybody, not just her mother. Forexample, I had to watch what I said to Penelope, more so than with nearly everypatient, so easily did she become overstimulated and fragmented.Those of us like Penelope who need just a wee bit of stimulation to becomearoused and pay attention are often sensitive individuals who become overwhelmedwith more than the small amount of stimulation we need to pay attention. We arerarely bored, because we so often feel overactivated by stimuli, with ourfight-or-flight responses triggered excessively. When overstimulated, we feelflooded, excessively excited, anxious, irritated, or fearful. A busy brain parexcellence.Optimal StimulationPeople vary greatly in how much their nervous systems are aroused under similarsituations of stimulation. Each of us has a kind of set point, meaning how muchenvironmental stimulation we can optimally handle without feelingunderstimulated (bored) like Jeremy or overstimulated (overwhelmed) likePenelope.Most of us find ourselves between Penelope and the wing walker; we need amoderate amount of stimulation to be optimally aroused, to feel awake and alert,and to pay attention. Too little stimulation and we feel bored, underaroused,dull, drowsy, uninterested. We search for something to jazz us up, maybecaffeine. Too much stimulation and we feel distressed, overloaded, andoverwhelmed. The goal is to find the sweet spot. Attention levels are optimizedwhen our degree of mental arousal is just right. We are relaxed and our mindsare alert, but not overloaded. This often correlates with the state of flowdescribed by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi.Optimal states correlate with sufficient stimulation—but not too much—so thatyou are not flooded with adrenaline and other stress hormones. You feelmotivated, confident, and interested, and your capacity for attention gives youa clear mind that allows you to focus on whatever is necessary. Note that whatmay be too much stimulation for one person is too little for another. The goalis for each of us to become aware of our individual patterns with regard tostimulation and then to reclaim our state of optimal stimulation.Stimulation and TemperamentDevelopmental psychologist Jerome Kagan studied temperament, which means one’sinborn, biologically based arousal and behavior patterns. Kagan’s researchshowed that about 20 percent of infants reacted strongly to novel, unfamiliarstimuli. Interestingly, the infants in the high-reactivity group were mostlikely to become quiet teens who had serious, careful personalities. Infants inthe low-reactivity group tended to develop into relaxed and confident teens.In essence, what Kagan had found was how to predict in infancy who would becomean introvert and who would become an extrovert later in life. Introvert andextrovert are terms that Carl Jung had coined years earlier. Introverts arethought of as self-reflexive, bookish, sensitive and maybe thin-skinned, havinga strong conscience, dreamers with a vivid imagination, idealists, thoughtful,serious, calm, modest, shy and preferring solitude, and tending to avoid risk.Sensitive to the environment and overwhelmed easily, they tend to becontemplative individuals. Introverts react strongly to stimuli.Extroverts (sometimes written as extraverts) tend to be outgoing, social,talkative, excitable, lighthearted, assertive and even dominant, active,practical, realistic, and thick-skinned. They are people of action. They tend tobe risk takers who like or even crave the spotlight. Extroverts tend to beunderstimulated individuals who require greater amounts of stimuli than dointroverts to achieve their sweet spot of optimal stimulation.We now have a good idea about some genetic underpinnings of these arousaldifferences. The source of these differences is amygdala activity. Remember thatthe amygdala is a key center for detecting danger, responding to potentialdangers instantaneously but rather primitively. If while hiking you notice ashape that could be a snake, your amygdala causes you to jump back immediately.Only milliseconds later does your more nuanced prefrontal cortex recognize thatwhat you saw was not a dangerous snake but a stick; all is well. But if it hadbeen a snake, your amygdala reaction, which occurs reflexively andinstantaneously without thinking, might have saved you.The amygdala is overactive in the easily overstimulated group. Genetic studieshave correlated amygdala overactivity with the presence of the “short” versionof the serotonin transporter gene (in contrast to the “long” version); thepresence of the short version increases depression and overarousal in affectedindividuals. We can now understand how, with amygdala-based threat detection onhigh, genetically prone individuals become more overstimulated and highlystressed than others in new situations.Think about people you know. Some love and even crave new situations, events,and experiences. Others prefer the same old thing, day after day. What we arediscussing is a biologically based attitude toward novelty, mediated by amygdalareactivity. A highly reactive amygdala will keep you on edge, on guard,chronically overstimulated. You will tend to avoid novelty. An amygdala with lowreactivity doesn’t keep sending up warning alarms; if anything, the individualinstead is likely to be understimulated. An understimulated individual will tendto seek out new and exciting activities to increase brain activity. Maybe thisindividual would try their hand at wing walking. Or rock climbing with nothingbut their bare hands and feet. Or skydiving.Stimulus tolerance, as determined by amygdala activity level, can affect aperson’s choice of profession. Highly reactive individuals from educatedbackgrounds often select intellectual professions in which they are incharge—such as teachers, writers, artists, scientists, and thinkers. They canclose the door, manage external stimulation, and get to work. Novelty for them,if explored in an intellectual pursuit, is encountered in a controlled fashion,more or less on their terms. Highly reactive individuals from less formallyeducated backgrounds may become file clerks or truck drivers for the samereasons.Please keep in mind that I am painting with a broad brush. Not everyoverstimulated or understimulated individual has all of these traits. Someindividuals have combinations of features of both overstimulation andunderstimulation. With optimal nurturing early in life and fortunate lifeexperiences from which one can learn and grow, an overstimulated individual canblossom and learn to tolerate greater stimulation, and an understimulated personcan learn to become more quiet and contemplative. And somebody who is mildlyoverstimulated might become much more so in the face of significant stress orlife changes; the situation is likely vice versa for those who areunderstimulated.Optimal StatesHow can you know if you are in an optimal state—neither understimulated noroverstimulated? Remember that the optimal point will vary greatly from oneindividual to another, and probably from one day to another in the sameindividual. But consider the following.Someone who is optimally stimulated will feel relaxed, not tense or strained.They will be able to calmly accept interruptions and frustrations. An optimalstate can be easily maintained. One should feel interested, pleasantlychallenged. The individual is acting, not just reacting, in pursuit of cleargoals that they have defined for themselves.How can we begin to manage our stimulation? Here are steps you can take.Strategies to Increase Stimulation * Accepting: Your physiology is not defective, just different in that you require high stimulation and novelty.Phil, twenty-three, took a job following college graduation as a claimsprocessor for an insurance carrier. The problem: he found the work as boring aswork could possibly be. After six months, it was clear to his supervisors thathis performance was mediocre at best. He was given notice—“shape up or else.”That was when he came to me. I quickly realized that we were dealing with amisfit. Phil wasn’t the misfit, but there was a misfit between Phil, anaction-oriented, excitement-loving fellow, and his job. With encouragement, Philfound another job, as a kind of problem solver in an information technology (IT)department, where the unpredictability and frank crises were more than enough tohelp him achieve an optimal state. * Mentally Preparing: When you anticipate understimulating situations, plan ahead. What strategies could you use to “survive”?Phil did much better in his new position. However, even he had to endureperiodic “all hands” meetings that most everybody found dry and boring, if notpainful. No way to escape them. Phil planned ahead by deciding which seat toselect (in the back in order to be less conspicuous) and by bringing writtenmaterial to review to pass the time. * Increasing Stimulation: Notice your body state. How are you experiencing the low-stimulation situation? Notice your negative thoughts and stories. Multitask if bored (like Jeremy, although hopefully you won’t need to take it to such an extreme). Play upbeat, energetic music. Take frequent scheduled breaks. Munch on a healthy snack.One way that Phil coped during the “all hands” meetings was by taking multiplerestroom breaks so he could stretch his legs and pace off nervous energy.Munching on healthy snacks like apple slices or small carrot sticks also helpedand was acceptable behavior in meetings at his company. * Releasing the Tension of Boredom: Exercise vigorously or work on a challenging intellectual task.Phil found that an hour of mountain biking was enormously helpful. * Make Expectations Realistic: Be realistic. Don’t overexpect or overpromise. Say no appropriately.When he could, which wasn’t all the time, Phil tactfully bowed out of boringmeetings by offering a legitimate excuse about pressing work that needed to beattended to. That he was responsible for IT emergencies gave him plausible coverfor his excuses.Strategies for Reducing Stimulation * Accepting: Your physiology is different; not defective, just different.It took some time, but eventually Penelope could accept that she was notdefective, just more sensitive than most people. In fact, she could appreciatethe benefits of her heightened sensitivity, which helped her appreciate art,music, literature, and nature—but always on her terms, so that she would not beflooded with excessive stimulation. * Mentally Preparing: Because you easily become overloaded, plan beforehand how to try to overcome your discomfort in a potentially difficult situation.Penelope, who was in grad school when she consulted with me, mentally preparedas best as she could for situations in which she would have been overstimulated.For example, if her study group was planning to meet for lunch or dinner in arestaurant, she gently tried to steer the restaurant choice to one that wasquieter than others. In the restaurant, she expressed her preference for a tableat the back of the room, which was less crowded, and she sat with her back tothe wall because she felt more grounded and less stimulated that way. * Managing Difficult Situations: Calm your breathing in difficult situations. Notice your body state; be in tune with your body. How overstimulated are you? What are your thoughts? What negative story are you telling yourself? Decide if you need to reduce your excessive stimuli. Focus on calming yourself and taking things one step at a time.By focusing on how and where Penelope experienced excessive stimuli in her body,and labeling it with self-talk (“I feel it in my neck. . . . I feel it in myjaw. . . . I feel it in my lungs”), she gained some distance from her excessivestimulation and calmed herself. * Recharging: Make sure you have adequate time to rest and recharge. You need downtime, alone time. Meditation can help. Use calming music. Take frequent breaks. Go outside. Walk.Penelope used walking outside while listening to calming music to greatadvantage. * Make Expectations Realistic: Don’t overschedule.Once Penelope could accept that she was just different, not defective, she couldmore easily decline meetings and events that were not essential and not feelinadequate or guilty. In this way, she reduced the depletion she experienced insocial situations.Advantages of Understimulation and ADHDLest we focus only on the negative, proneness to understimulation and ADHD canhave an upside. Individuals with these traits are often curious, adventurous,open to exploration, passionate, and good with people. They can excel in timesof challenge. Some claim that the United States may have more than its fairshare of individuals with ADHD. After all, many of us are descended fromancestors who took the bold step of leaving behind their original countries andcultures to forge a new life in a new land. These people would not have been asoverwhelmed as their peers by the challenges they faced emigrating. Rather, theymay have been more likely to be excitement-seeking individuals, revved up bychange and deadened by boring situations. In brief, such individuals would havebeen comfortable with high levels of stimulation, maybe even seeking it.Life Problems in ADHDIndividuals affected with ADHD, especially when it is untreated, often havedifficult lives, filled with learning struggles, speeding tickets, job failures,divorce, legal difficulties, substance abuse, and poor self-esteem. In fact,without adequate treatment, one-third of those with ADHD never finish highschool, half abuse drugs or alcohol, and three-quarters have significantrelationship problems. Some develop a pattern similar to post-traumatic stressdisorder (PTSD), due to living a life of chronic dysfunction. One issue thatrarely gets discussed: the problems that ADHD causes in the bedroom.Sexual Problems in ADHDTerry was a thirty-two-year-old woman with ADHD. She had a good job as a buyerfor a major department store chain. Always somewhat distracted, always a littleanxious because of her distractibility, she nonetheless did well in her workbecause the excitement of new fashion styles and the give-and-take with thebuyers at the major fashion houses revved up her understimulated PFC.Although she was in a stable marriage of four years to Stu, an outgoing dentist,Terry complained that she never enjoyed sex. She could not become sexuallyaroused. It wasn’t her husband; Terry had experienced problems in a number ofprevious relationships, too. Terry convincingly told me that she had no historyof sexual abuse or other sexual violations.We talked about her marriage. Terry was faithful, as was Stu. Their marriageseemed good, with mutual devotion, sharing of household responsibilities, andmutual caring. What I came to learn was that because of Terry’s ADHD, it wasimpossible for her to relax and focus on the pleasurable aspects of sex. It wasa classic busy-brain problem. Her underfocused brain was going here, there,everywhere, just not where she needed to be in the moment with Stu. Although itmay sound like a paradox, it’s not: her understimulated PFC led to her beingunderaroused sexually.I told Terry that medication for ADHD would boost the activity of herunderstimulated PFC, resulting in her greater ability to be more sensitive andreceptive to sexual arousal with Stu. Terry was afraid of medications; the fewprescription medications she’d taken in her life—for nonpsychiatricreasons—caused strong side effects. Terry asked about alternatives tomedication.What helped Terry was neurofeedback training, in which she was able to learn tocontrol her brain wave patterns so she could improve her baselineunderstimulated PFC. Twenty neurofeedback sessions with a trained neurotherapistmade a big difference, helping Terry learn to regulate her own brain wavepatterns and improve her ability to focus. Terry felt calmer and more focusedwhen doing less interesting tasks, even at work. During sexual encounters withStu she began to notice improved sexual arousal, but it still was not enough.Having benefited from neurofeedback, Terry was then able to use mindfulnesstechniques such as relaxation breathing to anchor herself in the present moment.The previous cacophony of thoughts in her brain during sex was quieted. She wasable to be present and could fully enjoy sex with Stu. And she noticed that herincreased ability to be present with Stu improved their intimacy outside thebedroom. Stu appreciatively commented on her improved presence with him.Causes of ADHDAlthough we understand much about what happens in the brain of an individualwith ADHD, the causes of ADHD are harder to pinpoint. There is not one cause forADHD but likely many, which can vary case by case. Some individuals with ADHDlikely have a developmental “lag” in which the prefrontal cortex matures severalyears later in those with ADHD than those without ADHD. Genetics play a role;there are increased rates of ADHD in biological relatives. For a child withADHD, at least one parent usually has ADHD, and often both. Some, though notall, children with ADHD are exquisitely sensitive to food additives, colorings,and preservatives. This is why some do better on the Feingold diet, whichemphasizes eliminating food additives from the diet. A number of children withADHD have what is called a “leaky gut,” a malfunctioning GI system likelyresulting from a less-than-optimal diet and antibiotic exposure. Diets low infish oil seem to increase ADHD in teens.Some children and adults with ADHD have low iron (as measured by a blood testfor ferritin) or low zinc levels. Sam was a married man in his forties who cameto see me with longstanding ADHD and low energy. Sam’s ADHD made him scatteredand disorganized. He never felt calm. Sam had a moderately good response to oneof the common stimulant medications, but we never seemed to hit the nail on thehead and get Sam to where he wanted to be. His low energy really never budged.Sam told me that he had yearly checkups with his primary care doctor, but Idecided to seize the bull by the horns and order my own lab work for Sam, whichrevealed low testosterone, low B12, and low iron. We then had targets we couldaim at to try to improve the function of Sam’s brain and body. DHEAsupplementation boosted Sam’s testosterone. Sublingual B12 increased thatvitamin, and iron pills increased his low iron. Ultimately, with theseadditions, we were able to get Sam close to 100 percent. Only by focusing onthese previously undetected hormonal and metabolic issues were we able to helpSam improve. Ultimately, he felt less scattered and disorganized. He becamecalmer and simultaneously more energetic. This is a good place to mention thatADHD for which a woman showed little evidence earlier in life may becomeunmasked during and after menopause, because declining estrogen productionindirectly reduces dopamine levels, thereby negatively affecting PFC function.Toxic exposure may play a role in bringing about ADHD in some. Maternal smokingduring gestation, elevated heavy metal levels (such as mercury, lead, andaluminum), pesticide exposure, and sensitivity to mold all seem to becontributing factors, at least in some individuals. Thyroid dysfunction canmimic ADHD. Tick-borne infections, such as Lyme disease and related conditions,can also be a factor. We need to check whether any child who snores and seems tohave ADHD is really having apparent symptoms of ADHD because of sleep apnea.Finally, using brain SPECT imaging, we can detect evidence of brain injurycaused by physical trauma that can mimic or contribute to ADHD issues.Treatment of ADHD * Diet: A gluten-free, dairy-free, sugar-free diet helps many. Avoid processed food. Eliminate artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives. High protein intake with low carbohydrates keeps blood sugar levels stable. Often, these diet changes need to be a family affair. * Substance Use: Minimize caffeine, which many use as self-medication to activate their low prefrontal cortex. Caffeine reduces blood flow to the brain and dehydrates. Don’t abruptly stop a high level of caffeine use—tapering is often needed to reduce caffeine withdrawal symptoms. Alcohol and marijuana, which are often used to calm a busy ADHD brain, should be minimized or avoided, because of their detrimental impact on brain function. * Exercise: Daily intense aerobic exercise is often essential for those with ADHD, especially those who are hyperactive, to burn off excess energy and help calm mental and physical hyperactivity. One of my patients with severe ADHD deteriorated significantly when he broke his ankle and could not continue his intense daily workout routine. Consider yoga, which has been found to help ADHD. * Sleep: Good sleep is essential. Mornings are often difficult for those with ADHD, in part because getting to sleep at night is typically a problem. Brain function is worse when we don’t sleep well. Attention to “sleep hygiene” and use of nutritional supplements and medication to assist with sleep can be essential. * ADHD Coaching: Coaching helps resolve the organizational issues that plague those with ADHD. Coaching for ADHD involves a collaborative relationship with a professional who understands how an ADHD brain works and who helps you address the specific challenges and opportunities that someone with ADHD faces. A coach is not a therapist; rather, they offer support, guidance, and accountability, so that things change and the individual with ADHD progresses. Coaches help individuals with ADHD learn new ways to solve problems and accomplish goals, moving life forward in important areas such as work, family life, relationships, health, education, talents, and interests. * Psychotherapy: Various kinds of counseling and talk therapy are useful to help individuals with ADHD to understand why they had the difficulties they had and to reframe their development. Marital and family therapy can improve the relationship issues that arise so commonly in ADHD. * Neurofeedback and Biofeedback: See the information in Chapter 4 (“Becoming Mindful”). * Accommodations for School and Work: Accommodations often help at work and school. School accommodations are often essential. Tutors can help parents get out of the toxic loop of struggling with their child over homework. * Parent Training: Parent training is often important. Parents need to be able to set clear limits and have clear structure. Family life often degenerates into a constant focus on negativity. Parents need to be able to focus on what their children do well so they can escape the constant spiral of negativity that is so common.Nutritional Supplements/Brain Boosters for ADHD * Multiple Vitamin: Use a daily high-quality vitamin and mineral supplement to help optimize brain function in ADHD. * Fish Oil: Fish oil is good to help heal injured brains, reduce overactivity, and minimize inflammation. Studies show that fish oil alone is helpful for ADHD. EPA and DHA are the two main omega-3 fatty acids that we want to boost by using fish oil. Children should take about 1,500 mg/day of the total of EPA and DHA. Adults should take about 3,000 mg/day of the total of EPA and DHA. Look on the label of your fish oil product to determine the amount of EPA and DHA each dose contains. * Cognitive Activators (to boost the front of the brain): * L-tyrosine: This amino acid shows some benefits, but they may be short-term. Take it on an empty stomach. Use 500 mg three times a day for three days, then 1,000 mg three times a day for three days, then increase if needed to 1,500 mg three times a day. * Ginkgo Biloba: I recommend 120 to 240 mg/day in the morning. Ginkgo can thin your blood, which is usually a good thing. Mention that you are using it if you are going to have surgery. * SAMe: SAMe is a compound found naturally in the body. It plays a major role in a number of important chemical reactions, including your body’s synthesis of chemical transmitters. Start with 200 to 400 mg twice daily on an empty stomach. Increase every few days as needed by 200 mg at each dose. The maximum total daily dosage is about 2,000 mg. Be careful if you have an underlying bipolar-type condition. * Phosphatidylserine (PS; to boost temporal lobes/learning/memory): Take 300 mg/day. Many PS products are derived from soy and may cause reactions in those sensitive to soy. * Supplements for Sleep: These include gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA; 750 to 1,500 mg), melatonin (0.5 to 10 mg), 5-HTP (50 to 200 mg), and L-theanine (100 to 200 mg or more).Medication Used for ADHD * Stimulants: Vyvanse, Adderall XR, Adderall, Concerta, Focalin, and others increase dopamine and boost function in the prefrontal cortex. They are often quite effective. Some teens and young adults abuse these. They have some side effects (insomnia, appetite suppression). With severe abuse, one could become psychotic. * Provigil/Nuvigil: These are used primarily for narcolepsy and fatigue in multiple sclerosis. They function somewhat like stimulants for patients with ADHD but are less effective. * Strattera (atomoxetine): This drug is effective in some cases. It has low abuse potential. In my experience, it is not very useful and often has side effects. * Wellbutrin (bupropion): Wellbutrin is a stimulating antidepressant of some usefulness, with limited abuse potential. * Desipramine: This older antidepressant is somewhat useful for ADHD. Children should have an electrocardiograph (EKG) before use because desipramine can affect heart rhythms, and we need to determine that a child’s heart is in good shape prior to taking the medication. * Amantadine: This drug is less effective than stimulants. * Blood Pressure Medications: * Tenex/Intuniv (guanfacine): These reduce brain overactivity and help with calming ADHD. They are not as useful as stimulants. They provide some benefit for sleep in ADHD. * Clonidine: This drug is useful for sleep and overall calming.[../image/59906.jpg]ACTION PLAN[../image/59900.jpg] * Stimulation Sweet Spot: Know your stimulation sweet spot and take steps to implement it. Plan ahead so that you can manage over- and understimulation as necessary. * Diet: Try a gluten-free, dairy-free, sugar-free diet with no food additives, no artificial colors, and no preservatives for one month. If you see improvement in ADHD symptoms, continue this diet if you can. Not everyone will benefit, but this dietary regimen is often helpful. Emphasize protein in your diet, including having several small snacks with protein during the day to keep blood sugar levels stable. * Sleep: Make sure that you get eight hours of sleep each night. Remove electronics from the bedroom. Use sleep aids like melatonin, 5-HTP, or Benadryl if necessary. * Exercise: Try to exercise daily for at least thirty minutes. * Electronics Diet: Minimize electronic distraction. Children and teens should not spend more than one half hour each day on video games. * Nutritional Supplements: Take a high-quality multivitamin and fish oil daily."},{"pageContent":"[../image/64356.jpg]7[../image/64354.jpg]Heart Matters: AnxietyDavid was a hardworking, decent man who came to me for help with anxiety andstress. Single and thirty-six, David was a rising star at a major bank. Hiscolleagues and superiors appreciated his attention to detail; in his line ofwork, overlooked details could result in financial disaster. A perfectionist,David naturally understood the importance of being detail-oriented and workedhard at his job yet experienced anxiety and stress because of the responsibilityplaced on his shoulders. A common story. Many of us find ourselves in similarsituations.David sometimes had difficulty falling asleep because his busy brain wouldn’tturn off. David coped at work by making sure to dot every i and cross every t.His hard work paid off and he was promoted to a senior position at the bank. Inhis new position, David needed to manage six subordinates, which added to hisstress. His previous coping mechanisms were not adequate; he couldn’t possiblymake sure that his six subordinates dotted all their i’s and crossed their t’s.Following his promotion, David’s insomnia worsened and he began to have panicattacks. He began dwelling on the financial catastrophes that would occur ifimportant financial information was missed. That was when he came to see me.When you are experiencing anxiety as David was, your body is chronically andexcessively aroused. Those with anxiety tend to predict the worst. They look tothe future with fear. They may be shy or startle easily. Worrying drains theirhappiness. Brain SPECT imaging of anxious people often reveals excessiveactivity in the basal ganglia—areas of the brain that correlate closely withanxiety, worry, fear, and panic attacks. We often say that an individual withanxiety has basal ganglia that have a high “idle,” almost like a car that idlestoo fast when it is not well tuned. In addition to overactivity in their basalganglia, those with anxiety often have excessive activity in the amygdala andfrequently low activity in their prefrontal cortex. The weaker PFC cannot reinin the wild horses of the basal ganglia and amygdala, which is why the personhas a busy brain.The Highly Sensitive PersonElaine Aron has studied the highly sensitive person (HSP), an easily overarousedand overwhelmed individual who is sensitive and often anxious. Aron believesthat evolution has favored the careful, reflective style that tends to accompanythe highly aroused individual, and not high arousal itself. If understimulatedand sometimes impulsive people like those with ADHD, whom we looked at in theprevious chapter, live by the mantra “Ready, Fire, Aim,” sensitive, reactive,easily overaroused HSP individuals have a strategy of observing carefully andreflecting before acting: “Look before you leap,” but probably even strongerthan that, more like “Think long and hard, explore all the angles, before youleap. And maybe don’t leap; perhaps take it a small step at a time.”When humankind functioned as nomadic hunter-gatherers, more impulsive,underaroused, action-oriented individuals probably were the first to find food.Once humans developed agriculture and began living in settlements, it is likelythat overaroused, more reserved, less action-oriented, less impulsiveindividuals would survive preferentially. Easily overaroused individuals wouldbe better able to detect and warn of potential danger, better monitor animalsand other humans, and more able to pass along cultural wisdom.A number of the strategies in Reclaim Your Brain assist HSP individuals withcalming their overstimulation, including the butterfly hug described shortly.Here are additional strategies that may be particularly helpful for HSPs: 1. Accept your feelings of being overwhelmed; don’t fight them. They, too, shall pass. 2. Rewrite your negative story of being flawed or defective because you become overwhelmed so easily. 3. Reframe your coping style as not lack of coping ability but rather a different way of coping. 4. Remind yourself of the good qualities that accompany being an HSP—such as sensitivity, feeling deeply, being empathic, understanding others, and being sensitive to art. 5. Get enough rest so you can recharge effectively after being particularly overstimulated.Anxiety isn’t all bad. Anxious individuals tend to be more sensitive, which canaid in developing relationships. Anxiety drives us to keep our children safe. Wemay anticipate problems better if we’re on the anxious side. And anxiety alertsand mobilizes us. Yet when it is too strong, too painful, we need to find a wayto deal with our anxiety. How can we manage anxiety when it’s severe? How can webetter regulate ourselves and aim for better harmony within?Though anxiety, like most of the issues we explore in this book, originates inour busy, unbalanced brain, one less remarked-on solution for anxiety lies inour hearts—specifically, in our heart rhythms. Optimizing our heart rhythm isone way to manage anxiety, control stress, and rein in our busy brains. Let’slook at how managing our heart rate helps us control emotions like anxiety.The Heart: More Than a PumpThe brain and autonomic nervous system affect the cardiovascular system,especially the heart. Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity causes the heartto beat faster, while activity of the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS)causes the heart to slow down. The SNS is like stepping on the accelerator. ThePNS is like stepping on the brake. This cardiac balance is delicate andimportant. While most people know that the brain influences the heart, what isless well-known is that the heart can affect the function of the brain and therest of the nervous system. Heart rhythm patterns directly affect the brain andthe mind, as we’ll see.Many older cultures and faith traditions have considered the heart to be thesource of positive emotions, including joy, compassion, and love. The Bibledescribes God’s creating a new heart for those seeking spiritual change. Somespeak of having God’s word written on their heart. In our everyday lives, mostof us have a sense that the heart is involved with our most profound positivefeelings. We experience these “heartfelt” emotions as being localized in ourchest, in the area of our heart.Yet around the sixteenth century, likely with the study of anatomy, the view ofthe heart as being the source of positive emotions began to change. Henceforth,the heart was to be considered only a pump, circulating blood. Have we lostsomething by viewing the heart as simply a pump? I think we have. The view ofthe heart as only a pump is likely mistaken; the innate sense most of us havethat the heart is involved with our positive emotions is correct. The heart canbe at the core of our being, if we know how to use it.The Heart and Our EmotionsResearch suggests that the heart plays a key role in regulating emotionalexperience. The heart has more than forty thousand neurons that sense, processinformation, regulate body physiology, and even remember—the equivalent ofalmost a little brain of its own, which can function more or less independentlyof the much larger brain in our head. The heart has the most extensive neuralconnections with the brain of any body organ. It also manufactures and secretesneurotransmitters like norepinephrine and hormones that can have widespreadeffects on the body, including oxytocin, the so-called bonding and love hormone.Some evidence suggests that oxytocin can have a calming effect. Thus, because ofits own “brain” and its secretion of hormones and neurotransmitters, the heartis in a unique position to regulate our emotional states. This is why we canrecruit the heart to help us manage our anxiety states.Heart rate variability (HRV) can be a key factor in helping us regulateourselves, so let’s take a closer look. Heart rate variability means thebeat-to-beat changes in heart rate that result from nerve signals sent back andforth between the heart and the brain. HRV patterns vary with emotional states.A “coherent” HRV pattern is a smooth sine wave, with gradual increases anddecreases in heart rate. The coherent HRV pattern results from synchronizedbrain and autonomic nervous system (ANS) function; coherent patterns reflect theaction of calming nervous system activity. We see a coherent HRV pattern withpositive emotions like joy, gratitude, love, and compassion. A coherent HRVstate is associated with calmness, emotional balance, and optimal alertness andresponsiveness, a state similar to that described as flow.Negative emotions, such as stress, anger, anxiety, and frustration, give rise tochaotic HRV patterns. Chaotic HRV patterns are jagged, not the smooth sine wavepattern we see with coherent patterns. This is an unhealthy pattern that has anegative impact on our overall physiology. During stress, anxiety, depression,anger, or even typical day-to-day worries, heart rate variability is chaotic,with a negative impact on brain function, including cognition and ability toregulate one’s emotions.Self-Regulation and the HeartHRV patterns not only reflect one’s emotional state, they also play a directrole in determining emotional experience. This is key. In other words, byfocusing on and being able to make our HRV more coherent, we reduce anxiety andincrease our positive emotions. Well-being is increased, with feelings of peaceand harmony. Our busy brains are calmed. Making shifts in HRV is calledHeartMath or Heart-Focused Breathing. We will look at how to do this in amoment.How to Increase Cardiac CoherenceWe can’t usually change the stressful world or the difficult people in ourlives, but by learning to better improve our physiology by improving cardiaccoherence, we are in a better position to master our inner being.Computer-assisted programs, such as those available through the HeartMathwebsite (www.heartmath.org), teach how to increase cardiac coherence. However,there are exercises one can do without using a computer that give the sameresult.Improving heart coherence draws on approaches from yoga, mindfulness, andrelaxation strategies. Here’s how to improve cardiac coherence withHeart-Focused Breathing. Remember David from the beginning of the chapter? Itaught David Heart-Focused Breathing, with good results. I’ve included hisapproach in italics. 1. Recognize that you are feeling stress from a troublesome situation. Take a mental time-out so you can put your thoughts and feelings on hold.David had no trouble at all recognizing that he was experiencing stress andanxiety. I asked him to find a quiet place and just let his feelings be. Don’tfight them. Don’t argue with them. Put them on hold, so to speak. 1. Start by taking two slow, deep breaths, each one about five seconds in and five seconds out. Continue breathing this way during the next steps. This approach to slow breathing activates the parasympathetic nervous system.David was glad to hear that there was a part of his nervous system that workedto calm him and that slow breathing could activate it. He was able to start withtwo slow, deep breaths, and to continue that way through the next steps. Justdoing this gave him a sense of control and he already felt a little better. 1. Shift your focus from the troubling feelings your busy brain is generating to the area around your heart. Continue breathing slowly, as if your breath is flowing in through your heart and out through your stomach.David was easily able to imagine his breath flowing in through his heart and outthrough his solar plexus. No problem there. 1. Think of a positive, pleasant, fun experience or time and put yourself back in that situation to try to reexperience how you felt then. It could be appreciation or caring for someone. Really try to feel the feeling, not just think about it.David easily came up with a number of positive situations. A particularlyspecial time came to mind—he was seven, and the family just got its first dog, awonderful pup named Max who was only eight or ten weeks old. Max was full oflife and ran and ran in the family’s backyard as he explored his new home. Maxseemed so free, and David felt almost then as Max felt. It was a wonderful time,and putting himself back in that situation, still breathing in and out slowly,filled David with warmth and love for Max. 1. Sincerely ask yourself what would be a better response to the difficult situation you’re in, one that would reduce your stress. Try to come up with a less stressful way of seeing the situation, even if you can’t yet feel it.David bathed in the delight of his experience of getting to know Max. “Whatwould be a better response to my needing to make sure that I don’t missimportant details than imagining that I’ll miss something and cause financialcatastrophe?” he asked himself. His question to himself was sincere. What cameto mind was this: “I usually don’t miss things. I have a knack for this work. Mynew position will help me grow as a manager. I might even find a way to be atpeace with needing to avoid overlooking important details. Maybe I’ll learnbetter ways to process the large volume of financial information I need tomaster. Maybe I’ll learn to ease up on my perfectionism, which is rather harsh.And anyway, nobody is perfect.” It seemed as if focusing on Max was able to giveDavid a greater perspective on the situation, one that reduced his stress. Hefelt free as a kid with Max. David seemed to again experience moments of freedomnow as an adult, even in the face of his stressful work demands. 1. Be open to what you come up with in response to the question you ask yourself in step 5. Notice any change in the way you think or feel about your difficult situation. Try to hold on to the new thoughts and feelings for as long as you can.As David continued to be open to the answer to his question in step 5, helaughed. It seemed ludicrous to be so worried about the financial details at thebank. “Life goes on, regardless,” he thought. His thoughts went next to Karen, ayoung woman he had been seeing. Their relationship was new but developingnicely. “Loving relationships, that’s what makes life worth living,” he thought.“Crunching financial numbers pales in comparison.”David achieved significant benefit the first time he used Heart-FocusedBreathing. As he used Heart-Focused Breathing in his appointments with me, andon his own, his stress and anxiety gradually—but significantly—declined. Heslept better. Plus, David came to realize that even before his promotion he wasdriving himself too hard. He especially appreciated that steps 5 and 6 seemed togive his heart, his intuition, a chance to speak to the rest of him about whatwas really important.Heart-Focused Breathing is similar to the approaches we’ve covered previously todeal with the busy brain. The key difference is that Heart-Focused Breathing isdirected more at balancing the nervous system than the brain. It focuses onchanging our emotions. What happens in the heart doesn’t stay in the heart butaffects what happens elsewhere in the body, including the emotional activity inthe brain. Heart-Focused Breathing improves cardiac coherence, reducing cardiacchaos, which positively affects the limbic centers in the brain, signaling thatone’s physiology is in working order. The net result is improved balance betweenthe sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Coherence increases innercalmness, but improving coherence is not meant primarily for relaxation. Cardiaccoherence improves our capacity to take appropriate action, because our bodyphysiology is more balanced. Thomas Merton wrote, “Happiness is not a matter ofintensity but of balance, order, rhythm and harmony.”Heart-Focused Breathing is not the only way to decrease anxiety, reduce stress,and calm a too-busy brain. Let’s turn now to some other techniques that canhelp.Butterfly HugThe butterfly hug technique was developed in Mexico to work with a group ofchildren following the trauma of a hurricane. It has since been used all overthe world to help increase the same positive feelings of “a safe place.”How to Do the Butterfly Hug 1. Cross your arms in front of you with your right hand on your left shoulder and your left hand on your right shoulder. 2. Close your eyes and envision a safe or calm place. 3. Slowly tap your hands alternately on each shoulder four to six times. 4. Open your eyes. 5. If the calm state increases, repeat the process.Butterfly hugs were especially helpful for Rachel, who experienced extreme panicattacks. By all accounts Rachel, twenty-four, had been a precocious child.Inquisitive, bright, musical, she seemed to have everything going for her. Butshe was having panic attacks, bad ones, including attacks that awakened her fromsleep. As happens often for those with panic disorder, Rachel became almosttotally homebound, unable to drive or even go out because she was afraid ofhaving a panic attack in a situation in which no help would be available. Andlike many people with panic problems, Rachel had significant chronic anxiety,likely biologically based and also related to her legitimate fear of havingattacks. Indeed, panic attacks can be frightening and overwhelming. During anattack, the person experiences significant shortness of breath, chest pain,dizziness, and nausea and can feel like they are going to die or go crazy.Notably, Rachel selected me as her psychiatrist because my office was locatedone block from her home. She could walk to my office in two minutes, and Rachelimagined that she could run back home quickly if she had an attack during ourappointment time.Medication (Zoloft) and cognitive behavioral therapy were effective in stoppingher panic attacks within three or four weeks. Rachel then worked to graduallyextend the boundaries of her life. After three months, she was back to going outand driving, except on the Beltway, which is a nightmare for everyone in theD.C. area. And she started going back to her work at a public interest lobbyingfirm; she had worked from home for six months because of her panic problems.One would think that all was well in the world for Rachel. She had improvedsignificantly. But Rachel believed that she was a defective individual becauseof her panic attacks. I had educated her on our understanding about how and whypanic attacks arise. An area of the brain, the locus coeruleus, functions likean anxiety thermostat. If too sensitive, as hers was, it fires too often,setting off an unwarranted alarm, causing the panic attacks. Rachel understoodmy explanations, but the belief that she was defective persisted nonetheless.This is not surprising. Panic attacks are really anxiety seizures. They arepowerful, overwhelming events. They come on suddenly, and the victim of a panicattack feels totally out of control.Thus, it was no wonder to me that Rachel continued to believe that she wasdefective, even though her panic attacks and generalized anxiety were gone. Thequestion was how to help Rachel get to the next level, a level at which thefundamental sense of defectiveness—which was not present prior to the onset ofpanic problems—could be addressed. What we are really talking about isself-control. Each of us needs to feel in control of ourselves, our bodies, ourexperiences. If we don’t have control, we fear that we will be strongly buffetedby any stray wind gust that life brings.What Rachel needed was a way to feel more in control of herself. That way turnedout to be simple—Rachel used the butterfly hug. She closed her eyes and crossedher arms and placed her hands on her shoulders. Rachel then imagined being backin the safest place she knew: on the lap of her grandfather, who had seemed hugeand strong to the little girl she had been. Rachel imagined being back in thatplace and time, protected by her grandfather’s love. As she imagined that, shetapped several times on her shoulders. Rachel could do this quickly and easilywhenever she needed to, to increase her sense of being safe and in control ofherself. After doing butterfly hugs many times a day for two weeks, Rachel hadcalmed her too-busy brain and reestablished the feeling of safety andself-control she had before her panic attacks started.Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulation (CES)An example of cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) is the Alpha-Stim device(www.alpha-stim.com). This device, about the size of a small mobile phone, runson a nine-volt battery. You attach two clips to your earlobes, through which thedevice passes a small current through your brain. Used for twenty to sixtyminutes daily, it is useful for anxiety, stress, depression, and insomnia. I’vetried an Alpha-Stim with benefit, as have family members and patients. Anapparently similar device, with which I am less familiar, is the Fisher WallaceStimulator (www.fisherwallace.com). Some of my patients have found it useful forthe same issues as an Alpha-Stim.Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a structured, short-term psychotherapydirected toward solving problems and modifying dysfunctional thinking andbehavior. Research and clinical experience show its usefulness for anxiety,depression, and other issues. CBT has much in common with therewriting-your-stories approach I’ve already presented. It has the advantage ofworking collaboratively with a therapist who helps structure the sessions andcan make sure that you thoroughly learn and follow the approach. To find atherapist with expertise in CBT, visit www.abct.org or search on the PsychologyToday website: http://therapists.psychologytoday.com.AcupunctureSome of my patients find acupuncture helpful for anxiety. My impression is thatit is useful for mild to moderate anxiety and excessive arousal.Essential OilsIncreasingly, my patients are turning to essential oils for calming, anxietyreduction, sleep, and other conditions. We’ve known for years that lavender iscalming. Essential oils go way beyond using lavender. An appeal of essentialoils is that these are natural products, derived from plant sources. One sourceof essential oils is found at http://do-essential-oils.com.Nutritional Supplements Useful for AnxietyMany individuals find nutritional supplements appealing because they are naturaland they are useful for calming an anxious, overaroused, busy brain.Jill, a sensitive teen, had school phobia. She had been out of school for twomonths when she came to me. The only thing that seemed to help Jill wasmarijuana, which she used daily with her parents’ consent because they knew thatJill’s anxiety was overwhelming. I knew that anxiety ran in Jill’s family; bothparents and a brother experienced severe anxiety. Jill’s parents also hadthyroid problems. I checked Jill’s labs, and she too had thyroid issues.Stabilizing her thyroid with medication reduced some of her anxiety aboutschool, but not enough. Only when I calmed Jill’s overactivity with magnesiumsupplements and the supplement GABA was she able to consider returning to schooland reducing her marijuana use. I then sent Jill to a counselor, who helpedprepare Jill for her return to school. Jill worried about what she would tellher classmates when they asked why she had missed school for two months. Jilland her therapist addressed Jill’s negative thoughts and developed strategies tohelp her deal with the difficulties she anticipated, such as explaining to herclassmates why she had missed school for so long. Eventually, Jill did return toschool without much difficulty and was able to stop using marijuana toself-medicate for her anxiety.Robert, thirty-nine years old, worked third shift in a busy machine shop. He hada busy brain, with racing thoughts, social anxiety, and difficulty approachingwomen because of his anxiety. Robert was lonely. Robert’s school historysuggested learning problems, and he remarked that his memory was not good. Evenwith me, Robert seemed to have difficulty finding the right words to expresswhat he wanted to say. Robert likely sustained a brain injury during an autoaccident at age eight in which he was thrown through the windshield, which couldexplain his learning, memory, and word-finding struggles.Robert had been strongly influenced by his mother, who was leery of medications;she insisted on natural remedies for herself and her family. Because of hismother’s attitude, Robert wanted natural healing approaches for himself. He readabout using L-theanine for anxiety and decided to try it himself. Starting with100 mg twice daily, Robert obtained a little relief. He increased the dose ofL-theanine to 200 mg three times each day, and an extra dose when needed foranxiety. His relief was about 60 percent. It was then that Robert decided to tryessential oils, which his mother had learned about from a neighbor. Usinglavender oil, Robert noticed a marked calming that he’d never experiencedbefore. With the combination of lavender oil and the nutritional supplementL-theanine, Robert’s social anxiety and his busy brain’s racing thoughts weremarkedly reduced; he found himself able for the first time to approach women andtalk. What Robert really appreciated about this approach was that he could be incontrol of what he used to reduce his anxiety and when he used it.After significantly mastering his anxiety, Robert next used the supplementsginkgo and phosphatidylserine (see Chapter 6 or the Appendix material forinformation about these supplements) to boost his brain function and to addressthe learning problems he had that seemed related to his auto accident at ageeight. In our meetings he did seem to have an improved memory and he didn’tstruggle so much to express himself. Once his brain functioned better, Robertcould then benefit from rewriting his stories, and he used mindfulnessapproaches such as meditation and even yoga to further reduce his anxiety andcalm his busy brain. He met a woman, started dating, and to my amazement evenreturned to school.Supplements That My Patients Have Found Effective for Anxiety * Fish Oil (Omega-3 Fatty Acids): Preliminary research suggests that omega-3 fatty acid levels may be lower in those with anxiety; to my knowledge, this has not yet been confirmed. Anecdotal evidence suggests that high doses of omega-3 fatty acids (8 to 10 grams daily) may help anxiety by calming excessive limbic system activity, reducing inflammation, and helping brains heal. Side effects can include bloating, loose stools, and “fish burp.” Individuals taking omega-3 supplements may also experience increased bruising and mildly prolonged bleeding times—it is a blood thinner, which is why cardiologists recommend it. Individuals using blood thinner medication can still take omega-3 supplements, but they should consult their physician prior to starting omega-3 supplements. I recommend obtaining a fish oil product that contains both EPA and DHA, the two omega-3 components that we want to boost. Aim for a more or less 3:2 ration of EPA:DHA. Add up how much EPA and DHA is in a capsule or a dose of the liquid concentrate. Take 3,000 mg/day of the total of EPA and DHA. * GABA: Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an amino acid that also functions in the brain as a neurotransmitter. It is reported to work in much the same way as do the antianxiety and anticonvulsant medications. GABA has a calming effect for people who struggle with anxiety, temper, and irritability. It reduces limbic system activity. GABA does not seem helpful for every patient, possibly because it is not always well absorbed and has difficulty crossing the blood-brain barrier. Side effects are few, it is safe, and doses can range anywhere from 100 to 5,000 mg/day, divided into two or three daily doses. The large dose range is likely due to variable absorption from one person to another. * Lemon Balm: Helpful for anxiety, lemon balm is an herb from the mint family. It has no significant side effects. The daily dose is 600 mg. * L-theanine: The active ingredient in green tea, L-theanine is an amino acid that promotes relaxation and sleep, reportedly by increasing alpha waves in the brain. The usual dose of L-theanine is 200 mg three or four times per day. You can take higher doses if you find it useful. There are no known adverse reactions. Keep some at your bedside to use in the early morning if you wake up too early. Metabolic Maintenance (http://www.metabolicmaintenance.com) is a good source for L-theanine. Pregnant women and nursing mothers should avoid L-theanine supplements. Children over age six can use L-theanine, but start with 100 mg twice daily. * Magnesium: Chronic stress depletes the body of magnesium. And some suggest that most Americans are magnesium deficient. Magnesium is a relaxing mineral that lowers anxiety, calms, and assists in obtaining the deep sleep needed for rest and restoration. I often recommend Tri-Mag 300 (by DaVinci Labs). Start with two capsules twice daily and increase the dose every day or two until your stools become loose. Then reduce the dose slightly. * Melatonin: Useful for mild to moderate insomnia associated with anxiety and possibly even anxiety and depression apart from insomnia. Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland deep in the brain. It is generally safe and easy to use. Occasionally there can be a “hangover” the next morning; other side effects can include headache or vivid dreams, but these occur rarely. Doses typically range from 0.5 to 10 mg taken thirty to sixty minutes before bedtime. Melatonin seems more useful for difficulty falling asleep than difficulty staying asleep. Those who have difficulty staying asleep should use a melatonin preparation that is formulated for extended release. * Passionflower: Approved in Germany for use in treating nervous restlessness, passionflower contains a compound that binds to benzodiazepine receptors. Preliminary studies suggest that it reduces anxiety. Side effects are minimal. The dosage is 90 mg/day. * St. John’s wort: Derived from a flowering herb named after St. John the Baptist, St. John’s wort may be the most potent of all the supplements for increasing brain serotonin and thereby calming mild to moderate anxiety and overarousal. It also is beneficial in depression. The starting dosage is 300 mg daily for children, 300 mg twice daily for teens, and 600 mg in the morning and 300 mg at night for adults. Sometimes the dose in adults is increased slowly to 1,800 mg daily. It is important that the preparation of St. John’s wort contain 0.3 percent hypericin, the active ingredient. Those taking St. John’s wort are more vulnerable to sunburn, so extra sun protection is needed. Other side effects can include nausea and loose stools. St. John’s wort can decrease the effectiveness of other medications, including birth control pills and blood thinners. It can bring on mania in individuals who have bipolar disorder.MedicationsLower medication doses are often needed in those with anxiety, especially whenmedication is started, because those with anxiety and overarousal can beexquisitely sensitive to medication side effects. Start with one-third toone-half of the typical doses that one would use for conditions other thananxiety. The following are some of the common medications used for anxiety: * Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs): Examples include Prozac, Zoloft, and Lexapro. The most common side effects are sexual, including lower sex drive and difficulty with sexual arousal and orgasm. Other side effects include nausea and headaches. We think of SSRIs as antidepressant medications, but they work equally well for anxiety. * Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs): Examples include Effexor, Pristiq, and Cymbalta. In addition to their usefulness for anxiety, they are also used for depression. Common side effects include difficulties with sexual function and gastrointestinal effects. Effexor can be difficult to stop because some people experience significant withdrawal symptoms. * Benzodiazepines: Examples include Xanax, Ativan, Klonopin, and Valium. Ideally, they are used only on a short-term basis. Physical dependence can develop when these medications are used regularly for a few weeks. Xanax, in particular, can cause “rebound” anxiety and insomnia when it wears off. Common side effects of the benzodiazepines include sedation and coordination problems. These medications also negatively affect memory. * Buspirone: I find buspirone (brand name BuSpar) to be useful in cases of mild anxiety when the individual has never used a benzodiazepine medication. Side effects are generally minimal. Unfortunately, the therapeutic benefit for anxiety is also minimal. * Beta Blockers: Beta blockers are medicines like propranolol (Inderal) that are used for public speaking and other instances of performance anxiety. Used primarily as blood pressure and cardiac medications, the beta blockers have few side effects because the doses we use for anxiety are usually lower than the doses used for blood pressure and heart problems. * Anticonvulsants/Mood Stabilizers: Neurontin, Lamictal, and Trileptal are the medications in this class that are used most commonly for anxiety. Neurontin probably has the most usefulness for anxiety among the medicines in the category. Its major side effect is sedation. Neurontin’s dose should be started low, often at 100 mg at bedtime, and increased slowly.[../image/59906.jpg]ACTION PLAN[../image/59900.jpg]With multiple options, you may wonder what to do to help your anxiety. Here iswhat I suggest: * Heart-Focused Breathing: Take a mental time-out at least twice each day and practice Heart-Focused Breathing. * Butterfly Hug: Use it at least three times each day, especially when you are feeling anxious or stressed. * Calming Nutritional Supplements: Try GABA, L-theanine, and magnesium, one at a time or together. They may be used daily if needed and tolerated for anxiety and stress. * Diet and Exercise: A high-protein, gluten-free, dairy-free, sugar-free diet is often helpful because blood sugar swings that contribute to anxiety are reduced. Caffeine contributes to anxiety, so minimize its use. Minimize alcohol and avoid drug use. Aerobic exercise is a sure anxiety reducer. Exercise every day and work up a sweat; your anxiety will be lower. * Obtain Professional Help: When these approaches are not enough, consult a professional to try CBT, biofeedback, neurofeedback, acupuncture, or medication."},{"pageContent":"[../image/64356.jpg]8[../image/64354.jpg]Mood Matters: DepressionJeanette came to me for help with depression. A single mother, age forty-five,she worked as a legislative assistant on Capitol Hill. Jeanette told me that shehad long-standing moderate depression, which had been present all her life. Shefunctioned well enough at work, where she was highly regarded. At home Jeanetteseemed to devote whatever free time she had to her two young daughters. She wasby all accounts a good mother.The problem was that Jeanette had no joy, no spark, no zest, no happiness. Shefelt as if she were going through the motions. Jeanette’s dark mood was alwaysthere, but she didn’t cry, didn’t take to her bed, and certainly had never beenso bad off that she couldn’t function. She was a trouper who, despite herdepression, bit the bullet, put her head down, and kept on going. Beforeconsulting me, Jeanette had tried to reduce her depression by optimizing herdiet, exercising, answering back her negative thoughts, and taking nutritionalsupplements. Unfortunately, the results were not what she had hoped for. Herdepression remained more or less unchanged.Jeanette was afraid of medication and wanted to be treated for her depressionwith psychotherapy. We began meeting weekly for psychotherapy. After a fewmonths, I noticed a curious pattern. Whenever I had to cancel our regularappointments for personal reasons, such as a professional meeting or my plannedvacation, Jeanette’s depression worsened, often significantly. For a week or twoafter my return she was really down in the dumps. We’d talk about it, but it wasdifficult for Jeanette to understand what was going on when I was absent. Aftersome months, she was able to articulate that it was something about my beingaway that was related to her flare-ups of depression. What Jeanette didn’tsuspect, but I began to, was that her worsening periods were related to herdifficulties forming attachments.As we’ve underscored, relationships are key for humans. We’re not like one of myfavorite animals, sea turtles, whose mothers dig a hole on the beach, deposithundreds of eggs, and then leave forever. That’s the extent of reptile maternalcare—building a good nest for the eggs. After that, baby turtles are on theirown. They must hatch and make their way immediately to the sea with no parentalassistance.Not so for us humans. Humans are born helpless and experience a long period ofcaring, learning, and growth with their parents, at least in optimalcircumstances. You will recall that I’ve underscored the importance of earlyattachment relationships in forming a healthy sense of self as well as allowingfor optimal brain development. To better understand the connection between earlyattachment relationships and depression in terms of what’s going on in thebrain, we must look at the thalamus.Early on we talked about the thalamus as one of the major components of thelimbic system, the other components being the anterior cingulate, the basalganglia, and the amygdala. The thalamus is located deep within the brain beneaththe cortex and serves a number of important functions. It is a relay station,collecting and sending information to the cortex. The thalamus is involved withbonding, appetite, sleep, pain conditions, and sexual desire. It colors youremotional mind and provides the filter through which you interpret lifeexperiences. The thalamus is thus key for attachment and bonding and moodregulation.As you may already be beginning to suspect, if the problem in depression is aproblem with what’s going on in the thalamus, and the thalamus is a keycomponent of the limbic system, then perhaps depression is related to yetanother imbalance between the PFC and the limbic system. You would be right.Excessive activity in the thalamus is often at the root of serious mooddisorders like depression, bipolar disorder, and even premenstrual problems. Wefeel and function better when the thalamus is at a lower level of activity.Individuals with mood disorders have a busy brain because the excessive activityin their thalamus cannot be checked or reined in adequately by the PFC.Note that I said the problem or brain imbalance is with excessive activity inthe thalamus, not underactivity. This is not a typo. Somewhatcounterintuitively, many forms of depression do not occur because our brains aregoing too slowly. Rather, it’s because our thalamus is going double time. We mayfeel like we are trudging through sludge when we’re depressed, but in unipolardepression, activity in the thalamus has speeded up. As with many busy-brainproblems and imbalances in the PFC–limbic system, the PFC has difficulty reiningin its limbic brethren.When we speak of overactivity of the thalamus in depression, we are usuallytalking about unipolar depression. A unipolar mood disorder is a mood disorderwith just one pole—depression. Bipolar mood disorder, by contrast, refers to twopoles—an individual experiences depression at some times and an elevated,irritable, or expansive mood (“mania” or “hypomania”) at other times.Depressions in a bipolar mood disorder outnumber periods of mood elevation bythree or four to one; that is, depressive periods are much more common.In unipolar depression, overactivity in the thalamus tends to be diffuse, orevenly spread out. In bipolar depression, thalamic activity is also increased.But—and here’s the kicker—in states of bipolar mood elevation or mania, theincreased activity in the thalamus tends to be “focal,” meaning localized to oneside of the thalamus, not throughout the whole thalamus. In addition, in statesof bipolar mood elevation, focal thalamic overactivity is typically accompaniedby excessive activity throughout the cerebral cortex. The whole brain is tooactive, which parallels the individual’s manic behavior—he or she is too active.Returning now to unipolar depression, I left out a piece of the puzzle. Thosewith depression also often have underactive prefrontal cortex function on theleft side. Remember that the left hemisphere tends to be more positive than theright side; lower activity on the left, in the prefrontal region, seems to allowthe more negative right side to dominate. So we might even view depression asthe prototype of the key brain imbalance I’ve been discussing in this book—thePFC is not functioning at full strength and cannot hold in check overactivelimbic (thalamic) activity.Considering the thalamus, why would depressed individuals have too muchactivity? We’ve just touched on one reason—their PFC is not functioning at fullstrength. Indeed, this corresponds with what we often see in individuals withADHD—they have an increased prevalence of depression as compared with thegeneral population. The PFC of an ADHD brain can’t always hold the wild horsesof the thalamus in check.Why else? Well, genetics can play a role. You may recall from the ADHD chapterthat the serotonin transporter gene comes in two forms: “short” and “long.” Theshort version of the serotonin transporter gene is associated with overarousal,serious depression, and PTSD. Why is the short version associated with theseproblems? Likely because it results in lower serotonin levels; serotonin is akey chemical transmitter. SSRI medications address depression and other problemsby increasing serotonin levels. Interestingly, having the short version of theserotonin transporter gene causes the thalamus to be enlarged, and treatmentwith antidepressant medication reduces the size of an enlarged thalamus.Another reason for an overactive thalamus can be early attachment difficulties.Previously, we saw that early attachment disruption caused excessive activity inthe brain and that affected individuals were more prone to later psychiatricdifficulties, which include depression. Remember that the thalamus is intimatelyinvolved with bonding and close relationships. It makes sense that depressioncould thus be both a result of difficulties in key relationships and a cause ofrelationship problems. With a malfunctioning thalamus, there would be less driveto connect to significant others, given the thalamus’s role in bonding.Recognizing the connection between an overactive thalamus, early attachmentdisruption, and depression, we now can put together the pieces of the puzzle ofJeanette’s depression, which worsened significantly each time she was separatedfrom me. She reacted each time almost as if she had lost me for good. I tried toexplore with Jeanette what developmental factors could have contributed to herstrong reactions to my absences. There were no significant overt traumas in herhistory. No physical abuse, no sexual abuse, no emotional abuse. Reading betweenthe lines, however, what I detected was a kind of benign neglect in herchildhood. Jeanette was raised in a wealthy, socially prominent family, the kindof family in which much of the child-rearing was performed by hiredhelp—nannies.You might wonder where Jeanette’s parents were in her story. Although Jeanette’smother did not work outside the home, her mother was not very involved inraising Jeanette or her siblings. Jeanette’s mother would show up now and thenand evince interest, but whatever maternal instincts she had were not verynurturing. Rather, Jeanette’s mother’s interests centered on managing thehousehold staff and coordinating social and charity events. Jeanette’s fatherwas not involved much in her early life, either; he was always occupied withrunning the large family business, and when he wasn’t working at the business heplayed golf. As a result, Jeanette was raised by nannies, some of whom were wellsuited for nurturing a child, others less so.Although Jeanette never could verbalize her developmental history in theseterms, I think what happened is that she lacked consistent nurturing when shewas young. Some of the nannies were warm and loving, but they didn’t stay. Someleft abruptly or were fired. Replacement nannies were not always suited to thetask of raising a young child. Childhood was a series of broken attachments andlosses for Jeanette. I even came to suspect that Jeanette’s parents may haveprematurely terminated some of the more loving nannies because of jealousy overtheir nurturing relationship with Jeanette; they were able to give to Jeannettewhat her parents could not give.Note that I began the previous paragraph with “Although Jeanette never couldverbalize her developmental history in these terms . . .” This is significant.Jeanette’s attachment disruptions were so early that she did not have languageto describe what happened then because it occurred so early in her life, beforeshe had a capacity to understand and use language. Jeanette really couldn’tdescribe why she became so depressed when I went away either. She knew that shebecame depressed, of course; she felt it. But she didn’t know why. This is anexample of enacting what she could not remember. It was only through theenactment with me that I could begin to develop a hypothesis about what wasgoing on.Jeanette and I continued to meet, week after week, month after month. Icontinued to try to explore with Jeanette what was occurring with her when shebecame depressed, but I never felt that we could make headway, at least notenough to bring her relief from both her chronic depression and the more severedepressive periods when I was absent.After about eighteen months of her more severe depressive periods repeating overand over when I went away, I suggested to Jeanette that she ought to reconsiderher initial rejection of medication for depression. I had in mind that an SSRImedication would likely help. Jeanette seemed to be suffering greatly, and Iwanted to relieve her suffering, and I suspected that using medication fordepression might help her make progress in psychotherapy. Eventually, Jeanetteagreed to try medication and we started Zoloft, an SSRI.Jeanette’s chronic depression gradually began to lift after she began takingZoloft. Imperceptibly at first, but more clearly after six weeks, it was as ifJeanette had had new life breathed into her. She smiled more, seemed to haveless of the emotional heaviness I had seen previously, and seemed moreoptimistic. The first time I needed to cancel appointments, about ten weeksafter she started Zoloft, Jeanette had a bit of a mood dip, but not nearly asdeep as before. After that, Jeanette had little negative emotional reaction tomy absences.In fact, we initially overshot the mark with Zoloft. It turned out that Jeanetteis sensitive to medication. I prescribed a normal dose of 50 mg for her. Whathappened was that Jeanette became emotionally numb. She didn’t feel sadness, butshe didn’t feel anything else either. A normal dose of Zoloft turned down herthalamus so much that she couldn’t feel anything. Once we realized this, we cutthe dose in half, to 25 mg. On that dose, she was able to experience a fullrange of feelings, including positive ones, but depression didn’t hang over her,as it had for most of her life.Psychotherapy proceeded better after Jeanette started Zoloft. We continuedmeeting weekly for a couple of months, and then we decided to put our regularmeetings on hold because she was doing so well, except for infrequent meetingsto make sure Jeanette’s medication continued to work effectively. Her Zoloftcontinued to be of great benefit to Jeanette, as illustrated by her lack of acrash when we stopped meeting regularly.From a brain systems point of view, what happened when Jeanette improved? Myhypothesis is that the optimal dose of Zoloft reduced Jeanette’s thalamicoveractivity but didn’t turn it down too much, as the inadvertent higher dosedid. She felt less bad emotionally and was less reactive. When we turned downher overactive thalamus, the approaches we used to strengthen PFCfunction—psychotherapy, rewriting her stories—had a better chance of beingsuccessful. Jeanette’s PFC was no longer outgunned by the thalamus, as it hadbeen before we started Zoloft.Jeanette’s case illustrates the complexities of depression. Why was shedepressed? Was it lack of consistent attachment and attunement early in life?Did she have a short version of the serotonin transporter gene? Were there otherfactors? We don’t have all the answers. Practically, it is clear that thefundamental intervention that turned things around for Jeanette was medication.Which is not to say that medication is the solution for everyone, but it can bean important part of treatment for those with serious depression. For bipolardisorder, treatment by a medical professional is typically essential. I list mypreferred treatment options for bipolar disorder in the medications section ofthis chapter.As much my aim in Reclaim Your Brain is to discuss steps you can take on yourown, I have written about Jeanette in detail because I want to underscore theimportance of psychotherapy and medication in healing depression for someindividuals for whom other strategies are not sufficiently effective. Ourcurrent knowledge of how the brain works—of how people work—remains incompleteand will likely continue that way for a long time to come. I must say, however,that the changes I have seen brought about by SSRI medications and otherantidepressants in some patients have been remarkable, far different from whatone reads and hears so often that these medications are no better than aplacebo. That does not accord with my experience. Because this point is soimportant, and so poorly understood, I have chosen to present the story ofJeanette to underscore for readers that one should strongly considerantidepressant medication when other approaches for moderate to severedepression are not sufficiently effective. Antidepressant medicine, when usedthoughtfully and appropriately, can make life worth living or even save lives.Depression’s Upside?The treatment of depression through antidepressants has many supporters in themedical community. Antidepressants also attract their fair share of controversy.Why does the prescription of drugs such as Zoloft cause so much controversy whenthey can be so effective? Some of this may have to do with depression’sfamiliarity.We psychiatrists call depression the “common cold of psychiatry,” because it iscommon, very common. Depression goes beyond mere sadness. Sadness is a state ofmild to moderate unhappiness. It is not an enduring state that colors most orall of life, as one would experience with a serious depressive episode.Depending on the situation, if you are sad, you can be capable of smiling andbeing happy. In contrast, if you have depression, you have difficulty beinghappy, because unhappiness pervades everything, as if you are looking throughdarkly colored glasses. Sadness and its relative, grief, both of which arerelated to life changes and loss, can merge into depression. On the other hand,we often find in cases of serious depression that there is no change or loss; inthese serious cases there is no easy answer to the question, “Why are youdepressed?” An individual with clinical depression, which means depression thatis severe enough to warrant professional help, experiences persistent feelingsof sadness and loss of interest in life’s usual satisfactions, among othersymptoms.Because depression is so common, many argue that it is too common for anautomatic reach for prescription meds. One concern is that we may be medicatingaway normality, trying to make everyone the same. As if there were apharmacological Big Brother. I don’t hold that view, but let’s considerpotential upsides of depression.Because depression is so widespread, it’s led some scientists to considerwhether depression might be beneficial to us. Paul W. Andrews, postdoctoralfellow at Virginia Commonwealth University, and J. Anderson Thomson, Jr., staffpsychiatrist at University of Virginia Student Health’s Counseling andPsychological Services, are researchers who have studied depression’sevolutionary upside. They propose that rumination, a negative mental loop commonin depression, is actually an evolved response to complex problems; its functionis to minimize distractions. That is, in depressive rumination we become stuckon dealing with the problem at hand, avoiding getting distracted by otherissues. Rumination, they found, not only reduces the desire to engage indistracting activities but also produces psychomotor changes (the relationshipbetween thinking and physical movement) that reduce exposure to unnecessarydistractions. Moreover, research suggests that depression may improve analyticthinking and persistence, qualities useful in complex tasks, by breaking downproblems into smaller components.Anecdotal evidence suggests that people with depression are more sensitive tothe needs of others. Thus, if you’re feeling blue, you are likely to be moreempathic and sensitive. Also, in some cases, those with depression are able totap into their emotional pain and use their feelings to create powerful artwork,profound literature, or heart-opening music. Indeed, my own observation is thatthose who are prone to depression are often sensitive individuals. Somephilosophers and psychotherapists believe that experiencing depression can helpus grow. “Sorrow is the vitamin of growth” is a quote from the late eminentpsychoanalyst Elvin Semrad, M.D.Finally, some posit that depression is an evolutionary strategy used to reducethe sense that one could be a threat to others. Energy, motivation, andemotional strength are all reduced. Moreover, if this hypothesis is true,depression could also be adaptive in eliciting help from others.Whether depression is an evolved response to everyday problems or not, we can becertain that it’s a painful disorder for those who experience it. Seasonal andcircadian rhythms provide some keys to strategies that may help lift depression.Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)Brenda, forty-three, a well-respected attorney, came to see me because she wasfrustrated about not being able to control her depression. A careful evaluationshowed that Brenda worsened significantly each fall and winter. She did functionduring the fall and winter, but life felt like a constant struggle. She isolatedherself, cried frequently, lost interest in her usual activities, and had lowenergy and low motivation. During these winter periods of low mood she slepttwelve to fourteen hours each day and ate too much. Because of her seasonalworsening, I questioned Brenda about her function during the spring and summer.It became clear that Brenda had elevated moods during these times. Why were hermoods so drastically different between winter and summer?That many individuals experience worsening of mood in fall and winter attests tothe human organism’s evolution in concert with our natural environment. Most—butnot all—people notice mood dips and worsening as the days become shorter andtemperatures become colder. When your energy, motivation, and mood dip too lowin fall and winter, you may well have SAD—seasonal affective (mood) disorder.Those with SAD are hypersensitive to changes in the natural light in fall andwinter, much more so than are most people. Moreover, research suggests thatindividuals with SAD have a distinctive relationship between light and alteredemotional responsiveness that individuals without SAD do not have. Finally, SADseems related to serotonin availability, with evidence of lower serotoninfunction in the thalamus like we often see in non-SAD cases of depression. Thus,although there are differences between SAD and non-SAD depression, there areimportant similarities.The treatment of choice for SAD is light treatment, which was pioneered byNorman Rosenthal, M.D. Light treatment mimics exposure to natural sunlight andartificially extends the solar day, resetting circadian clocks. That individualswith SAD often need to sleep too much, crave carbohydrates, and experiencefatigue suggests that fundamental circadian rhythms have been thrown off kilterin SAD, supporting the importance of interventions to regularize circadianrhythms for seasonal depression. These same strategies to regularize circadianrhythms are useful for treating bipolar disorder; in fact, a significantproportion of individuals with bipolar disorder have SAD. Finally, because manynonbipolar, non-SAD depressions involve unhealthy alterations in energyexpenditure, activity, sleep, and nutrition (so-called vegetative functions),interventions to normalize circadian patterns are helpful in these cases as welland likely ultimately have a downstream effect on thalamic overactivity.Mood stabilizer medication and light treatment during the fall and winter gaveBrenda great relief. I helped Brenda understand that she needed to carefullymanage her sleep and diet. With these treatment interventions, Brenda has donewell, without the typical worsening in the fall and winter she had in the past.Though people with SAD are almost always affected in fall and winter, I did haveone surprising case where the pattern was reversed. Neil, forty-one, anattorney, was the son of well-off parents. His father was a highly sought-afterpolitical consultant. Neil’s mother was a well-known actress, his brother was aprominent engineer, and his sister was a leader in the tech industry. They wereall bright and accomplished, including Neil. Unfortunately, this was a familywith a strong history of mood disorders. Neil’s mother, for example, experiencedrepeated bouts of disabling depression. One time she had to be hospitalized.Neil himself had significant mood fluctuations. Most of the time he had a lowmood, with no energy, no motivation, and hopelessness. Occasionally, Neilexperienced highs lasting from several days to a couple of weeks. During thesetimes, he had racing thoughts, thought he could solve fundamental worldproblems, didn’t need to sleep, and juggled several different women at the sametime. Neil rarely experienced a normal stable mood. His depressions were verydisabling. He’d lie on his couch for weeks at a time, not working, not bathing,rarely eating, and speaking with no one. Treatment with mood stabilizermedication and interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (discussed next)eventually helped Neil become much more stable. I educated Neil and his familyon the signs and symptoms of potential relapse—for Neil, disrupted sleep was akey indicator. Interestingly, Neil had reverse SAD; that is, he typically becamedepressed in the spring and summer and had mood elevations in the fall andwinter. To help Neil address his reverse SAD, I instructed him to avoid sunlightas much as possible, wear sunglasses when outside, and run his air conditionerat a low temperature all the time during the spring and summer. In essence, wewere trying to trick his body into thinking that spring and summer had notarrived. These unusual interventions were helpful for Neil and added to his moodstability.Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy for Mood IssuesInterpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT) was developed by Ellen Frank,Ph.D., at the University of Pittsburgh. IPSRT addresses the disruption incircadian rhythms found often in recurrent depression and bipolar disorder. Thegoal of IPSRT is to prevent new episodes of illness or to extend the duration oftime between episodes of illness. By focusing on medication nonadherence,stressful life events (especially relational issues), and disruptions in dailyroutines, IPSRT attempts to help individuals cope with a potentially lifelongpropensity to have mood disruptions. Altered daily rhythms and routines arelikewise related to mood problems. Dr. Frank found that addressing relationshipissues and maintaining regular daily rhythms in sleeping, waking, eating, andexercise help reduce relapses. In severe cases, IPSRT cannot replace medicationbut is a useful approach for individuals with mood disorders.Relationship issues are often related to a downward spiral into an episode of amood disorder, which is why IPSRT pays such close attention to them. Thechallenges to a relationship are great when one of the partners has mood issues,yet precisely because the relationship itself can negatively affect the mooddisorder, it’s important to confront those challenges head on and halt thenegative spiral before it spins out of control.Kathy, forty-eight, married with three children, was a competent IT specialistwho came to see me because she was frustrated about not being able to controlher moods. Kathy’s mood worsened significantly each fall and winter, when lifefelt like a constant struggle. She isolated herself, cried frequently, lostinterest in her usual activities, and had low energy and low motivation. Duringthese winter periods of low mood she slept twelve hours each day and ate toomuch. When her mood was low she gave her children less attention and wasirritable toward her husband, Ken, who tended to pull away in response. Isuggested to Kathy that she try a light box during fall and winter. She sat infront of the light box for a half hour each morning. Light treatment helpedimprove Kathy’s mood significantly, but we soon learned that their marriage hadbeen negatively affected by Kathy’s depression.Ten Suggestions to Improve Relationships When One of the Partners Has a MoodDisorder 1. Look at the people you spend time with. How do they make you feel? What are the interactions like? Do you feel buoyed up when you are with them? Do you feel dragged down? Take stock. When Kathy’s husband, Ken, looked at his relationship with Kathy, he recognized that he felt beaten down by her irritability toward him. Plus, her low energy and low motivation felt like a heavy weight around his neck, pulling him down. You need to begin to recognize and evaluate your own feelings before you can communicate to your partner. 2. Make sure you are clear yourself about what you want in the relationship and discuss those wants clearly with the person you care about. Ken wanted peace, without Kathy’s irritable attacks, and he wanted a wife who was present emotionally. Kathy wanted help at home and with their children. They were able to communicate these things to each other. 3. For troublesome relationships, recognize your contribution. Own your part. Commit to change. Ken owned that he withdrew from Kathy when she became cranky and irritable. Kathy owned that her irritability pushed Ken away and that her low energy and motivation were a drag on everybody in the family. 4. Tell the other person, specifically, what they are doing that is hurtful. Focus on their actions, not them. Ask them to change. If they can’t or won’t change, reduce your involvement or end the relationship. Kathy and Ken each were able to be clear with the other, without needing to reduce involvement or end the relationship. 5. To develop more positive relationships you may have to make changes to meet new people: take a class, do volunteer work, go to lunch with your coworkers, contact an old friend whom you’ve not spoken with recently, or try a new hobby. Kathy tended to withdraw from her friends during fall and winter depressions. With encouragement, she reconnected with friends with whom she had been out of contact. 6. Make your important relationships a priority. Do you spend adequate time together? This was a problem for Ken and Kathy due to their busy lives and Kathy’s withdrawal and isolation during her depression. They needed to commit to more time with each other. 7. Focus on the positive in relationships. Watch out for the creeping negativity that seems to be our default stance. It’s so easy to be negative and critical. It was easy for Kathy and Ken to be critical of each other. However, it wasn’t difficult for each to recognize positive traits in the other, like Kathy’s good mothering skills, or how Ken was good at keeping the family cars running well. 8. Encourage the personal growth of those who are important to you. Support them in new endeavors like career change, more education, or pursuing a hobby. Ken was interested in pursuing photography, and Kathy was able to support him in his new pursuit. 9. If your relationship is a sexually intimate one, make sure that you nurture that aspect of the relationship. It’s easy to get into a rut. With Kathy’s irritability, lower energy, and withdrawal during her depressed periods, sex fell by the wayside. Ken and Kathy needed to carve out time to rekindle their intimate relationship. 10. No matter what, always keep the lines of communication open.Relationships suffer when one of the parties has depression, but attention torelationships can help with healing. Helping someone who is depressed doesn’tonly have to be about the relationship.Suggestions for Helping a Depressed Loved One 1. Encourage your depressed loved one to get professional help, if needed. Seek therapy as a couple or family as appropriate. 2. Don’t tell your depressed partner that you understand. You may not understand. 3. Respond to your depressed partner as if they were recovering from a serious illness. They are. 4. Don’t take the depressed individual’s loss of interest in sex personally; it’s typical for depression. 5. If you have a depressed individual in your life, you need to make sure that you don’t end up beaten down. The nondepressed individual needs to focus on taking care of himself or herself. It’s your job to make you happy, not the depressed person’s. 6. Take a walk together with the depressed person. It’s time together, and exercise can improve mood.Recommendations for Mood, Sleep, and Circadian Rhythms * Sleep: Good-quality sleep is essential. This is true for all individuals, and even more true for those with a mood disorder. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. This helps keep your biological clock regular. Keep your bedroom temperature moderate. Minimize liquids in the evening. Avoid alcohol in the evening; it fragments sleep. Also avoid caffeine. Avoid naps during the day. Eliminate exposure to bright artificial light two hours before you go to bed. Make sure you are more than six feet away from the television if you watch before sleeping. If needed, take an over-the-counter supplement or medication. Ask your doctor for a sleeping medication, if necessary. * Light Exposure: Try to expose yourself to bright light outdoors between eight a.m. and noon; twenty to thirty minutes of morning light is enough. * Work: If possible, avoid shift work and select a workplace that provides exposure to natural light and a view of the outside. If your workplace does not have natural light, try to get outside for twenty to thirty minutes during daylight, mornings preferred. * Electronics in Bed: Avoid light-emitting devices in bed. * Light Boxes: A number of companies sell light boxes; some rent them. A light visor does the same job as a light box but can be more convenient. Start light treatments gradually; the box should be used first thing in the morning, for five minutes the first day, and then for periods of time increasing by five minutes a day, until a treatment period of thirty minutes is reached. A second treatment of fifteen to thirty minutes, usually no later than midafternoon, is often helpful. Late second doses of light therapy can cause insomnia. Light therapy is generally more effective the earlier in the day it is performed, so if you can do it at about six a.m., light treatment may be most helpful. In some cases, light treatment has made susceptible individuals hypomanic, causing mild mood elevation. When that occurs, reducing the duration of the light exposure is usually sufficient to remedy the light-induced hypomania. * Light Precautions for SAD: Besides light box treatment for SAD, here are recommendations that one might call “light precautions” for SAD: Increase your exposure to light as much as possible, go out for a walk at noon for up to an hour without sunglasses, and sleep with all the blinds up. * Light Treatment for Non-SAD Depression: Importantly, depressed individuals with non-SAD depression often respond well to light treatment. This intervention is often not considered, but should be more often. * Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT): Those with severe depression not responsive to other treatments should consider DBT (websites to check to find providers include www.dbt-therapists.com and www.dbtselfhelp.com). * IPSRT: If you have recurrent mood problems, investigate IPSRT (www.ipsrt.org). Working with your clinician on the principles of IPSRT can be of significant benefit.Nutritional Supplements for DepressionA number of nutritional supplements show promise for treatment of mild tomoderate depression. * Omega-3 fatty acids: The dose is at least 3,000 mg/day of the total of EPA and DHA. * SAMe: People who have bipolar disorder or manic depression need to be careful with SAMe, because it may cause unwanted mood elevations. Take it before breakfast and lunch on an empty stomach. If taken later in the day, it may interfere with sleep. Start at 200 or 400 mg/day and then increase the dose gradually, if tolerated. Some people may require 1,600 mg or more per day. * 5-HTP: We generally start 5-HTP at 50 mg twice a day, increase the dose after several days to 100 mg twice daily, and then if needed increase again to 150 mg twice daily, based on response. This supplement begins to work quite quickly, in most cases within several days. * L-tyrosine: This amino acid helps with focus, energy, and motivation. For the first three days, take 500 mg before breakfast, midmorning, and then midafternoon. After three days increase to 1,000 mg before breakfast, midmorning, and midafternoon. Thereafter, some people increase to 1,500 mg at each dose. Take it on an empty stomach. * St. John’s wort: Adults start at 600 mg in the morning and 300 mg at night. Sometimes the dose may be increased slowly to 1,800 mg daily. Wear sunscreen—St. John’s wort increases the risk of sunburn. * L-theanine: L-theanine promotes relaxation and mood modulation. The usual dose is 200 mg three or four times per day. You can take higher doses if you find it useful. There are no known adverse reactions. Pregnant women and nursing mothers should avoid L-theanine. * Vitamin D: The dose is 5,000 to 10,000 IU/day.Although most people with a bipolar disorder require medication in order to havestable moods, some do well without medication. Elaine was a psychologist whowrestled with disorganized, distracted thoughts. Her brain never felt calm andshe never acted calmly. Previous doctors had diagnosed her with ADHD, but shenever responded well to what seemed to me to be reasonable treatment approaches.In fact, she often became depressed, moody, irritable, and anxious when she tookstimulant medication.I had the advantage of being able to perform a thorough assessment of Elaine,including gathering a detailed longitudinal history. What became clear was thatElaine actually had a previously undetected bipolar disorder. Worsening of moodstability in bipolar disorder is common when stimulants are given. With this newinformation, I explained to Elaine that we needed to calm her overactive limbicsystem before we could boost her prefrontal cortex. This all made sense toElaine, who then started using high doses of fish oil and the supplement GABA tocalm her overactive limbic areas. We could have used a medication like Lamictalor Depakote, but Elaine preferred natural supplements. Having calmed her limbicareas, we could then have Elaine try L-tyrosine to boost her PFC, which shetolerated well, without the worsening of mood stability.On this new treatment approach, Elaine was finally able to successfully userelaxation breathing and other stress-reduction approaches to calm her busybrain, approaches that previously had never worked for her because her brain hadnot been sufficiently well balanced. She also paid close attention to dailyrhythms, sleep, exercise, and diet. Though Elaine’s case illustrates someapproaches that can be useful for those with less severe mood swings, her caseis highly unusual. If you have a bipolar disorder, please do not stop yourmedication without discussing the matter extensively with your doctor. As I havementioned above, it is the rare bipolar patient who can do well withoutmedication.Medication for DepressionWe now believe that antidepressant medication changes gene expression (turnsgenes on and off) in the hippocampus and likely other brain areas.Antidepressant medication actually seems to cause new cells to grow in thehippocampus, reversing the hippocampal cell death seen with depression andstress. Keep in mind that we try to treat episodes of bipolar depression withoutantidepressant medication, because of the risk of causing more rapid moodcycling. If an antidepressant is needed for bipolar depression, Wellbutrin XLmay be the best choice.Medications used commonly for depression include the following: * SSRIs: Lexapro, Zoloft, Prozac, Celexa * SNRIs: Effexor and Cymbalta * Wellbutrin XL: More energizing and activating than most other antidepressants; lack of sexual side effects is a big advantage over SSRIs * Abilify: Not strictly an antidepressant, but helpful as an add-on to antidepressants in some casesMedications for bipolar disorder: * Bipolar Depression: It’s best to attempt to treat bipolar depression without antidepressant medication, because antidepressants may bring about more rapid cycling and mood instability. * Bipolar Mood Stabilization: Lithium is the gold standard treatment, likely the most effective medication. Anticonvulsant medications are often used alone or added to lithium. Atypical antipsychotic medications, such as Risperdal, Zyprexa, and Seroquel, are effective but can have significant side effects of weight gain and increases in blood lipids and blood glucose. Most individuals with bipolar disorder require more than one mood-stabilizing medication.[../image/59906.jpg]ACTION PLAN[../image/59900.jpg] * Exercise: Moderate aerobic exercise can be as helpful for some as antidepressant medication. The trouble is, we don’t feel like exercising when we are depressed. If you can, exercise five times a week for thirty to forty-five minutes. As I tell my patients, you don’t have to run marathons or climb mountains. Find something you enjoy that raises your heart rate and makes you sweat. Walk briskly as if you are in a hurry. Ride a bike. Swim. Play tennis. * Supplements: Try SAMe or 5-HTP. They can be used together, but make sure you start one at a time. * Light Therapy: Get outside every day, if you can, and expose yourself to the natural elements. Consider using a light box or light visor even if you don’t have SAD. Definitely use light treatment if you do have SAD. * CBT: CBT provides a structured approach for dealing with the negative thoughts in depression. * IPSRT: Anyone with recurring depression or bipolar disorder should familiarize themselves with the principles of IPSRT. Regular daily rhythms, especially sleep, are essential for someone with a serious mood disorder. * Medication: Do not be afraid to use medication if these steps do not give you enough help. Individuals with bipolar disorder typically require the care of a psychiatrist and should give serious consideration to using medication."},{"pageContent":"[../image/64356.jpg]9[../image/64354.jpg]Getting Unstuck: OCDHave you ever felt stuck on a thought? Nagged by a worry you simply can’t seemto banish from your mind? Walked down the street with a difficult conversationconstantly replaying in your head? Sometimes our busy brains play a scenarioover and over again, without a solution. Often we imagine the worst. That achein our shoulder could be serious; maybe it’s cancer. Maybe the boss’s commentmeans that our job is in jeopardy. Bedtime is often a particularly badmoment—the quiet and lack of distraction allow our ruminative thoughts to gowild. With such a busy brain we can’t fall asleep, or we awaken in the middle ofthe night with the cracked record of worries playing over and over again. We’restuck. And the image of being stuck, as it turns out, is a useful way ofunderstanding what’s literally happening in our brain.Error Detection and Incapacitating StucknessOur brains are hardwired to detect mistakes. We have error-detection circuits inthe brain that constantly search for potential mistakes or dangers, orientingthe organism to take steps to protect itself. This error-detection capacity,which happens automatically, is thus for a good reason: it optimizes our chancesof survival.Think of the antivirus program on your computer. It scans each website,download, and e-mail for threats. When the antivirus protection works well, it’salmost invisible—working in the background, holding things up for just a fewmilliseconds as it scans for unwanted intruders. However, imagine that theantivirus program is not functioning well; in that case, it might flag nearlyevery website, e-mail, and document as being a potential threat, even when nothreat is there. The flow of your work on the computer would be slowed downimmensely. Eventually, the computer might become paralyzed, and with it yourability to work. That’s what happens when the error-detection circuits in yourbrain are overactive. You become slowed, sometimes to the point of paralysis,needing to check and recheck and yet check again. Stuck, sometimes to the nthdegree.Error checking matters. Our ancestors from many thousands of years ago needed toconstantly scan for threats to their existence. Whether in matters of hygiene(think cleanliness and contamination obsessions such as repetitive and excessivehand washing) or the safety of one’s family and dwelling (think lock-checkingcompulsions), checking and even double-checking likely improved the chances ofstaying safe and secure, of surviving.Obviously, survival behaviors have their place, and mild stuckness on thesebehaviors may be a good thing. Regular hand washing reduces the risk ofcontamination and the spread of infection. Some of the religious traditionsregarding food in Judaism and Islam may well be variations and extensions ofgenetically determined behaviors to optimize cleanliness. However, more severeobsessions and compulsions are the mistake-detection circuitry run amok. Theantivirus program flags every little thing, paralyzing the computer and blockingyou from doing the work you need to accomplish.Brain Anatomy and Circuits in StucknessThere are three key players in the brain’s error-detection circuitry: thecaudate (a component of the basal ganglia), the anterior cingulate, and theorbital-frontal cortex.The caudate, part of the limbic system, seems to generate the emotional anguishconnected with the error messages, announcing that there is imminent danger thatneeds to be attended to immediately. This emotional anguish is the sense of animpending catastrophe.The anterior cingulate is the brain’s gear shifter, which, if functioning well,allows us to shift smoothly from one thing to another. When the anteriorcingulate is working well, one can cooperate with others, see options, havecognitive flexibility, and go with the flow. When it isn’t working well, we arestuck, rigid, and cannot transition our thoughts and attention easily from onething to another; we’re stuck on the perceived danger, just like the antivirusprogram is stuck on and keeps flagging that innocent e-mail you’re trying todownload.The orbital-frontal cortex is the error-detection center; this is the antivirussoftware, so to speak. When it works well, it appropriately sends error messagesabout problematic or dangerous situations, just as properly functioningantivirus software does. When it doesn’t work well, when it is too sensitive, itflags situations it shouldn’t flag, just as a malfunctioning antivirus programflags files that really are safe.Brain SPECT of individuals prone to stuckness typically shows excessive brainactivity in the anterior cingulate and caudate areas. The notion of being stuckand of an excessively busy brain may seem at first to be a contradiction. It’snot. The excessively busy brain of somebody who is stuck typically manifestsexcessive cingulate and caudate brain activity that cannot be adequately reinedin by the PFC. Remember how with depression, excessive thalamus activity sentthe delicate balance between the PFC and limbic system (of which the thalamus isa part) topsy-turvy? It’s the same with stuckness. Only this time the limbicsystem culprit is excessive anterior cingulate and caudate brain activity ratherthan excessive thalamus activity. In both cases the apple cart of PFC–limbicsystem balance has been upset, leading to classic busy brain.When the PFC inadequately regulates the excess cingulate and caudate activity,individuals who are stuck feel keyed up, needing to do something to relievetheir inner tension, but no matter what they do, the tension remains. Anindividual with stuckness or OCD cannot “gate” or appropriately filter theinformation flow from lower centers (anterior cingulate and caudate) to thecortex. Too many disturbing thoughts about potential errors keep reaching theprefrontal cortex, which is not able to control these error messages, motivatingus toward activity in response to the error messages, just like themalfunctioning or oversensitive antivirus program keeps flagging safe files,making us spend time checking the files—a busy brain par excellence caused byanterior cingulate and caudate wild horses run amok.Activity of the error-detection circuit that is a bit overactive, but notextremely high, causes us to appropriately check and organize. Organization is akey to success in modern life. I could not function well as a physician if Icould not organize my workload; developing systems and routines for things I dorepetitively saves time, ensuring that I take care of all of the details andthat I am the best doctor I can be to my patients. Most physicians have a littlebit of stuckness, which helps. Wouldn’t you want your doctor to double-check? Iwould. High motivation to do the right thing, even perfectionism, can enhancefunction and survival.Slightly elevated activity of the error-detection circuitry results inconscientious and effective individuals. Maybe they are even perfectionistic.This is the good part of higher activity in the error-detection circuit. Butwhere does perfectionism merge into obsessive-compulsive behavior? Problemsarise when double-checking becomes triple-checking and then becomes stucknesscarried out ad infinitum. There is no hard and fast dividing line thatdetermines when checking—or any other potentially dysfunctional stuckbehavior—becomes a problem. Practically when a behavior—say, checking—causesdistress (think emotional pain) or disability (think interfering with day-to-dayfunction), then we call it pathological, a problem, a disorder—a malfunctioningantivirus program inappropriately flagging nearly everything.Stuckness, difficulty shifting our mental gears, includes OCD and a number ofless obvious problems. My clinical experience and brain SPECT have taught methat in addition to OCD, a number of other conditions join in the pantheon ofstuckness, including oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), scrupulosity(pathological guilt about imagined moral or religious failings), autism, eatingdisorders, pathological gambling, and addictions to alcohol and drugs. Becausethey are special cases of stuckness, we will cover addictions in Chapter 11.As I have suggested, stuckness and OCD-type behaviors exist on a spectrum, fromrumination, mild double-checking, perfectionism, and conscientiousness at oneend to severe, disabling OCD on the other that renders an individual absolutelynonfunctional. With milder cases of stuckness, we find that the feared problemsand dangers are usually social. In modern society, we don’t need to occupyourselves as much with literal survival issues as our ancestors did. Rather, thepotential threats and dangers we face have to do more with our relationships. AmI attractive enough? Will I be accepted? Will I be admired? Will I be loved?Will I be rejected? Will I be successful? Individuals with these milderstuckness issues ruminate on perceived social dangers and social mistakes, ofpotential faux pas. They ruminate about failure, embarrassment, humiliation, andsocial rejection.OCD and ADHD ComparedIndividuals with ADHD and OCD/stuckness are both flooded with stimuli, but fordifferent reasons. In ADHD, the individual cannot properly filter externalstimuli. Their busy brain jumps around from one thing to another. The individualis distracted by his or her inability to properly filter external stimuli. InOCD, as we pointed out earlier, the individual cannot properly filter internalstimuli. It is as if they are recipients of constant error messages, with eachmessage jarring them as a result. Stuckness is a daytime nightmare of repeatedlyneeding to try to address what is “wrong,” to turn off the error-detectioncircuit. But because the error-detection circuit malfunctions, one can never beat peace. The error alarm sounds continuously, no matter what. The antivirusprogram continues to inappropriately flag as dangerous the innocent file yourgranddaughter e-mailed to you.Let’s consider how distraction by internal and external stimuli results inproblems with focus. In ADHD, there is too little focus; one is scattered,distracted. Important issues are not attended to or missed because the mindcan’t stay with something (especially “boring” things) long enough, even whenimportant. Many individuals with ADHD need novelty in order to generateinterest. In OCD, there is too much focus on the perceived dangers generatedfrom the malfunctioning error-detection circuit, albeit in a narrow,nonproductive, possibly dysfunctional area. With stuckness, important issues arenot attended to or are missed because the mind is stuck on relativelynonessential things (contamination, for example). Individuals with OCD and ADHDdo have in common that they have poor self-regulation; in OCD, there isexcessive self-regulation because of unimportant error messages. In ADHD, thereis weak self-regulation because of distraction and focus problems with externalfactors; these individuals have difficulty selecting and sticking with the mostimportant issues they face.Genetics and Life Changes Predispose for Stuckness and OCDThere is some genetic predisposition for OCD; it does seem to run in families.Moreover, although we rarely find a psychological “meaning” behind the symptoms,we often do observe the onset of OCD symptoms following a life change or aperiod of stress, as if the life changes and stress destabilize a previouslystable equilibrium. Those with OCD find that their symptoms wax and wane throughthe course of their lives, similar to how someone with a predisposition for moodproblems such as depression has periodic symptomatic recurrences.OCD is when our brain takes error detection to the extreme and is best treatedwith professional help. But many of us experience a more common version offeeling stuck. We ruminate, we unhealthily return again and again to a smallslight. When this happens, there are strategies that you can use to reducecommonplace stuckness. These strategies divert attention away from mentalstuckness and recruit the PFC to offset the brain’s overactive error-detectioncircuitry. Ted’s and Barb’s examples illustrate how to use these strategiesyourself.Ted, thirty-four, had worked since his college graduation for his father’ssuccessful real estate firm. He’d done well. However, although his father was agood and decent man and employer, Ted yearned to step out of his father’sshadow. One way to do this was to take a position with another real estate firm,in which he hoped that he could spread his wings and fly—if not solo, then moreunder his own power. An opportunity arose in a nearby city, but Ted would haveto interview for the position. That was the problem.After arranging the interview, Ted began to ruminate. What if the owner of theother firm was critical of Ted because Ted had only worked for his father? Wouldthat owner think that Ted couldn’t make it on his own? And even if he got thejob, could he do it? He began to feel unsure; his confidence waned. Ted becamestuck on these fears and worried that he had been too dependent on his father,too much under his protection. Did he really have what it takes to be successfulon his own? The two weeks leading up to the job interview threatened to bemiserable. Ted couldn’t shake these thoughts. He was stuck on them. His sleepwas poor, he lost his appetite, and he was nervous and edgy.Mindfulness Approach to StucknessMentally separate yourself from the stuckness. Tell yourself, “I am not mybrain. This is my brain’s mistake-detection system working too hard. This is notme.” This approach to help stuck individuals get unstuck is based on generalmindfulness principles, CBT, and the work of Jeffrey Schwartz, M.D., apsychiatrist at UCLA.Ted used the approach of telling himself, “My stuck thoughts are because of mybrain’s mistake-detection system going haywire.” He found it moderately helpful.Pencil In a Stuck AppointmentSet aside a specific time to ruminate or obsess. Outside those times, work yourbest to stay away from the stuckness. When stuck thoughts creep up, tellyourself that you’ll indulge in them at the scheduled time.Ted scheduled “stuck appointments” at eight a.m. and three p.m. each day. Heallowed himself fifteen minutes to dwell on his ruminative fears about theinterview: the owner wouldn’t take him seriously, he wouldn’t be able to succeedwithout his father’s guidance, he’d fall flat on his face. On and on he went,but only for fifteen minutes during the stuck appointments. Outside those times,Ted diverted his attention from his stuckness, telling himself that he wouldindulge in his ruminations during the appointed times.DiversionWork on your hobby, exercise, watch a movie, do a crossword puzzle. Do anythingwithin reason to get your mind off your ruminations and stuckness and distractyourself in a healthy way. Do something productive or fun for fifteen minutes tolet the pressure of stuckness die down. You are diverting your attention fromyour ruminations, focusing your attention on alternate behaviors, which helpsovercome the stuckness stalemate.Ted really liked crossword puzzles and used them to escape his rumination abouthis upcoming interview. Each day, he cut out the New York Times crosswordpuzzle, kept it nearby, and used it as a positive distraction when hisruminations flared up.Laugh at Your StucknessLaughter makes situations more tolerable and moves you away from the negativethoughts and feelings you are ruminating about. Make fun of the rumination andstuckness. Recognize the absurdity of your stuckness and laugh at it.Ted had a natural sense of humor. He got himself to laugh at his ruminations,seeing them as not so important, by focusing on the fact that in several billionyears the sun will burn out and the earth will become a cold, lifeless rock;long before then, whether he did well in the interview and succeeded in the newfirm would not be important at all in the grand scheme of things.These simple techniques gave Ted the relief he needed from his stuckness. Tedwas moderately nervous on the day of his job interview, but the two weeksleading up to the interview did not turn out to be miserable, as he anticipated,because he was able to use these techniques to gain mastery over his stuckness.Ted did get the new job, and he has since been successful. Whenever ruminationsflare up, he goes back to the techniques he used prior to his interview.Let’s now turn to Barb, who managed a successful nonprofit medical clinic thatprovided healthcare to people with low incomes. Barb dreaded her monthlymeetings with the board of directors, all prominent members of the community,including church leaders, the mayor, and well-off individuals whose financialsupport made possible the services that the clinic provided. Barb couldn’t shakethe thought that the board might think she was doing a bad job; if they held anegative view about her work, she worried, they could withdraw financial supportor even shut down the clinic. Consequently, each week leading up to the monthlyboard meetings was miserable for her; she felt nauseated, couldn’t sleep, and onoccasion had panic attacks.“Stop” TechniqueMentally, yell “Stop” as loud as you can in your mind. Do this as many times aday as you like.Barb yelled “Stop” in her mind when she tended to become stuck and ruminate onher fears about the board meetings. She initially thought this would be silly,but she tried it and it helped. Yelling “Stop” gave vent to some of the tensionshe experienced with her stuckness.Rubber Band TechniqueWear a rubber band on your wrist and snap it every time you become stuck. Youcould do this all day, if you find it helpful, as many do. Using the rubber bandtechnique, many people notice that their stuck thoughts decrease rapidly.Barb tried this technique, found it helpful, and took pleasure in finding thewidest, most colorful rubber bands she could get her hands on. Snapping therubber bands reduced her stuckness.Head ShakeShake your head as if you were shaking the stuck thoughts out of your head.Barb often used shaking her head side to side, as if she were shaking out allher stuck thoughts, with benefit. This was an easy technique for Barb, whosuspected that it was so helpful because it served as a diversion from herruminations.These techniques helped Barb a great deal. Her stuckness on potentiallycatastrophic outcomes of her monthly board meetings declined about 80 percentover a few months. And she appreciated that these tools were things she could doon her own, whenever she needed them. She was able to reconfigure her brain’santivirus program and get it to work normally.OCD and the Price of FertilityThe preceding techniques work for those of us who ruminate or experienceoccasional stuckness. Formal OCD can be a harder case. Sue’s example is aninstructive one. Sue, thirty-four, was smart, really smart. She came from ahardworking family in which education was paramount. Fortunately for Sue,education came easy. She attended a prestigious private high school and thenstudied engineering at an Ivy League school.When she came to see me, Sue had married Lee, an engineer at the firm she joinedfollowing college graduation. During her first few years of marriage, Sue triedto get pregnant, with no success. After a year of trying and consultation withfertility specialists, Sue and Lee tried in vitro fertilization (IVF).Even with IVF, Sue could not conceive. Unfortunately, the different hormones andother medications Sue took during her fertility treatments caused acne outbreakson her face. Always perfectionistic, Sue became obsessed with her facial acne.Dermatological treatment, including medication, chemical peels, and lasertreatments, had greatly reduced the acne in my opinion; I couldn’t see anyblemishes. Yet Sue was stuck on her perceived skin blemishes. She wore hats withbroad brims and scarves whenever she went out. And she rarely went out. Sue tooka leave of absence from work and stopped seeing her friends. At home, she mostlyshut herself off from her husband, isolating herself in their bedroom. Allbecause of blemishes that she could hide with makeup.Recall that we discussed how stuckness can result from the brain’s error- anddanger-detection circuits run amok? And recall that we talked about how thepotential threats we face in modern society have more to do with ourrelationships than being attacked by a lion on the savannah? Sue is a primeexample. She feared that her blemishes would make her unacceptable to others,perhaps unlovable. You and I might conclude, correctly, that Sue overdid herfears of rejection, but that is precisely the point. Her error-detectioncircuits made her focus excessively on actual, yet—in the grand scheme ofthings—rather minor blemishes that could be concealed effectively with makeup.Sue became paralyzed.I suggested that Sue try some of the mindfulness and other approaches that Tedand Barb used with great benefit—the rubber band technique, yelling “Stop,”laughing at her stuckness, trying to divert herself—to distract herself from herstuckness on her blemishes. These approaches did little; in fact, she was sostuck that she was even reluctant to try them. Sue was too stuck. She had formalOCD.Although reluctant to try more medication, given her reaction to the fertilityhormones, Sue agreed to use an SSRI, Zoloft, which at high doses is ofteneffective for stuckness and OCD issues. We gradually worked our way up to a doseof 300 mg/day; this is a dose higher than we typically use for depression, butOCD issues typically require higher doses. At 300 mg of Zoloft Sue reportedsignificant benefit. Her OCD issues were reduced about 70 percent. Sue soonreturned to work and started again to socialize with her friends. When shereturned to being more social, Sue often noticed that she was preoccupied withher skin rather than being attentive to her friends and coworkers. Here,mindfulness and the other approaches mentioned earlier could help. She committedherself to using the Stop technique, diversion, and the rubber band technique.Now these techniques worked.To underscore an important point, it was only after medication calmed heroveractive error-detection circuit that Sue could then use the self-helpapproaches we discussed to deal with her obsessions with her skin and to improveher presence with friends and coworkers. After two years of treatment withZoloft, we were able to taper and discontinue it, and Sue continued to do welloff the medication. Whenever she has a flare-up, a moment of increased worryabout her skin, Sue effectively uses the mindfulness and other approaches we’vediscussed to make sure that her momentary flare-up of her error-detectioncircuit—her skin obsession—does not derail her.Fortunately for Sue and her husband, Lee, her overactive error-detectioncircuits did not have a profoundly negative effect on their marriage. We nowturn to Betty and Peter, whose marriage was profoundly affected by overactiveerror-detection circuitry. It’s a story with an interesting twist. Peter soughthelp first, but it was in helping Betty with her issues that we found the key tosaving their marriage.Error Detection in a MarriageIn his late forties, married with two children, Peter was an orthopedic surgeon.He also had ADHD, which is why he came for help. Peter was not good with detailswhen situations were not exciting. The adrenaline rush of a complicated surgicaltrauma case actually calmed Peter, boosting his underaroused PFC (a bit like thewing walker I mentioned earlier), and Peter was well-known for keeping a coolhead during surgical disasters. Yet outside the OR, Peter was less effectivewith small things. Medication for ADHD helped some, but there were limits to howmuch benefit Peter obtained from stimulant medication.Life at home was the real problem. Well-meaning, Peter did his best to be aloving father and devoted husband. I learned that a major problem was thatPeter’s distractibility, a common ADHD symptom, often caused him to forget to dosmall things around the house. He’d open the blinds but forget to close them atnight. He’d forget to put the mayonnaise jar back in the fridge after making asandwich. Small things, I thought. But not to Betty, Peter’s wife.It turned out that Peter’s forgetting to close the blinds, put back the mayo,and other seemingly small things tormented Betty. She was constantly criticizinghim for these oversights. He did what he could to try to improve, but his brainjust didn’t attend to the small stuff when somebody’s health and life were notin jeopardy. His underaroused busy brain was all over the place when he wasn’tin the OR; the small stuff—like putting the mayo jar back in the fridge—justdidn’t get him sufficiently aroused.I concluded that Peter didn’t even see the proverbial mayonnaise jar, but Bettyaccused him of all sorts of relationship crimes, such as that he wasintentionally neglecting these things in order to torment her. As best as Icould tell, there was no truth in this accusation.For years Peter had accepted his wife’s accusations and attacks, believing thatshe was justified in labeling him lazy, passive aggressive, and—at times—ahorrible husband. Her attacks were an emotional storm that blew Peter offcourse. He experienced nervousness around his wife because he was waiting forthe next attack. Peter was often discouraged, to the point of being depressed.Peter benefited significantly from a meditation class. As a result, he was lesslikely to be blown about by his wife’s emotional storms. He could more calmlyweather her tirades because he was less reactive emotionally. He didn’t fightback, as fighting back was not in his nature. Rather, Peter reached a point atwhich he was able to keep a calm equanimity when she attacked him. Internally,he responded to Betty’s attacks with an attitude of “Is that so?” He neitheraccepted her accusations nor rebutted them. He realized that defense onlyexacerbated Betty’s attacks.Peter’s calmness with Betty made things worse for a time. She upped the ante,attacking him more vehemently. But he was able to hold his own, not acceptingher provocative attacks.On the brink of a separation, Peter suggested that they first see a maritaltherapist to discuss their problems. Betty reluctantly agreed for the sake ofthe children.The Price of ControlWhat became clearer during several marital counseling sessions was a surprise toeveryone involved. Betty’s need to keep control over every little thing in herlife stemmed from her own feelings of being completely out of control. Bettyoften felt on a knife’s edge due to a childhood assault that she had neverdisclosed to Peter. Her extreme focus on these small things was her attempt toward off future disaster. She experienced Peter’s distracted oversights almostas if she were again being violated. Her traumatic past was affecting herpresent.Betty had been stuck on these small things—the mayo jar, the blinds—so stuckthat it is interesting to consider her motivation. The dynamics of the situationwere as follows: Betty tried to control every minute detail in her life, fromthe dust on the counter to the absolute perfection of the floral arrangement onthe dining room table to the symmetrical arrangement of the salt and peppershakers on the pantry shelf. Her error-detection system went into overdrivewhenever her absolute attempt to manage any and every little detail was foiled.She unconsciously believed that controlling the minutest thing would ensure thather world would never again become so out of control that she would risk anotherassault or violation. For Betty, it all was an impossible life-and-deathstruggle. For Peter, it was just a mayo jar, and not even that, because hehardly thought about it.Their marital therapist helped Betty share her trauma with Peter and graduallyhelped the two of them understand Betty’s unconscious motivations that drove heroveractive error- and danger-detection apparatus. This was a new opening. Nolonger was there talk of separation and divorce. Instead, Betty continued seeingthe marital therapist individually, with Peter joining at times as appropriate.Betty was able to become more mindful about what was going on inside when shenoticed herself becoming instantly enraged at Peter’s oversights. She eventuallylearned to catch herself, stop, and breathe, reminding herself that now was notthen, that it was simply a mayo jar on the counter, not a repetition of pasttrauma. Betty also embraced some of the techniques to combat her stuckness, suchas diversion, the Stop technique, and penciling in a daily stuck appointment.Peter and Betty remained together. Peter’s mindful stance helped him understandhimself better, not accept Betty’s negative attributions, and withstand herattacks. He was able to be more empathic with Betty, seeing her attacks asreflecting her emotional wounds. But his mindful approach also destabilized themarital equilibrium. Eventually, the destabilization helped both of them moveahead, to strengthen their marriage. And both parties grew as individuals.How to Control the Impulse to ControlWe all desire to exert some control over our own lives. The freedom to chart ourown course is likely the most cherished value in the United States, a bedrockfounding principle. But as with Betty, the desire for too much control candestabilize us—and our relationships. What are some steps you can take torelinquish control and/or to stop being controlled by others? * Control Assessment: Assess your life honestly. Are you the author of your life? Nobody can be 100 percent in control, but are you in the driver’s seat as much as is realistic? Not enough? Or are you trying to control too much? * Values: What is most important in your life? For most of us, it’s family, health, friends, productive work, perhaps helping others or a relationship with the divine. Correlate your values with your control: Are you trying your best to control your life in the areas that reflect your basic values? Family, friends, health, and other important values are worth a mighty struggle. Are you fighting to control what is most important to you? Maybe you are, maybe you aren’t. Are you fighting to control things that aren’t important values? Putting back the mayo jar? Closing blinds? Work on those. They are draining valuable energy from your life. * Strategies to Reduce Excessive Control Tendencies * Hand over the reins. Even if for only a day, let someone else do the planning. It’s amazing what you learn about yourself—and about others’ capabilities—when you let them take charge. * Let go of perfection. Remember that “better” is the enemy of “good.” Take satisfaction in accomplishing tasks, not in perfecting them. * Talk it through. Find someone to talk to about your priorities. Sometimes just hearing someone echo back to you what you’ve outlined shows how far out of whack your priorities have become. * Embrace the chaos. Do something unplanned. Take up a new activity. * Try a twelve-step motto: “Let go, let God.” Of course, God could mean the world or the universe, reflecting a broader understanding that nobody can control everything and it’s silly to try.Oppositional Defiant DisorderTrying to exert excessive control like Betty is one form of stuckness. ForBetty, it was as if the sought-after perfection of her home would give hermagical protection from far more serious traumas like she had experienced in thepast. An even simpler form of stuckness—and control—is to automatically vetowhatever others suggest. Tyler was a nine-year-old boy I saw a few years ago whooften became stuck. His parents had told Tyler and his brothers that they wouldgo to Six Flags Great Adventure, a large amusement park in New Jersey, thatcoming Saturday. However, in the meantime, Tyler’s parents learned that Tyler’suncle Jeff, whom they love and rarely see, would be visiting from out of townthat day. Accordingly, Tyler’s parents said that the trip to Great Adventurewould have to be postponed one week. “But you said that we were going onSaturday,” said Tyler. “Yes, we did,” said his father, “but we want to spendtime with Uncle Jeff on Saturday. We’ll go to Great Adventure the followingSaturday.” That didn’t satisfy Tyler. On and on and on he repeated the samerefrain: “But you said we were going this Saturday.” Tyler was stuck. Nothingcould satisfy him. Not even the thought of seeing Uncle Jeff, whom he loved,could placate him. All of this played out in my office, right in front of me.Tyler had what we call oppositional defiant disorder, or ODD, a condition seenoften in stubborn, oppositional children and teens, and sometimes in adults.Their cingulate activity is strong, and they automatically reject anythingsomeone else says. They act as if they are protecting their integrity by beingoppositional, by refusing to shift or change plans. Tyler’s stuckness on goingto Great Adventure was just one instance of his overall pattern.ODD can be treated with medication, but I decided to treat Tyler withnutritional supplements to boost his serotonin. His parents started by givingTyler 5-HTP, which was moderately useful in that Tyler seemed a little lessstuck. Then they added inositol, which really reduced Tyler’s stuckness.Finally, they added GABA, which doesn’t increase serotonin but has a generallycalming effect on excessive brain activity. With Tyler’s 5-HTP, inositol, andGABA, he became much less stuck and much more reasonable. Family life definitelybecame easier. About eighteen months after Tyler started these supplements, hewas weaned off and continued to do well, without an increase in his stuckness.You may wonder whether Tyler’s parents tried the approaches that Ted and Barbused to try to reduce Tyler’s stuckness. They didn’t, and the reason is thatTyler couldn’t buy into his brain being the problem. He was too young to stepaway from his behavior to see that it was a problem that needed to be addressed.We say that Tyler’s stuckness was ego-syntonic, that is, it felt like a part ofhim. With many adults, their stuckness feels ego-dystonic, that is, not a partof them but foreign. This makes it easier to mount an offensive against theforeign troops occupying our minds. Not so in a child, whose brain and psycheare immature.Suggesting to a child that his stuckness results from his error- anddanger-detection circuits run amok will either irritate him even more or fall ondeaf ears. Nonetheless, it is likely that overactive error- and danger-detectionis at the heart of ODD as it is with other varieties of stuckness. However, Ithink the motivation is different. Anyone who has had children will vividlyremember the “terrible twos,” during which the growing child learns to exert hernegativity. One of the first words the child learns is “no,” and she soon usesit with abandon. Why is this? The reason is that “no” defines the child as aseparate individual, one who doesn’t agree with parents. Always agreeing wouldseem to mean that she hardly exists psychologically. Thus, no-ness andoppositional behavior like Tyler’s is an attempt at psychic survival. Tyler andothers like him act like they are in a fight for their lives, as if it is amatter of basic integrity, a core value, if a young child were able to speak inthose terms. ODD, then, can be understood as a mechanism, overdone to be sure,at defending and even saving the emerging self.There are useful strategies in dealing with individuals prone to stuckness,whether child or adult. One is to offer them choices, assuming that’s a viableoption. Another approach to dealing with stuck individuals is to use “reversepsychology.” If you are planning to go to the mall and you’d like your stuckchild to go along, you could say, “I’m going to the mall. You really don’t wantto come along, do you?” Presenting this in the negative may make theiroppositional tendencies flare up. “Yes, I really do want to go. Why do you thinkI don’t?” they might say.Nutritional Supplement Options for StucknessUseful nutritional supplements for stuckness work by increasing serotonin and/orcalming the brain to reduce stuckness. Some to consider are 5-HTP, St. John’swort, GABA, L-theanine, glycine, inositol, and NAC. * 5-HTP: Start with 50 mg twice a day; increase the dose after several days to 100 mg twice daily, and then if needed increase again to 150 mg twice daily. This supplement begins to work quite quickly, in most cases within several days, by increasing serotonin levels. * St. John’s wort: This is a potent supplement for increasing brain serotonin. The starting dosage is 300 mg daily for children, 300 mg twice daily for teens, and 600 mg in the morning and 300 mg at night for adults. Sometimes the dose in adults is increased slowly to 1,800 mg daily. * GABA: GABA has a calming effect on the brain, reducing limbic activity. GABA does not seem helpful for every patient, possibly because it is not always well absorbed and has difficulty crossing the blood-brain barrier. Side effects are few, it is safe, and doses can range from 100 to 5,000 mg/day, divided into two or three daily doses. The large dose range is likely due to variable absorption from one person to another. * L-theanine: This amino acid calms, reportedly by increasing alpha waves in the brain. The usual dose of L-theanine is 200 mg three or four times per day. You can take higher doses if you find it useful. * Glycine: Take 500 to 3,000 mg/day in divided doses to calm brain activity, including in the anterior cingulate and caudate regions. * Inositol: Use up to 18,000 mg/day to boost serotonin. * NAC (N-acetylcysteine): Use doses of 600 to 1,200 mg twice daily.Medication Options for StucknessMedications that reduce stuckness include the SSRIs (serotonin blockers), whichoften cause sexual side effects such as lowered sex drive, difficulty withsexual arousal, and difficulty achieving orgasm. Anafranil, which is often usedfor stuckness, can cause sexual side effects as well as sedation and weightgain. In severe cases we add atypical antipsychotic medications such asRisperdal and Zyprexa, which are more powerful than SSRIs and work more quickly.But the side effects of Risperdal and Zyprexa can be troublesome (weight gain,increased blood sugar, and increased cholesterol and triglycerides). Medication,when used for several months and at an adequate dosage, can often result in asmuch as a 50 percent reduction in symptoms. * Lexapro: 10 to 50 mg/day * Zoloft: 100 to 350 mg/day * Prozac: 40 to 120 mg/day * Anafranil: as much as 250 mg/day * Risperdal: 1 to 8 mg/day * Zyprexa: 5 to 10 mg/day, or more[../image/59906.jpg]ACTION PLAN[../image/59900.jpg] * Techniques * Mindfulness Approach to Stuckness: It takes time, often days, for this method to become effective, so try it and get started. It works best when combined with distraction. * Diversion: Some people do this five to ten times each day in the beginning and then decrease gradually. * Pencil In a Stuck Appointment: Do this twice daily. * Laugh at Your Stuckness: Do this at least five times each day. * “Stop” Technique: Do this at least ten times a day for the first week. * Rubber Band Technique: Do this twenty times or more each day for the first week. * Head Shake: You can do this whenever you want, although doing it in public could result in some staring. * Supplements: Try 5-HTP, NAC, or some of the other supplements. * CBT: When these steps do not provide enough relief, consult a professional with experience using CBT for stuckness problems. * Medications: When the individual techniques, supplements, and CBT are not effective, medication can give good relief of stuckness. For severe cases, a combination of approaches works best."},{"pageContent":"[../image/64356.jpg]10[../image/64354.jpg]Branded in the Brain: Emotional Trauma and PTSDImagine that you are in your car, waiting for the traffic signal to change.Suddenly, a car comes out of nowhere and smashes into a car crossing theintersection, and the driver of one of the cars is decapitated. You see hissevered head rolling down the street. How would you react? Most likely you wouldbe shocked by this horrific event, traumatized emotionally. I selected thisexample because of its shock value, but it is a true story, one that actuallyhappened to Miles, one of my patients.After the experience, Miles developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).PTSD is a condition that develops in some individuals who are exposed to orinvolved in an extremely traumatic event that involves actual or threateneddeath or serious injury. The individual’s response to the traumatic eventinvolves intense fear, helplessness, or horror. They continue to reexperiencethe event long afterward and avoid stimuli associated with the traumatic event.Emotional overarousal is common, unbalancing the PFC–limbic system relationshipand giving rise to a busy brain.In such instances, the individual’s capacity to cope with the traumatic event isabsolutely overwhelmed. That’s what happened to Miles, and what would happen tomany of us if we witnessed such a horrible accident. We all need to feel safe.When we experience traumas, we lose that background feeling of safety. LikeMiles, we may have difficulty processing the memories and emotional impact. Nowonder. The shock and trauma of such an event is thankfully outside the realm ofnormal experience, at least for most of us. People like Miles who have PTSDcontinually reexperience the trauma, as if the past were still alive in thepresent. Miles had nightmares about the accident every night. During the day,Miles was triggered to reexperience the accident whenever he saw a car similarto the one that caused the horrible accident.By now you’ve heard a lot about the fight-or-flight response, activated byprotective circuitry that strives to keep us safe. Miles’s danger detector, hisstress response alarm system, was on constant fight-or-flight high alert.Remember that in danger situations the thinking brain can be turned off whilethe primitive limbic areas take over. Like Miles, most traumatized individualshave fight-or-flight reactions that continue long after the danger has passed.It is as if the traumatic past is acutely alive in the present. Their feeling ofdanger never abates. This is the root of the busy-brain experience intrauma—primitive limbic and fight-or-flight areas remain in overdrive, with thePFC unable to rein them in.“Big T” versus “Little T”What Miles experienced was a “Big T” trauma: a sudden, single, horrible eventthat leaves a lasting imprint. Big T traumas are major events in our lives.Examples include horrible events such as rape, kidnapping, war experiences,accidents, and earthquakes. Big T trauma is the kind that most commonly comes tomind when we imagine shattering events. The individual’s life often changesforever after a Big T trauma. They struggle to work through the terror, thememories, and even shame. The trauma of the experience is branded in theirbrains.“Little t” traumas, in contrast, accumulate over a longer period. They are notas extreme as the horrific experiences associated with Big T traumas, but Littlet traumas can have a powerful and detrimental impact nonetheless because theylast for a long time. We get our first lessons in self-care from the way otherscare for us. Little t trauma for a child could be separation from parents,having a depressed mother or father, or growing up in a home in which there is alack of emotional attunement or in which one is neglected or constantlybelittled. Maybe there were not enough nurturing, sustaining, and healingencounters with early caretakers. Perhaps no one ever looked at the child withloving eyes or smiled at the toddler’s first achievements of standing unaided.Maybe a mother experienced postpartum depression and was not available toadequately nurture her infant. Or maybe one’s parents were struggling with theirown unresolved trauma issues themselves and could not be available for theirchild, attuned to his or her needs.Other examples of Little t traumas include bullying; substance-abusing familymembers; unstable families with job loss, financial ruin, violence in the home,or parental incarceration; and physical and emotional abuse in a marriage. Wewonder why someone would stay with an abusive spouse. Well, we seek refuge inwhat is familiar. The known, even if hurtful, seems safer than the unknown.Why is the Big T/Little t distinction important? Because they are so far out ofthe realm of normal life, Big T traumas are impossible to miss. The impact onthe traumatized individual is devastating, and the individual’s psyche may beshattered, but it is difficult to overlook a Big T trauma.In contrast, Little t traumas can fly under the radar, their traumatic effectsgoing unnoticed for what they are. Emotional traumas are much more common thanwe would like to admit. Many individuals are traumatized and do not havefull-blown PTSD. And too many of these traumas are inflicted on us by the peoplewho are supposed to love and care for us, making it all the more confusing tosort out when someone whom we love and who should love us becomes a traumatizer.When does a depressed and hopeless mother’s comments to her son of “You’ll endup just like your father, no good” become a Little t trauma? When does ahusband’s critical nature become for his wife emotionally abusive and a Little ttrauma? When does the bullying received by an eighth grader become traumatic?There are no clear-cut rules to help us decide. How traumatic these situationsare depends on factors such as the genetic endowment and emotional resilience ofthe individual, the availability and support of caring, loving figures, and theindividual’s prior experiences of trauma. We’ve all been there, we’ve all beenhurt, we’ve all been traumatized to some degree. But depending on how young orfragile an individual is and the precarious situation they are in, theemotionally traumatized person may not recognize that they are caught in adestructive, traumatic force field.Early instances of developmental trauma have lifelong effects. In general, theearlier and the more severe and more prolonged the trauma, the more negative andfar-reaching its effects. Children cannot select their parents. And childrenlack the capacity to understand their parents’ motivations. They don’tcomprehend why Mom is depressed, or why Dad directs his anger toward them.Children view the world as being all about them. They assume that their parents’behavior toward them reflects something about their own goodness or badness.They interpret everything about the world from their own vantage point. Plus,they may have nobody else to whom they can turn. Their survival literallydepends on their early caretakers. If we are loved and cherished when young, wecarry that sense with us through life. If we are abused or neglected duringchildhood, we carry a sense of defectiveness and humiliation. No wonder some ofus go through relationship after relationship as adults in which we are takenadvantage of, victimized. We may not protest if mistreated; we feel deep downthat we deserve it. It’s all we’ve known, what we believe. And we may not evenbe fully aware of what we know, what we believe.In an earlier chapter, we discussed the negative default position of the humanpsyche. Along with that, I have observed in many individuals a kind of negativeegocentricity. I don’t mean selfishness, per se. Rather, what I mean is that toomany of us reflexively assume that negative interpersonal events reflectnegatively on us or are our fault. Remarkably, so many of us assume blame whenthere is none to be had, at least on our part. A case in point is the youngchild who assumes that her parents are divorcing because she was a bad girl.This is all too commonplace.Where it gets confusing is that not all individuals react the same way tosimilar events. The reflexive assumption of blame for one’s parents’ divorce canaggravate the Little t trauma of the experience for one child. Another childwith a genetic endowment that makes him less reactive to stress—say, not havingthe short version of the serotonin transporter gene—and more loving support may,however, come through a similar event with fewer lasting wounds.In part, because emotional traumas are so common and affect differentindividuals differently, individuals—and those who treat them—aren’t alwaysaware that their condition is related to a Little t trauma. I remember a patientfrom when I first started doing brain SPECT imaging. I evaluated Robin, atwenty-four-year-old woman who complained of anxiety and depression. Iquestioned Robin, as I do with all my patients, about physical, sexual, andemotional abuse. Robin said that none of those had happened to her. But herbrain SPECT scan showed what we call a “diamond plus pattern” (excessiveactivity in the anterior cingulate, basal ganglia, thalamus, and right temporallobe areas).As I showed her the brain SPECT pictures, I said to Robin: “We often see thispattern in people who have been abused or traumatized. Are you sure that nothinglike that has happened to you?” Robin thought for a moment. She replied: “Well,when I was four years old, my older brother Hank used to hang me outside hissecond-floor bedroom window by my ankles and threaten to drop me. Was thatabuse?” “How’d you feel when he did that?” I asked Robin. “I was terrified and Ithought I was going to die,” she said.I learned that Hank, who later ended up in jail for robbery, had done thisdozens of times to Robin. He seemed to love the terror her helplessness createdin her. I told Robin that Hank’s behavior was more than enough to emotionallytraumatize her.Jill: Blocking It OutJill, seeing me for depression, anxiety, and panic attacks, reported a dream inwhich a baby was being flushed down the toilet. Jill told me this dream on thetwo-year anniversary of terminating her one and only pregnancy; I would learnlater that her pregnancy termination was extremely traumatic for Jill. She hadnever before told me about that abortion. In fact, she had not thought of theevent, which was tremendously troubling at the time, in nearly two years. It wasas if she had blocked it from her conscious awareness.Following her abortion, Jill didn’t have anyone with whom she could process whatoccurred. She had no one with whom she felt safe. Jill’s dream did open the doorto our exploring the lack of safety and security she experienced early in life.In essence, she had a Big T trauma—the pregnancy termination—but also Little ttraumas related to family chaos and lack of parental availability when she wasyoung that seemed to lay the foundation for her trauma of her pregnancytermination.Blocking it out or repression of the event is not the only reason manyindividuals have difficulty surfacing or articulating their trauma. Practically,trauma—whether Big T or Little t—can profoundly affect one’s ability to thinkand use language to understand and to process the traumatic events. Researchsuggests that neglect and abuse early in life reduce gray matter in theself-control areas of victims’ brains. We don’t know why the gray matterdecreases, but we do know that stress can kill cells in an adult’s hippocampus.Perhaps the lack of safety the child experiences increases their stresshormones, thus having a detrimental impact on their gray matter. Regardless, theimplications are stark: early abuse and neglect can have a lifelong negativeimpact on the brain, damaging an individual’s capacity to self-regulate for therest of their lives.Helping patients become aware of how traumatic past events have been can be halfthe battle in treating trauma, as it was with Robin and Jill. Patients withtrauma may even be misdiagnosed precisely because their traumatic experienceslie buried. I’ve seen many instances in which trauma and PTSD were misdiagnosedas another condition, such as generalized anxiety disorder, major depression,panic disorder, OCD, and psychosomatic conditions such as migraine headaches orirritable bowel syndrome. The treatment for the other, misdiagnosed condition isoften effective for a time, but then the treatment effectiveness falls off. Whena patient comes for evaluation with a history of several psychosomatic problems,multiple different psychiatric diagnoses, and multiple failed treatments, Ialways wonder if trauma has been missed. Patients who were previously given adiagnosis of borderline personality disorder are often found to have traumaissues when evaluated carefully.In part, trauma and PTSD tend to be misdiagnosed because the affectedindividuals’ ability to emotionally process their traumatic experiences has beenimpaired by the trauma. During episodes of severe trauma, higher corticalcenters become shut down. There is active inhibition of language centers. Andmemory integration is disrupted by a shutdown of the pathways from the frontalcortex to the memory centers in the hippocampus. We often say something like,“There are no words to describe how I feel.” In trauma situations, this can beliterally true because of the shutdown of the brain’s language and memorycenters that I’ve just described. Someone has been so severely wounded that theymay not or cannot generate an integrated story of what happened. The eventbecomes stored in the brain raw, as you experienced it, in its original,unprocessed form, not integrated into the more general memory networks. Thememory is still there, but you cannot convey it or remember it in the usualsense.I have emphasized narratives and storytelling in this book, but with trauma thecognition, emotion, sensations, and memories necessary to integrate an eventinto a narrative can be dissociated or walled off. They are blocked off and arenot consciously accessible. There is nothing consciously there to reflect on.The individual’s capacity for self-reflection is thus markedly impaired.Affected individuals simply cannot develop a coherent story of what is happeningto them. They cannot explain what they do not know.And, of course, if the story cannot be told in the first place, it’s impossibleto rewrite it and heal. It’s a situation in which time doesn’t heal all wounds.One may still experience pain, sorrow, depression, anxiety, and other emotionsabout events from years ago.Lacking adequate capacity to think about and process our traumatic experiences,the traumas become split off and stored in the body. Never being able tointegrate the event becomes a key element in the continuation of the trauma. Thetraumatic past continues to be alive in the present. The body remembers what themind cannot. We may become like traumatized animals, relying on our primitivefight-or-flight systems. Because of this, being attentive to our bodies and theway they harbor trauma can help us find a path to what’s unconsciously stored.Monty Roberts, Safety, and Emotional ResonanceLet me describe for you a remarkable event I was privileged to witness inperson. The event has to do with body memory of trauma. Monty Roberts is theoriginal “horse whisperer.” Because of his own experiences with his father, who“broke” horses harshly, using pain and abuse, Monty dedicated his life tofinding a different way to “join up” with horses, meaning a way to develop asafe and trusting relationship with a frightened and often traumatized horse.Monty goes around the country demonstrating his techniques. Local individualsbring to the demonstrations horses that have never accepted a saddle, bridle, orrider. Many of these horses were physically abused in the past; as I learned,abuse is quite common in the horse racing industry.Monty takes these recalcitrant, mistreated horses and enters a ring with them.He is a keen student of the body language of horses. He also understands thathorses want to join up—that is, connect—with a human, but that at the same timethe horses need to feel safe and be able to run away if they feel endangered.Using a round pen and his exquisite sense of what is going on inside thatemotionally traumatized horse, by forming a safe and secure relationship withthe horse, Monty is able to connect with the horse and get it to accept abridle, saddle, and rider in twenty to thirty minutes. Monty respects andunderstands horses and their fears, which is key. It’s absolutely remarkable towatch the join-up process. What is even more remarkable is that during thesedemonstrations with horses that were abused, women in the audience who werethemselves abused and traumatized often faint! They lose consciousness. Why isthat? Because the body speaks louder than words. Our emotions live in ourbodies.Abused women in the audience pick up on the body language of these mistreatedand petrified horses; the women somehow sense, unconsciously, that these horsesfear humans because of the abuse they have suffered. It’s a remarkabledemonstration of how unintegrated emotions and trauma are expressed in the body.Horses have only body language with which to communicate. We humans have ourbody language and more. It’s an extraordinary experience to witness theconnection between these women and horses with so much in common yet no real wayother than body language to express it. Some individuals at Monty Roberts’sdemonstrations who don’t faint, including men, are overcome with intense emotionand have spontaneous outbursts of laughter. The emotional impact is so powerfulthat many don’t have the words to express what is going on inside; theylaugh—seemingly inappropriately, giving vent to the powerful emotions for whichthey have no words.ResilienceIt is important to underscore that not everyone who experiences a trauma willdevelop a Big T or a Little t trauma. Some concentration camp survivors emergedfrom the camps with reasonably good mental health. Other individuals have risenfrom the ranks of abject poverty and family chaos to become well-adjustedindividuals. Studies of resilience have addressed this. We’re not all cut fromthe same cloth; genetic differences, such as with the serotonin transportergene, help explain why some individuals are more resilient than others. Othergenes related to resilience or the lack of it are currently being studied. Thosewith backgrounds of neglect and abuse are more prone to have traumaticreactions. And being surrounded by caring, supportive individuals offers someprotection against developing a traumatic reaction following a traumaticincident. The reality is that most war veterans who serve in Iraq andAfghanistan and return with psychiatric problems don’t have PTSD; less than halfhave PTSD, while the rest have other problems, such as mood and anxietydisorders.For those of us who aren’t naturally resilient, there are strategies we can useto address our traumas. Darryl’s success story illustrates one effectivestrategy.Darryl’s EFTDarryl was five years old when the 9/11 terrorist attacks occurred. His familylived outside New York City and knew four people who lost their lives in theattack on the World Trade Center, one of whom was Darryl’s uncle. The televisionwas on constantly in Darryl’s home in the aftermath of the attacks, broadcastingthe carnage relentlessly, as was the case in many American homes. When Darrylwas nine, he was brought to me for evaluation of his depression and schoolstruggles. He also experienced constant anxiety, nightmares, headaches,gastrointestinal complaints, and other physical symptoms that had waxed andwaned since 9/11. Remember that the body speaks what the mind cannot remember.It is by recognizing, bearing, and putting into perspective traumatic lifeexperiences that we begin to heal. A traumatized young person lacks the lifeexperiences, maturity, and cognitive capacity to understand and put intoperspective what happened. If an attuned parent or other caring adult is notavailable for the young person, the traumatic event remains split off from therest of psychic life and may still reside otherwise in the body.Parental availability following a trauma is thus crucial to help a child workthrough his feelings about what happened. Parents who are sensitive, receptive,and available to discuss the trauma with the child can help the child processthe event. If they are concerned about their child’s emotional state, they willattempt to create a sense of safety for the child and encourage the child todiscuss his thoughts, feelings, and reactions to the trauma.Because Darryl’s parents, too, had been traumatized and were grieving the lossof Darryl’s uncle and friends, they had not been emotionally availableimmediately after the attacks to help him work through his feelings about theattacks. In this case, the entire family experienced trauma issues. Four yearsafter the event, they all were still suffering.Darryl and his parents wanted to avoid medication. I taught them EmotionalFreedom Techniques (EFT) so that they all could more effectively deal withpost-9/11 trauma. EFT and art therapy helped Darryl recover. He was able toretell his story through his artwork with a top-notch art therapist.This is just one example of the myriad uses of EFT to calm busy brains andresolve symptoms. EFT does not erase memories. Rather, like eye movementdesensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), EFT changes the way painful memoriesare stored, so that when we think about them we no longer experience suchpowerful negative emotions or problematic physical sensations. Any disturbingepisode that causes emotional and physiological problems can be addressed withEFT. Problems that can be addressed include anxiety, panic attacks, depression,anger, sleep problems including nightmares, fears and phobias, the impact ofbullying, and even life-threatening situations such as rape or experiencesduring wartime. EFT jump-starts the brain’s emotion-processing systems. I liketo say that EFT helps integrate the “unthought known.”Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT)Emotional Freedom Techniques, also known as tapping, are often called“do-it-yourself EMDR,” a technique described shortly. Given my skeptical nature,when I first heard about EFT, my initial response was that it was flaky andunlikely to be legitimate. I had my doubts. You may have your own doubts as Idescribe EFT. Despite my initial skepticism, I was open to learning more aboutEFT, and I’ve found it helpful personally. And my patients have found it helpfultoo. I hope you can keep an open mind and consider EFT.You probably know about acupuncture, in which needles are inserted into“meridian points” in the body. Acupuncture is effective for a variety ofconditions, as research and clinical experience show. EFT was developed as avariant of acupuncture. Instead of using needles, you tap on certain meridianpoints. It’s simple. Here’s what you do: 1. The Issue: Identify the issue you want to work on, what bothers you right now. Examples could be work, your boss, the fight with your spouse, your aching back, that embarrassing episode in elementary school. Try to be as specific as you can be. Target only one issue at a time. 2. Testing the Initial Intensity: To test the initial intensity of your issue, rate the distress you experience with your issue on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 being the worst possible. 3. The Setup: Make a setup statement in the form of “Even though I [fill in the blank with your issue], I deeply and completely accept myself.” For example, “Even though I have this aching back, I deeply and completely accept myself.” Or, “Even though I was humiliated by the teacher in sixth grade, I deeply and completely accept myself.” Tap on your karate chop point (the fleshy part of your hand that you would use to break a board if you were doing karate) with the fingers of your other hand three times while repeating the setup statement. 4. The Tapping Sequence: Tap with your fingertips through the eight points in the EFT sequence that follows while you say a reminder phrase out loud. Tap five to seven times at each point. When there are two possible body points to tap on, just pick right or left. It doesn’t really matter which side you pick. The reminder phrase is short— just a couple of words to remind you of your issue. Say this phrase out loud at each of the eight points in the EFT sequence. For example, if your issue has to do with the anger you feel toward a friend who betrayed you, you might tap through each point in the sequence saying, “This anger . . . this anger . . . this anger . . .” Or you might have a reminder phrase such as “the pain in my back” or “my panic attacks.” These little reminder phrases are present simply to remind you of the issue you have chosen to tap on. Here are the eight points you tap on, in the sequence given: Top of the Head (TOH) Beginning of the Eyebrow (EB), just above the nose Side of the Eye (SE) Under the Eye (UE) Under the Nose (UN) Chin Point (CH) Beginning of the Collarbone (CB), either side Under the Arm (UA), several inches below the armpit 5. Retesting: When you have finished tapping, take a deep breath and then test the intensity of your issue again using the 0-to-10 scale to check your progress. Compare this number with what you had before tapping. Your number should be lower, indicating progress. Sometimes it takes a few rounds to get your number down, so don’t get discouraged.You can repeat this sequence as often as necessary to get the relief you desire.As you tap on particular issues, you will likely notice other, related issuescoming to mind. Tap on them too, to maximize your relief. Evidence suggests thatEFT reduces an overactive fight-or-flight system related to trauma issues, thuscalming a busy brain. Exactly how and why it works is not clear. Proponents ofEFT state that EFT addresses disruptions in the body’s energy transmissionsystems—in the Chinese energy meridians—thereby improving energy flow that wasblocked by emotional traumas.Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)EMDR is a technique developed to activate the brain’s emotional processingcenters, permitting warded-off, unprocessed, and dissociated emotional traumasto be processed and integrated. EMDR treatment is usually done by a therapisttrained in the approach, although some versions of EMDR do not require a trainedtherapist; you can do them yourself. EMDR does not erase memories. Rather, EMDRchanges the way painful memories are stored, so that when we think about them weno longer experience negative emotions or problematic physical sensations.Any disturbing memory that causes emotional and physiological problems can beaddressed with EMDR. Problems that can be addressed by EMDR are the same asthose I mentioned for EFT, including Big T or Little t traumas, nightmares,phobias, anxiety, and depression. EMDR treatment usually requires six to twelvesessions. The therapist employs various techniques to activate the emotionalprocessing centers of the brain (which come “online” every night during REMsleep) while the individual puts themselves mentally back into the traumaticexperience. These techniques include moving your eyes back and forth, alternatetapping on thighs, and listening to sounds in headphones that travel back andforth from one ear to another. When I first heard about EMDR years ago, I wasskeptical about it, just as I was with EFT. But I kept an open mind and learnedmore about it, and I’ve found it to be quite helpful to many patients withtrauma issues. Remarkably, traumatized people can heal using EMDR even if theydon’t talk about the traumas with the EMDR therapist. For example, Jill, who wasenormously pained about her pregnancy termination, was able to obtainsignificant help from the EMDR expert to whom I referred her. Jill especiallyappreciated that she was able to significantly reduce her emotional pain withouthaving to talk about the details of her abortion with her EMDR therapist.Kristen was a social worker who was assigned to the child abuse team at themental health center where she worked. Unfortunately, Kristen herself had beensexually abused during childhood by her grandfather. Her exposure during work tocase after case of child abuse, difficult enough for anyone, brought Kristen tothe point of emotional collapse. The cases resonated too closely with her ownabuse issues, and Kristen presented to me with many symptoms of PTSD. Medicationhelped Kristen sleep and reduced the nightmares that began when she joined thechild abuse team. EMDR reduced her constant fight-or-flight symptoms.Ultimately, Kristen concluded that given her personal abuse history, she couldnot continue to work on child abuse cases, and she transferred to the geriatricpsychiatry team, where she did well.Healing RelationshipsDarryl and his family are, unfortunately, not an unusual case. In general,trauma is devastating for relationships, whether parent-child, husband-wife, oreven previously close friendships. Hyperarousal makes the traumatizedindividual’s world feel dangerous and hostile. At the same time, their agitationand wariness make those who are traumatized less desirable companions and reducetheir social support. The tendency to avoid, common in people who aretraumatized, reduces social connections. Fundamental relationship issues forthose who are traumatized are safety and vulnerability; traumatized people oftenhave difficulty trusting.Yet connecting with others is a human imperative. Though trauma often makes thatconnection difficult, relationships can be healed, and relationships can behealing. What is necessary is safety, openness, and lack of judgment. Traumaticexperiences are, at their core, experiences of lack of safety. Someone in arelationship with a traumatized, wounded soul needs to work hard to enable asense of safety and security in the relationship. This takes time, whether inthe psychotherapist’s office or in real life.A deep, loving relationship can transform traumatized individuals. Even havingchildren can teach traumatized individuals how to love. A calm, devoted, lovingpartner or spouse who is able to withstand the emotional swings in therelationship with the traumatized person can have a remarkably positive impact.Love goes a long way toward healing. The loving care of others can help usdevelop positive expectations of other people as we develop a capacity to carefor ourselves that is based on the care and love others give to us.Loving a traumatized individual is not always easy. The promise of closenessgenerates a danger for traumatized individuals. They fear getting hurt,betrayed, or abandoned again. Their sense of defectiveness plays a part in thisfear: “You’ll reject me if you find out how disgusting I really am.” Sometraumatized individuals may try to hurt the other person or break off therelationship as an unconscious way to avoid the greater hurt of being rejectedor abandoned by the other person.A person who is involved with a traumatized individual needs to be especiallysensitive and self-aware. In a word, they need to be mindful. They need to beaware of what is happening within themselves, process it, and use it to generatea loving response to the hurts and retreats that their traumatized partnerbrings to the relationship. They need to be empathic and to know where the otherperson is coming from. This is no easy task. The challenge in helping othersheal is to be nonintrusively present long enough to allow neuroplasticity totake over, so that new brain patterns can develop. The traumatizedindividual—whose life experiences have taught them that they themselves arehelpless and that others may be threats—needs new, positive experiences withothers to counteract the old, destructive ones, so that the brain can change.Being able to be emotionally present and feel safe with another is a goal foremotionally traumatized people. Disaster response studies around the world havedemonstrated that social support protects against being overwhelmed by stressand trauma. Social support means being heard and understood by those around us,that they care, that they think of us. Deep friendship and love buffer usagainst the wounds that life inflicts. Safety is incompatible with terror. Areassuring voice or a warm embrace calms a frightened adult just as it does aterrified child. Recovering from trauma must involve reconnecting with ourfellow human beings.Animal TherapyInvolvement with animals can be helpful in healing. Connection with dogs andhorses, both of which are especially sensitive to human emotions, has provenhelpful in alleviating trauma reactions and seems to increase oxytocin, whichcalms. Pets for Vets (www.pets-for-vets.com) is an organization that pairsveterans with shelter dogs that mesh well with their personalities. Othervarieties of canine assistance include service dogs and emotional support dogs.Involvement with and caring for animals can help traumatized individuals feelsafe enough to begin to relate to humans.Barry, wounded by a roadside bomb in Iraq, got a service dog following medicaldischarge from the army with PTSD. He benefited enormously from his emotionalsupport dog, Fletcher, whom Barry obtained from a program called Paws for PurpleHearts. Working with a dog trainer, Barry was able to get Fletcher to obey amyriad of voice commands. Doing this meant that Barry’s demeanor had to beconfident, even strong, yet calm and focused. Training Fletcher helped Barrystep outside himself by focusing on Fletcher.An emotional assistance dog may also be helpful in regulating their human.Fletcher spent all day with Barry, slept in bed with him, and accompanied him towork when he was able to resume working. His presence likely raised Barry’soxytocin levels, which helped calm him. More important than that, however, isthat the relationship between Barry and Fletcher was primarily one limbic systemrelating to another. I’m speculating here, but I suspect that Barry was able insome way to borrow or absorb the calmness in Fletcher’s limbic system. Dogtraining with his service dog also helped Barry calm down his out-of-controllimbic system; in becoming master of Fletcher, Barry developed greater masteryof himself.Movement TherapiesTrauma literally alters an individual’s nervous system. As we’ve beenemphasizing, traumas may reside as much in the body as in the brain. Approachesto address the body are necessary, because so much of the traumatic experienceis experienced not in memories but in the body’s physical reactions.Movement therapies can help one become more centered in the present, rather thananchored in past traumatic situations in which they don’t feel safe. Approachesto the body give the individual a greater sense of body mastery andself-control. Access to split off memories and feelings is typically increased.Yoga, tai chi, Feldenkrais, Pilates, and martial arts are examples of approachesthat can reduce internal numbness and help traumatized individuals get back intouch with their bodies to regain a sense of who they really are.Similarly, dance and music have been used since time immemorial by individualsand groups and can help traumatized individuals get back in touch with theirbodies. Jill, who had blocked out the trauma of her pregnancy termination, hadalways wanted to study dance. She joined a weekly dance class at a local studio.Dancing helped Jill overcome the body numbness that we eventually realized shehad experienced since the termination.Support GroupsFinding a safe place to share the hurt and terror with others can help atraumatized person begin to feel connected again to the human race. For example,Barry, who witnessed horrible events in Iraq, including roadside bombings, wasable to be more open with his family and girlfriend once he shared his emotionalpain and gained perspective in a veteran support group.Writing and JournalingWriting and journaling can help traumatized individuals connect with their innerfeelings. These writings can be private, which reduces inhibitions and allows asafer expression of the traumatized inner world. The traumatized writer doesn’tneed to worry about how what he or she has to say will be received. On the otherhand, some traumatized individuals share their writings with their therapists.Some of my own patients, for example, find it safer to hand me what they’vewritten than to tell me out loud.When Do You Need a Therapist?As I’ve pointed out, healing from trauma is aided by a relationship with atrusted individual with whom the traumatized person feels safe. Sometimes thetrusted individual may be a friend, family member, partner, or spouse. But sometraumatized individuals have hurts that are so deep that professional assistanceis needed—a therapist.The professional designations and qualifications of a therapist can beimportant. But what is most important is to find someone who can accompany youon your journey of healing. You need a guide who can listen to the painfulmessages from deep inside you without overreacting. Your therapist needs to be amature individual with life experience, including his or her own hurts, whoknows how to create a safe place for you. And your therapist needs to be able totolerate and understand your tendency to run away from treatment because you’rescared. Can you resonate with such a person? And can you discuss impasses intreatment? Such impasses are often productive moments for growth and healing ifthey can be explored. Finally, remember that more than one kind of therapy maybe useful. Exploratory psychotherapy, EMDR, and other approaches all could beuseful at different points in your healing.Neurofeedback and Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulation (CES)Neurofeedback is helpful in reducing the excessive brain arousal that we find ina busy, emotionally traumatized brain. One of my colleagues has studied the useof neurofeedback for soldiers with PTSD returning from Iraq and Afghanistan andhas demonstrated its benefit. Neurofeedback likely alters the circuitry thatsustains the fear, shame, and rage related to trauma, reducing automatic stressreactions and the hyperaroused brain states we find in people who haveexperienced trauma.Cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES; www.alpha-stim.com and other companies)reduces excessive arousal and improves anxiety, depression, sleep, and stressand can be helpful for traumatized individuals.Nutritional SupplementsNutritional supplements can help heal those with emotional traumas by reducingthe trauma-based overarousal that leads to a busy brain. One should not expectmarked results, but nutritional supplements can help. For example, Barry, theIraq War vet, used GABA to calm down his overactive brain.Here are some nutritional supplements that can be beneficial: * GABA: GABA is usually taken in doses ranging from 250 to 1,500 mg daily for adults. For best effect, the daily dose of GABA should be divided among two or three daily doses. Start at 750 mg once or twice a day and increase as needed. * 5-HTP: Start with 50 mg twice a day; increase the dose after several days to 100 mg twice daily, and then if needed increase again to 150 mg twice daily. * L-theanine: The usual dose is 200 mg three or four times per day. You can take higher doses if you find it useful. There are no known adverse reactions. Keep some at your bedside to use in the early morning if you wake up too early.MedicationsMedications can offer significant help, especially for sleep and nightmares.Keep in mind that medications do not cure trauma; rather, medications dampen theexpressions of physiological dysregulation—the overarousal of a busybrain—caused by the emotional trauma. * SSRIs: Examples include Lexapro, Zoloft, and Prozac. SSRIs are useful for anxiety, panic attacks, depression, and stuckness. Doses that are too high can inappropriately deaden feelings, interfering with the work of healing from trauma. * Benzodiazepines: Examples include Ativan, Klonopin, and Xanax. They are useful for short-term anxiety but carry addictive potential. They also deaden feelings, which can work against healing. * Blood Pressure Medications: These reduce arousal. Clonidine and prazosin have been helpful for sleep and reducing nightmares. * Anticonvulsant Medications: Lamictal, Depakote, Trileptal, Neurontin, and Topamax can be useful by reducing arousal. * Atypical Antipsychotic Medications: Examples are Risperdal and Seroquel. They can cause significant side effects, but low doses can be useful when a traumatized individual has out-of-control emotions and behaviors.[../image/59906.jpg]ACTION PLAN[../image/59900.jpg] * Nutritional Supplements: Try GABA, 5-HTP, or L-theanine. You can use them together, but start them one at a time. * EFT: Learn how to do EFT. It is easy to learn and quick to do. Find a calm, quiet place and spend fifteen minutes twice daily doing EFT on your most pressing issues. You can also do EFT anytime you want during the day when you experience an upsurge of strong emotions related to your traumas. * Movement Therapy: Try yoga, tai chi, or other body and movement therapies. Take at least one class or lesson weekly, and practice for fifteen minutes each day you don’t have a class or lesson. * Professional Assistance: If the emotional difficulties related to your traumas do not resolve sufficiently with nutritional supplements, EFT, and the other approaches I’ve outlined, consult a mental health professional trained in EMDR. Also consider medication, especially for severe cases of insomnia, nightmares, anxiety, and depression."},{"pageContent":"[../image/64356.jpg]11[../image/64354.jpg]Balance Your Brain, Boost Your Willpower: AddictionJerrie started smoking marijuana in her teens. It calmed down her busy brain.Whenever life began to feel overwhelming, she found a certain solace andrelaxation in smoking pot. Soon, she felt that she couldn’t live without it. Nowthirty-nine years old, she smoked multiple times each day. Then she lost hersecurity clearance when an unexpected urine drug test came up positive. Shortlythereafter she made an appointment to see me.Jerrie had a strong family history of depression. And after I took a thoroughhistory of Jerrie’s life before she started using marijuana, it was apparentthat she also had started experiencing depression. Putting together the piecesof the puzzle, we understood that Jerrie was using marijuana to self-medicate.In small doses marijuana can calm an overactive limbic system, almost likeProzac and other SSRIs. Unfortunately, in larger doses it can actually increasedepression. Marijuana use also negatively impacted Jerrie’s cognitive functions.Her memory was worse and her motivation was low because of her smoking.Despite an addictive substance’s negative effects, the idea that it also makesus “feel better” is one that many people with addiction relate to. Why? Becauseaddiction frequently begins as an attempt to self-medicate a real problem.Addiction, in fact, is often masking an underlying brain imbalance. And if anaddicted person’s underlying—and often undiagnosed—condition is an imbalance inthe brain, it is no surprise that the addictive substance, often a stimulant toa low-functioning PFC or a calming substance for an overactive brain area, willprovide relief.Boosting Underactive Brains, Calming Overactive BrainsRemember that a busy brain results from brain imbalance between the PFC and thelimbic system. We commonly find this same imbalance among the addictions. Takethe PFC. Individuals with underactive brains—for example, those with lower PFCfunction due to ADHD or physical brain injury to the front of the brain—are morelikely to experience substance abuse and addictions for two key reasons. Thefirst is that lower PFC activity correlates with impulsivity and poor judgment.The second reason is that these individuals are drawn to abuse substances—suchas cocaine, meth, and prescription stimulants—as self-medication to boost thefront of the brain.Aside from the PFC, the other key affected area we find with an unbalanced busybrain is the limbic system, where there is overactivity. We commonly find thisas well in individuals who wrestle with addictions. Those who wrestle with thestuckness of an overactive anterior cingulate, or the worry and anxiety ofoveractive basal ganglia, or mood issues related to excessive thalamic activity,may discover great relief from substances that calm down these overactive areas.Just like Jerrie, they partake excessively of alcohol, marijuana, narcotics,and/or other calming substances precisely because these substances providesubstantial relief from their painful feelings.It is also possible—even common—for individuals with addictions to have both anunderactive PFC and overactive limbic areas, compounding the difficulty inhelping them overcome their addictions. Like Jordan Belfort and his friends inThe Wolf of Wall Street, these individuals may snort coke, perhaps to stimulatean underactive PFC, and then drink heavily, perhaps to calm an overactivethalamus. Alternating stimulants and depressants only deepens the existing brainimbalance and increases the difficulty in getting off the addictionmerry-go-round.Once we understood Jerrie’s underlying brain imbalance, we were able to helpaddress her depression with CBT and Zoloft. After she received adequatetreatment for her depression, she was able to wean herself off marijuana andremain off. Eventually, with my help, she was able to regain her securityclearance. Moreover, she appreciated that her memory and motivation were muchimproved once she stopped using marijuana. Jerrie’s case illustrates that oncean underlying brain imbalance is addressed, individuals typically experience animprovement in their willpower and can more successfully deal with substanceissues that were masking fundamental problems of brain balance.The Brain and Willpower: Genetic Factors Explain Why “Just Say No” Doesn’tAlways WorkThe correlation between an imbalanced brain and addiction also helps usunderstand why regulating our addictive behavior through willpower alone can beespecially difficult. Dr. Nora Volkow, a research psychiatrist and scientist anddirector of the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse, has performed importantresearch that revealed inherited brain abnormalities involving the PFC that makeindividuals more vulnerable to addiction. In other words, she looked at geneticfactors that weaken willpower. Her work shows that willpower is not justculturally or socially based. There can be genetic and biological components tolack of willpower.Crucially, Dr. Volkow found that people who are addicted to cocaine, alcohol, ormethamphetamine have fewer D2 receptors in their brains, a whopping 30 percentfewer. This is due to their fundamental, inherited biological makeup and not aresult of their substance abuse. Why do fewer receptors matter so much? BecauseD2 receptors determine how sensitive people are to dopamine, a keyneurotransmitter for the prefrontal cortex and the limbic system. If you havefewer D2 receptors, you are less sensitive to dopamine. And because dopamine isassociated with feelings of reward and pleasure, lower sensitivity to dopaminemeans you are less sensitive to things that give others pleasure, like money,food, drink, or sex. Individuals with fewer D2 receptors simply do not receivethe same rewards others receive for the same behaviors. They have what’s calledreward-deficiency syndrome. So they keep going in order to feel the same levelof satiety as those with more receptors. In other words, they overindulge. Thiscan play a large role in why they become addicted.Because drugs and alcohol seem to be among the few things that give affectedindividuals pleasure, the drive to partake of these particular substances isequally strong if not stronger for a person who is addicted compared to theaverage individual. But the problem for those who are addicted isn’t justdecreased sensitivity; lower D2-receptor density negatively affects prefrontalcortex function, which means one has a weaker ability to self-regulate (anADHD-like pattern). The PFC normally lets you know that you should stop anunhealthy behavior; with fewer D2 receptors, the PFC is too weak to exertself-control. Your pleasure centers override the ability of your weak PFC toinhibit the drive of your pleasure-seeking centers; your pleasure and rewardsystem literally hijacks your brain, and the drugs and alcohol you seek forpleasure further weaken your PFC’s ability to self-regulate, creating a viciouscycle of addiction.In sum, some people with addiction have a genetic double-whammy: lowerD2-receptor density means a weakened ability to regulate themselves—an ADHD-likepattern—and fewer D2 receptors means that their brains cannot take pleasure inthings that others usually find pleasure in. Given that lower D2-receptordensity is genetically determined, it is no wonder that some people becomeaddicted, and no wonder that addictions can be so difficult to overcome.There is some good news. Just because some individuals are geneticallyvulnerable doesn’t necessarily mean that they will become addicted. Those wholearn to regulate themselves may prevent a downward spiral. Also, factors otherthan D2 receptors are involved in addiction, such as early parental involvement;coexisting psychiatric issues such as anxiety, depression, and ADHD; headinjury; developmental and emotional traumas; peers who abuse substances; and useof the substance earlier in life. If your child has strong parenting and healthypeers and stays away from addictive substances, he or she has a much betterchance of beating a genetic predisposition to addiction. Moreover, physicalexercise may help boost D2 receptors. Exercise has been shown to increase D2receptors in rats. It’s possible that that daily turn you take on the ellipticalmay be increasing your sensitivity to dopamine and your ability to feel pleasurewith one beer rather than six.Increasing Motivation for ChangeThe challenges for people with addiction are great. But success in dealing withsubstance abuse issues and self-regulation is possible. As described earlierwith Jerrie, one key is often addressing one’s underlying brain imbalancesfirst. If the brain imbalance is addressed, you may actually have more abilityto change yourself than you think you do.Recall that lower PFC function weakens your capacity to regulateyourself—because your self-control is worse. Even after the brain imbalance hasbeen treated, a person with addiction often needs to boost motivation to recruittheir PFC to strengthen their self-regulation. They need to strengthen theirweakened, underfunctioning PFC. A stronger PFC is in a better position toinhibit the more primitive limbic centers that may push them toward addictivebehaviors. In lay language, they still need to boost their willpower.One of the approaches I recommend for boosting motivation and willpower andimproving the balance of activity between your PFC and limbic system is based onan approach called motivational interviewing. Motivational interviewing helpsyou think about and set important goals, including your goals to tackle youraddiction.Although this approach is not formally backed by research, I havefound it useful for individuals who struggle with addictions. The effectivenessof this approach likely results from enhanced self-monitoring. You can’t hit agoal you cannot see. This approach shines a spotlight on what you wish tochange. Close monitoring of behavior, which this approach enhances, increasesthe likelihood of change, reducing addictive behavior and improving thePFC–limbic system balance.Motivational interviewing is usually done with a trained professional. But youcan adapt the approach to use on your own. Here are questions to ask yourself toget help kicking your addiction. Record your answers on paper or on yourcomputer. As an example, I’ve included in italics the responses of Bart, aforty-year-old roofer I treated who had lost $100,000 gambling on horse races,football games, and online poker, really anything he could find to wager on. Notsurprisingly, Bart had excessive anterior cingulate activity and low PFCactivity consistent with ADHD and poor ability to self-regulate. Even after wetreated Bart’s brain imbalances, we needed to deal with his addiction togambling and boost his ability to self-regulate. Bart needed to learn toexercise more willpower. Focusing directly on his motivation helped Bart changehis behavior.Assess Your Motivation to ChangeTo start out, rate on a scale from 1 to 10 the importance for you of making ahealthy change at this time. * Look at the advantages of making a change. How will things be different in X number of years if you . . . ? How would you like things to be different? If you decided to change, how would that benefit you? * Consider the disadvantages of the status quo: What concerns you most about your health? How much does that concern you? What worries you if you don’t make a change? What do you suppose are the worst things that can happen if you keep on this track? * If you feel ambivalent, you may want to chart the decisional balance. Make a list of the good things about what you want to change, including what you’ll look forward to if you successfully change; the not-so-good things about it; and the bad things about making changes, including what might be difficult and what you’re afraid of. * Once you’ve considered the advantages and disadvantages of making a change, again rate the importance of making a change on a scale of 1 to 10. You will likely see that your rating is higher, underscoring the importance of making a change.Bart initially rated his motivation to make a healthy change at 6 on the 1-to-10scale. He then considered the advantages of a change. He’d feel better abouthimself. There would be more free time to play golf and engage in other hobbies.He would have more time with his family. Bart then considered the disadvantagesof the status quo. He struggled to hide his gambling from his wife and kids. Hespent endless hours at the race track and casino, and gambling online. He riskedplunging his family into even more severe debt. He was burdened by shame andguilt. After considering the advantages of a change and the disadvantages of thestatus quo, Bart rated his motivation to change at 7–8 out of 10.Reinforce Your Beginning Interest in Making ChangesOnce you’ve expressed at least an initial interest in change, you will stillneed reinforcement and support. * Begin by making a list of the strengths you have that may help you quit or change. * Then confront your possible challenges head on. What ideas do you have about overcoming the challenges? What would you like to try this time to overcome challenges (i.e., that you haven’t tried in the past)? What things have been successful for you in the past, either specifically in your health journey or in the other areas of your life that you can use to manage your new goals?Bart listed his strengths: he actually had demonstrated a good amount ofwillpower in the past—he’d quit smoking and he lost twenty-five pounds and keptoff the weight for two years and counting. He considered the challenges: hiscoworkers liked to gamble, and discussions about gambling took up a good part ofthe workday with his peers. He would have to make sure that these discussionsdidn’t serve as traps to lure him back to gambling; he couldn’t avoid thesediscussions, but he decided to plan simple strategies he could use to gentlyshift the work conversations away from gambling.Formulate Small Initial Changes * Ask yourself what you will do to start to make small changes in your life. * If you have questions related to making small changes, how can you find help? Are there “up and down” periods affecting your habits? How do these barriers/obstacles affect you? What ideas do you have for overcoming these barriers?Bart decided to start with the small change of telling his brother-in-law Petethat Bart wasn’t going to accompany Pete to the race track every weekend. Petepressured Bart about that, but Bart was able to stand firm and not be swayed byPete’s pressure. Bart also decided that he would join Gamblers Anonymous, wherehe could find help as he worked to make the necessary changes in his life.Set Smarter Life GoalsWhat are the life goals you want to set for yourself? These can be broad lifegoals such as being healthier, living longer, or being able to play with yourchildren or grandchildren. How is your health affecting you currently?To make your goals SMARTER (Specific/Measurable/Achievable/Realistic andRelevant to overall goals/Time-Bound/Evaluated/Rewarded), consider thefollowing: * How will you make your goal Specific? In other words, what exactly are you going to do to achieve this? * How are you planning to Measure this? In other words, how will you know that you attained your goal? * Is it Achievable, or do you need to rework it? (Is this goal dependent on someone else? If so, can you rephrase the goal so it only depends on you and not on others?) * Is the goal Realistic and Relevant? (Is my goal realistic within the resources at hand? Is it relevant to my life purpose? Will achieving this goal lead me to the life I want to have?) * When will you accomplish this goal? We use the term Time-Bound, which means you must give yourself a target date. * How will you know you have succeeded? We use the term Evaluated to reflect assessment of success or lack thereof. * When you succeed, what is your plan to Reward your accomplishment?Bart had a number of important life goals. He wanted to make sure that he washealthy. Therefore, he committed himself to yearly physical exams by his primarycare doctor. Bart wanted to take a more active role in the lives of hischildren, especially because he would have more free time when he stoppedgambling. He committed himself to at least one engagement, outing, or activityeach week one-on-one with his son and daughter. Bart also wanted to support hiswife. He decided to work toward helping his wife return to school so that shecould train to be a dental hygienist. Bart also wanted to improve the family’sfinances. To increase his income and begin to save for retirement, Bart decidedto work overtime one Saturday each month. He would devote 25 percent of theadditional income to making needed home repairs; the remaining 75 percent ofadditional income he would place in a retirement account.To increase the chances that he would take steps to carry out these goals, Bartprinted them out and pasted them on his bathroom mirror, to remind himself oftheir importance. He also discussed these goals with his wife, who agreed withthem. Bart asked her to help him be accountable to these goals, not by nagginghim but by lovingly supporting and encouraging him to work on these goals, whichwere important for Bart and his family. For each goal, Bart wrote down a targetdate by which time he expected to have met the goal. For example, he anticipatedthat his wife would begin her dental hygiene training within six months.Dealing with SetbacksEveryone encounters setbacks along the way. The important thing is how you dealwith them. Here are some things to remember and ask yourself as relapses occur: * Be kind to yourself: Setbacks will happen. Accept your slip and remind yourself to move on. * Take note of the setback: Think about the experience. When did it occur? Who were you with? What environment were you in? What were the circumstances surrounding the setback? * Learn from the experience: How will you change the situation in the future, so you are less likely to have a setback? * Go back to your plan as soon as possible: A temporary slip should not derail everything you have worked so hard for; that’s why it is called a “slip.” * Make a plan for the future: How will you handle things the next time this situation presents itself? What strategies can you use to help you be successful in the future?Like everyone, Bart experienced slipups in his efforts to abstain from gambling.For example, he slipped up and joined his brother-in-law for a day at the trackgambling on horse races. Rather than beat himself up, Bart reminded himself thatthey don’t keep using that phrase “one day at a time” for no reason. He thoughtabout why he slipped, and he concluded that too much work and lack of sleepweakened his willpower. Bart affirmed to himself the need to avoid theexhaustion that comes from overworking and to make sure that he had enoughsleep.Change is not easy—deciding to move forward can be as difficult as actuallydoing it. And different people are ready at different times for different kindsof change. Addressing motivation this way helps you address your ambivalence,strengthens your movement to your goal, and helps you find within yourself thenecessary resources to succeed with your plan.Support GroupsSupport groups, although not everyone’s cup of tea, are resources that help manyimprove their motivation and strengthen their willpower. Alcoholics Anonymousand other twelve-step traditions tackle addiction by helping individuals improvetheir self-control. Their goals are clear: one day at a time—do not gamble, donot use drugs, do not drink, do not look at pornography. Addictive behaviors aremonitored by reporting in at meetings and receiving chips that recognize andcelebrate periods of abstinence. These programs serve as substitutes foraddictive behaviors—go to a meeting rather than go out drinking or gambling.Participants see models of hope and success—they can learn from others in theprogram who have wrestled with and managed similar problems. Accountability isemphasized and life goals are more likely to be met when commitment to changeaddictive behavior is made out loud to others. Personal and twenty-four-hourassistance is available in the form of sponsors. Finally, there is lack ofcriticism in the programs—one is not criticized for lapses in sobriety; rather,one is assisted in getting back on the path to abstinence.Bart joined a twelve-step fellowship, Gamblers Anonymous, and received helpthere.Let’s look at the story of another person who benefited from a twelve-stepprogram. Forty-four-year-old Martin, a successful architect who was married withfour children, came for treatment after he was arrested for driving under theinfluence (DUI). Martin drove while drunk, ran his car into a telephone pole,and narrowly missed hitting a bus filled with passengers. He was fortunate notto have been severely injured and even more fortunate that he didn’t maim orkill anyone else.Ever since puberty, Martin had unstable moods, with frequent high and lowfluctuations. During the high periods, he felt confident, creative, nearlyinvincible, and able to manipulate any situation to his advantage. When low,Martin wanted to sleep, couldn’t concentrate, had low energy, and wasoverwhelmed easily.It was not difficult to diagnose Martin with a bipolar disorder and tounderstand that Martin had self-medicated for his unstable moods. I would learnlater that Martin’s father had a similar mood disorder and also self-medicatedwith alcohol. Both Martin and his father had tried to stop drinking over theyears; neither was successful in becoming sober.A small dose of lithium was quite effective for stabilizing Martin’s moods. Buthe needed more than that. Although we eliminated the original impetus for hisalcohol abuse—self-medication of his mood disorder—Martin’s alcohol abuse waslong-standing and had taken on a life of its own. He needed help for his alcoholaddiction. But he wasn’t ready.Because Martin’s motivation to give up alcohol was weak, I worked with him overseveral months using the approaches to increase his motivation that we’vediscussed in detail with Bart. Eventually, Martin’s motivation increased and hecould no longer deny that he needed to stop drinking. I then referred him to astructured outpatient treatment program, which he attended three times a weekfor a month, with fewer weekly meetings afterward. At the program’s and myurging, Martin started attending AA meetings, doing “90 in 90.” He found asponsor and has been able to stay sober, although he realizes that they don’ttalk about “one day at a time” for no reason.Martin’s story is one of many similar success stories I could recount. What isimportant to understand is that many individuals use alcohol and drugs to try toself-medicate for underlying brain problems, such as mood disorders likeMartin’s, anxiety, ADHD, emotional trauma, OCD, traumatic brain injury, andchronic pain. Even after the underlying brain problem has been treated, whippingone’s addiction still takes willpower and motivation. For those who have spentmost of their lives self-medicating, taking follow-up steps to treat theaddiction is absolutely crucial. If I may add a happy note, Martin told me thatbeing arrested for DUI was one of the best things that ever happened to him.Motivating Change: Spiritual FactorsIf we pause for a moment, the steps just outlined to increase motivation arelikely more helpful to boost an underactive PFC than they are to help manage anoveractive limbic system. The structure of twelve-step programs clearly assistsindividuals in self-regulation; the regular meetings, the steps, and the programenhance the efforts of the PFC to implement appropriate self-regulation.But twelve-step programs assist people with addiction in another way, helpingindividuals dampen excessive limbic system activity through an emphasis onspirituality. Twelve-step programs’ emphasis on spirituality—not religion—helpsindividuals find meaning amid the pain and occasional darkness of their lives,helps them find lived acceptance of their own and others’ imperfections, andprovides a way for them to help heal other people with addictions while theyseek healing for themselves. Seeking and finding meaning outside ourselves is aneffective way for us to manage the excessive limbic system that tends toaccompany the pain of a hurting soul’s existence.Nutritional Supplements to Increase Your Self-ControlMany individuals use alcohol, drugs, food, sex, gambling, and other addictivebehaviors to try to self-medicate for their imbalanced brains. When some brainareas are underactive, individuals may turn to addictive stimulating behaviorsand substances—such as caffeine, cocaine, and prescription stimulants—andstimulating behaviors to rev up their brain. This was the case for Bart, whosegambling boosted his dopamine. Other individuals with overactive brain areas,especially in the limbic system, use addictive downers—such as alcohol,marijuana, sedatives, painkillers, and high-carb foods that increaseserotonin—to calm the brain.Nutritional supplements can help balance the brain so cravings are lower, thereis less need to self-medicate, and self-control is improved. Nutritionalsupplements alone are rarely sufficient to balance the brain of somebodystruggling with addiction, but the supplements do provide some benefit. Anutritional supplement for ADHD helped Bart. He needed less of a dopamine rushonce he started using the supplement L-tyrosine, which improved his PFCfunction, increasing his impulse control and self-regulation. A supplement toincrease serotonin, 5-HTP, reduced his tendency to get stuck on gambling. Hereare more commonly used supplements that help rebalance underactive andoveractive brain areas, followed by medications that are commonly used for thesame reasons. Just so we keep things clear here, think of underactive brains(e.g., underactive PFC) as those with ADHD features—problems with focus,attention, concentration, easy distractibility, impulsivity, poor judgment, andboredom. Think of overactive brains (e.g., overactive limbic system) as thosewrestling with anxiety, depression, and stuckness.Supplements to Boost Underactive Brains (Problems with ADHD, Focus, Attention,Concentration, and Impulsivity) * L-tyrosine: This amino acid helps with focus, energy, and motivation. For the first three days, take 500 mg before breakfast, midmorning, and then midafternoon. After three days increase to 1,000 mg before breakfast, midmorning, and midafternoon. Take on an empty stomach. * SAMe: This supplement works best when taken at least twenty to thirty minutes before breakfast and lunch on an empty stomach. If taken later in the day it may interfere with sleep. In higher doses it can cause insomnia and restlessness. Start at 200 or 400 mg/day and then increase the daily dose gradually, if tolerated, by approximately 200 mg per week. A person may start seeing some benefit at 200 to 400 mg but may require 1,600 mg or more per day. Individuals with features of bipolar disorder should use SAMe with caution. It can cause mood swings or mania. * Ginkgo Biloba: This supplement helps with mental sharpness. The dose is 60 to 120 mg twice daily. It boosts blood flow and improves function in the front of the brain.Supplements to Calm Overactive Brains (Anxious, Depressed, or Stuck Brains) * 5-HTP: We generally start 5-HTP at 50 mg twice a day, increase the dose after several days to 100 mg twice daily, and then if needed, increase again to 150 mg twice daily. This supplement begins to work quite quickly, in most cases within several days. Sometimes we add 500 to 1,000 mg of L-tryptophan for additional boosting of serotonin, especially for insomnia. * GABA: We use GABA to calm the brain, aid sleep, calm mood swings, decrease irritability, temper, and anxiety, and to stabilize the temporal lobes. GABA is usually taken in doses ranging from 250 to 1,500 mg daily for adults. For best effect, the daily dose of GABA should be divided among two or three daily doses. Start at 750 mg once or twice a day and increase as needed. On occasion, we have used daily doses as high as 5,000 or 6,000 mg. * L-theanine: L-theanine is an amino acid that promotes relaxation and sleep. The usual dose of L-theanine is 200 mg three or four times per day. You can take higher doses if you find it useful. There are no known adverse reactions. Keep some at your bedside to use in the early morning if you wake up too early. Pregnant women and nursing mothers should avoid L-theanine supplements. Children over age six can use theanine, but start with 100 mg twice daily. * Glutamine: A dose of 500 mg twice daily is recommended for reduction of cravings. Twinlab brand seems to be preferred.Medications to Boost Underactive Brains (Problems with ADHD, Focus, Attention,Concentration, and Impulsivity) * Stimulant Medication: Vyvanse, Adderall and Adderall XR, Concerta, Focalin * Other Medications with Stimulating Effects: Provigil and Nuvigil, Wellbutrin XLMedications to Calm Overactive Brains (Anxious, Depressed, or Stuck Brains) * SSRIs: Lexapro, Zoloft, Prozac, and others * SNRIs: Effexor XR and Cymbalta * Anticonvulsant Medications: Neurontin, Lamictal, Depakote, Trileptal * Antipsychotic Medications: Risperdal or Zyprexa, if all else fails; powerful and effective, but with many side effects[../image/59906.jpg]ACTION PLAN[../image/59900.jpg]Keep in mind the acronym HALT. It stands for Hungry, Angry, Lonely, and Tired.These are situations in which individuals are more prone to engage in addictivebehaviors. These steps will help you boost self-control and combat addictions. * Hungry (Diet): Our willpower is weaker when we are hungry. Low blood sugar is a problem because it decreases brain activity and effectively lowers your ability to say no to unhealthy substances and behaviors. Consume a higher-protein diet, with several daily snacks that include protein and minimize refined carbohydrates. This helps keep your blood glucose levels steady. * Anger: Anger is unavoidable in life. Keep in mind what triggers you to anger and take steps in advance to reduce the possibility of your being triggered to anger. When you are angry, the limbic system becomes too powerful and may override the self-regulating capacity of the PFC. * Lonely: Humans are social animals, as we’ve pointed out. Connecting with supportive others helps strengthen our motivation and willpower. Those prone to addictive behaviors need to take steps to minimize lonely times. * Tired: Americans work longer hours than most other countries. Exhaustion is a common problem: We spend too much time at work, then go home fatigued, depleted, and exhausted. At home we then reward ourselves with that extra helping of ice cream, or worse, sometimes far worse. . . . I cannot offer specific hourly limits for you; this varies from one person to another and with the specific nature of the work activities. It is clear, however, that all of us have the potential to become depleted by our work, which weakens our willpower, increasing the risk of addictive behavior. Determine your personal limits for work and try to stick with them. * Sleep: Sleep at least eight hours each night. Most of us get less sleep than we need, and the quality of our sleep is often less than ideal. Poor sleep = suboptimal brain function; in particular, lowered PFC activity = impaired willpower. * Exercise: The benefits of exercise are well-known. They include improvement in cardiovascular status, reduction of anxiety and depression, and possible increase of D2 receptors, as mentioned earlier. Exercise also improves sleep quality—but don’t exercise too late in the day. Try exercising for forty-five minutes four or five days each week. Work up a sweat, walk briskly as if you’re in a hurry; do something to increase your heart rate and get your blood flowing. * Caffeine: Excessive caffeine use creates a roller-coaster effect of swings and crashes of mood and energy, which weakens self-control. To avoid these swings, limit yourself to two cups of coffee or less per day, or the equivalent. Some individuals should not consume caffeine after early morning because it interferes with quality sleep. * Alcohol: For those who do not have a problem with drinking, do not consume more than four alcoholic drinks per week. If you have an alcohol problem, abstinence is the best route. Alcohol lowers self-control by lowering blood glucose and by reducing self-awareness. In medical school, they taught us a pithy phrase: “The prefrontal cortex is the portion of the brain that dissolves in alcohol,” meaning that alcohol makes the PFC—the governor of the brain—less effective. * Friends: Choose your friends wisely. If you are looking to increase self-discipline, delay gratification, and set high goals and standards for yourself, you need to surround yourself with others who do the same. We become most like the people we associate with, so choose your friends well. * Twelve-Step Programs: Seriously consider participation in a twelve-step program if you struggle with addictions. If your sobriety is new, do “90 in 90”—attend ninety meetings in the first ninety days, and find a reliable sponsor as soon as you can."},{"pageContent":"[../image/64356.jpg]12[../image/64354.jpg]Healing the Hurting Brain and Body: Brain Injury and Medical ProblemsThanks to the press, the public is more aware than ever of traumatic braininjury (TBI) and its effects. You may have heard that individuals with TBI oftenseem to have personality problems, bad attitudes, anger dysregulation, orsubstance abuse problems. These are symptoms, all pointing to the underlyingproblem of brain injury. I’ve witnessed the impact firsthand. I’ve treatedsoldiers who served in Afghanistan and Iraq who were injured by rocket attacksand blasts from roadside bombs. Beyond wartime brain injury, there have alsobeen many reports about the effects of repeated blows to the head that retiredNFL players received over the course of their football careers. I’ve evaluatedand treated some of these players, superb athletes who are often reduced bytheir brain injuries to shells of their former selves. In fact, Amen Clinics hasdone the largest study of these former football players. The brain injury thatmany football players sustain is profound. But the good news is that manyimprove significantly with approaches to heal their injured brains.Moreover, TBIs aren’t something we see solely in vets and NFL players. As withBill, from Chapter 1, we are witnessing a silent epidemic in this country ofTBIs in young people. You don’t have to be knocked unconscious to experiencebrain trauma, and it’s not just NFL players and boxers who get injured brains.We are seeing traumatic brain injury in pee-wee league players, cheerleaders,soccer players, hockey players, skiers, and skateboarders.Maybe you’ve never done any of these activities. But we even see TBI in peoplewho don’t recall a significant head injury—sometimes it’s just a minor fall, ora two-year-old running into the coffee table. Even those who don’t recall asignificant blow to the head can have a TBI. And we often have to ask peoplefive or six times whether they had a head injury—often they will recall oneafter repeated questioning. Maybe it was that fall off the ladder. Or the fallyou took when you tripped over the dog’s toy. Maybe a mother dropped hersix-month-old infant—and never before told anybody because of her extreme guilt.Or maybe you just slipped, fell down, and whacked your head. That’s happened tous all.Unfortunately, we are seeing many people with TBI only years after the traumaticevents. Once the damage has been done, it may reveal itself in a number ofapparent psychiatric disorders, including ADHD, anxiety, and depression.Misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis of TBI, which is rampant, can result in greatsuffering, violence, and even suicide. It seems that hardly a month goes bywithout the tragic news of yet another suicide by an individual who sustained asport-related head injury and could not cope or function afterward.Further, it’s not just TBI that’s a problem. Physical brain injuries are justthe tip of the iceberg. Brain imaging reveals a whole host of ways in which ourbrains and bodies can be damaged that rarely show up as the culprit inpsychiatrists’—or physicians’—offices. Lyme disease, cysts, toxic substances,and other factors can injure the brain in ways that we may never have suspected.We see the symptoms in the psychiatric disorders, the suffering, and thefunctional impairment, but the symptoms may be misleading. To really help theseindividuals, we need first to address the root cause of their difficulties.As I’ve underscored earlier, most readers will not need SPECT scans to benefitfrom the approaches in Reclaim Your Brain. However, I would be remiss if Ididn’t talk about what SPECT can offer in select cases. Therefore, let me takethis opportunity to explain how SPECT works. Following that, we’ll look atdifferent types of brain injury that most people are not aware of.Brain SPECT ImagingSingle-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) measures blood flow to thebrain. To initiate a SPECT study, a small amount of radioactive tracer isinjected into a vein in the arm. Within a few minutes that tracer goes to thebrain and becomes fixed in the different brain areas. Areas of the brain thatare more active receive greater blood flow and thus more radioactive tracer.We’re technically measuring blood flow to various areas of the brain. Butbecause blood flow correlates so closely with brain activity, we’re alsomeasuring brain activity.A few minutes after receiving the tracer injection, the individual reclines forfifteen to twenty minutes in the scanner. Using the photons emitted from theradioactive tracer in the brain, computer software constructs a 3-D image ofbrain function, permitting us to make pictures of what the brain activity lookslike. The pictures show us areas of the brain that are too active, areas thatare not active enough, and areas that have activity that is where it should be.SPECT does not give us a diagnosis; rather, SPECT helps us ask better questionsso we can arrive at more informed ideas about why the brain is not functioningoptimally. These questions are prompted by areas of the brain that do not havethe degree of activity that we would expect.We typically do two scans—one with the brain at rest (the person is sittingcalmly and quietly), and one with the brain at work (the person is engaged in asimple computer test of attention and concentration). We compare the two scans.Differences between the resting and concentration scans provide us withimportant information about areas of the brain that are not functioningproperly. For example, with many forms of ADHD there is lower activity in thefront of the brain during the concentration scans as compared with the restingscans. With mood disorders, we often see greater activity throughout thebrain—especially in the limbic system—in the concentration scans as comparedwith the resting scans.SPECT imaging has shown us that physical brain injury is much more common thanwe would have realized. It also often shows us brain problems that we couldnever have known about any other way. For example, injuries to the temporallobe, the part of the brain behind the temple and above the ear where memoriesand feelings reside, can be detected by SPECT. Temporal lobe problems, which areotherwise difficult to detect, can contribute to mood and anxiety problems,learning problems, hallucinations, irritability, and rage problems. Temporallobe damage, when missed, often results in an individual being misdiagnosed andnot receiving the correct treatment. Recall that in my work with Bill, describedin Chapter 1, SPECT showed us previously undetected temporal lobe damage. BrainSPECT is not magic, but it often points to brain (and body) problems that wewould not have otherwise discovered.The stories that follow illustrate some of the unusual suspects, or the moresurprising types of damage that we’ve discovered—in some cases using SPECT, andin other cases using different means. This is the realm of the more seriouslyhurting and even damaged brains, including those with physical trauma, metabolicimbalances, inflammation, infections, and heavy metal toxicity. At this level,something is often seriously disordered in the way the brain functions.Understanding the nature of this brain dysfunction allows us to understand theseserious problems and then better target treatment. Various rehabilitation andhealing strategies can often restore hurting and broken brains like these,sometimes remarkably so. To reiterate, most readers will not have brain injuryas serious as most of these cases. On the other hand, my intention is toillustrate various brain problems that readers—or their caregivers—might nothave considered, especially when they don’t respond as expected to reasonableapproaches and interventions.PTSD and Brain InjuryNot surprisingly, a number of individuals with PTSD have also experienced braintrauma during the experience that caused the PTSD. To heal the PTSD, one mustalso heal brain injury when it is present. An injured brain is more easilyoverwhelmed by the traumatic experience, making it more likely that PTSD willdevelop. This situation is common in soldiers who were injured by roadside bombblasts in Iraq. Another common scenario is that of a woman who was in a horribleauto accident in which she hit her head against the windshield, injuring herbrain. She developed PTSD from witnessing her fellow passengers get killed. Andher brain injury makes it that much more difficult to process the emotionaltrauma. Brain areas commonly injured in a wartime bomb explosion or a horribleauto accident include the prefrontal cortex and the temporal lobes. These brainareas, because they are more vulnerable, are the ones most likely injured inmore common traumatic experiences such as auto accidents.Harold: Undetected Brain CystHarold was a boy for whom having a brain SPECT scan showed me a problem thatother doctors were not able to detect. Fourteen years old, small but stocky,Harold had been a relatively sweet-natured boy for his first twelve years.Around his twelfth birthday, his family began to notice Harold’s moodiness andirritability, which they had not seen before. Harold developed a simmeringnegativity that was always there, just beneath the surface. His irritabilityprogressed, and soon Harold was having several episodes each week during whichhe broke a lamp, punched a wall, or kicked a hole in a door. Therapy with acaring counselor did no good; the counselor told the family that Harold washaving “normal teenage issues.” Family therapy was problematic in that thefamily therapist blamed Harold’s parents for not setting good limits; in fact,firmer limits only worsened Harold’s rages. Psychiatrists prescribed severaldifferent classes of medication, with few benefits and significant side effects.His family brought Harold to see me when Harold tried to stab his father with akitchen knife in a fit of rage.Given his failure to respond to previous treatments, I recommended brain SPECT,and the family agreed. We were surprised to find on SPECT that Harold had alarge cyst, a fluid-filled sac, pressing on his left temporal lobe. Cysts likethis in the area of the left temporal lobe can give rise to problems just likeHarold had—moodiness, irritability, rage.I suggested to his family that Harold consult a neurosurgeon about having thecyst removed. The first surgeon they consulted declined to operate, saying thathe would operate only if and when the cyst caused “real” problems—as ifintermittent rages, destruction, and attempting to stab your father were notreal issues. Not giving up, I steered the family to another neurosurgeon, onemore sympathetic to the neuropsychiatric effects of temporal lobe cysts. Thissurgeon agreed to operate, and Harold had surgery a few weeks later. Followingremoval of the cyst, Harold’s moodiness, irritability, and rages disappearedcompletely—well, almost completely. He still was, after all, having “normalteenage issues.”Counseling, family therapy, and medications have limited or no impact onproblems caused by a cyst or a brain tumor. Harold and his family could have hadyears of psychotherapy without any benefit. Harold’s serious brain problem hadto be addressed first. Only then could effective psychotherapy and otherapproaches take over.Mercury, Carbon Monoxide, and Other ToxinsThirty-nine-year-old Clark had seemed to be an up-and-comer. He had breezedthrough medical school, completed a dermatology residency at a prestigiousuniversity, and started his own medical practice, which was booming. But thingsstarted not going well. Clark could no longer remember simple treatments anddifferential diagnoses. Unusual for him, he began forgetting the names oflongtime patients. And his staff told him that he had become irritable and curtwith them. At that point, Clark came to see me.Clark wanted to have his brain scanned. He was visually oriented, and for Clarka picture was worth a thousand words. I was surprised to find that Clark’s brainscans looked horrible, like somebody who had used hard-core drugs for a longtime—we call this SPECT pattern a toxic, scalloped appearance. I carefullyquestioned Clark about his use of street drugs or alcohol or abuse ofprescription drugs. I also asked him about his possible exposure to furniturerefinishing, unusual pesticides, or other toxins. Clark’s answer was “no” to allof these questions. Racking my brain, I asked Clark what he ate. Clark surprisedme when he told me that he loved sushi and had literally eaten sushi three timesa day for years!Sushi set off a lightbulb for me. I knew that sushi can contain mercury, and Itested Clark’s mercury levels; they were sky-high. Mercury is highly toxic. Wehad our answer. I referred Clark to a specialist in toxic metals, who helpedClark eliminate his mercury through chelation therapy, a treatment that removesheavy metals from the body, and infrared sauna treatment, which also removestoxins. Gradually at first, and then a bit more quickly, Clark’s cognitivefunctions returned to his previous high level and he became less irritable andabrupt with his staff.Clark’s case wasn’t the first time I’d encountered a problem with mercuryexposure. Years ago, I found that another of my patients had high mercury levelsbecause he spent hours hunting and fishing in swampy, marshy waters downstreamfrom a paper-processing plant. Investigating the problem, I learned that paperplants use lots of mercury and discharge the toxic, mercury-laden pollutantsinto the surrounding water. This patient, an avid hunter and fisherman, hadexperienced significant cognitive impairment because of his toxic level ofmercury.Mercury and lead are among the most toxic substances for humans and are oftennot considered in patients with cognitive impairment whose brains are obviouslynot working well. Aluminum is another one. A simple blood lead, mercury, oraluminum level is not adequate. A “provocation” test that measures the amount ofheavy metals in the urine is the most useful test to check for heavy metaltoxicity.Carbon monoxide is another toxin that I’ve found to have a devastating impact onbrain function. One patient, who lived in New England, had had a new oil-burningfurnace installed, but the technician did not properly vent the furnace to theoutside. Incredibly, over a period of two years, my patient was constantlyexposed to carbon monoxide exhaust from her furnace. Her brain SPECT had a toxicscalloped pattern and her cognitive function had deteriorated dramatically.Hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) saved her. HBOT is an important brain-healingtreatment that involves resting in a sealed chamber while oxygen is pumped inunder higher than atmospheric pressure (see www.ihausa.org for a list ofcenters). Another of my patients had similar problems from carbon monoxidebecause the exhaust system in the used car he purchased vented carbonmonoxide—which is odorless and colorless—into the passenger compartment of thecar. HBOT also helped him.Other patients we’ve seen with “toxic brains” include a man who breathed intoxic fumes from furniture refinishing, landscape workers poisoned by pesticideexposure, and patients with mold and biotoxin exposure. And we alsounfortunately see a toxic brain pattern in patients who receive chemotherapy forcancer; these problems are commonly called “chemo brain.” Finally, we’ve allheard about “huffing,” in which young people inhale gasoline and other solventsin order to get high. Don’t do it! These fat-loving organic solvents lodgethemselves in the fatty parts of the brain (yes, we are all “fat-heads,” with alot of fat between the ears). Brain SPECT pictures of huffers lookhorrible—among the most damaged brains we see.Toxicities are not just the result of man-made chemicals or elements known to beharmful such as mercury. Some of the most toxic substances for the brain areactually natural ones that many consider harmless. Alcohol is one example.Marijuana is another.Marijuana MikeMore times than I can count, a teenager or young adult patient comes to meextolling the virtues of smoking marijuana. Mike was one of these. In his earlytwenties, Mike reported lifelong anxiety and attention and focus problems thathe said were made better by smoking marijuana. Treatment with previouspsychiatrists had been relatively unsuccessful; they had given Mike variousmedications to try to calm his busy brain and improve focus. Mike said thatthese medications didn’t help much and caused all manner of side effects. Mikesaid that marijuana was the only thing that helped.Evolving laws legalizing marijuana may give marijuana users the mistakenimpression that marijuana is certified effective and totally safe. The realityis that for some individuals, marijuana seems to have an ideal calming effect.For others, certain strains of marijuana reportedly improve attention andconcentration, seemingly improving symptoms of ADHD.Yet when we do brain SPECT imaging on these individuals, we typically see loweractivity in the prefrontal and temporal cortex areas. So, while they feelbetter, their brain functions worsen and deteriorate even further over time withchronic marijuana use. Why does this happen? The prefrontal cortex and temporallobe areas seem especially sensitive to injury by toxins and other means. Isuspect it is because of the different cell types that the brain uses in thoseareas. These cells are evolutionarily newer and thus more easily damaged.Mike and others often want to argue with me, saying that it would be better tohave the driver in the car behind me be under the influence of marijuana thanalcohol. That’s probably true, but that doesn’t mean that marijuana is totallysafe for the brain. When we scanned Mike, we did see significantly loweractivity in his temporal lobe areas; his prefrontal cortex had lower activitytoo. And he had a diffuse scalloped pattern on SPECT, indicative of toxic braindamage. He was not helping his brain by smoking marijuana. Showing thesepictures to Mike was sobering for him, literally and figuratively.Health-conscious Mike wanted to live a healthy life, and the evidence from brainSPECT suggested big problems if he kept smoking.Gradually, I helped wean Mike from marijuana, and he was able to calm andbalance his brain using meditation, neurofeedback, and natural supplements. Hewas able to return to college, graduate, and obtain a good job as a hotelmanager. Mike eventually worked his way up the corporate ladder, achieving theposition of district manager with a nice salary, all the while staying offmarijuana. A repeat SPECT scan one year after stopping marijuana use showed thathis brain had healed significantly—the toxic pattern was gone and frontal andtemporal lobe activity was increased, which was a good sign.It should go without saying that other drugs that are commonly abused can have adevastating impact on brain function. These include alcohol; street drugs likecocaine, heroin, and Ecstasy; and prescription narcotics. Alcohol abuse cancause widespread damage to the brain, similar to other drugs of abuse. Even highamounts of caffeine can have a negative impact on the brain—caffeine stimulatesthe PFC, which many appreciate, but it is a vasoconstrictor, reducing blood flowto the brain, and it is a diuretic, dehydrating the brain.Individuals often select substances to abuse in order to try to balance anoveractive or underactive brain; they experience short-term relief of symptoms,but on the whole, abusing drugs and alcohol to try to balance one’s brain islike killing a fly on your dining room table with a sledgehammer. You may killthe fly, but there will be many splinters and other collateral damage on yourtable.Robert the SnorerSleep apnea is a condition that’s received much more publicity in recent years.Nowadays you even see travelers at airports carrying small cases with theircontinuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines. These machines are used tokeep increased air pressure pumping into the airways at night in order to keepthe airways open and patients breathing. What’s less well-known, however, is theimpact on the brain when the disorder goes untreated.Robert, a married father of three, struggled in his work at a marketing firm. Hecouldn’t keep up with the work, seemed “out of it,” and was disorganized.Robert’s job was on the line. He complained of never feeling refreshed when hewoke up. He said he had brain fog. Beth, his wife, worried about him but didn’tknow what she could do to help.I met with Robert and Beth to discuss his problems. Robert was down on himself.He berated himself for his job struggles: “I’m stupid, I’ll never be able tosucceed, I’m no good as a husband and provider.” What wasn’t clear was why hewas failing. Robert had a good education from a leading university andreportedly had a high IQ. He didn’t seem to have ADHD. What became clear wasthat Robert’s diet worsened as work stress increased. He ate more and more andgained more and more weight; with increased work demands, he stopped exercising.Now, at age thirty-six, Robert weighed fifty pounds more than he did when hegraduated from college.I inquired about Robert’s sleep. Beth told me that he didn’t always snore, butnow he snored constantly after gaining so much weight. It was so bad that sheslept in their guest room. I asked Beth if Robert stopped breathing duringsleep. “Oh, yes,” she said. He stopped breathing many times each night, oftengasping and choking. These were the clues I needed. I strongly suspected sleepapnea, which an overnight sleep study confirmed. Using the CPAP devicerecommended for his apnea, Robert slept much better and awoke more refreshed,and his brain fog disappeared. Robert’s job performance improved, and his jobwas no longer in jeopardy. Eventually, Robert improved his diet, began toexercise, and lost the fifty pounds he’d gained. He no longer needed his CPAPmachine following his weight loss.Undetected and untreated sleep apnea has a devastating impact on the brain.Sleep apnea should always be considered in patients like Robert who have gainedweight, have large necks, snore loudly, or stop breathing during sleep.Individuals with apnea simply do not get enough oxygen at night—a definite no-nofor the brain.Elizabeth in the Lyme LightAn often overlooked condition that can have a markedly negative effect on brainfunction is Lyme disease and its co-infections. Lyme disease has received morepress in recent years, but there is still much ignorance, even among medicalprofessionals, regarding the damage Lyme can do. I know from personalexperience.My daughter, Elizabeth, now twenty-eight, had a severe case of mono at agetwelve or thirteen. It was so severe that her pediatrician wanted to hospitalizeher. Eventually, Elizabeth recovered from the mono, sort of. What followed themono is clearer now in retrospect. But suffice it to say that for many years shestruggled, and for many years my wife and I felt totally lost as we tried tohelp Elizabeth.Following her mono, Elizabeth became much more moody and irritable. Typical teenstuff, some thought, including respected counselors, therapists, andpsychiatrists and other physicians whom we consulted. She complained ofdifficulty sleeping and wouldn’t get up for school; much later we realized thatthe “wouldn’t” was really “couldn’t.” Elizabeth complained of severe dailymigraine-type headaches and exquisite light sensitivity. I remember sitting in adimly lit restaurant with Elizabeth, who was wearing a pair of dark sunglasses;she reminded me of some paranoid patients who don’t want you to see their eyes.Elizabeth wasn’t paranoid, however.Off we went in search of headache relief. Neurologists, headache doctors,pediatric ophthalmologists, and sleep specialists were consulted, with minimalbenefit. The psychiatrists we consulted weighed in that Elizabeth seemeddepressed; maybe she was bipolar, they said. Here I was, myself a physician anda psychiatrist, and my wife an experienced nurse, and we couldn’t help mydaughter.Elizabeth continued to be moody and irritable. She often seemed pressured andspoke about all the jumbled thoughts in her head. Elizabeth was also weak andfatigued, had severe difficulty sleeping, and could not concentrate at school.Medical consultations continued. To no avail.By the time Elizabeth reached her early twenties, I began to notice that anumber of patients in my practice had Lyme disease. This was unfortunate for mypatients, but fortunate for us in that I began to notice similarities betweentheir complaints and the problems Elizabeth had. Moreover, her dog and horse hadhad Lyme. On a hunch, I called up a local Lyme expert, who said that he’d bewilling to evaluate Elizabeth. The result was that Elizabeth did have Lyme andlikely had had it for years. And she also had a number of the so-calledco-infections in addition to Lyme. Looking back, I believe that Elizabeth’s monoat age twelve or thirteen weakened her immune system so much that it made hersusceptible to Lyme and co-infections.Following her diagnosis we finally had answers and had something to treat. Hertreatment was and continues to be complicated. She received IV and oralantibiotics, supplements to boost her immune system and kill the Lyme and otherorganisms, hyperbaric oxygen treatment, and IV infusions of glutathione, Myers’Cocktails, and high-dose vitamin C. Elizabeth’s treatment has not been quick oreasy, but she is improving. I kick myself for not recognizing Lyme sooner, butmany physicians know little about Lyme; as best as I recall, it was nevermentioned when I attended medical school.Elizabeth has undergone multiple SPECT scans at my clinic, which have helped usmonitor her treatment. Her SPECT images show incredible overactivity in herlimbic system, which correlates with her moodiness and irritability. I believethat the overactivity is caused by her infections and treatments. Seeing theseimages enabled us all to understand Elizabeth’s behavior as well as show theneed for continued treatment. As Elizabeth’s treatment progressed, we didfollow-up SPECT scans that showed slow but steady improvement in her scans; herlimbic overactivity was reduced.Lyme disease and co-infections (Babesia, Bartonella, Rocky Mountain spottedfever, anaplasmosis, and others) can mimic or cause any medical, neurological,or psychiatric issues. For these reasons, we call Lyme “the great imitator.” Ihave seen Lyme present with issues that seem like ADHD, depression, bipolardisorder, anxiety, OCD, and psychosis. But if Lyme and co-infections arepresent, these issues often go away when the infections are treated.Individuals with Lyme are often exquisitely sensitive to the environment; theyfeel constantly assaulted by light, sounds/noise, and fragrances. Their brain isoverwhelmed and cannot process and manage the stimuli. Often they complain ofnoise in the brain. Many individuals with Lyme are disabled, not being able towork or attend school. They often are bereft of energy, don’t sleep well, andcomplain of brain fog.One woman with Lyme was so impaired that she struggled to say more than one ortwo words; she had been a research scientist prior to getting sick. Anotherpatient, a boy of eleven, developed severe OCD symptoms of excessive handwashing and fears of contamination within a week or two of getting infected withLyme following a tick bite.Blood tests for Lyme are unreliable. We often use the IGeneX lab in Palo Alto,California, for testing. IGeneX does much better testing for Lyme andco-infections than labs that do not specialize in Lyme—which have high rates offalse-negative results. Without intending to do so, I have become one of theleading experts in the use of brain SPECT imaging to diagnose and treat Lymedisease, having presented this information at a number of professionalconferences.There is much controversy in the medical field about whether chronic Lymedisease is a legitimate condition. I believe that it is legitimate. Lymeabsolutely must be considered in the differential diagnosis of most psychiatricissues. Unfortunately, the diagnosis is often missed, with tragic consequences.Importantly, it is likely that many individuals with the common diagnoses ofchronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and fibromyalgia have tick-borne infections likeLyme and its co-infections. Psychiatric experts of the future will needexpertise in diseases that infect and affect the brain, like Lyme and itsco-infections.Another condition that I see often in Lyme patients is Irlen syndrome, which mydaughter Elizabeth has as a result of her Lyme. It is to Irlen syndrome that wenow turn.Julie: Severe Headaches and Light SensitivityJulie, age twenty-four, single, and working as a receptionist in a dentalpractice, came to see me because of headaches. She had daily, severe, poundingmigraines. She also felt constantly overwhelmed, as if the environment wereassaulting her. Over the years, she consulted her internist, a neurologist, andtwo headache specialists. Medications for headaches helped the pain, but nothingseemed to prevent them. As is often typical when physicians struggle to find theanswer to a patient’s problems, her last doctor told Julie that he thought thatshe needed to see a psychiatrist.When I first met Julie, she was sitting alone in our waiting room wearingsunglasses. This was a little unusual, but she was not the only person to havedone that. Julie told me all about her saga of searching for help. Medications,injections in her scalp, biofeedback, psychotherapy, and diet changes had donelittle. She was still having daily, excruciating headaches. And she struggledwith extreme light sensitivity, especially in the dental office, which hadoverhead fluorescent lights.Julie found it depressing to have these headaches, but she was not depressed.Nor did she struggle with anxiety, ADHD, OCD, or other common psychiatricissues. Julie had good fortune in coming to me, because I know about Irlensyndrome. Irlen is a common visual-processing disorder. We see it in many peoplewith traumatic brain injury, autism, Lyme disease, and ADHD. And we can alsofind Irlen in people without any of those conditions. A tendency for Irlensyndrome can be inherited. Irlen has four key features: light sensitivity,especially to fluorescent lights; severe headaches; reading difficulties; anddepth perception issues.I explained Irlen syndrome to Julie and referred her to an Irlen specialist foradditional evaluation and treatment. Julie’s Irlen specialist confirmed thatJulie does have Irlen syndrome. Julie received the typical treatment for Irlensyndrome, which consists of “filters,” special color coatings on her eyeglasslenses. Coated contact lenses are also available. Immediately, when Juliereceived and started wearing her Irlen lenses, her headaches were reduced 99.9percent and her light sensitivity went away. She also found that she could readbetter and that words no longer ran together on the page as they had done beforeher Irlen lenses.Experience using brain SPECT shows remarkable overactivity in the limbic systemsof those who have Irlen syndrome. This overactivity is eliminated when theseindividuals wear their Irlen lenses. It’s a remarkable change. Irlen iscontroversial; not everybody “believes” in it, just like not everybody“believes” in Lyme disease. Some medical professionals, including optometristsand ophthalmologists, deny that Irlen syndrome is a valid condition. But I’veseen positive changes with treatment in many patients with Irlen syndrome.Anyone suspecting Irlen syndrome should look at the Irlen website(www.irlen.com), where helpful information and self-tests are available.Cynthia: Impact of Low Thyroid FunctionSometimes the problem isn’t that our brain has been literally damaged by atemporal lobe injury, toxicities, or other brain injuries. Sometimes, it isdysfunctions in other parts of our bodies that are causing a problem for ourbrain. For example, thyroid disorders are extremely common yet often goundetected. Similarly, the connection between thyroid problems and busy brainsis often missed. The result is frustrated patients trying to solve theirproblems through therapy who actually need to first heal their bodies, in thiscase their thyroids. Cynthia’s case is a good illustration.Cynthia, twenty-eight, was bubbly and smart. She had a passion to help the poorand started law school in order to devote herself to the legal needs ofunderprivileged children. But when Cynthia came to see me, she told me that shehad flunked out of law school. She couldn’t concentrate and had failed most ofher exams; the law school suggested an indefinite leave of absence.Like Sam, discussed later, Cynthia reported scattered and jumbled thinkingpatterns; at first, she, too, seemed to have ADHD. Her busy brain attackedCynthia for her failure at school with a constant stream of negativethoughts—“I’m a failure.” “I can’t do anything right.” I taught Cynthiatechniques to deal with her negative thoughts, but they did little good. I wouldeventually learn why these approaches failed. As I came to know Cynthia, shealso reported chronic depression, low energy, memory difficulties, dry skin,brittle hair, cold hands and feet, and constipation—common symptoms of lowthyroid function. I asked Cynthia to have screening bloodwork to check herthyroid and other issues. Her test results showed that Cynthia had low thyroidfunction and low iodine levels (which make it more difficult for the body tomake thyroid hormones).To deal with her thyroid issues, I asked Cynthia to optimize her diet, includingeliminating gluten, which is often associated with thyroid problems. Iprescribed thyroid hormones and iodine supplementation. Over six months, weoptimized the doses of her hormones and iodine. Gradually, Cynthia’s mood,energy, and memory improved. Her other symptoms of low thyroidfunction—constipation, cold extremities, dry skin, and brittle hair—alsoimproved. With improved thyroid function, the techniques for rewriting hernegative thoughts and stories finally worked.How does thyroid function affect our thoughts? To grasp the body-to-brainconnection here, it’s important to understand that the thyroid has a profoundimpact on all areas of the body, including the brain. Every cell in the nervoussystem has receptors for thyroid hormones. Thyroid hormones control a cell’smetabolism. And if thyroid hormones are lower, the metabolic rate goes down. Inother words, lower thyroid hormones lower your metabolic rate, which is likelowering the idle rate of the brain. The engine will run, but not at 100percent. When the thyroid doesn’t work well, the brain doesn’t work well. Peoplewith thyroid issues commonly report brain problems such as focus, attention,concentration, and memory issues.I wrote a letter to Cynthia’s law school, explaining that we now knew whyCynthia had had difficulty doing her coursework; it was because of thyroidproblems. Her law school agreed to give her another try, and she reenrolled thefollowing semester. Cynthia was able to complete her law school studies,graduate, and set up her own law practice helping immigrants with their legalneeds. I was pleased to play a part in her success. Cynthia’s case shows thatthyroid issues should be considered whenever patients complain of mood, energy,memory, constipation, cold extremities, and other symptoms of low metabolism. Ifthe thyroid doesn’t work right, the brain doesn’t work right.While Cynthia had low thyroid function due to an underactive thyroid gland,Edward, another patient who had difficulties responding to regular treatment,turned out to have an overactive thyroid. Both kinds of thyroid trouble cannegatively affect brain function.Edward: Overactive ThyroidEdward’s parents brought him to see me. They were desperate. Edward had periodicflare-ups of irritability, anger, and violence. He was anxious, constantlyagitated, and panicky and always seemed overwhelmed. There were more than a fewholes in the wall. Nearly two years in a residential treatment program hadfailed to put a dent in his problems. Home life was miserable; Edward’s parentsand sister walked on eggshells around him. Edward’s school performance wasabysmal. He wasn’t interested, didn’t or couldn’t pay attention, and was indanger of failing tenth grade. Importantly, Edward spoke about never feeling atpeace. His mind raced constantly, but he didn’t seem to have bipolar mania, andthere was no family history of bipolar disorders. For months I asked, prodded,cajoled, and begged Edward to do some blood tests. I especially wanted to checkhis thyroid function, because there was a strong family history of thyroidissues. But Edward refused; he seemed to be afraid of needles but wouldn’t admitit. Finally, after nearly a year of unsuccessful medication trials to calm hisbusy brain—unsuccessful because he always had major side effects—Edward agreedto do the blood tests I requested.The blood test results confirmed my suspicions. Edward had thyroid problems—buthis thyroid was overactive, too much activity. This was why his thoughts raced,he couldn’t concentrate, and he was so irritable. I referred Edward to anendocrinologist; there was no quick fix, but addressing Edward’s thyroidproblems eventually calmed his brain. Anger and rages decreased, family lifeimproved, and Edward did passably well at school. Edward’s overactive thyroidhad the impact of pouring gasoline on a fire. We needed to take away the fuelfor Edward’s fire.Other hormone issues also need to be considered in situations of obvious braindysfunction. For example, falling estrogen levels in menopause increases therisk of depression. Lower progesterone levels contribute to increased anxietyand sleep difficulty. And low testosterone levels in middle age and beyond,especially in men, contribute to depression, low energy, and loss of vitality,not to mention sexual drive and stamina, in this age group.Sam: More than ADHD—Vitamins, Nutrients, Hormones, and DietIn his midforties, Sam, married with two young sons, came to me for help withADHD. He’d had a successful career in the biotech field. Sam made a killing whenhis company went public; he’d sold his stock and was able to retire early. Luckyguy. Despite his good fortune, Sam struggled with what seemed to be typical ADHDissues: focus, attention, concentration, organization, and easy boredom.Motivation was a problem; Sam could never get himself to complete the tasks heset out for himself. These even included artistic goals he sought, such aslearning to play the piano and developing his earlier passion for oil painting.Sam also struggled with scattered thoughts that seemed to race at times in hismind, especially when he tried to sleep; Sam had a busy brain. He attackedhimself with a constant stream of negative thoughts along the lines of “What iswrong with me that I can’t do what I want and need to?” and “I can’t believewhat a failure I am.”Initially, Sam and I discussed lifestyle changes, such as steps to improve hissleep and the need to exercise. He knew that these were important but couldn’tget himself to do what we both knew that he needed to do. We decided to trymedication for ADHD. Adderall XR and Vyvanse provided some help, but still notenough.I began to hear Sam talk about low energy. At this point, I carefully exploredwith Sam what he ate. I was surprised to learn that he was a vegan—no meat orany animal products whatsoever. Sam had been a vegetarian since his teens buthad adopted a more rigorous vegan lifestyle six months earlier when one of hissons did the same. Knowing that vegetarians and vegans can have difficultyobtaining all the nutrients they need, I had Sam do a full bloodwork panel tocheck for vitamin and mineral deficiencies. What I found was that Sam had lowlevels of vitamins B12 and D, low testosterone, and low thyroid function. I hadSam take supplements to boost vitamins B12 and D, arranged for him to havetestosterone supplementation via weekly injections, and gave him a prescriptionfor Armour thyroid medication to boost his thyroid function. Low levels of B12,testosterone, and thyroid had negatively affected his energy and motivationbecause of their impact on the brain.After Sam had been on this new regimen for several months, his energy andmotivation increased significantly. I also suggested that he change back to avegetarian diet, which he did, thus improving his intake of essential nutrients.I then suggested that Sam avoid gluten, which is often associated with thyroidproblems. After making the diet changes and being on the supplemental vitaminsand hormones for four months, Sam was able to attain the response we wanted fromhis ADHD medication. Now the Vyvanse had its intended effect—significantlyimproved attention, focus, concentration, motivation, and the like. Sam couldthen actively pursue his piano studies and painting, and he could accomplish therepair jobs around the home that had heretofore stymied him. And, importantly,Sam’s busy brain was calmed.Sam’s story shows that there is often more than meets the eye. What at firstseemed to be a simple case of ADHD was much more than that. Sam didn’t respondto typical treatment because his body physiology was way out of balance.Hormones, minerals, and diet can significantly affect body—and brain—function,and need to be attended to if we aim to heal hurting individuals.My aim in Reclaim Your Brain is to help you calm your thoughts, heal your mind,and bring your life back under control. The primary emphasis has been on whatyou can do yourself, without professional assistance, to bring about thesepositive changes. Then why have I devoted so much space to addressing hurtingbrains and bodies? The reason is that many people—and their doctors—are notaware of the impact of physical brain injury, brain infections, toxicity,hormonal problems, and the other factors I’ve highlighted in this chapter. Ifyou don’t improve by using the strategies and Action Plans I’ve laid out foryou, seek professional help and consider whether one of the problems illustratedin this chapter is interfering with your healing.I repeat what I’ve said several times, that not everyone needs a brain scan. ButI also want to underscore that brain scans and other appropriate medical studiescan help you and your health professional “think outside the box,” to identifyreasons why you may not have found healing thus far for your brain and yourhealth."},{"pageContent":" Conclusion:Beyond Mind and BrainWhat do you think of Western civilization?” someone supposedly asked Gandhi. “Ithink it would be a good idea,” he replied.Eating, sleeping, reproducing, defending our territory, even conquering, weshare these fundamental behaviors with our primate ancestors, our animalcousins. But is there more to human beings, more to life? There should be more.Indeed, civilization becomes possible only when we attain some mastery of ourprimitive natures. It is our mind (PFC) that tames the primitive (limbicsystem), unleashing the flowering of human achievement: music, art, literature,science, philosophy, beauty, and spirituality.Yet despite the grand achievements of civilization, despite all that our mind isable to master and accomplish, most of us hurt and seek healing. We seek toassuage our pain. And we seek to transcend our own limitations. Some of us findrelief in art. Some in science. Some in a richer spiritual life.Note that I am not referring to the spirituality of traditional religiousinstitutions. Rather, I mean by spirituality that which goes beyond thematerial, beyond the concrete, really beyond ourselves—a way for each of us tobe in harmony within ourselves and others, despite faults, failings, and flaws.More emphasis on who and how we are, less emphasis on what we do. Somethinggreater than ourselves that can anchor us. Without that anchor, we may focusexcessively on ourselves, exacerbating our hurts and continuing to rev our busybrains. We seek purpose, to belong to something greater than ourselves.Spirituality can help us find that purpose and go beyond our biological destiny.Beyond mind and brain.Charles, in his midforties, came to me because of moderate depression. Married,a father of two girls and three boys, Charles had a good job as a seniorhealthcare recruiter. I had the opportunity to scan Charles using brain SPECT.When I saw Charles’s brain SPECT images, I was shocked. His brain lookedextremely unhealthy. I discussed with Charles what made his brain look so bad.Multiple head injuries from sports and seven years of heavy drug and alcoholabuse in his late teens and early twenties, he told me. But here was a puzzle:Charles’s brain looked like the brain of somebody who would be barely able tofunction. How was it that, apart from mild to moderate depression, he functionedwell at work, as a husband, and as a father? That’s what I asked Charles. Hetold me that when he met his wife, he joined her in her faith tradition of theSociety of Friends, the Quakers. It was his dedication to pacifism and thebetterment of society, and the structure of regular participation in Quakeractivities, that allowed Charles to overcome his poor brain function. Externalstructure and purpose overcame his unhealthy brain. Eventually, I was able tohelp Charles improve his brain and deal with his depression. But the key pointof his story is that the structure, love, and meaning he found in hisrelationship with his wife, her family, and their religious tradition helpedmightily to offset what should have been—and would have been—a debilitated life.Spirituality and purpose may allow us to transcend our brain limitations.Or consider the story of my French tutor, Madame Renelle Gannon. Born in Franceduring the Nazi occupation to a large, impoverished family, in difficultcircumstances, Madame Gannon at a young age dedicated herself to a profoundspiritual life, with many hours devoted each day to prayer and meditation. Thesespiritual practices give her life meaning, and she experiences her life’spurpose in helping others find their own spiritual path. The meaning and purposethat she has found have allowed her to escape what likely would have been a lifeof misery and depression.My intention in describing Charles and Madame Gannon is not to advocate thatreaders adopt this or that religious or spiritual tradition but to underscorethat finding our own individual meaning and purpose helps us rise abovepotentially unhealthy brains and difficult life circumstances. And an importantlesson seems to be that in helping others heal, we find purpose, go beyond thesolipsistic emphasis on self, and heal and grow ourselves. We can all becreators of something good. I think that is our purpose, and that can be ourlegacy.Your main job is to figure out the lifestyle—the schedule of daily and weeklypractices—that keeps your spiritual well filled up. Consider whatactivities—whether prayer, meditation, music, contact with like-minded people,spiritually focused readings, or time in nature—keep you emotionally andspiritually centered. What are the activities that reliably produce “spiritualfruits” of joy, gratitude, compassion, and acceptance of yourself and others?What are the choices that anchor you most effectively in your authentic self?Think about how you orient yourself to the world each day. What is the mind-set,the emotional and spiritual center, out of which you relate and function mosteffortlessly, meaningfully, joyfully, and fruitfully? This means: How do youwant to be in the world? Do you want to radiate positivity, support, love,energy, creativity, hope? If so, how can you best do that? It might mean makingsure that you have enough quiet time to center yourself through reading,writing, meditation, prayer, or walking in nature.What are your current priorities—your purposes—going into the next chapter ofyour life? Stop and form a mental picture of how you want your life to look inthe near future. Build on your mind-set and spiritual values to create a planthat will lead you successfully ahead, step by step. You may find that socialjustice is a passion; dedicating yourself to advocacy for social justice givesyou a purpose beyond yourself. Or you might be drawn toward immersing yourselfin a field of study, or broadening yourself with music, art, or literature.Perhaps you will seriously consider a career change. In the realm of yourrelationships, nurturing important friendships, being a more available andloving parent, and being a less critical, more supportive spouse may beimportant priorities.Think about who are you now and what’s most important in the upcoming phase ofyour life. To carry out your spiritual priorities, think about whether you willneed to make changes in your relationships, work, schooling, finances, andphysical and emotional health. What will you need to do to be able to fulfillyour mission or calling? What could you do today or this week to begin to embedthose spiritual priorities and purposes you’ve just clarified into your life, sothat you experience an ongoing, deep sense of purpose and meaning, rather thanhaving it be a rare or random experience? For example, if your goal is to setaside time for reading and meditation, start with thirty minutes a week. Findthe thirty minutes by unplugging from your electronics. Expand beyond thirtyminutes as the weeks go by.“The only thing worse than being blind is having sight but no vision,” saidHelen Keller. In conducting this spiritual survey of your life, the importantthing is that you decide what gives your life joy and meaning. What is yourvision? Reflecting and clarifying for yourself what stance toward your lifeyields spiritual fruit, joy, and purpose, and participating in something greaterthan yourself takes time, but the investment will be worth it. You might decideto make a written contract with yourself, using the SMARTER goals approachdiscussed earlier. And sharing your intentions with those close to you may helpyou keep on the path toward fulfilling your spiritual goals.It’s so easy to be caught up in the daily to-and-fro of life and to be waylaidby our busy brains. But we can choose to address our negativity, to rewrite ourstories, to live mindfully, and to improve our relationships. We can move beyondthe mundane and beyond our busy brain. We can reclaim our brains by managing ourminds and balancing our brains. We can bring our lives back under control. Andthrough developing our own spiritual meaning and purpose, we can transcend thelimitations of our minds and brains."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX[../image/64356.jpg]A[../image/64354.jpg]Nutritional SupplementsPlease consult your healthcare professional before starting any supplement.5-HTP: Use for depression, insomnia, OCD, pain intolerance, migraines, andfibromyalgia pain. Start with 50 mg twice a day; increase the dose after severaldays to 100 mg twice daily, and then if needed increase again to 150 mg twicedaily. This supplement begins to work quite quickly, in most cases withinseveral days. Sometimes we add 500 to 1,000 mg of L-tryptophan for additionalboosting of serotonin, especially for insomnia. By boosting serotonin levels inthe brain, 5-HTP calms limbic system (including anterior cingulate gyrus)hyperactivity. We often suggest using 50 mg of vitamin B6 daily because thisvitamin is essential for converting amino acids into serotonin. The most commonside effect of 5-HTP is an upset stomach, although this is usually mild. Stomachupset can be improved by starting 5-HTP slowly and increasing the dose as youget used to the supplement; taking 5-HTP with food also helps minimize stomachupset.GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid): Use for calming the brain, anxiety, mood swings,irritability, and temper. GABA is usually taken in doses ranging from 250 to1,500 mg daily for adults. For best effect, the daily dose of GABA should bedivided among two or three daily doses. Start at 750 mg once or twice a day andincrease as needed. On occasion, we have used daily doses as high as 5,000 or6,000 mg. GABA does not seem helpful for every patient, possibly because it isnot always well absorbed and has difficulty crossing the blood-brain barrier.There are few side effects, apart from sedation.Ginkgo Biloba: Use for ADHD, focus, concentration, memory, and mental sharpness.Take 60 to 120 mg twice daily. Ginkgo can thin your blood, which is usually agood thing. Mention that you are using it if you are going to have surgery.Glutamine: Use to calm the brain and reduce cravings. Take 500 mg twice daily.Twinlab brand seems to be a good one.Glycine: Use for stuckness/OCD and cravings. Take 500 to 3,000 mg/day in divideddoses. We usually recommend taking it with food. At higher doses, you may noticea “dirty sock smell,” which comes from the sulfur in glycine.Inositol: Use for depression and stuckness/OCD. Take up to 12,000 mg/day fordepression and up to 18,000 mg/day for stuckness/OCD.L-theanine: Use for anxiety, insomnia, stress, and focus. The usual dose is 200mg three or four times per day. You can take higher doses if you find it useful.There are no known adverse reactions. Keep some at your bedside to use in theearly morning if you wake up too early. Pregnant women and nursing mothersshould avoid L-theanine supplements. Children over age six can use theanine, butstart with 100 mg twice daily.L-tyrosine: Use for ADHD, focus, energy, motivation, and depression. For thefirst three days, take 500 mg before breakfast, midmorning, and thenmidafternoon. After three days increase to 1,000 mg before breakfast,midmorning, and midafternoon. Take on an empty stomach.Lemon Balm: Use for anxiety. The daily dose is 600 mg. Lemon balm is an herbfrom the mint family. It has no significant side effects.Magnesium: Use for anxiety, insomnia, and stress. I often recommend Tri-Mag 300(by DaVinci Labs, with which I have no financial or other relationship). Startwith two capsules twice daily and increase the dose every day or two until yourstools become loose. Then reduce the dose slightly.Melatonin: Use for mild to moderate insomnia associated with anxiety andpossibly even anxiety and depression apart from insomnia. Doses typically rangefrom 0.5 to 10 mg taken thirty to sixty minutes before bedtime. Melatonin seemsmore useful for difficulty falling asleep than difficulty staying asleep. Thosewho have difficulty staying asleep should use a melatonin preparation that isformulated for extended release. Occasionally there can be a “hangover” the nextmorning; other side effects can include headache or vivid dreams, but theseoccur rarely.NAC (N-acetylcysteine): Use for stuckness/OCD. Doses for this widely usedantioxidant are 600 to 1,200 mg twice daily.Omega-3 fatty acids: Use for anxiety, depression, mood stability, and overallbrain health. I recommend obtaining a fish oil product that contains both EPAand DHA (look on the label). Aim for a more or less 3:2 ratio of EPA:DHA. Add uphow much EPA and DHA is in a capsule or a dose of the liquid concentrate. Take3,000 mg/day of the total of EPA and DHA. Side effects can include bloating,loose stools, and “fish burp.” Individuals taking omega-3 supplements may alsoexperience increased bruising and mildly prolonged bleeding times—it is a bloodthinner, which is why cardiologists recommend it. Individuals using bloodthinner medication can still take omega-3 supplements, but they should consulttheir physician prior to starting omega-3 supplements.Passionflower: Use for anxiety. The dosage is 90 mg/day. Side effects areminimal.Phosphatidylserine (PS): Use for memory, learning, and ADHD. Take 300 mg/day.Many PS products are derived from soy and can cause reactions in those sensitiveto soy.SAMe: Use for depression, low energy, and ADHD. Start at 200 or 400 mg/day andthen increase the daily dose gradually, if tolerated, by approximately 200 mgper week. A person may start seeing some benefit at 200 to 400 mg but mayrequire 1,600 mg or more per day. It works best when taken at least twenty tothirty minutes before breakfast and lunch on an empty stomach. If taken later inthe day it may interfere with sleep. In higher doses it can cause insomnia andrestlessness. Individuals with features of bipolar disorder should use SAMe withcaution, because it can cause mood swings or mania.St. John’s wort: Use for depression and stuckness/OCD. Start at 600 mg in themorning and 300 mg at night. If needed, the dose may be increased slowly to1,800 mg daily. Wear sunscreen, because St. John’s wort increases the risk ofsunburn. Other side effects can include nausea and loose stools. St. John’s wortcan decrease the effectiveness of other medications, including birth controlpills and blood thinners. It can bring on mania in individuals who have bipolardisorder.Vitamin D: Use for depression and mood cycling (bipolar disorder). Aim for ablood level between 60 and 100. I often recommend that people take 5,000 to10,000 IU/day of over-the-counter vitamin D3. The prescription vitamin Dsupplements given by physicians seem to work less well."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX[../image/64356.jpg]B[../image/64354.jpg]MedicationsPlease consult your healthcare professional before starting any medication.Abilify: Use for depression and psychosis. Abilify is not strictly anantidepressant but is helpful as an add-on to antidepressants in some cases.Adderall/Adderall XR: Use for ADHD. These stimulant medications increasedopamine and boost function in the prefrontal cortex. They are often quiteeffective. Some teens and young adults abuse them. There are some side effects(insomnia, appetite suppression). In cases of severe abuse, the individual canbecome psychotic.Amantadine: Use for ADHD. Amantadine is less effective than stimulants likeAdderall XR.Anafranil: Use for OCD. Take as much as 250 mg/day. Side effects include loweredsex drive and difficulty attaining sexual arousal and orgasm.Ativan: Use for anxiety, calming, and sleep. Ideally, Ativan is used only on ashort-term basis. Physical dependence can develop when benzodiazepinemedications like Ativan are used regularly for a few weeks. Common side effectsof the benzodiazepines include sedation and coordination problems. Thesemedications also negatively affect memory. They are useful for short-termanxiety but carry addictive potential. They also deaden feelings, which can workagainst healing of emotional traumas.BuSpar: Use for anxiety. BuSpar is useful in cases of mild anxiety when theindividual has never used a benzodiazepine medication. Side effects aregenerally minimal. Unfortunately, the therapeutic benefit for anxiety is alsominimal.Clonidine: Useful for sleep in ADHD busy brains and for overall calming ofhyperactive individuals with ADHD. Clonidine is also helpful for treatingnightmares in PTSD.Concerta: Use for ADHD. Concerta is a longer-acting stimulant and is often notquite as effective as Vyvanse or Adderall.Cymbalta: Use for depression, anxiety, chronic pain, and sometimes OCD. Sideeffects include lowered sex drive and difficulty attaining sexual arousal andorgasm.Depakote: Use for bipolar disorder, anxiety, anger/rage, mood stabilization, andtemporal lobe problems. The doctor will need to monitor blood tests when usingDepakote.Desipramine: Use for ADHD and depression. This is an older antidepressant withsome usefulness for ADHD. Children should have an electrocardiograph (EKG)before use because desipramine can affect heart rhythms, and we need to makesure their heart is healthy enough to tolerate a trial of this medication.Effexor/Effexor XR: Use for anxiety, depression, and OCD. Common side effectsinclude difficulties with sexual function, as with Cymbalta, andgastrointestinal effects. Effexor can be difficult to stop because ofsignificant withdrawal symptoms that some individuals experience.Focalin/Focalin XR: Use for ADHD. This drug is similar to Concerta.Intuniv: Use for ADHD and to reduce brain overactivity. Intuniv helps withcalming ADHD. It is not as useful as stimulants. It provides some benefit forsleep in ADHD.Klonopin: Use for anxiety and sleep. Klonopin is similar to Ativan, butlonger-acting and causing more sedation.Lamictal: Use for bipolar disorder, anxiety, anger/rage, mood stabilization, andtemporal lobe problems. Lamictal has few side effects for most patients. I findthat the generic version of Lamictal made by Teva often does not work well formy patients.Lexapro: Use for depression, anxiety, panic attacks, and OCD. Lexapro has thefewest side effects of any SSRI medication. The most common side effects aresexual, including lowered sex drive and difficulty attaining sexual arousal andorgasm. Other side effects include nausea and headaches. Doses that are too highcan inappropriately deaden feelings, interfering with the work of healing fromtrauma.Lithium: Use for bipolar disorder and as an add-on in the treatment ofdepression. Lithium is the gold standard treatment for bipolar disorders, likelythe most effective medication.Neurontin: Use for sleep, anxiety, and chronic pain. Neurontin is very sedatingat first, so start with 100 mg at bedtime.Nuvigil: Use for ADHD, narcolepsy, fatigue, and low energy in multiple sclerosisand in depression. Nuvigil is a cousin of Provigil.Paxil: Use for depression, anxiety, panic attacks, and OCD. Paxil is a “dirty”medication, meaning it has the most side effects of any SSRI, including lots ofsedation and sexual side effects. Because of its significant side effects, andbecause other SSRI medications work as well or better than Paxil works, in myopinion there is no practical reason to use it.Prazosin: Use for sleep and nightmares, especially with trauma.Pristiq: Use for depression, anxiety, and OCD. Pristiq is a relative of Effexorbut probably easier to discontinue. It has side effects similar to those ofEffexor, but they are probably milder.Propranolol: Use for anxiety, especially public-speaking and performanceanxiety. This is a blood pressure medication with few side effects at the lowdoses we use for anxiety.Provigil: Similar to Nuvigil.Prozac: Use for depression, anxiety, panic attacks, and OCD. Prozac was thefirst SSRI; it is also the longest-acting SSRI and can be used effectively tocross-taper other SSRIs. It has more side effects than Lexapro or Zoloft.Risperdal: Use for bipolar disorder, mood instability, anger, rage, psychosis,and severe OCD and PTSD. Risperdal often has significant side effects of weightgain and increases in blood lipids and blood glucose.Seroquel: Use for insomnia, bipolar disorder, mood instability, anger, rage,psychosis, and severe OCD and PTSD. Seroquel often has significant side effectsof weight gain and increases in blood lipids and blood glucose. It is used quiteoften for sleep, too often in my view.Strattera: Use for ADHD. Strattera has low abuse potential, but it is not veryuseful in my experience and often has side effects, including urologicalproblems in males and mood instability.Tenex: See Intuniv. Intuniv is a slightly longer-acting version of Tenex.Topamax: Use for sleep, nightmares, and binge eating. Topamax is so sedating forsome patients that we have a nickname for it—“Dopamax,” because it makesindividuals feel dopey.Trileptal: See Depakote and Lamictal, for which Trileptal has similar uses, butTrileptal tends to be less effective. It has few side effects apart from lowsodium levels in a small percentage of patients.Vyvanse: Use for ADHD. Vyvanse is the longest-acting and smoothest stimulantavailable. Insurance companies are reluctant to cover it because no generic isavailable and it is more expensive than other stimulants that are available ingeneric form.Wellbutrin: Use for depression, ADHD, smoking cessation (available as Zyban),and sometimes anxiety. It has no sexual side effects, in contrast to the SSRImedications.Xanax: See Klonopin, to which is it similar, but Xanax is shorter-acting andmore likely than Klonopin to cause “rebound” anxiety and insomnia when it wearsoff. Xanax is an effective medication, but patients can easily become dependenton it.Zoloft: See Lexapro, to which Zoloft is quite similar.Zyprexa: See Risperdal."},{"pageContent":"ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHYHere I list authors and books that particularly influenced me, either during thecourse of my career or more recently during the work of writing Reclaim YourBrain. Although this list is not in any way a systematic review, readersinterested in learning more about the topics I covered may benefit frominvestigating the authors and works below.Chapter 1: Balancing the BrainAmen, Daniel. Change Your Brain, Change Your Life: The Breakthrough Program forConquering Anxiety, Depression, Obsessiveness, Anger, and Impulsiveness. NewYork: Three Rivers Press, 1998. This is Daniel Amen’s first major publication,one that set the stage for his subsequent work. CYBCYL, as we affectionatelycall it, will be reissued as a new edition in late 2015. CYBCYL is agroundbreaking work that will show you much about why you need to understand howyour brain works and what you can do about it.Barkley, Russell. Executive Functions: What They Are, How They Work, and WhyThey Evolved. New York: Guilford, 2012. Barkley is a key researcher in thefields of executive function and ADHD. Not recommended for the general publicbut useful for academics and mental health professionals.Cozolino, Louis. The Neuroscience of Psychotherapy: Healing the Social Brain.New York: Norton, 2012; and The Neuroscience of Human Relationships: Attachmentand the Developing Social Brain. New York: Norton, 2006. Cozolino is a brilliantwriter and clinician. Engaging and readable, his works are to be savored. I’veused them in some of the courses I’ve taught. You will learn much about how thebrain is wired to optimize social relations and especially about the importanceof early attachment.Damasio, Antonio. The Feeling of What Happens: Body and Emotion in the Making ofConsciousness. New York: Harcourt Brace, 1999; and Self Comes to Mind:Constructing the Conscious Brain. New York: Pantheon, 2010. Damasio’s work isbreathtaking in its scope. His writing can be difficult-going and often is bestread in the context of a study group, but Damasio’s thinking is of the highestlevel. Read Damasio if you want to be challenged by the thinking of one of theworld’s best neuroscientists.Goldberg, Elkhonon. The New Executive Brain: Frontal Lobes in a Complex World.New York: Oxford University Press, 2009 (paperback). Goldberg is a witty andthoughtful writer. It is very much worth the time to read him. Goldberghelpfully describes how a well-functioning PFC is the CEO of the brain and whatgoes wrong when the PFC doesn’t work well. He also movingly writes about growingup in the Soviet Union and his apprenticeship with the renowned Russianpsychologist Alexander Luria. Goldberg ultimately made the painful decision todefect from the Soviet Union, which required great courage.LeDoux, Joseph. The Emotional Brain: The Mysterious Underpinnings of EmotionalLife. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1996; and Synaptic Self: How Our Brains BecomeWho We Are. New York: Viking, 2002. LeDoux is a brilliant researcher who hasdone fundamental work on primitive memory and anxiety systems. He is quitereadable and compellingly writes about the practical and human applications ofbasic neuroscience research.Schwartz, Jeffrey, and Sharon Begley. The Mind and the Brain: Neuroplasticityand the Power of Mental Force. New York: HarperCollins, 2002 (paperback).Schwartz has written widely and is admired for his research and the scope of hiswritings.Siegel, Daniel. The Developing Mind: How Relationships and the Brain Interact toShape Who We Are. New York: Guilford, 1999. This is a classic, a real gem, butmore for professionals than the lay audience.Chapter 2: Conquering NegativityBeck, Aaron, et al. Cognitive Therapy of Depression. New York: Guilford, 1979.Beck is the father of CBT. He has written many books on the subject that clearlypresent the theory and practical application of his ideas. My ideas aboutnegativity and rewriting stories are related to how one approaches negativethinking in CBT.Cozolino, Louis. See the Chapter 1 bibliography.Chapter 3: Rewriting Your StoriesKatie, Byron. Loving What Is: Four Questions That Can Change Your Life. NewYork: Harmony, 2002. This is a key book for my approach to addressing negativityand rewriting stories. I really do think this book can change your life for thebetter.Newberg, Andrew, and Mark Robert Waldman. Words Can Change Your Brain: 12Conversation Strategies to Build Trust, Resolve Conflict, and Increase Intimacy.New York: Hudson Street Press, 2012 (Kindle). Newberg is a noted brainresearcher, a proponent of structural brain imaging, and a noted writer onreligious and spiritual issues as they apply to the brain. His writings are morefor professionals than the lay audience, although he is often in the newsbecause of his work on spirituality (“the God Spot”). See the Chapter 4bibliography for other Newberg titles.Schafer, Roy. A New Language for Psychoanalysis. New Haven, CT: Yale UniversityPress, 1976; and Retelling a Life: Narration and Dialogue in Psychoanalysis. NewYork: Basic, 1992. Schafer is a brilliant psychoanalytic theoretician andteacher. I love this book because he attempts to jettison all of thepsychoanalytic jargon that has hindered the development of psychoanalysis. Onlyfor mental health professionals.Schwartz, Jeffrey, and Rebecca Gladding. You Are Not Your Brain: The 4-StepSolution for Changing Bad Habits, Ending Unhealthy Thinking, and Taking Controlof Your Life. New York: Avery, 2011. This is an important book for showing howthinking can change the brain. Schwartz’s ideas influenced my thinking about howto rewrite stories.Chapter 4: Becoming MindfulAndreas, Jamie. The Principles of Correct Practice for Guitar: The Perfect Startfor Beginners, and the Answer to the Problems of Players. Woodstock, NY: GuitarPrinciples, 1999; and The Deeper I Go the Deeper It Gets: Meditations on Lifeand Guitar. Woodstock, NY: Jamey World, 2004. Andreas is a gifted guitarteacher, but she also writes movingly about life and mental health. Guitarplayers, other musicians, and nonmusicians would enjoy the Meditations book.Csikszentmihalyi, Mihaly. Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience. New York:Harper and Row, 1990; and Finding Flow: The Psychology of Engagement withEveryday Life. New York: Basic, 1998. These books are both classics.Davidson, Richard, and Sharon Begley. The Emotional Life of Your Brain: How ItsUnique Patterns Affect the Way You Think, Feel, and Live—and How You Can ChangeThem. New York: Hudson Street Press, 2012 (Kindle). Davidson is an importantresearcher on the emotions and mindfulness.Kramer, Garret. Stillpower: Excellence with Ease in Sports and Life. New York:Atria/Beyond Words, 2012. I love the idea of stillpower.Newberg, Andrew, et al. How God Changes Your Brain: Breakthrough Findings from aLeading Neuroscientist. New York: Ballantine, 2010 (Kindle); and Principles ofNeurotheology. Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2010. Great work, but not easy going,especially the second one. Only for academics or mental health professionals.Siegel, Daniel. The Mindful Brain: Reflection and Attunement in the Cultivationof Well-Being. New York: Norton, 2007; and The Mindful Therapist: A Clinician’sGuide to Mindsight and Neural Integration. New York: Norton, 2010. Siegel haswritten widely on mindfulness.Sterner, Thomas. The Practicing Mind: Bringing Discipline and Focus into YourLife. Wilmington, DE: Mountain Sage, 2005. I love this little book. Find it, buyit, read it. It really influenced some of my ideas about mindfulness.Tolle, Eckhart. The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment. Vancouver:Namaste, 1997. Many find this book unreadable, but I do think that Tolle isspeaking to an unmet longing. Thanks to Oprah, he’s become a rock star ofspirituality. I included this book because Byron Katie’s work, Loving What Is,mentioned earlier, is really the “how-to” manual for what Tolle is trying toteach readers in The Power of Now.Chapter 5: Righting RelationshipsArtiss, Kenneth. Therapeutic Studies. Rockville, MD: Psychiatric, 1986. Artissdeveloped the little-known vertical and horizontal relationship paradigms that Idiscussed in this chapter. I think that only mental health professionals wouldfind Artiss’s work interesting.Berne, Eric. Games People Play. New York: Grove, 1964. A hit from years ago. Anice review of relationship patterns. ’Nuff said.Cozolino, Louis. See the Chapter 1 bibliography.Havens, Leston. Making Contact: Uses of Language in Psychotherapy. Cambridge,MA: Harvard University Press, 1986; and A Safe Place: Laying the Groundwork ofPsychotherapy, Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1996. Making Contact ismy favorite book about how to do psychotherapy. Havens had a knack for findingunusual ways to express things that others had seen before but had not graspedwell. Although the book is written for mental health professionals,nonprofessionals interested in how minds and relationships work will benefitfrom Havens’s writings.Ogden, Thomas. The Matrix of the Mind: Object Relations and the PsychoanalyticDialogue. New York: Aronson, 1993; and Projective Identification andPsychotherapeutic Technique. New York: Aronson, 1977. These are just two ofOgden’s many books. For a psychotherapist or psychoanalyst, his works aretop-notch. Others will find them heavy going.Wallin, David. Attachment in Psychotherapy. New York: Guilford, 2007. This is adifficult-to-read but important book about the importance and nuances ofattachment. It is intended only for professionals.Chapter 6: Bored Brains, Excitable Brains: ADHDAmen, Daniel. Healing ADD: The Breakthrough Program That Allows You to See andHeal the 7 Types of ADD. New York: Berkley, 2013. Daniel Amen at his best. Thisbook is great for learning about different ADHD subtypes and why some treatmentsfail.Cain, Susan. Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking.New York: Broadway Paperbacks, 2013. I loved this book. It was very helpful tome in thinking about managing arousal. Most people will find this bookinteresting.Palladino, Lucy Jo. Find Your Focus Zone: An Effective New Plan to DefeatDistraction and Overload. New York: Free Press, 2007. This book helped me thinkthrough my ideas about stimulation and brain arousal patterns.Chapter 7: Heart Matters: AnxietyAron, Elaine N. The Highly Sensitive Person: How to Thrive When the WorldOverwhelms You. New York: Broadway Books, 1996 (paperback). I love this book,probably because it resonates with my own temperament. It helped me thinkthrough ideas about stimulation and arousal. Read it if you or a loved one ismore sensitive than the average person.McCraty, Rollin, et al. The Coherent Heart: Heart-Brain Interactions,Psychophysiological Coherence, and the Emergence of System-Wide Order. BoulderCreek, CA: HeartMath, 2006.Paddison, Sara. The Hidden Power of the Heart: Discovering an Unlimited Sourceof Intelligence. Boulder Creek, CA: HeartMath, 1998. There is significantoverlap among the various publications I’ve listed here on HeartMath.Nonetheless, they present interesting information that will be unknown to mostreaders.Pearce, Joseph Chilton. The Heart-Mind Matrix: How the Heart Can Teach the MindNew Ways to Think. Rochester, VT: Park Street Press, 2012.Rozman, Deborah, and Doc Childre. Transforming Anxiety: The HeartMath Solutionfor Overcoming Fear and Worry and Creating Serenity. Oakland, CA: New Harbinger,2006.Servan-Schreiber, David. The Instinct to Heal: Curing Depression, Anxiety, andStress Without Drugs and Without Talk Therapy. New York: Rodale, 2004(paperback). This is a nice book that helped me sort out HRV and EMDR issues.Chapter 8: Mood Matters: DepressionAmen, Daniel, and Lisa Routh. Healing Anxiety and Depression. New York: Berkley,2003. This book is good for subtyping anxiety and depression.Beck, Aaron, et al. Cognitive Therapy of Depression. New York: Guilford, 1979.See the Chapter 2 bibliography.Burns, David. Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy. New York: Avon, 1980, 1999.This is probably the most-recommended self-help book for patients by mentalhealth clinicians. It is a great “how to” book on do-it-yourself CBT fordepression—very easy to read and simple to use.Frank, Ellen. Treating Bipolar Disorder: A Clinician’s Guide to Interpersonaland Social Rhythm Therapy. New York: Guilford, 2005. This book presentsimportant research on IPSRT. It is intended mainly for clinicians.Kramer, Peter. Listening to Prozac. New York: Penguin, 1994.

Shadow Syndromes: The Mild Forms of MajorMental Disorders That Sabotage Us. New York: Pantheon, 1997. This good bookhelped me think about the function of milder stuckness vis-à-vis socialfunctioning.Schwartz, Jeffrey. You Are Not Your Brain: The 4-Step Solution for Changing BadHabits, Ending Unhealthy Thinking, and Taking Control of Your Life. New York:Avery, 2011 (Kindle). People seem to like this book and benefit by using it ontheir own to tackle stuckness.Chapter 10: Branded in the Brain: Emotional Trauma and PTSDChurch, Dawson. The EFT Manual (3rd ed.). Fulton, CA: Energy Psychology, 2014(Kindle). Church is a leading figure in EFT.Ortner, Nick. The Tapping Solution: A Revolutionary System for Stress-FreeLiving. Carlsbad, CA: Hay House, 2013. A readable and helpful book about EFT.Roberts, Monty. Horse Sense for People. New York: Penguin, 2002 (paperback).Love the book, love the man.
