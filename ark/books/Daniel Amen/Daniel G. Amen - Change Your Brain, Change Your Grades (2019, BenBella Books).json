Do you feel like you should be getting better grades? 2. Does schoolwork stress you out? 3. When you need to study, does it take longer than you’d like becauseeverything is so disorganized? 4. Are you spending more time studying than the A students in yourclass but not getting the same results? 5. Do you study so much you miss out on other things you’d like to do? 6. Are you heading back to school after a long break and need arefresher to get more done in less time? 7. Do you feel like you’re failing in your academic life? 8. Would you love some simple, practical tips to make studying easier,to feel more confident in your abilities, and to actually start to enjoy thelearning process?If you answered yes to any of these questions, this book is for you.All of the great writers about success—think Ben Franklin, Dale Carnegie,Stephen Covey, and Sheryl Sandberg—have overlooked the most important secret ofsuccess, because they did not have the technology to see it. Based on theworld’s largest brain imaging database, we now know that success and failureeverywhere in life starts, and is maintained, between your ears, in themoment-by-moment functioning of your brain.Your brain is involved in everything you do and everything you are, includinghow you think, feel, act, and interact with others. Your brain is the organ oflove, learning, personality, character, and every decision you make. Afterlooking at more than 150,000 brain scans over the last 30 years, I have learnedthat when your brain works right, you work right—whether we’re talking aboutschool, work, relationships, money, health, or anything else. Likewise, whenyour brain is troubled for whatever reason, you are much more likely to havetrouble in your life. Get your brain right and learning will be much easier foryou.I will admit that I was merely an average student in middle school and highschool, but I went on to graduate near the top of my class in college andmedical school. How did I do it? I used my brain to develop simple strategiesthat allowed me to study and learn more efficiently. If I can do it, you can,too.Change Your Brain, Change Your Grades draws on my experience as a neuroscientistand psychiatrist, as well as the latest brain science, to help you study moreeffectively, learn faster, and stay focused so you can achieve your academicgoals. It is also based on a brain health program I created with Dr. Jesse Paynethat teaches students how to love and care for their brains. Called Brain Thriveby 25 (www.brainthriveby25.com [http://www.brainthriveby25.com]), it has beentaught in all 50 states and seven countries. In the course, we include lessonson basic brain facts, the developing brain, gender differences, the impact ofdrugs and alcohol on the brain, nutrition, stress management, killing ANTs(automatic negative thoughts), and how to throw a brain healthy party. A popularcourse, it has changed the lives of those who take it.Many of the regions of the brain are involved in determining if a student willbe successful or be stuck struggling to graduate. In chapter 1[Chapter01.xhtml#ch1], you will learn about some of the brain regions and therole each plays in helping you learn and retain information, stay organized, payattention in class, and feel confident in your abilities. Every brain is unique,and understanding your brain type (more on this in chapter 2[Chapter02.xhtml#ch2]) and how your unique brain works is an important step. Byusing the simple strategies in this book, you can optimize your brain so you canbecome a more successful student, no matter what your age.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you suspect you might have learning issues or ADD/ADHD, take the Amen ClinicsLearning Disability Questionnaire in Appendix B [Appendix02.xhtml#app2] and seektreatment if necessary.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------This book can help a broad range of students, whether you’re an underachiever, astressed-out studier, an adult reentering school or doing job-related training,or just someone who wants to make learning easier.Underachievers. If your achievements fall below your capabilities, you may thinkyou’re a mediocre student because of so-so intelligence or because you don’thave a high IQ. But did you know that research shows that learning strategiesare actually more important than IQ when predicting academic achievement?1[Bibliography.xhtml#ci_rfn1] In truth your knowledge of how to learn effectivelyand efficiently may be mediocre but not your ability to learn. The good news isyou can change your learning strategies and thereby change your success. Thinkhow great it would feel if you had the upper hand in a classroom full of otherstudents. Wouldn’t it make learning so much more fun and enjoyable? I have seenC students become consistent B and even A students after acquiring these skills,and with much less stress.Stressed-out studiers. This book is also useful for good students who feel likethey need to use massive assault tactics when they study in order to achieve. Doyou neglect other areas of your life in the race to reach scholastic success?You may think that that in order to be an A+ student, your nose should be buriedin a textbook until 2 a.m. every day, but that is not realistic or even healthy.How would you like to learn to direct your efforts and economize your time soyou can achieve the same results in less time with less stress, leaving room forpersonal development, more fun, and a more balanced life?Adults reentering school or doing job-related training. Change Your Brain,Change Your Grades is also for the working person who is either going back toschool after a long absence or is taking on job-related training. It has beenestimated that almost one-quarter of the adult population in the United Statesis enrolled in some form of regular study, and that people in skilledprofessions or trades require retraining every five to six years to keep up todate with new developments in their fields. If you’re one of these people, youprobably have more outside responsibilities than the typical college student andhave less time to devote to your studies. This means you need to use the mostefficient study methods possible in order to accomplish your goals. Findingtricks and so-called shortcuts is not taking the easy way out; it’s going theextra mile to achieve the success you want while making your life happier andless stressful.Anyone who wants to make learning easier. Whether you want to learn a foreignlanguage before taking a vacation, take a finance course so you can increaseyour investing know-how, or simply ace your tests with less effort, you canbenefit from the strategies in this book. The principles in this book arepractical and can easily be applied to almost any learning situation.SIX WAYS CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR GRADES IS DIFFERENTMany books have been written on how to study. What makes this one different?Change Your Brain, Change Your Grades will systematically look at each majorarea of what I call “studenthood” and offer many practical solutions. This bookwill also give you the necessary mental boost you need to not only thrive, butto actually enjoy the learning process.Here are six ways this book is unique: 1. It teaches you how to optimize the organ of learning—your brain. 2. Much more than just a book on how to study, this is a handbook onhow to benefit from being a student, how to profit personally by excelling as astudent, and how to do both of these without jeopardizing other areas of yourlife. 3. This book was written by someone who studies human brains andbehavior for a living. As a psychiatrist, neuroscientist, and brain healthexpert, I have worked with thousands of students of all ages who are strugglingin school and who have improved their success with the same strategies in thisbook. It’s been a while since I’ve been in school, so I also asked my teenagedaughter, Chloe, and niece, Alizé, to help make this book relevant for21st-century students. Look for the “Tech Tip from Chloe and Alizé” boxesthroughout this book for their insights on how to use technology in the mosteffective way. 4. The secrets to learning involve so much more than just test prep,time management, and organization skills. This book will introduce you to thepower of changing your habits and finding your motivation (chapter 3[Chapter03.xhtml#ch3]), preparation (chapter 4 [Chapter04.xhtml#ch4]), classskills (chapter 8 [Chapter08.xhtml#ch8]), studying with a partner (chapter 10[Chapter10.xhtml#ch10]), and approaching teachers (chapter 11[Chapter11.xhtml#ch11].) 5. Every method or suggestion outlined in this book has been testedand proven with thousands of students. I am not going to tell you what otherpeople think. I am going to tell you what I know works! 6. This book is not meant to be an exhaustive textbook on how to excelin all subjects. Think of it as your go-to guidebook—providing inspiration,practical ideas, and a pleasant sense of relief from the everyday academicgrind. You can read it quickly and reap its benefits immediately. And when youmaster the skills in this book, you can learn any subject faster and retain theinformation longer.WORK SMARTER, NOT HARDERWith the tools and strategies in this book, you’ll discover how to work smarter,not harder. You’ll stop wasting time on aimless study and focus on the mostimportant things, so you can learn more with less effort. You’ll develop skillsthat will serve you well during school and throughout your life as you continueto learn. Of course, as you master these skills, your grades, confidence, andeven your social life will reap the benefits. In particular, this book will helpyou: 1. Kick bad study habits to the curb and adopt smarter study habits. 2. Discover how to prepare better for classes, so you get more out ofthem with less overall study time. 3. Adopt a big-picture view that helps you develop a solid foundationfor learning anything faster. 4. Organize yourself and your time more efficiently. 5.

Lewis makes it clear that the people, through their actions and attitudes,are responsible for their disadvantageous situation. The people are offered achance to take an intense bus ride from Hell toward Heaven. Only after choosingto get on the bus and ride on the path toward change can they avail themselvesof the opportunity to improve their circumstances.

Yourability to succeed in school comes from many different areas of your brain. Ifyou want to perform better in the classroom, you must first learn about yourbrain. After all, it is your brain that decides if you should play mindlessvideo games or head to the library to study. It is your brain that tells you toditch class or pay close attention to the professor’s lecture. It is your brainthat causes you to procrastinate and have to pull an all-nighter or that helpsyou plan ahead so you can get a good night’s sleep before a big test. In thischapter we will look at different systems within the brain, what they do, andthe strengths and vulnerabilities they give us. We will also explore threestrategies to optimize your brain, which is the first step to becoming a moresuccessful student. But first, here are 41 amazing facts about your brain: 1. The brain has about 100 billion neurons (brain cells). 2. Each neuron is connected to other neurons by up to 10,000connections. 3. The brain has more connections than there are stars in theuniverse. 4. A piece of brain tissue the size of a grain of sand contains100,000 neurons and over a billion connections talking to one another. 5. The brain prunes connections it does not use: Use it or lose it. 6. The brain weighs about 3 pounds, or roughly 2 percent of yourbody’s weight. 7. Yet, it uses 20 to 30 percent of the calories you consume; 8. 20 percent of the oxygen you breathe; and 9. 20 percent of the blood flow in your body. 10. The brain needs a constant supply of oxygen. As little as fiveminutes without oxygen can cause some brain cells to die, leading to severebrain damage. 11. It is the consistency of soft butter, tofu, or custard. 12. It is easily damaged. 13. Your soft brain is housed in a very hard skull that has many sharp,bony ridges. 14. Your brain has the storage capacity of 6 million years’ worth of TheWall Street Journal. 15. It is about 80 percent water. 16. Being dehydrated by just 2 percent can negatively affect attention,memory, and judgment. 17. About 60 percent of the dry weight of the brain is fat. 18. Low-fat diets are generally bad for the brain. 19. About 25 percent of the body’s cholesterol is in the brain and isessential for brain health. 20. Total cholesterol levels under 160 have been associated withhomicide, suicide, depression, and death from all causes. 21. Babies have big heads in order to hold their rapidly growing brains. 22. A 2-year-old’s brain is 80 percent the size of an adult’s brain. 23. The brain peaks in activity around age 8, then declines until it issettled at about age 25, which, by the way, is when car insurance rates change,because people make better decisions on the road and most everywhere else intheir lives when their brains are fully developed. 24. Brain information travels up to 268 miles per hour, faster thanFormula 1 race cars (about 240 mph). 25. The brain constantly generates 12 to 25 watts of electricity. 26. The average brain generates up to 50,000 thoughts per day. 27. The brain processes a visual image in as little as 13 milliseconds,which is less than a blink of an eye. 28. One of the world’s most powerful computers (Japan’s K computer) wasprogrammed to simulate human brain activity; it took 40 minutes to process theinformation equal to 1 second of brain activity. 29. When you stop learning, the brain starts dying. 30. Inflammation is a major cause of depression and dementia. 31. Gum disease increases brain inflammation. 32. Fish consumption helps decrease brain inflammation. 33. Depression doubles the risk of Alzheimer’s disease in women andquadruples it in men. 34. The brain cleans or washes itself at night, which is why getting atleast 7 hours (or 8 to 10 hours if you’re a teen) of sleep is important. 35. Soldiers who got 7 hours of sleep at night shot with 98 percentaccuracy at the firing range the next day; those who got just 6 hours were only50 percent accurate; 5 hours were 35 percent accurate; and 4 hours only 15percent accurate (they were dangerous). 36. Gut health is critical to brain health. Your gut makes vitamins andneurotransmitters essential to brain health. 37. Alcohol prevents the formation of new memories. 38. Alcohol is not a health food for the brain. 39. In research my team published, marijuana prematurely aged the brain. 40. About 30 percent of the brain is dedicated to vision, which explainswhy we are more drawn to images than to text. 41. Children exposed to violence show the same brain activity assoldiers exposed to war.A BRIEF TOUR OF YOUR BRAINThe most noticeable structure in the brain is the cerebral cortex, the wrinklymass that sits atop and covers the rest of the brain. The cortex has four mainareas, called lobes, on each side of the brain, and another important structurecalled the cerebellum. 1. Frontal lobes (specifically, the prefrontal cortex, or PFC):purposeful movement, planning, and forethought 2. Temporal lobes: visual and auditory processing, memory, learning,mood stability 3. Parietal lobes: direction sense, math, constructing 4. Occipital lobes: process visual images 5. Cerebellum: motor skills, thought coordination, processing complexinformationWhen your brain works right, you work well in school. When your brain istroubled, you have trouble in school.When your brain is healthy, you tend to be effective, creative, attentive, andorganized. When your brain is troubled—for whatever reason—you are much morelikely to have problems at school, including issues with planning, focus,organization, and memory. Even subtle brain issues can get in the way ofachieving your academic goals. The great news is that you are not stuck with thebrain you have. You can change your brain and change your grades. Optimizingyour brain is the first step to becoming a more successful student.To optimize your brain, you need to follow three simple strategies. • Love your brain. • Avoid the things that hurt your brain. • Do the things that help your brain.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------YOUR BRAIN: A BRIEF PRIMEROutside View of the Brain[../images/f013.jpg]Inside View of the Brain[../images/f013a.jpg]Brain Regions: Functions and ProblemsBrain SystemFunctionsProblemsPrefrontal CortexFocusForethoughtPlanningJudgmentImpulse controlOrganizationEmpathyLearning from experienceShort attention spanDistractibilityLack of perseveranceImpulse control problemsRestlessnessChronic latenessPoor time managementDisorganizationProcrastinationUnavailability of emotionsPoor judgmentTrouble learning from experienceLower empathyAnterior Cingulate GyrusAbility to shift attentionCognitive flexibilityAdaptabilityMovement from idea to ideaAbility to see optionsAbility to “go with the flow”Ability to cooperateAbility to detect errors or when things are not rightStrong willWorryingHolding on to hurts from the pastGetting stuck on thoughts (obsessions)Getting stuck on behaviors (compulsions)Oppositional behaviorArgumentativenessUncooperativenessTendency to say no automaticallyAddictive behaviors (alcohol or drug abuse, eating disorders)Cognitive inflexibilityChronic painObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)Basal GangliaIntegrating feeling and movementForming habitsControlling motivation and driveSetting the body’s anxiety levelShifting and steadying fine motor movementsSuppressing unwanted motor behaviorsMediating pleasure and ecstasyAnxiety or nervousnessPhysical sensations of anxietyTendency to predict the worstConflict avoidanceRisk avoidanceTourette’s syndrome (tics)Muscle tension, sorenessTremorsFine motor problemsLow or excessive motivationSensitivity to rejectionSocial anxiety, interpersonal inhibitionThalamus/Limbic SystemSets the emotional tone of the mindFilters external events through internal statesTags events as internally importantStores highly charged emotional memoriesModulates motivationControls appetite and sleep cyclesPromotes bondingDirectly processes the sense of smellModulates libidoSadness or clinical depressionIncreased negative thinkingNegative perception of eventsFlood of negative emotions, such as hopelessness, helplessness, and guiltAppetite and sleep problemsDecreased or increased sexual responsivenessSocial isolationPainTemporal LobesHearing/listeningReadingReading social cues, including speech and toneShort-term memoryLong-term memoryRecognizing objects by sightMood stabilityNaming thingsMishearing communicationDyslexiaSocially inappropriate behaviorTrouble reading social cuesMemory problemsWord-finding problemsPoor visual recognitionMood instabilityAbnormal sensory perceptionsAnger, irritability, dark thoughtsParietal LobesDirection senseSensory perceptionSpatial processingSeeing movementVisual guidance, such as to grab objectsRecognizing objects by touchAbility to know where you are in spaceKnowing right from leftReading and creating mapsTrouble with math or writingImpaired direction senseTrouble dressing or putting objects togetherLeft/right confusionDenial of illnessImpaired position senseNeglect or unawareness of what you seeImpaired copying, drawing, or cuttingOccipital LobesSightColor perceptionLinesDepth perceptionDeficits in visionDeficits in perceptionVisual hallucinationVisual illusionsFunctional blindnessCerebellumThought coordinationSpeed of thought (like clock speed of a computer)OrganizationMotor coordinationImpulse controlPoor learningSlowed thinkingDisorganizationImpulsivenessCoordination problemsSlowed walkingSlowed speech--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Love your brain. Most students never think about their brain as a tool forlearning. You (or your parents) will buy all sorts of gadgets to help you inyour studies, but it’s your brain that is worthy of your biggest investment.Loving your brain means always keeping it in mind when you make choices.Whenever you are making a decision, ask yourself, “Is this decision good for mybrain or bad for my brain?”Avoid the things that hurt your brain. There are many things in our everydaylives that can hurt your brain and make it harder for you to do well in school: • Lack of exercise • Negative thoughts • Chronic stress • Head trauma • Environmental toxins • Drugs • Excessive alcohol • Mental health issues • Many medications • Hormonal imbalances • Junk food diet • Obesity • Lack of sleepDo the things that help your brain. What’s exciting is that there are manythings that can boost your brain power and help optimize brain function: • Learning new things • Having loving relationships • Having a purpose in life • Physical exercise, especially coordination exercises (table tennis,dancing, etc.) • Controlling your thinking • Meditation and stress-relief techniques • Protecting your head from injury • Avoiding drugs and too much alcohol • Getting help for mental health issues • Balancing hormones • Great nutrition • Taking nutrients (omega-3 fatty acids; vitamins B6, B12, D, andfolate)When you start optimizing your brain, you will find that all the additional tipsand tools in this book will become much easier to implement. And this will putyou on the fast track to successful studenthood."},{"pageContent":"2 [Contents.xhtml#rch2]KNOW YOUR BRAIN TYPE [Contents.xhtml#rch2]EVEN IF YOU NEVER GET SCANNED [Contents.xhtml#rch2]Why do you act the way you act?Why do you think the way you think?How can you perform your best?How can you interact better with your teachers and other students?If you want to know the answers to these profound questions, you must learnabout your brain, which governs how you think, feel, act, and interact. Learningabout your brain, especially your brain type, will help you in school and canalso help you in other areas of your life. And learning about the brain types ofothers will help improve your relationships with your teachers and fellowstudents so you can be more successful at school.In the late 1980s, when I started looking at the brain as a psychiatrist, I wassearching for tools to help me be more effective in helping my patients getbetter faster. My colleagues and I started looking at the brain with a testcalled quantitative EEG (qEEG), which evaluates the brain’s electrical activity.Once we knew an individual’s brain pattern, we could then teach the patient tochange it, using techniques such as neurofeedback. This is where I first got theinspiration for my book Change Your Brain, Change Your Life. We proved that youare not stuck with the brain you have; you can make it better. In 1991, we addedbrain SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) imaging to our toolbox.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------PRIMING YOUR BRAIN FOR BETTER LEARNINGThe preparation for learning begins before you ever crack open a book or setfoot inside a classroom. It starts with your brain. If your brain is healthy, itwill be much easier for you to learn. If your brain is unhealthy, it will beharder for you to be successful in your studies. Over the past three decades atAmen Clinics, we have taken a revolutionary approach to diagnosing and treatingour patients. As part of a comprehensive assessment, we use a brain imagingstudy called SPECT that looks at blood flow and activity in the brain. In thesebrain scans, full, symmetrical activity is an indicator of a healthy brain,whereas holes show areas that are significantly low in blood flow and/oractivity. You don’t want holes in your brain! When our patients see their brain,it helps them understand that their issues are not a personal failure but rathera medical issue. It inspires them to develop brain envy and to take the stepsnecessary to have a healthier brain.Surface SPECT ScansHealthy Brain (looking from the top down)[../images/f020.jpg]Full, even, symmetrical activityToxicity from Drug and Alcohol Abuse[../images/f020a.jpg]Scalloping or overall low activity15-Year-Old Patient with Traumatic Brain Injury[../images/f021.jpg]Damage to left hemisphereAttention Deficit Disorder: Underside Surface Views[../images/f021a.jpg]At rest: Good prefrontal activity (arrows)[../images/f021b.jpg]During concentration: Drop-off of prefrontal activity (arrows)Teenager with ADD: Underside ViewBefore treatment[../images/f022.jpg]Low frontal lobe activityAfter treatment[../images/f022a.jpg]Marked overall improvementActive SPECT ScansHere are examples of “active” SPECT scans. The gray background representsaverage activity. The white areas represent the top 15 percent of brainactivity, which in adults is mostly in the back, bottom part of the brain, in anarea called the cerebellum (Latin for “little brain”). Some 50 percent of thebrain’s neurons reside in this area.Healthy Active Scan (looking from top down)[../images/f023.jpg]Gray is average activity; white is top 15% showing most active areas of thebrain.Obsessive Compulsive Traits[../images/f023a.jpg]Marked increased activity in frontal lobes. Frontal lobes work too hard, so theyneed to be calmed to help people feel better.Posttraumatic Stress Disorder[../images/f024.jpg]Diamond pattern of increased activity in deep emotional part of brain (diamond).Overactive areas need to be calmed.Even if you don’t have a mental health issue, improving your brain health willmake it easier to ace your classes without giving up other areas of your lifethat are important to you. Getting your brain primed for learning is the key.(See chapter 15 [Chapter15.xhtml#ch15] for more details and Appendix A[Appendix01.xhtml#app1] for 107 Ways to Grow Your Brain.)A full-color version of the following poster hangs in over 100,000 schools,prisons, and therapists’ offices around the world.[../images/f025.jpg]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Initially, my team started by naively looking for unique electrical or bloodflow signature patterns for each of the major mental illnesses—such as anxietydisorders, depression, addictions, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsivedisorder, autism, and ADD/ADHD—but we soon discovered there was not one brainpattern associated with any of these illnesses. Rather, they all have multipletypes that require their own treatments. This makes sense because there cannever be just one pattern for, say, depression, since not all depressed peopleare the same. Some are withdrawn, others are angry, and still others are anxiousor obsessive. Taking a one-size-fits-all approach to people with mental healthissues based on symptom clusters invites failure and frustration.But the scans did help us understand the type of anxiety, depression, ADHD,obesity, or addiction each person had, so we could better target treatment tothat individual’s brain. This one idea led to a dramatic breakthrough in oureffectiveness with patients and opened up a new world of understanding and hopefor the tens of thousands of people who have come to see us and the millions ofpeople who have read my books or seen our public television shows. In previouslypublished books, I have written about: • 7 types of ADD/ADHD • 7 types of anxiety and depression • 6 types of addictions • 5 types of overeatersUnderstanding your type of brain is critical to getting the right help.In addition to looking at mental health problems, we also realized that we wereseeing personality types in the scans. The scans revealed so much about people’spersonalities—including their thinking patterns, behaviors, and interactionswith others: • If the brain’s blood flow was full, even, and symmetrical in allareas, we called it balanced. • When areas in the front of the brain were lower in activity or“sleepier” than average, people tended to be impulsive and spontaneous. • When the front areas of the brain were much more active thanaverage, people were more likely to worry more and to be more persistent. • When there was above-average activity in the limbic “emotional”brain, people likely had a greater vulnerability to sadness and tended to bemore sensitive. • When activity was higher than average in the basal ganglia andamygdala, people tended to feel more anxious and to be more cautious.In those early years when I performed brain scans, I would often do a “blind”reading, without any information on the patient. With nothing but the scan, Irealized I could learn a lot about a person. Of course, with every new patientwe evaluate, we take a comprehensive look at their lives. Still, I had a lot offun asking people, “Would you say you have a tendency to think this way . . .?”based solely on their scans.We once saw a teacher who wanted to learn more about our process in helpingstudents with learning issues and ADHD so she could feel more comfortablerecommending our services to parents who were looking for help for theirchildren. She wanted to have her brain scanned and then have me tell her aboutherself based on nothing but the scan. She refused to tell me anything about herlife experiences. I told her that with our patients, we always try to put thescans in the context of their lives. But she was determined to see what the scanalone would reveal. So, we scanned her, and it showed that the front part of herbrain was far more active compared to our healthy group, which correlated withour “persistent” brain type.“So, tell me about myself,” she insisted.“Well, you are more likely to be persistent and strong-willed, and you are verygood at getting things done.”She smiled and said I was right on those points.“However,” I added, “you get upset when things don’t go your way, you have atendency to be stubborn, and you say ‘no’ a lot.”“No, I don’t,” she shot back.“You don’t say ‘no’ a lot?” I asked.“No, no, no, no, I don’t,” she said, then paused for a moment and chuckled.“Well, maybe I do tend to say no first.”A BRIEF HISTORY OF PERSONALITY TYPESThroughout history, there have been many attempts to categorize people andpersonality. The Greek physician Hippocrates (c. 460 to c. 370 BC) describedfour fundamental temperaments he believed were caused by an excess or lack ofbodily fluids: • Sanguine (outgoing, social, risk-taking) • Phlegmatic (relaxed, peaceful, easygoing) • Choleric (take-charge, decisive, goal-oriented) • Melancholic (thoughtful, reserved, introverted, sad, anxious)I have to confess that ever since I was a child, I’ve been a huge fan of theCharles Schulz Peanuts comic strip. I even had Snoopy sheets on my bed(shhh—don’t tell anyone!) when I was a young soldier stationed in West Germany.My love for the comic strip stuck with me through college, and I even found acreative way to work it into one of my first psychology homework assignments.For a class on Temperament and Personality, I wrote a paper using the Peanutscharacters as examples of Hippocrates’s four temperament types. Obviously,Snoopy was sanguine, Schroeder phlegmatic, Lucy choleric, and Charlie Brownmelancholic. Ever since writing that paper, I have been hooked on looking intothe science of how we classify personality.Teachers, employers, and therapists often use personality tests to help themunderstand their students, employees, and patients. These are three of thebest-known tests: • Myers-Briggs: 16 personality types, based on 4 sets ofbehaviors—Extroversion vs. Introversion, Sensing vs. Intuition, Thinking vs.Feeling, and Perceiving vs. Judging • DISC: Often used in business, based on 4 traits—Dominance,Influence, Steadiness, and Conscientiousness • Big Five: Based on 5 basic dimensions of personality—Extraversion,Agreeableness, Openness, Conscientiousness, and NeuroticismThese tests give people a sense of uniqueness and belonging, yet, despite theirwidespread use, there is surprisingly little neuroscience underlying theirpractical application. Of these tests, the Big Five model is the most widelyaccepted framework among neuroscientists.A NEW MODEL BASED ON 160,000 BRAIN SPECT SCANS AND 3 MILLION QUESTIONNAIRESOver the years, our brain imaging work gained wider recognition as an effectivetool to more accurately diagnose and treat people with mental health issues. Asa result, an increasing number of people wanted to get a brain scan but eitherlacked the resources or didn’t live close enough to one of our clinics. In aneffort to help as many people as possible benefit from what we have learned fromour brain imaging work, we developed a series of questionnaires to help peoplepredict what their brains might look like if we could scan them. Thequestionnaires were based on tens of thousands of scans. Obviously, they didn’thave the same level of accuracy as a scan, but they were the next best thing. Inthe last three decades, thousands of mental health professionals have used ourquestionnaires in their practices, and they’ve told us it completely changed theway they think about and help their patients.In 2014, we created our free online Brain Health Assessment (BHA), which offersinsights into your brain type and gives scores on important areas of brainhealth. As of this writing, more than 3 million people worldwide have taken theBHA at www.brainhealthassessment.com [http://www.brainhealthassessment.com]. Thequestions in the BHA were validated comparing brain region activity to theanswers to 300 questions. The most predictive 38 questions were chosen.Now, after studying more than 160,000 brain SPECT scans, we have identified 5primary brain types and 11 combination brain types:Primary Brain Types Brain Type 1: Balanced Brain Type 2: Spontaneous Brain Type 3: Persistent Brain Type 4: Sensitive Brain Type 5: CautiousCombination Brain Types Brain Type 6: Spontaneous-Persistent Brain Type 7: Spontaneous-Persistent-Sensitive Brain Type 8: Spontaneous-Persistent-Sensitive-Cautious Brain Type 9: Persistent-Sensitive-Cautious Brain Type 10: Persistent-Sensitive Brain Type 11: Persistent-Cautious Brain Type 12: Spontaneous-Persistent-Cautious Brain Type 13: Spontaneous-Cautious Brain Type 14: Spontaneous-Sensitive Brain Type 15: Spontaneous-Sensitive-Cautious Brain Type 16: Sensitive-CautiousKnowing your brain type can help you understand more about how you learn, study,and perform in school, as well as how you interact with your teachers, fellowstudents, and others. It can also help you know how to optimize your individualbrain to make you more successful at school. Here is an example:Maya and JackieMaya, 16, was in her junior year of high school and was struggling to keep upwith her schoolwork while also studying to take the SAT. Her room at home was amess and she often couldn’t find her notes from class or her SAT prep materials.When she did study, she couldn’t stay focused for long and would get distractedby social media, so she was getting behind on things. She started thinking shewould never get into college, so why should she even bother studying so hard forthe SAT? Her mom, Jackie, was constantly hounding her to study more and workharder and telling her she was being lazy, which only added to Maya’sdiscouragement.Maya was Brain Type 13 (Spontaneous-Cautious) and had low activity in herprefrontal cortex (associated with attention issues, disorganization, andimpulse control problems) combined with increased activity in her basal gangliaand amygdala (a tendency for anxiety and predicting the worst).Jackie was Brain Type 3 (Persistent) and had above-average activity in the frontpart of her brain. She was a natural at taking charge and getting things doneand expected everybody else to be just as good at powering through their to-dolist, so she thought Maya was just being lazy with her study schedule. AndJackie hated it when things were out of place, so she would get angry at Mayafor having such a messy room. These negative thoughts would get stuck inJackie’s head, and she would bring up things Maya did wrong years ago, whichjust added more stress to Maya’s situation.To help, we had to balance both Maya and Jackie’s brains using supplements andlifestyle interventions targeted to each individual brain type. After a fewweeks, Maya was able to get organized better and stay more focused whilestudying, which gave her more confidence in her abilities and motivated her todo well so she could get into college. Jackie learned that Maya’s brain workeddifferently from her own and stopped expecting her to tackle her studies thesame way she had done when she was that age. And with her own brain calmed down,Jackie stopped getting so upset about things being out of place and quit harpingon Maya about things that had happened years earlier.When it came time for the SAT, Maya did better than she had anticipated andeventually got into her top choice for college. And she and her mom now getalong much better, so they are both less stressed in general. Knowing your braintype and the brain type of the important people in your life and can help notonly in your schoolwork but also in your relationships.KNOW YOUR BRAIN TYPE AND THE BRAIN TYPE OF YOUR INNER CIRCLETo determine your brain type, take the free BHA at www.brainhealthassessment.com[http://www.brainhealthassessment.com] and share it with your family and friendsat school. It will take only 5 to 7 minutes. Here is a short summary of the 5primary types.1. Balanced Brain Type: Advantages and Challenges of Symmetrical Brain ActivityOne of the most common brain types is the Balanced Brain Type. This group tendsto do what they say they’re going to do, show up on time, and follow through ontasks they promise to get done. Typically, they dislike risks, are not firstadopters, and tended to color within the lines when they were kids. They likerules and tend to stick to them. Because of their high level ofconscientiousness and lack of risk-taking behaviors, they tend to live longer.People with the Balanced Brain Type tend to:People with the Balanced Brain Type are less likely to:Be focusedExhibit good impulse controlBe conscientiousBe flexibleBe positiveBe resilientBe emotionally stableHave a short attention spanBe impulsiveBe unreliableBe worriedBe negativeBe anxiousOur imaging work shows that people with this brain type tend to have full, even,symmetrical activity throughout the brain, with the most activity in thecerebellum, which is one of the brain’s major processing centers.Balanced Brain Type[../images/f033.jpg]Full, even, symmetrical activity2. Spontaneous Brain Type: Advantages and Disadvantages of a Sleepy PrefrontalCortexPeople with the Spontaneous Brain Type tend to enjoy doing things on the spur ofthe moment, love trying new things, and often think that rules don’t apply tothem. They may struggle with organization and can engage in risky behavior.People with the Spontaneous Brain Type tend to:People with the Spontaneous Brain Type are less likely to:Be spontaneousTake risksExhibit creative, “out of the box” thinkingBe curiousHave a wide range of interestsLike surprisesBe restlessGet distracted easilyNeed to be highly interested to focusStruggle with organizationArrive late or in a rush to meetingsBe diagnosed with ADHDHate surprisesAvoid riskPrefer routineLike samenessPlay by the rulesBe practicalExhibit good attention to detailExhibit good impulse controlBe settledOur imaging work shows that people with this brain type typically have loweractivity in the front part of the brain, in an area called the prefrontal cortex(PFC). When activity in the PFC is too low, it can be troublesome.Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)The PFC is the most evolved part of the brain, making up 30 percent of the humanbrain, 11 percent of the chimpanzee brain (our closest cousin), 7 percent of thedog brain, 3.5 percent of the cat brain (which is why cats need nine lives), and1 percent of a mouse’s brain (which is why they become food for cats). The PFCis your “executive control center,” responsible for behaviors that are necessaryfor you to focus on and achieve your goals. (See the PFC’s primary functions inthe “Brain Regions: Functions and Problems” chart in chapter 1[Chapter01.xhtml#ch1].)When the PFC is healthy, people are able to supervise themselves and make gooddecisions. When it is sleepy or low in activity, they tend to be morespontaneous and creative, take risks, and think outside the box—which can begood or bad. Whether it is due to medical conditions (such as ADHD, braintrauma, or dementia) or poor lifestyle choices (such as a lack of sleep orexcessive alcohol or marijuana use), a less-active PFC makes people tend tostruggle. (See the PFC’s main problems in the “Brain Regions: Functions andProblems” chart in chapter 1 [Chapter01.xhtml#ch1].)Spontaneous Brain Type[../images/f035.jpg]Low prefrontal cortex activity at front of brain (eee balanced brain type forcomparison).Think of the PFC as the brain’s brake. It stops us from saying or doing thingsthat are not in our best interest, but it can also block creativity. The PFC isthe little voice in our heads that helps us decide between the banana and thebanana split. The Spontaneous Brain Type tends to be associated with lowerdopamine levels in the brain, which may cause people to be more restless, to berisk takers, and to need to be very interested in something in order to stayfocused.Our research team has published several studies showing that when people withthis brain type try to concentrate, they actually have less activity in the PFC,which causes them to need excitement or stimulation in order to focus (think offirefighters and race car drivers). Smokers and heavy coffee drinkers also tendto fit this type, as they use these substances to turn their brains on.Optimize the Spontaneous Brain TypeThis brain type is best optimized by boosting dopamine levels to strengthen thePFC and avoiding supplements and medications that can lower the already low PFCfunction, which can then take the brakes off behavior. For example, we havetreated many people who had done things they later regretted, such as spendingmoney they did not have, when they were put on antidepressants called selectiveserotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). It turned out they had low activity inthe PFC, and the serotonin-boosting medications diminished their judgment.DoDon’tEat a higher-protein, lower-carbohydrate dietEngage in physical exerciseTake stimulating supplements, such as green tea, rhodiola, ginsengTake calming supplements, such as 5-HTPTake serotonin-boosting medications, such as SSRIs3. Persistent Brain Type: OCD and Being in ControlPeople with the Persistent Brain Type are often take-charge people who won’ttake no for an answer. They tend to be tenacious and stubborn. In addition, theymay worry, have trouble sleeping, be argumentative and oppositional, and holdgrudges from the past.People with the Persistent Brain Type tend to:People with the Persistent Brain Type are less likely to:Be persistentBe strong-willedLike routineBe suspiciousGet “stuck” on thoughtsHold on to hurtsSee what is wrongBe oppositional or argumentativeBe more vulnerable to obsessive-compulsive disorderBe ever-changingBe timidBe spontaneousBe trustingLet go of negativity easilyLet go of hurts easilySee what is rightBe noncriticalBe cooperativeOur imaging work shows that people with this brain type often have increasedactivity in an area in the front part of the brain called the anterior cingulategyrus (ACG).Normal “Active” Brain SPECT Scan[../images/f037.jpg]Most active areas in cerebellum at back of brainPersistent Brain Type[../images/f037a.jpg]High anterior cingulate activity at front of brain (arrows)Anterior Cingulate Gyrus (ACG)The ACG runs lengthwise, deep in the frontal lobes of the brain, and is involvedwith cognitive flexibility. Healthy activity in the ACG helps you go with theflow, adapt to change, cooperate with others, and deal successfully with newproblems. The ACG helps you effectively manage change and transitions, which isan essential ingredient in personal, interpersonal, and professional growth.(See the ACG’s primary functions in the “Brain Regions: Functions and Problems”chart in chapter 1 [Chapter01.xhtml#ch1].)Increased activity in the ACG is often associated with being strong-willed,wanting things to be just so, perfectionism, and liking routine, which can begood or troublesome. (See the ACG’s main problems in the “Brain Regions:Functions and Problems” chart in chapter 1 [Chapter01.xhtml#ch1].)We think of the ACG as the brain’s gear shifter. It helps people go from thoughtto thought or move from action to action. It is involved with being mentallyflexible and going with the flow. When the ACG is overactive, usually due to lowlevels of serotonin, people can have problems shifting attention, which can makethem persist, even when it may not be a good idea for them to do so. Caffeineand diet pills tend to worsen this, because this brain type does not need morestimulation. People who have this brain type may feel as though they need aglass of wine at night—or two or three—to calm their worries. Be aware, alcoholis not a health food, and too much can damage the brain. There are healthierways to calm the brain.Optimize the Persistent Brain TypeThe best strategy to balance the Persistent Brain Type is to find natural waysto boost serotonin because it is calming to the brain. High-glycemiccarbohydrates turn to sugar quickly and increase serotonin, which is why manypeople become addicted to simple carbohydrates like bread, pasta, and sweets.These “mood foods” are often used to self-medicate an underlying mood issue.Avoid these quick fixes, because they can cause long-term health problems.DoDon’tEngage in physical exerciseTake calming supplements, such 5-HTP, saffronEat high-glycemic carbohydrates (bread, pasta, sweets)4. Sensitive Brain Type: Sadness and EmpathyPeople with the Sensitive Brain Type tend to feel deeply about their family,friends, and all fellow humans and are more likely to have lots of automaticnegative thoughts (ANTs) and low moods.People with the Sensitive Brain Type tend to:People with the Sensitive Brain Type are less likely to:Be sensitiveBe deeply feelingHave great empathyStruggle with moodsBe prone to pessimismHave lots of ANTs (automatic negative thoughts)Have depressionBe emotionally reservedBe superficialBe consistently happyHave little empathyHave positive thoughtsHave few ANTsOur imaging work shows that people with this brain type often have increasedactivity in the limbic or emotional areas of the brain.Normal “Active” Brain SPECT Scan[../images/f040.jpg]Most active areas in cerebellum at back of brainSensitive Brain Type[../images/f040a.jpg]High deep limbic activity (arrow)Limbic SystemThe limbic system is one of the most interesting and critical parts of beinghuman and is packed with functions—all of which are critical for human behaviorand survival. It sets the emotional tone of the mind and modulates motivation.(See the limbic system’s primary functions in the “Brain Regions: Functions andProblems” chart in chapter 1 [Chapter01.xhtml#ch1].)Our experience at Amen Clinics tells us that when the limbic system is lessactive, there is generally a more positive and hopeful state of mind. However,when the limbic system is working too hard, it is often associated with sadness,negative thinking, and negative emotions. (See the limbic system’s main problemsin the “Brain Regions: Functions and Problems” chart in chapter 1[Chapter01.xhtml#ch1].)Optimize the Sensitive Brain TypeEngaging in activities that release feel-good neurotransmitters, eliminatingnegative thoughts, and taking certain supplements can help people with theSensitive Brain Type. If someone with this type is also a Persistent Brain Type,the supplements or medications that boost serotonin may help the best.DoDon’tEngage in physical exercisePractice ANT therapy (see chapter 14 [Chapter14.xhtml#ch14])Practice gratitudeTake supplements, such as omega-3 fatty acids, SAMe, vitamin DBe a couch potatoLet your thoughts run wildFocus on the negative5. Cautious Brain Type: Some Anxiety Is Good for YouPeople with the Cautious Brain Type tend to struggle more with anxiety, whichcauses them to be more cautious and reserved. On the flip side, it makes themmore prepared.People with the Cautious Brain Type tend to:People with the Cautious Brain Type are less likely to:Be preparedBe cautiousAvoid riskBe motivatedBe reservedHave a busy mindBe temperamentalHave difficulty relaxingHave anxietyBe unconcerned about being fully preparedTake risksBe calmRelax easilyHave a quiet mindBe even-temperedFeel secureOn SPECT images, we often see heightened activity in the anxiety centers of thebrain, such as the basal ganglia, amygdala, and insular cortex. People with thisbrain type also tend to have low levels of the neurotransmitter GABA.Normal “Active” Brain SPECT Scan[../images/f042.jpg]Most active areas in cerebellum at back of brainCautious Brain Type[../images/f042a.jpg]High basal ganglia activity (arrows)Basal Ganglia, Amygdala, and Insular CortexThe basal ganglia, amygdala, and insular cortex are structures toward the centerof the brain that surround the limbic system. They are essential to healthyhuman functioning because they set the body’s anxiety level, control motivationand drive, and are involved in forming habits. (See the basal ganglia’s primaryfunctions in the “Brain Regions: Functions and Problems” chart in chapter 1[Chapter01.xhtml#ch1].)The basal ganglia are connected with other areas of the brain and are involvedwith integrating feelings, thoughts and movement. When the basal ganglia areoveractive or underactive, a number of problems can arise, including anxiety anda tendency to predict the worst. (See the basal ganglia’s main problems in the“Brain Regions: Functions and Problems” chart in chapter 1[Chapter01.xhtml#ch1].)A certain amount of anxiety is healthy and necessary in order to help us makegood decisions and keep us out of trouble. And, while we all may experiencebasal ganglia symptoms occasionally, having an issue like chronic, unremittingworry is not normal and can be very distressing.Optimizing the Cautious Brain TypeThis brain type is best optimized by finding ways to soothe the brain whileavoiding things that worsen feelings of anxiety.DoDon’tPractice meditationPractice hypnosisTake supplements, such as vitamin B6, magnesium, GABAIngest caffeineDrink alcoholNote that alcohol may decrease anxiety in the short term, but withdrawal fromalcohol causes anxiety and places a person with anxiety at greater risk foralcohol addiction.Combination Brain Types: Most of UsIt is common to have more than one brain type. If you have a combination braintype, use a combination of the optimization strategies to boost your brainhealth.

If you keep repeatingthe same activity over and over or keep having the same thoughts, your neuronskeep firing together until they begin wiring together in a process calledlong-term potentiation (LTP). With this process, whether what you are doing orthinking is productive or unproductive for you, networks of your brain cellscreate connections to automate that behavior. At first, the connections arefragile, but with repetition over time, this neural circuitry becomes verystrong and the behaviors become potentiated. Basically, they become habits.Depending on what you’ve taught your brain to do, the LTP process can eitherhelp you be a better student or make it much harder for you.The good news is, you can rewire your brain and change your behaviors. Gettingadequate sleep, exercising on a regular basis, and resisting the urge to scrollthrough your social media pages at all hours will help shore up your brain’swillpower circuitry. Every time you replace an old, unproductive habit with amore productive one, your brain will overwrite those old connections and startbuilding a neural superhighway to success.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------In setting yourself up to succeed, you also need to learn how to takewell-planned risks. If you have confidence in your abilities, you can pushyourself to academic heights that have always been beyond your grasp. But theonly way to gain that confidence is by taking risks and winning at them most ofthe time. If you don’t take a chance on yourself, you’ll never know yourcapabilities. The first time you successfully challenge another student or evena teacher because you know the correct answer, your confidence will start tobuild.When you take a risk and succeed—when you ace a tough calculus test, write akiller English essay, or get a great grade on a chemistry project—your brainreleases dopamine, a neurotransmitter that triggers good feelings. Healthydopamine levels promote feelings of pleasure, motivation, and focus. Thiselevated mood ultimately helps you be even more successful.Even so, I know it isn’t easy to take a risk. You may be thinking, “What if I’mwrong?” To which I say, “So what?” You’ll certainly never forget the correctanswer and at least you will have tried. I have heard many students say thatthey gave up on their dreams of becoming a doctor, lawyer, journalist, orengineer because they didn’t think they had the smarts for it. This is usuallynot true. If you follow the principles in this book and take a systematicapproach to study and to your career goals, then you can succeed! You won’taccomplish anything, however, without risking some time, money, and pride. Butas you’ll discover, it’s so worth it!Here’s a quick tip to set yourself up to win from the get-go each day. Startwith a good attitude in your first class so you’ll do well from the beginning ofyour day. You’ll feel good about your accomplishments, and you’ll want toexperience that feeling again. This will spur you on! If you neglect to preparefor your first class of the day, you’ll be continually behind and feelinadequate. Since no one likes to feel that way, you might end up dropping outto rid yourself of the feeling. If you continually place yourself in depressingor losing situations, you will not win. If you come to class prepared, however,you’ll be able to participate and be encouraged to prepare more often. Thisconcept in life is invaluable. Success breeds success. If you set yourself up towin, you’ll win!TOOLS: ONLY THE BEST WILL DOTo do something right, you need the proper tools. Where would a surgeon bewithout a scalpel, retractors, and scrub nurse? What if a construction workershowed up at a job site with no hammer, nails, or wood? There’s no way theycould do their job. This book will help you take stock of the necessary toolsfor study and will offer many practical aids for sharpening these tools. Anygood grocery store owner knows their inventory, and so should you. You need toknow what you’ve got in stock and what you’re missing.Exercise: Take a few minutes to write out five strengths and five weaknessesthat you have regarding your study skills. If you know your strengths andweaknesses, you will be able to improve your weak areas and build on the strongones.My Strengths[../images/f0048a.jpg]My Weaknesses[../images/f0048b.jpg]Throughout the rest of this book, you’ll discover the tools you need to turnyour weaknesses into strengths. Be sure to practice and review your study skillsoften. The more you practice good study habits, the more your brain will laydown and strengthen neural pathways to make those behaviors automatic.Eventually, good study habits will feel completely natural to you.ATTITUDE: DOES YOURS NEED AN ADJUSTMENT?Your attitude toward your schoolwork will be either a motivating force or aconstant drag on your energy. Approach the learning process with the idea ofgaining the most that you can; it is the only rational way to spend your time.If you’re constantly looking beyond what you’re studying, or you view it aspurposeless, you’ll slow your progress and lengthen the time it takes you toreach your goal. If, on the other hand, you concentrate on preparing for yourclasses and milking them for everything they’re worth, you’ll find that studyingafterward will go faster. In addition, if you challenge yourself to find valuein everything you learn, you can find ways to use that knowledge to aid you infurther studies.As you adopt new habits, you must assume an attitude of confidence. Believing inyour ability to achieve is paramount to success. One of the best ways to enhanceself-confidence is to surround yourself with people who believe in yourabilities and build you up. Friends, family, and professors who are on your“team” and are rooting for you increase your chances of success.Stay away from people who are constantly putting you down, telling you that thefield of your choice is too competitive, or that you’re not smart enough tosucceed. During my sophomore year of college, after I had decided to go tomedical school, my speech teacher told me that her younger brother didn’t getinto medical school even though, according to her, he was twice as smart as me!In other words, she was telling me I didn’t have a chance. Fortunately, I wassmart enough to realize I didn’t need this kind of discouragement, so I quicklycut off most of my communication with her. If I had listened to her long enough,I just might have started to believe her, and I might have given up hope ofgoing to medical school.On the other side of the spectrum, as I talked to my father about the medicalschool adventure, he told me that I could do anything I set my mind to. Youknow, he was right! Of course, I had setbacks like everyone else. I remembertimes when I would get emotionally down about the pressures or workload atschool. In those times, my dad would take me by the shoulders, look me in theeye, and say, “Son, you’re going to make it.” Then he would give me a quickshake and tell me to straighten up. Thank God I had his confidence to lean onwhen mine was weak! Where would I be if I had listened to those who did notbelieve in me? I hate to think of it.I can’t stress enough the importance of surrounding yourself with people who seeyour potential and exude an attitude of confidence. Hanging out with people whoare motivated and have a clear path to their goals will inspire you to do thesame. Plus, it makes it seem much easier every step of the way if you seesomeone else doing it too.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[../images/moniter.jpg]TECH TIP FROM CHLOE AND ALIZÉTell Siri, Alexa, or whatever tech personal assistant you have to give youencouragement at regular intervals throughout the day or right before a bigtest. A simple “You’re doing great!” can really help.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------MOTIVATION: HOW TO FIND YOURSIn order to be a better student, it is critical for you to know why it isimportant. You’ll be more likely to perform at your peak if you have insightinto what fuels your engine.What drives your desire to be a more successful student? • Are you a high school student who wants to go to a prestigiousuniversity? • Are you a sophomore pre-medical student who needs an A in organicchemistry to make it into medical school so you can fulfill your dream ofbecoming a doctor? • Are you a junior psychology major who needs to finish with very goodgrades to have a chance at a competitive graduate school so you can earn a PhDand become a psychologist as you’ve always wanted? • Are you a business student who wants to prepare the best possiblerésumé so you can land a high-paying corporate job upon graduation? • Are you returning to school so you can make a career change thatwill be more fulfilling on a personal level? • Are you doing on-the-job training so you can get a promotion thatwill allow you to take better care of your family? • Are you a student who just wants to get better grades and learn morewhile expending less energy? • Are you hoping that being a more successful student will help youfeel more confident about yourself?Exercise: Too many people are thrown around by the whims of the day, rather thanusing their brains to plan their lives and follow through on their goals. One ofthe best ways to figure out what motivates you is to write it down. Tell yourbrain what you want and let your brain help you match your behavior to get it!When you focus on negativity, you will feel depressed. If you focus on fear, youare likely to feel anxious. If you focus on achieving your goals, you are muchmore likely to succeed.I have designed a powerful yet simple motivation exercise called the ONE PAGEMIRACLE to help guide your thoughts, words, and actions. I’ve seen this exercisequickly focus and change many people’s lives.Directions: On the following form, clearly write out your major goals, in thefollowing areas:Relationships: parents, siblings, significant other, children, friends, extendedfamilySchool and Work: short- and long-term education and career goalsFinances: short- and long-term financial goalsSelf: emotional and physical health, personal interests, spiritualityWork on these goals over time. After you finish your initial draft, I want youto look at your ONE PAGE MIRACLE every day, and then before you do or sayanything, I want you to ask yourself, “Is my behavior getting me what I want?”If you focus on your goals every day, it becomes much easier for you to matchyour behavior to get what you want. Your life becomes more conscious and youspend energy on goals that are important to you.The areas of relationships, school/work, finances, and self are separated inorder to encourage a more balanced approach to life. Burnout occurs when ourlives become unbalanced and we overextend ourselves in one area while ignoringanother. For example, in one’s teens, spending excessive time with friends canlead to school failure and family stress.MY ONE PAGE MIRACLEWhat Do I Want? What Am I Doing to Make It Happen?[../images/f0052.jpg][../images/f0053.jpg][../images/f0054.jpg]Let your brain help you design and implement your life. Work toward goals thatare important to you. Many other people or corporations are happy to decide whatyou should do with your life, but you can use the ONE PAGE MIRACLE to help yoube the one who has the say. Your brain receives and creates reality. Give itsome direction to help make your life what you want it to be.Anchor ImagesDid you know that 50 percent of your brain is dedicated to vision? Because ofthis, it can be very helpful to surround yourself with what I like to call“anchor images” that remind you why you want to be a more successful student.These images can shift your motivation into high gear. If you want to be a moreeffective student so you can get into a particular university, use a picture ofthat university as your computer background so every time you turn it on, you’rereminded of why you’re studying. If you’re going back to school to land a betterjob so you can support your family, post your favorite picture of your family inplain view to anchor you. If you want to study more efficiently in less time soyou can enjoy other pursuits—playing guitar, playing tennis, making movies—putup pictures of yourself doing those things.[../images/f0055.jpg][../images/f0056.jpg]Don’t forget that motivation is your business! In higher education, you’llencounter very little encouragement to prompt you to do your best work. It’s upto you to keep yourself inspired to thrive. Come up with fun ways to motivateyourself, such as rewarding yourself for consistently maintaining your newhabits, finding entertaining ways to study (at the park or beach), or getting afriend to hit the books with you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[../images/moniter.jpg]TECH TIP FROM CHLOE AND ALIZÉWe set our phone calendars so that every time we turn them on, a reminder toview our ONE PAGE MIRACLE pops up. It keeps us inspired and reminds us why wewant to study effectively.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------After you have formulated your goals, make a conscious decision to change yourmethods for reaching them. That’s right: Decide to change! This decision will bethe pivotal point in your academic career. After you make the confident decisionto make it happen, you need to act on it right away. The sooner you put yourfocus in the direction you want to go, the more consistent you will be and themore likely you will be to succeed.A simple strategy you can use to stay on track with your new habits is somethingI call “then what?” These are the two most powerful words when it comes to yoursuccess as a student, and keeping them at the top of your mind can literallychange your performance in a positive way. If I do this, then what will happen?If I take sloppy notes, then what will happen? If I take notes that are easy toread, then what? If I skip a lecture, fail to prepare for class, or cram at thelast minute, then what? If I pay close attention in class, then what? Will anyof these actions help me with any of my goals? Think about the consequences ofyour behavior before you act.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------KEEP YOUR LIMBIC SYSTEM HEALTHY FOR HEALTHY MOTIVATIONThe brain’s limbic system influences your motivation and drive. When activity inthe limbic system is optimal, it’s what gets you to hop out of bed in themorning and keep powering through your day. Brain imaging shows that when thereis overactivity in this brain system, it is associated with a drop in motivationand drive, which is commonly linked to depression. Here are a few strategies toenhance the health of the limbic system: • Engage in physical exercise. • Practice ANT therapy (see chapter 14 [Chapter14.xhtml#ch14] to learnthis simple technique). • Try mood-boosting supplements, such as omega-3 fatty acids and SAMe.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------PERSEVERANCEIn order to change bad study habits or patterns, you must develop perseverance.Many people in every walk of life never reach their full potential, not due to alack of talent or intelligence, but rather because of a lack of tenacity. Youneed to understand two concepts before you’ll be able to power up yourperseverance: 1. You need to count the cost beforehand. 2. You’ll experience a certain amount of pain before you reach yourgoal.Jesus said, “Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Will he not first sitdown and estimate the cost to see if he has enough money to complete it? For ifhe lays the foundation and is not able to finish it, everyone who sees it willridicule him, saying, ‘This fellow began to build and was not able to finish.’”(Luke 14:28)In order to persevere, you must know what you’re up against. If you count thecost of the goals you’re pursuing, you’ll be less likely to start something thatyou’ll later drop—which would surely make you feel like a failure. For example,if your goal is to become a heart surgeon, you need to be fully aware that thiswill require: • a four-year undergraduate degree with a major like biology • good scores on the MCAT • four years of medical school • about five years of general surgery residency training • about two years of specialized heart surgery residency training • passing the licensing exam • obtaining board certificationPhew! This adds up to about 15 years of study to attain your goal. Ask yourselfif you’re willing to invest 15 years of your life before reaping the benefits ofyour efforts. And be honest with yourself! If you have other conflicting lifegoals that are important to you, you may need to rethink this goal. Perhaps ifbeing a heart surgeon doesn’t fit into your overall life goals, then anothercareer in the medical field would give you the job satisfaction you’re seekingwhile letting you achieve a more balanced life.Perseverance also requires a dose of pain. American society seems to promote theassumption that all pain is bad. I find, however, that not all pain is bad—andindeed, in many instances, pain is a necessary ingredient for personal growth.Growth and change involve pain. There were many nights when my first son, Anton,awakened in the night moaning from the pain in his legs. As I massaged hislittle legs or placed a cool, wet cloth upon them, the growing pains wouldsubside. Anton learned to accept the pain of physical growth, because it fitinto his desire to be as tall as his grandfather, who is six feet four inches.There is pain in any learning situation. You will experience the pain of hardwork and long nights, studying when your friends are playing, postponingmaterial or social goals for academic ones, and doing poorly on an exam eventhough you studied hard for it because the teacher asked “off the wall”questions. Prepare yourself for the pain and accept its place in your personallife and in your study life. Learning to use the curveballs to your advantage isso important, because they are certainly not going to stop anytime soon. Infact, after you’ve finished school and joined the workforce, that’s when theyreally come at you. But it’s up to you to decide if these setbacks throw you fora loop and break you down or if they inspire you to think fast on your feet andmake you stronger. If you aren’t willing to accept some pain in your life, thenyou will revert to old habits or drop out whenever the going gets tough.It takes time to develop good study habits, just as it takes time for anymedicine to work after you have taken it. If you do not take your medicine asprescribed, its effects will be compromised. Likewise, if you lack persistencein applying the tools that I will help you develop and sharpen, then this bookwill have little impact on you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR GRADES: CHANGING HABITS• Set yourself up to succeed by starting at a reasonable pace and takingwell-planned risks. Give yourself positive, reinforcing experiences. This is thekey to having the confidence of a winner.• Obtain the tools for change and update them regularly.• Use your attitude to fuel change and surround yourself with people whobelieve in your potential.• Find out what motivates you to study better and decide to change bad studyhabits.• Develop the perseverance to change by counting the cost of your endeavorsbeforehand and accepting that pain is a necessary part of change and growth.• Know the six stages of change and understand that slipups are normal.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE 6 STAGES OF CHANGEIt takes time to rewire your brain. Being aware of the fact that your brain goesthrough six stages of change can help you stay on track when adopting habitsthat will make you a better student. • Stage 1: I Won’t or I Can’t: In this stage, the downsides of changeappear to outweigh the benefits. If you’re in this stage, ask yourself severaltimes a day, “If I decided to change, how would it benefit me?” This helps yourbrain focus on the benefits of change. • Stage 2: I Might: You may still feel ambivalent about changing. Topush yourself in the right direction, ask yourself, “If I decided to change,what are the first steps I could take?” • Stage 3: I Will: By now, you see that that the benefits of changingoutweigh the downsides and you begin developing a plan. • Stage 4: I Am: You are taking action to make change happen, whichkick-starts the long-term potentiation (LTP) process and begins to rewire yourbrain. • Stage 5: I Still Am: LTP is firmly underway, and your new behaviorsare beginning to feel reflexive or automatic. But beware that you can still slipback into old habits if you don’t make a concerted effort to stick with your newways. • Stage 6: Whoops! It is completely normal to experience a few slipupsas you change your habits. Just ease back into whichever stage you land in.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageContent":"4 [Contents.xhtml#rch4]IN THE BEGINNING [Contents.xhtml#rch4]PREPARATION FOR LEARNING [Contents.xhtml#rch4]In the beginning God created humans. Right? No, that is wrong! In the beginningGod created the heavens and the earth. Then he proceeded to create the day andthe night, the sun, the moon and the stars, the land and the sea, the forestsand the gardens, the fish, the birds and the mammals, etc. He took into accountall that was necessary, and he prepared extensively for his ultimate purpose—thecreation of humans. (Maybe he took into account more than was necessary; whoneeds leeches and stink bugs?)Whether or not you accept the above description on the history of our genesis isnot the point. What is important is to recognize that preparation is paramountto accomplishment. With a solid foundation, goals become achievable; withoutit—impossible!If you want to become a more successful student, where do you start? Where elsebut at the beginning? If you want to study writing, you need to learn grammarand vocabulary. If you want to enter the business world, you need to learnmathematics and accounting skills. If you want to be a physician, you shouldstart with basic chemistry and physics. And if you want to be a minister, beginwith the Bible and learn public speaking techniques.To carry this point even further, it is necessary to start at the beginning ofthe beginning. I know this sounds redundant, but this simple principle will saveyou many hours of frustration and stress. In chemistry it is essential to knowthat gold is a metal before you can possibly understand how it reacts to heat.You must know the functions of verbs and prepositions before putting togethersentences for a short story. It is essential in psychology or medicine tounderstand what is normal before you can comprehend what is abnormal.These four strategies have been proven to help you prepare for learning so thatyou can be more successful.1. HONE YOUR READING SKILLS.Regardless of what grade you’re in or what field you’re studying, reading skillsare essential to a successful academic career. I will not dwell on the mechanicsof good reading in this guidebook because most middle schools, high schools, andcolleges offer elective courses in reading skills. If your skills could use aboost, I highly recommend such a course. I will, however, offer a few simpleobservations on reading. Reading for pleasure and reading for study are twocompletely different animals. One usually takes on the feeling of a warm, cuddlypuppy, while the other often resembles a vile cockroach.Become a word whiz. When reading to learn, be sure to look up words you don’tknow. This habit will build your vocabulary rapidly and increase your knowledgeof the subject.Don’t skip the good stuff. Some people tend to gloss over the charts, graphs,illustrations, italicized words, sidebars, and summary statements included inmany textbooks. This is a big mistake! These elements often include criticalinformation that will improve your comprehension and ensure that you the see“the big picture.” In the same vein, it’s very important to read the preface,table of contents, introduction, and introductory chapters of textbooks. Thesegive you valuable information that is often overlooked by students, who end upstruggling without realizing why.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[../images/moniter.jpg]TECH TIP FROM CHLOE AND ALIZÉDownload a free dictionary app, such as Merriam-Webster, so you can look upwords on your smartphone while you read. You can also ask Siri, Alexa, oranother personal assistant for the definitions of words you don’t know, but beaware that their responses can sometimes be unpredictable. When writing essays,you can also ask them for help with spelling.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------These sections present information on how to use the textbook efficiently, howto study the subject, unique features of the book, why the subject is important,and interesting biographies of the authors that can make the subject matter lessimpersonal. Reading this part of the text familiarizes you with the task ahead,while giving you an early opportunity to return the book and drop out of theclass if it is not what you expected. For example, when I was a junior incollege, I enrolled in a biochemistry course I thought would be helpful in mymedical education. After reading the preface, introduction, and first twochapters of the text, I found out quickly that I did not want to put myselfthrough that kind of pain twice, since I would have to take a similar class inmedical school. I dropped the class and took a course on death and dying, which,although more morbid, was vastly more interesting.Try to enjoy what you’re reading and consider its value to you. I know that thisis not always possible, and I have spent more time than I care to admit readingwords that seem to have been put together purposely to torment my moods andobscure my thoughts. If you take a broader view and try to see its value,however, it will be easier to wade through the material.Have a (realistic) plan and stick to it. Decide ahead of time what you want toaccomplish when you have finished a section so you can read with a purpose. Itis a good practice (in life as well as in reading!) to keep a running tab ofwhere you are and where you are heading. If you follow a plan, you’ll find thatyou waste less time, and unproductive time is what you want to completelyeliminate. Be realistic about your plan, though. Don’t pressure yourself todigest 10 chapters of a dense economics book in a single sitting. That’s justgoing to set you up for failure. Schedule your time realistically, and you’llabsorb the material faster and feel more successful.When you feel lost, start over. Do you ever find yourself in the middle of atextbook and suddenly realize you have no idea what you’ve just read? Whenyou’re reading and begin to feel lost, stop and ask yourself, “When did I firstfeel lost?” Then go back to that point and begin reading again until youunderstand. And this time, try getting through the material without anydistractions—like checking your Instagram feed (cough, cough). If you don’tstart over and simply continue to read without understanding, it will be muchtougher and more time-consuming for you to learn the material. When you’refeeling lost, the sooner you go back, the better it will be for you, yourspouse, your children, your friends, and even your dog, because you will be lessirritable.Got it! A very important statement is repeated several times in the book ofGenesis. At the end of each day in creation, God said, “and it was good.” Makesure you can say the same thing after each section you study: “It is good. Iunderstand it.” If you find yourself saying, “It is not good. I have no cluewhat this is about,” start over at the beginning of your lesson until you feelcomfortable with the material.Limit distractions and stop trying to multitask. You may think that multitaskingis the key to being a more productive and successful student because you can getmore done in less time. But brain studies show that it is very difficult toconcentrate well on more than one thing at a time. Researchers at StanfordUniversity have found that rather than being a time-saver, multitasking isactually bad for your brain and makes it harder to sort out relevant informationfrom irrelevant data.1 [Bibliography_1.xhtml#c4_rfn1] Your brain performs betterif you focus on one thing at a time. This means you need to limitdistractions—no cell phones, no TV, no YouTube. I promise you, the memes canwait.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[../images/moniter.jpg]TECH TIP FROM CHLOE AND ALIZÉWhen you need to read a book for school or on-the-job training, put your cellphone on silent mode and resist the temptation to scroll through your socialmedia feed.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------2. CREATE AN IDEAL STUDY ENVIRONMENT.To study effectively, you need your own private haven. What sort of surroundingshelp make your study sessions more efficient? Most of what you’ll read hereinvolves common sense, but as I have found, common sense is not always aprerequisite for higher learning.Find a place that is comfortable and quiet. You want it to be comfortablebecause if you feel good physically, you’ll be able to study longer; you want itto be quiet because you need to concentrate! See to it that your chair iscomfortable, but not to the extent of encouraging you to fantasize that it is afirst-class seat aboard a plane bound for Honolulu. Do not study on your bed!The message you are sending to your brain when you are lying down—to powerdown—is the opposite of your purpose. You need your brain to be alert and readyto learn (unless, of course, you happen to be taking a class on theinterpretation of dreams).Keep it cool, but not too cool. Studies show that students perform better ontests in rooms that are well ventilated and temperature controlled. A space thatis too stuffy, too hot, or too cold can be detrimental to performance. Theoptimum temperature appears to be in the range of 70 to 78 degrees Fahrenheit.2[Bibliography_1.xhtml#c4_rfn2]Let there be light. Make sure that the lighting is good and that it shines overthe opposite shoulder of your writing arm. This will diminish unnecessaryshadows. Also ensure that the light can be easily adjusted to reduce the glarefrom glossy textbook pages or your computer screen. If you tend to study atnight, be aware that the blue light emitted from the LED screen of your laptopor tablet can mess with your biological rhythms. A 2015 study in the Proceedingsof the National Academy of Science found that using light-emitting readingdevices—like your Kindle, Nook, or iPad—before bedtime prolongs the time ittakes to fall asleep, disrupts circadian rhythms, suppresses melatoninproduction, reduces the amount of REM sleep, and lowers alertness the followingmorning.3 [Bibliography_1.xhtml#c4_rfn3]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[../images/moniter.jpg]TECH TIP FROM CHLOE AND ALIZÉIf you have to study at night (as most students do), check out screen covers orgoggles that filter blue light.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Make room. Clear your desk, table, or study area to give yourself plenty of roomto spread out, so you don’t feel cluttered. Only the material you’re studying atthe moment should be out on your workspace. All other homework should be out ofsight. For example, don’t study for your English exam with your math homeworkwithin eyesight.Tune in to the right music. There are varying opinions on listening to musicduring study time. In my experience, listening to soft, instrumental music mayenhance a study session. It is obvious, however, that loud, aggressivemusic—think heavy metal—will not help you assimilate the details of fine art inthe Baroque period! And avoid anything that you can’t sit still and listen to(for Chloe and Alize, that would be Drake, JB, or the entire Mamma Miasoundtrack). If you’re one of those students who finds any music distracting,turn it off and let the silence help you concentrate.Be prepared. If you’re going to use any study aids, be sure to have them at handbefore you sit down to study so you won’t have to interrupt yourself.3. STAY FRESH AND ENERGIZED.Take regular breaks. You might think that powering through a study sessionwithout taking a break is the best way to get more done. Think again. A 2011study in the journal Cognition found that short breaks allow people to stayfocused on a task and avoid the decline in concentration that usually comes overtime.4 [Bibliography_1.xhtml#c4_rfn4] Brief breaks allow you to clear your mindso you can come back to the material feeling refreshed and energized. If you’rean overachiever, you may balk at the idea of breaks, but just remember that eventhe bagger at the grocery store down the street gets a 10-minute break every fewhours. You should take at least that much time, preferably 10 minutes everyhour. There is good reason why psychiatrists see patients for only 50 minutes.Take the hint and give yourself a break—unless, of course, you are the type totake a 50-minute break for every 10 minutes of study.Get moving. Sitting at your desk for hours on end can be a drag, and it’sterrible for your posture. Every time you take a break, get up out of your chairand get your blood pumping. Do a few jumping jacks, stretch, or go for a quickwalk outside. It will boost your energy and your mood.4. DON’T TAKE ADVANCED CLASSES BEFORE MASTERING THE BASICS.As you have no doubt already noticed, most class material “pyramids”—that is, itbuilds upon a base of knowledge. Jesus said in the New Testament that a wise manbuilds his house on a foundation of rock, for it will survive the wind, therain, and the exposure to time. But it is the foolish man who builds his houseon a foundation of sand, for when the winds blow and the rains come, it willquickly crumble. (Matthew 7:24) What you need to do to is build your educationon a foundation of rock, so you will have a lot less work to do in the future.This means you need to make sure you have mastered the necessary prerequisitesfor the courses you are about to undertake, or your grade might find itself atthe undertaker. I remember my first week of general chemistry in college—I wasso lost that I thought I was in the wrong room taking a Russian language class.I had taken the prerequisite chemistry class in high school but had barelysqueaked by with a C. (I, of course, placed the blame on my girlfriend at thattime, who was taking up most of my time and energy.) The smartest thing I didfor my career was to drop that class and take a beginning chemistry courseinstead. It gave me a solid foundation and adequate preparation for the moreadvanced chemistry classes.This principle may delay your plans by a few months, but inadequate backgroundand preparation are the major reasons why students drop out of tough programs.So be a good scout and “Be Prepared” for what you are to encounter.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR GRADES: PREPARATION FOR LEARNING• Preparing to learn is paramount to accomplishment.• Prime your brain for learning.• Start at the beginning and solidify your academic foundation before youmove ahead to more advanced courses.• Polish your reading skills by using a dictionary app and comprehensionaids. Recognize the value in what you read and have a purpose when reading bycreating and following a realistic plan. Read the introductory materials of yourtexts. Avoid distractions.• Create a comfortable and quiet study environment by keeping the room at agood temperature and by having good light, a comfortable chair, and enough spaceto work. Remember to keep distractions out of sight and opt for soft musicrather than hard rock.• Stay fresh and energized by taking regular breaks with brief bouts ofmovement.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageContent":"5 [Contents.xhtml#rch5]THE BIG PICTURE [Contents.xhtml#rch5]FROM GENERALIZATIONS TO SPECIFICS [Contents.xhtml#rch5]When I first began tutoring in my sophomore year of college, I was amazed todiscover that some of my pupils could remember facts I had never even heard. Ifigured the only reason why I was the tutor and they were the tutees was that Iknew where the facts belonged and could put them into a rational sequence. Theirfacts were often left hanging like leaves without branches to support them.If I was surprised by this in college, I was astounded in medical school to finda very similar situation of dangling facts. You would think that medicalstudents would have it all together when it comes to having good study habitsand knowing the importance of getting the “big picture” before knowing thedetails. Boy, what naivete! To my shock and dismay, I found the study skills ofmany medical students on a par with trained monkeys who learned information onlyafter numerous repetitions. It is true that the average intelligence of themedical students with whom I had contact was quite high, but they had wastedliterally thousands of hours on circular, repetitive, and unproductive study. Iwonder what great medical discoveries could have been made if they had thosehours back, but as the Apostle Paul said, “Forgetting that which is behind andstraining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the high mark.” (Phil. 3:13)That, in fact, is part of what this book is all about: getting high marks.LOOK FOR THE “BIG PICTURE” FIRSTI think getting the “big picture” in a subject is the first step to being asuccessful student, but it is a step that far too many ignore. Now, I know manyof you are expecting me to tell you that you are having trouble seeing theforest for the trees, which is most likely the case. As you know, if you do notrealize that you are in a forest, it is very easy to get lost in the maze oftrees and foliage that surrounds you. If, however, you do know where you are andwhat you are doing there, the forest can be a wonderful place.Another analogy, that of a trip I once made, will be useful in driving thispoint home (or, as happened to me, driving me farther from home). I wastraveling from California to Oklahoma. I had made this trip four or five timesbefore, always driving from Los Angeles to Needles to Flagstaff, and so on. Thisparticular time, however, I was entering my junior year in medical school andmust have felt the extraordinary powers of my position in life when I decidedthat there must be a quicker way to Flagstaff than through Needles. After all,what did the Auto Club (which had mapped out the trip for me—remember, this waslong before GPS!) know that a third-year medical student did not?As I eyed the map, I saw a shortcut from Blythe, California, to Flagstaff,Arizona, saving about two inches on the map. The only difference was theshortcut had a single red line instead of a double green line and it looked alittle curvy. I didn’t know what the red and green lines meant, but it seemedlike a no-brainer to me, so I headed for the shortcut at about 9:30 p.m.,expecting to arrive in Flagstaff about 2 o’clock that morning. As you may haveguessed by now (the smart person that you are, as evidenced by your purchase ofthis book), the drive didn’t turn out to be the shortcut I was hoping for. Ispent the next ten hours enduring the sharpest curves and steepest mountaingrades that Arizona has to offer. When I finally pulled into Flagstaff at 7:30the next morning, I felt like a frazzled mouse living in a gyroscope operated bya sadistic scientist who was testing its tolerance to vertigo.I certainly missed the “big picture” because I didn’t have an accurate, overallplan or outline for the trip. It would have been simple to check the map key tosee what a single red line meant or to have trusted the experts at the AutoClub, who had decades of experience helping plan such trips. Determination tomake one’s own way without the proper preparation, guideposts, or a reasonablegeneral scheme can be very destructive. You must have a plan to succeed, frombeginning to end, with the finish line always in sight.The practical applications of this principle are myriad and apply in almostevery situation in which the understanding of principles and concepts isnecessary. Even in a romantic situation, it is advantageous to ask the otherperson for a date—and have them accept—before splurging on floor-seat concerttickets, making dinner reservations, or buying an expensive new outfit. Forwithout the “big picture,” which in this case is the date, you really havenothing at all.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------BRIGHT MINDS: GET THE “BIG PICTURE” OF BRAIN HEALTHThe concept of the “big picture” applies to more than just your classwork. Italso relates to your overall brain health, since that is the foundation thatwill help you succeed in school. I use the mnemonic BRIGHT MINDS to identify themajor factors that either help you perform at a high level or sabotage yourschoolwork. When you optimize the following BRIGHT MINDS factors, you changeyour brain for the better and improve your ability to do your best.B is for Blood Flow: Healthy blood flow is critical for a high-performing brain.Our brain SPECT imaging shows that low blood flow is associated with ADHD,depression, suicidal thoughts, substance abuse, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia,traumatic brain injury, and more—all of which make it harder to stay motivatedand focused on your schoolwork.Optimization strategies: Engage in physical exercise, practice meditation and/orprayer, and take omega-3 fatty acids and ginkgo biloba.R is for Rational Thinking: Your thoughts are powerful and can be positive andhelpful or, if undisciplined, can be negative and hurtful. I call these damagingthoughts ANTs (automatic negative thoughts).Optimization strategies: Learn to kill the ANTs that make you feel bad (seechapter 14 [Chapter14.xhtml#ch14] for more details).I is for Inflammation: High levels of inflammation have been associated withdecreased motivation,1 [Bibliography_2.xhtml#c5_rfn1] depression, bipolardisorder, OCD, schizophrenia, personality disorders, and more.2[Bibliography_2.xhtml#c5_rfn2],3 [Bibliography_2.xhtml#c5_rfn3] It’s also linkedwith leaky gut, a condition that causes gastrointestinal issues, allergies, andmore things that can get in the way of your efforts at school.Optimization strategies: Eat more foods high in omega-3 fatty acids, reduceintake of foods high in omega-6 fatty acids, and increase prebiotics andprobiotics (see chapter 15 [Chapter15.xhtml#ch15]). Be careful with antibioticsand be sure to floss every day. Have your doctor test your C-reactive protein(CRP) levels, a blood marker for inflammation, as well your omega-3 index (lowlevels of omega-3 are associated with inflammation).G is for Genetics: Having family members with brain health/mental healthchallenges—ADHD, depression, anxiety, addiction, and more—can make you morevulnerable to them. But your genes are not your destiny. Your everyday habitscan help turn those bad genes on or off.Optimization strategies: Adopt brain-healthy habits to reduce the impact ofgenetic vulnerabilities.H is for Head Trauma: Concussions and head injuries, even if you didn’t passout, can cause lasting issues, including learning problems,4[Bibliography_2.xhtml#c5_rfn4] ADHD,5 [Bibliography_2.xhtml#c5_rfn5]depression,6 [Bibliography_2.xhtml#c5_rfn6] anxiety and panic disorders,7[Bibliography_2.xhtml#c5_rfn7] drug and alcohol abuse,8[Bibliography_2.xhtml#c5_rfn8] and more.Optimization strategies: Protect your brain. Don’t hit soccer balls with yourhead, and wear a helmet when you ride a bike or go skiing. If you had a headinjury, seek treatment—such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) andneurofeedback—to help heal your brain.T is for Toxins: Environmental toxins found in alcohol, marijuana and cigarettesmoke, nonorganic produce, many personal care products, mold, and other everydayitems can harm your brain. Exposure to toxins has been associated with learningproblems, memory difficulties, brain fog, ADHD, depression, suicide, autism, andmore.Optimization strategies: As much as possible, eliminate toxins from your life.Support your organs of detoxification—the liver, kidneys, and skin—which helpflush toxic substances from the body. Your gut also plays a role indetoxification. To support your detoxification system, drink more water(kidneys), reduce alcohol intake (liver), work up a sweat (skin), and eat morefiber (gut).M is for Mental Health: When you have mental health problems, it makes it muchharder to do your best in school. Depression can leave you feeling unmotivated.ADHD can make it hard to focus. Anxiety can mess with your mind on exam days.Optimization strategies: Address all the BRIGHT MINDS factors and if you’restill suffering, seek treatment.I is for Immunity/Infections: When your immune system is out of whack, it canlead to allergies, infections, autoimmune disease, and even cancer. All of thesecan get in the way of performing your best at school.Optimization strategies: Balance your vitamin D levels, avoid allergens,practice stress-management techniques, and get screened for common infections.N is for Neurohormones: Hormonal imbalances can impact your mind—and yourschoolwork—in negative ways. Thyroid abnormalities can sap energy levels andlead to fuzzy thinking, difficulty concentrating, and attention problems. Excesscortisol can make you vulnerable to stress and anxiety. Problems withreproductive hormones can drain motivation and cause mood swings and brain fog.Optimization strategies: Get your hormone levels checked. Steer clear of“hormone disruptors”—pesticides, certain personal care products andcosmetics—that negatively affect hormone function and production.D is for Diabesity: Having high blood sugar levels and/or being overweight orobese is known as “diabesity.” High blood sugar has been linked to lower bloodflow in the brain and a smaller hippocampus, the brain region linked withlearning, memory, and moods. Obesity and being overweight are detrimental tobrain health and are associated with a smaller brain, decreased blood flow,ADHD, and many other issues.Optimization strategies: Know your numbers—body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hipratio, A1C, fasting blood sugar, and fasting insulin levels. Limit pizza andbeer (they are not brain foods) and focus your diet on brain-healthy nutrition(see chapter 15 [Chapter15.xhtml#ch15]).S is for Sleep: As you sleep, your brain consolidates learning and memory,prepares for the following day, and takes out the neural trash—the cellulardebris and toxins that build up during the day.Optimization strategies: Aim for 7 to 8 hours of sleep a night and follow ahealthy sleep regimen. Turn off your tech gadgets at night so they don’tinterrupt your sleep.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Tap into the power of outlines. In writing, the “big picture” means having anoutline of your thoughts before you begin. Such a road map makes it possible toknow where you are going. It makes writing an essay or term paper much easierand less time consuming. Diving into writing an essay without an outline meansyou will probably veer off on tangents, fail to make a cohesive argument, orhave to rewrite several times to rear-range passages.Similarly, in public speaking, it is essential to know where you want to takeyour audience. It is certainly much simpler to start with general ideas andintegrate specifics rather than to begin with isolated details and try toconnect them in a logical form.Keep the context in mind. An idea is easier to understand if you know itscontext. For example, look at some instances in the development of personality.If you objectively view the behavior of 4-year-olds, you might imagine that theyhave many psychotic traits. They are frequently found talking to themselves ortheir invisible friends. They have delusions of grandeur, thinking that they arefictitious characters that they see on television or in books. They also thinkthey can run the house and marry mommy if only daddy will go away! These4-year-olds seem to be constantly hallucinating, screaming that bears are intheir bathrooms or that incredibly large creatures, monsters, whatchamacallits,or whatever are under their beds. If this information on 4-year-olds was notviewed in relation to the “big picture” of their development, our state mentalhospitals would look like nursery schools. If you look at all the details ortraits put together in the big picture and watch it grow over time, it allbegins to make sense. The same goes for studying. Putting the facts you’relearning into context helps you grasp their meaning.Develop a system. In medical school, you will continue running into trees if youdo not see the forest. First-year medical students must learn 25,000 new words,and in the second year an additional 25,000 words. If they do not have a systemof learning new words and putting them into “the big picture,” their brains willundoubtedly go on strike and refuse to process anything but confusion andscattered thoughts. However, if they learn the suffixes, prefixes, and commondenominators of root words, the task becomes tolerable.Develop a system for every subject you learn, whether it’s algebra, history, orgeography. Once you have a system in place, it simplifies the learning process.It allows you to focus on the material rather than trying to figure out how tolearn it at the same time.Put things into historical perspective. If you want to avoid getting discouragedby all the details, it’s also important to know where you have been and whereyou are going. If you feel lost in the details, just stop, seek out the mostcommon idea, then work your way down to the specifics. For example, if you’restudying American history and need to know specifics about the ratification ofthe 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1920, your task will be madesimpler if you first understand the events of major importance that led up tothe event, such as the women’s suffrage movement and the efforts of people likeSusan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. If you try to focus on all themicro-details without that main perspective, your brain will become overloadedand will not be able to take in any more information. But if you mentallyhighlight key points and then break them down from there, you will be muchbetter off.Favor the “big picture” over the facts. It has been estimated that we rememberonly 10 to 15 percent of what we learn in high school and college, and that weuse less than half of that. Unfortunately, medical school is the same way. (Whatour patients don’t know might hurt them!) Doctors forget many of the facts theyonce knew; however, understanding the big picture is more important. Forexample, is it more advantageous for a neuroscientist to know the exact numberof neurons in the brain or to understand how those neurons function?Learn how to learn. Cultural anthropologist Margaret Mead once said, “Childrenmust be taught how to think, not what to think.” I think you can replace theword “children” with “students” and her statement is equally true. This sameconcept arose in a statement that the dean of my medical school gave to myclass: “In 10 years, 80 percent of what you learned in medical school will beobsolete [not a very comforting thought!]. You are here not only to learncertain medical subjects, but more importantly, to learn a lifelong method oflearning and problem solving.” It has been my experience that having a solidfoundation and being constantly aware of the “big picture” is more than half ofthe battle.Go from the “big picture” to the small details. This principle continues tooperate effectively even as you are pursuing the pickiest of details. I know atthis point that many of you are saying to yourselves, “It is nice to want toremember this stuff after graduation, but I’m worried about just getting throughnext Tuesday. The ‘big picture’ is fine, but you never had Dr. Wilson, whosetest next week will question me on the number of electrons of hydrogen in amilliliter of tsetse fly saliva.” Believe me, I have had my share of thoseteachers who thought that their academic corners were the only important ones.The only way that I could do well in their classes was to go from “big picture”ideas to the small details, trying to make sense of it all along the way.If you schedule yourself and your study time, you’ll have the time to get the“big picture” as well as the picky details. If you start with the details,you’ll get bogged down and won’t ever have the time to get the “big picture.”There was one particular student in my medical school class who was infamous forhaving the details without the corresponding concepts. He often bragged aboutthe amount of time he studied and the volume of facts he memorized. But becausethe “big picture” usually escaped him, he had trouble with many tests. He wouldget outraged when fellow students who had grasped only the “big picture” didbetter than he did. I recall one time when his roommate (who was in charge ofextracurricular partying) got a 99 percent on a histology laboratory exam afterstudying for only 2 hours. His own grade, however, was 75 percent after studyingfor more than 10 hours. When he heard the test scores as we were working in theanatomy lab, he fell to his knees and cried out to God over the injustice of itall!I agree, if you’re going to spend the time, you should be rewarded for youreffort, but only if you get the “big picture.” And remember to study smarter,not harder. If you spend 10 hours focused on the tiny details but don’t knowwhere they stem from or how they all connect, that’s a waste of time that youcould have used for a much-needed break.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR GRADES: FROM GENERALIZATIONS TO SPECIFICS• Start with generalities, then work toward specifics.• Keep the “big picture” of what you are doing constantly in front of you.• The “big picture” is what you will remember, and it is your key tounderstanding the details.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageContent":"6 [Contents.xhtml#rch6]GET ORGANIZED [Contents.xhtml#rch6]ORGANIZING YOUR CLASSES, YOUR TIME, AND YOURSELF [Contents.xhtml#rch6]What do Post-It Notes, the microwave oven, super glue, and Teflon all have incommon? They were all invented by accident. If you can come up with a winninginvention by chance, you may wonder why you need to be organized or why you needto have a lot of discipline. Take it from Bruno Mars: The world-famous,platinum-selling musical artist says, “You can’t knock on opportunity’s door andnot be ready.”Look at Sir Alexander Fleming, for example. Most people think that when hediscovered penicillin in 1928 at St. Mary’s Hospital in London, it was a freakaccident. It is true that by chance he noticed a mold contaminant on a cultureplate of staphylococci, which had resulted in a killing zone of the bacteria.But without his previous foundation in microbiology, the organization of hislaboratory, his time, and his discipline to follow through on his discovery,that chance accident might have gone unnoticed for 50 more years. In actualfact, that accident of nature must have occurred many times before, but no onewas sufficiently prepared to discover it!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE CEREBELLUM: THE ORGANIZATION HELPERGetting organized requires a healthy brain, and especially a healthy cerebellum(and PFC). Latin for “little brain,” the cerebellum is located at the backbottom part of the brain, and it plays an essential role in thoughtcoordination, processing complex information, and organization. The cerebellummakes up only 10 percent of the brain’s volume, but this powerhouse region iswhere half of all the brain’s neurons reside. Research indicates that the“little brain” is also involved in processing speed, which simply refers to howquickly you can assimilate new information. When activity in the cerebellum islow, people tend to process information more slowly and be more disorganized intheir thinking. If your thinking is disorganized, it’s going to be hard toorganize your studies. Some forms of ADHD (we have identified seven types ofADHD) are related to low activity in the cerebellum, and disorganization is oneof the hallmarks of the condition. However, be aware that being somewhatdisorganized does not mean you have ADHD.In our brain imaging studies, we also do a series of scans that show brainactivity. The white in the following image shows the areas of increasedactivity. In a healthy scan the cerebellum at the back of the brain is typicallythe most active.Cerebellum optimization strategies: Engage in coordination activities, such astable tennis (my favorite), any form of dancing where you need to memorizechoreography, yoga, and tai chi. As little as 10 minutes of table tennis boostsactivity in the cerebellum (and PFC), according to a Japanese brain imagingstudy. Go easy with beer and other alcoholic beverages, as alcohol lowers bloodflow to the cerebellum, which slows your thinking.Healthy Active SPECT Scan[../images/f083.jpg]White equals the most active part of the brain, typically in cerebellum in back,bottom areaLow Overall Activity[../images/f083a.jpg]Low activity in the cerebellum--------------------------------------------------------------------------------ORGANIZATION PRINCIPLE #1: SCHEDULE YOUR TIMESo how do you begin putting together an organizational structure that willincrease your effectiveness and reduce your study time? First, you need toorganize the time you have. Time can be a trusted ally or, as is often the case,a harassing enemy!Track your time. Before you can organize your time, you need to have an idea ofhow you spend your 1,440 minutes a day. The best way to do that is to take stockof what you do and how much time you spend doing it. Tracking your dailyactivities for a full week will give you interesting information about yourselfthat can be of great value. We often think “I don’t have enough time,” but inreality, we do have the time, we just have to better allocate the time we have.Schedule your study time. Now that you’ve determined how you’re currentlyspending your time, you can decide how to use that time to your advantage.There’s an old adage that says you should spend two hours studying for everyhour of class time, but as you have probably noticed, this is seldom achieved.Besides, every class is unique, and the amount of study time required will varywith each section of each course you study. The time spent on each subject willalso vary with the school that you attend and the grade you’re in. If you’re inmiddle school, you don’t need to put in as many hours as someone in medicalschool or law school.Budget time for all of your courses. First, you need to eyeball your scheduleand estimate how much time is required for each class so you can establish aschedule that allows ample time for each subject. Don’t neglect the classesoutside of your major or those that have fewer units. I remember my firstsemester of medical school, when gross anatomy was the major hurdle; I was sotaken up with anatomy that I neglected a smaller course in histology. I didgreat in anatomy, but that was at the price of a mediocre grade in histology.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[../images/moniter.jpg]TECH TIP FROM CHLOE AND ALIZÉDownload a productivity app and use it to track how much time you spend on yourhomework versus on social media, and use a Fitbit or other tech tools to trackyour sleeping, eating, class time, work hours, sports activities, and leisuretime.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Be realistic. If you are accustomed to spending 20 hours a week studying,setting up a 35-hour-a-week schedule is only inviting disaster! Set yourself upto succeed and make it realistic. If you make it impossible to achieve yourgoals, you’re less likely to be motivated in general. The best way to break oldhabits and patterns is to give yourself positive, reinforcing experiences. Ifyou lock yourself into an impossible schedule, you will be quickly frustratedand give up the idea altogether. If, however, your schedule is reasonable, thenyou will find that you can adhere to it, and it will boost your self-esteem!That alone will often motivate you to study better and learn more.Build in some wiggle room. When creating your schedule, allow for someflexibility. Realize that the first schedule you set up is only a rough estimateof your time, and that it will need to be revised. This revision should takeplace at least every two weeks and will depend on the difficulty of certainsections in subjects, the dates that term papers are due, the dates of quizzesand mid-terms, and so on.A time schedule is a lot like a budget. If you’re reasonable and flexible insetting it up, then the budget can be of enormous value and security to you,giving you helpful guidelines for spending your money (time) wisely. If,however, you’re unreasonable or too rigid with the budget you set up, you willbe frustrated by the whole process and toss it to the wind. And you’ll feelworse than when you started for failing to follow through with something youbegan.ORGANIZATION PRINCIPLE #2: CREATE A PLAN OF ATTACKThe second principle in building your organizational structure is to have asystematic approach for each class that you take.Lean on your professor. One of the best resources you have is the professor whois teaching the course. Students often think that teachers are too busy forthem, or that they don’t want to be bothered with questions outside of class.Nothing could be further from the truth. Sure, there are some self-aggrandizingtypes who think their own research projects are more important than theirstudents, but they are usually the exception. It has been my experience thatalthough most teachers are busy, they welcome personal contact with students,and they derive tremendous satisfaction from showing students how to learn theirdiscipline. Teachers are also often impressed by a student’s interest in theirclass, and that may be an important point if your grade teeters on theborderline between an A and a B or a B and a C.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[../images/moniter.jpg]TECH TIP FROM CHLOE AND ALIZÉCheck out online reviews of college courses and instructors to find out what toexpect from a class.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Don’t hesitate to approach the prof and take advantage of their experience andadvice on how you should organize yourself for the class. After all, professorshave spent six to eight years getting advanced degrees in a particular subjectand have likely been teaching it for several years, so they are qualified toguide you through their forest.Read the syllabus. It is definitely worth your time to read through the syllabusbefore you actually start the class. Many students never take the time to readthe syllabus at any time during a course, let alone before it begins. This is ashame because this document serves several purposes. First, the syllabus is theprofessor’s way of introducing you to what lies ahead for you in the course andwhat is expected from you, so it will help you know how to schedule your time.Second, it usually gives you the “big picture” right off the bat so you canstart the semester with a basic understanding of what’s important about thesubject. Third, it gives you time to find another class if you realize this onewas not what you had in mind.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[../images/moniter.jpg]TECH TIP FROM CHLOE AND ALIZÉLook for summaries of your required reading online. These aren’t meant toreplace reading the actual textbook, but they can help you get the “big picture”before tackling the whole book.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Get a second (or third or fourth) opinion. If you’re unsure about a class, tryto find people who have previously taken it from the same instructor and askthem what to expect. Hearing that others have made it out alive and well willmake it seem doable. Plus, you’ll have a valuable source of advice andinformation. Ask them: • how they approached the class • what was expected from them in class • what kind of exams were given and how they were graded • if there were any pop quizzes • if they have copies of old exams (if the professor does not object,get these!) • what were the best ways to approach the instructor • what books were the most useful for the class • what they liked best or didn’t like about the classIf you can, talk to someone who excelled in the class as well as someone whostruggled. Sometimes, a student who didn’t do well in a class is better able tooffer insights into potential challenges you might face, such as an instructorwho talks so fast it’s impossible to keep up with your notes. If you don’t haveaccess to someone who has had the same instructor for a class, it is stillhelpful to talk to someone who has taken the same class from another professor.They will also have valuable information to share. Do not neglect this gold mineof knowledge!Check out the textbooks. The required reading list for a class can be animportant source of information for organizing your time. As I mentioned above,ask other students which books are valuable for the class and if there are anybooks on the reading list that are not worth purchasing. In college especially,some professors don’t have the “big picture”—or your bank balance—in mind whenthey choose textbooks. There may be more valuable sources available to you, solook for them. We will explore this important point at length in the nextchapter.Organize your notes. Organizing your notes efficiently can truly have lastingvalue, and we will explore this topic in depth in chapter 8[Chapter08.xhtml#ch8]. But for now, let me just bring up one pertinent point: Ifyou don’t organize and file your notes, papers, and exams after you havefinished with them, they are almost certainly lost to you! What would you do if,at the end of a long year, you looked at an eight-foot-high stack of old classnotebooks piled in the corner? Would you spend hours separating, organizing, andfiling them individually? Probably not. If you’re like most of us, you wouldtoss the notebooks into the trash.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[../images/moniter.jpg]TECH TIP FROM CHLOE AND ALIZÉIf a teacher speaks too fast to take notes efficiently, record lectures on yoursmartphone and use voice transcription to create a first draft of notes. Be sureto go through the transcription to correct any mistakes.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Luckily for you, computers have made it much easier to organize your notes. Ifyou prefer to take notes on your computer, it helps to keep a separate folderfor each class. Organizing all your notes by chapter or unit makes it convenientto study for tests. And it’s easy to keep these files for future reference.Believe me, I have gone back to my old notes and papers many times. You mayspend up to 30 minutes a week labeling and filing your material, but it is timewell spent because you will have something of lasting value. Remember to includetime for organizing your notes in your weekly schedule.ORGANIZATION PRINCIPLE #3: ORGANIZE YOURSELFThe final overarching organization principle relates to you. I touched ondiscipline earlier in this chapter, and I firmly believe that discipline is thekey to organization. Having a disciplined and organized mind will help youaccomplish the goals you set for yourself. Dr. M. Scott Peck, the author of TheRoad Less Traveled,1 [Bibliography_3.xhtml#c6_rfn1] says that developingself-discipline involves learning four basic techniques: • Learning how to delay gratification, “which is a process ofscheduling the pain and pleasure of life in such a way as to enhance thepleasure by meeting and experiencing the pain first and getting it over with. Itis the only decent way to live.” This means do your homework first, then checkyour social media feeds or meet up with your friends in person. • Learning to assume responsibility, which is realizing that you arein charge of your life and your education. Your success as a student is yourresponsibility, not some whim of chance or the fault of poor teachers. Theoutcome is up to you. • Learning to be dedicated to truth and reality. The truth is that youhave sufficient resources, and the reality is that it takes hard work and oftenlong hours to prepare yourself for your goals. • Learning the art of balancing, which Peck says is the disciplinethat gives us flexibility and is certainly necessary if you want to developwholeness in your life.When your mind is organized and disciplined, you will find it much easier tokeep your schedule and schoolwork organized.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR GRADES: GETTING ORGANIZED• Discipline and organization are the basic tools required to learn fasterand solve problems at school and in life in general.• Organize your study time by first taking inventory of your available time.• Set up a realistic and flexible study schedule by estimating how much studytime you need for each class and revising the schedule as your needs change.• Establish a systematic approach to each class by consulting with yourprofessors and with students who have taken the class previously.• Utilize the syllabus and textbooks in your study approach.• Organize your notes to get lasting value from them.• Organize yourself by learning to delay gratification, to assumeresponsibility, to be dedicated to truth and reality, and to put balance intoyour life.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageContent":"7 [Contents.xhtml#rch7]METHODS TO SUCCESS [Contents.xhtml#rch7]METHODS OF STUDY [Contents.xhtml#rch7]Study methods can either work to your advantage and help you reach your goalsfaster with less effort, or they can work against you and make it harder for youto achieve success. If your approach to thinking and studying is consistent andleads to rational conclusions and assimilated material, then you have abeneficial method. If, however, your methods of thinking and studying arehaphazard or too rigid, you may find yourself in a very unproductive andfrustrating state of mind. The most successful students use study methods thatare productive and economical, while underachieving students tend to havemethods that are frustrating and inefficient.Everyone has methods for studying; the trick is to develop an effective,systematic approach to learning that works for you. This chapter will introduceyou to a variety of study methods. It’s up to you to choose the ones that workbest for you.HAVE A GAME PLANCreating an overall game plan for your classes involves deciding how you’regoing to approach each subject before the semester begins. One of the best gameplans is to “blow out” (not blow off!) the first few weeks of the semester. Thismeans putting maximum effort into doing well in the first part of your classes.Many students think they can ease into the new school year and spend thebeginning of the semester catching up on partying with friends they haven’t seenall summer. This is a big mistake. Blowing off this part of the year isdangerous. It leaves you behind in classes, and you often miss importantfoundational material. Not only that, but the first week or so leaves animpression for the rest of the year not only on your teachers and peers but alsoon yourself. If you’re prepared and work hard at the start of the year, you’remore likely to continue that way, and it will be much easier to stay on track.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE MOST EFFECTIVE METHOD: HARNESS THE POWER OF YOUR PREFRONTAL CORTEX (PFC)The PFC, which is located behind your forehead, is involved in executivefunctions, such as planning, focus, forethought, judgment, and organization. Itis considered the most human part of the brain and makes up about 30 percent ofits total volume. When the PFC isn’t working right, it makes it hard for you tocome up with an effective study plan and stick with it. Emma came to see me whenshe was 19 years old because she had just gotten kicked out of college, and shewas feeling depressed and anxious about her future. Emma had an IQ of 140, butshe was so disorganized and scattered in her approach to schoolwork that she wasalways turning in assignments late and pulling all-nighters before tests becauseshe hadn’t scheduled her time appropriately.When we scanned Emma’s brain while she was resting, her PFC activity lookedhealthy. But when we scanned her brain while she was focusing on a concentrationtask, the activity in her PFC decreased. In a healthy brain, PFC activity shouldincrease when concentrating. A decrease in PFC activity is a classic sign ofADHD, and with a comprehensive treatment plan, Emma was able to reenroll incollege. She got organized, came up with a study plan, stuck with it, andgraduated with honors.If you struggle with organization and planning or with inattention andrestlessness—even if you don’t have ADHD—it’s important to strengthen your PFC.Boosting dopamine is the key. (See chapter 2 [Chapter02.xhtml#ch2] for specificways to enhance the function of the PFC.)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you follow the principle of doing well in the beginning, you will notice atleast three positive effects on the rest of your semester: • First, your effort will be on establishing a solid foundation, andas we have seen before, building knowledge on a good foundation is a lot easierthan building on one made of sand. • Second, by working hard during the first part of the semester, youwill do well in the class and subsequently build your self-esteem. With yourconfidence improved, it will be easier for you to continue in a positive andproductive way. You will feel good about yourself because your efforts will havepaid off. This is a lot easier to do in the beginning because the material isusually foundational. If you are missing that foundation, you will find thatyour efforts are not paying high dividends, thus decreasing your stimulus to putforth the effort. • Third, if you do well in the beginning, you will leave yourself somebreathing room in the event of a disruption in your personal life making itdifficult for you to study for a week or two. This could be something negative,such as illness, or positive, such as meeting someone special who makes it hardto concentrate on anything else. You will also do better in your classes simplybecause you will be under less pressure to perform.This foundational principle is one of the chief reasons for my success incollege and medical school. By obtaining a solid foundation, developingself-confidence, being rewarded for my effort, and leaving myself breathing roomto learn under less pressure, I was able to achieve my immediate academic goals.AVOID THE TEST-TO-TEST SYNDROMEAnother aspect of the game plan involves learning how not to spend the semestersimply going from test to test. This a common syndrome in college and is almostthe norm in medical school. Many students survive in school by studying for onlyone test at a time—the next one—and leaving all other work until after the exam.But as my own work with students will verify, there is a price to pay for thishabit in the form of anxiety, high blood pressure, and insomnia.Schedule your time, not just during a study session, but throughout the semester(see chapter 6 [Chapter06.xhtml#ch6] for tips). If you adhere to a reasonableschedule, you can eliminate, or at least decrease, the test-to-test syndrome asa study method. This will give you a more positive outlook and a healthier body.GO BEYOND YOUR TEXTBOOKSIf you’re like many students, you may believe your education begins and endswith the first and last pages of your textbooks. You may not realize that thereare many other materials that can be even more valuable than those textbooks.Specifically, I am referring to three sources: review books, recent journal oronline articles, and old exams.Use review or outline books. I call these “big picture” books because they giveyou the straight stuff you need to remember. These resources are great forgetting a quick overview before you read your text and are also very useful forreview later. If you happen to come across some useful information, highlight itor write it on a sticky note and attach it to the rest of your study materials.Do not, however, use them as your only source. If you do, you will likely findthat the facts will not make as much sense as they should. You can find outabout these books from your teachers or fellow students or by going to thelibrary or by searching an online bookstore. Scour the internet for additionalarticles and resources, but make sure they are reliable sources—and sorry, butnote that Wikipedia itself is not a reliable source, although the sources listedat the end of a Wikipedia entry may prove to be useful.Read recent journal and online articles. If you train yourself in school to beinformed on the latest developments in your field of interest, you will carrythis trait with you into your professional life. Periodical literature, besidesgiving you the most current information, often will present a topic more clearlyand concisely than your textbook. Find the online journals that are mostbeneficial to your studies and use the information in them to your advantage.Review old exams. Get your hands on some old exams—if your professor doesn’tmind! Be aware that some professors frown on this and some categorically refuseto hand out old tests, while others see no problem with it. Old tests can be asvaluable a resource as your textbook, lecture notes, or review books. They willshow you what the professor thinks is important to learn, thus guiding yourstudy. They will illustrate how the professor writes test questions so you candetermine how to answer the questions. Also, studying old exams is an excellentreview method for testing yourself on the material. Finally, teachers have adifficult time making up new test questions each year, so questions on old testswill likely reappear on the current test. Be smart and try to get copies of oldtests from previous students or from the professor. You can easily make flashcards based on the old test questions and study them on your phone or carry themwith you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[../images/moniter.jpg]TECH TIP FROM CHLOE AND ALIZÉQuizlet is a great app you can use to create flashcards.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------LEARN THE PRELUDES TO METHODSBefore I discuss the different methods of study, I want to mention a few simplestatements or principles that I believe are basic to all good study methods.Do a quick recap. Before beginning a study session, quickly review the materialyou studied the day before. This will increase your exposure to it and will alsogive you an opportunity to test your understanding and recall of it.Study in units that are defined. Before a study session, carefully andsystematically choose a block of material to be covered. In this way, you’llhave specific goals for your time and can regulate the amount of material youcover. Divide all of your study material by the amount of time you have tostudy, so you know how much time to devote to each section. This way, each timeyou complete a section, you’ll feel like you’re making progress, and it won’tseem like endless work.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[../images/moniter.jpg]TECH TIP FROM CHLOE AND ALIZÉUse the timer on your smartphone to let you know when it’s time to move on tothe next study unit.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Rewrite for better comprehension. If you’re having trouble with a statement thatis poorly written, try to rephrase it in your own words. If you do this, yourretention of the point will be especially increased.Make sure you understand the material. Memorizing material doesn’t necessarilymean you have actually learned it. Learning follows understanding. If youunderstand what you have memorized, then you have learned the material. On theother hand, if you can recite facts but cannot make sense of them, you may passthe test, but you haven’t learned anything.Apply what you learn. At every opportunity available to you, try to take whatyou have learned and make a practical application of it. Make connectionsbetween everyday activities and the material. This way, when you’re taking atest, you’ll remember that situation. Application is integral to retention.Shore up your foundation. If you’re having problems in the beginning of a class,go back to the basics. It’s better to strengthen your foundation than to waste asemester in confusion.5 SUREFIRE STUDY METHODS FOR SUCCESSI recommend five specific study methods to increase your chances of success:1. Preview/review. Previewing and reviewing will tells you where you are goingand where you have been—two-thirds of the work.Getting an overview before you dive into a subject and summarizing what you havelearned are the two principles that frame the “big picture.” If you practicereading the summaries and skimming the material as you begin, you’ll know whatto expect during your study session, and you’ll be able to develop a plan forcompleting your task.Then, as your study session is nearing its conclusion, take a few minutes towrite a short summary of what you have learned. This practice will reinforceyour understanding and will provide insight into particular problem areas.2. Test making. One of my favorite study methods is making up test questionsduring and after the study period. By doing this, you learn to pick out theimportant facts and reinforce what you have studied. If you write thesequestions, you will have a good, quick source of review to consult right beforean exam. When I studied, I kept a separate piece of paper with my own questionson it (with the answers on the back). It often turned out that I would have 30to 50 percent of the test on those sheets of paper.If you have questions on the material you are studying, you should also makenotes of these and seek clarification from the professor or other sources.Keeping a record of questions about the material you do not understand ishelpful in review, because if you had trouble with the material initially, youwill likely need more review to master it.Creating your own test questions on the material you do not understand will taketime and will slow you down initially. However, this practice will save you timeand energy in the long run because you won’t need to read through the textbookor your notes four or five times before you assimilate the material.3. Underlining. Underlining (or highlighting) important material in textbooks ornotes is a very popular method of study and, if used properly, it can be avaluable tool in your study arsenal. However, this method is often overdone.There was a student in my medical school class who underlined virtuallyeverything in his text or notes—using 14 different colors to denote the degreeof importance for the material! Underlining while you study is effective forthree reasons: • First, it helps you focus on what’s important. If you underlineeverything, you’re wasting your time. Select the summary sentence of aparagraph, the main fact statements, and important supporting material.Underline what you want to remember and what you think might be on exams. • Second, underlining helps you be active. By selecting importantstatements to underline, you are forcing yourself to take an active role instudying, so you will be less likely to passively read through the material andmiss important points. You will instead be interacting with it. • Third, underlining helps you review. If you have the pertinentpoints highlighted, then you can quickly review what you have studied. If youhave underlined nothing (or everything), you will have to waste time ploddingthrough all of it to review.4. Outlining. If it is done concisely and thoughtfully, outlining will re-exposeyou to the material in a slower, more methodical manner, thus increasing thechance for retention. In addition, as with underlining, you’ll be taking anactive role in your studies by deciding what information is important enough torewrite. It is easy to underline everything in a book, but when you outline,you’ll force yourself to restate only the important material. And finally,outlining provides you with a valuable tool for review when it is time to studyfor the test. Many students, even after they have underlined their texts, nevergo back to their books before the exam. They instead rely on their notes andoutlines.Outlining is simple. Start by putting the textbook title, lecture title, ormajor topic at the top of the page. Below that, list the main concepts covered.Label each one with Roman numerals (I, II, III, IV, V). Under those, use numbersor just bullet points to list the most important things you need to remember.However, there are disadvantages to outlining. First, this method can be verytime-consuming, and if you are very busy, you’ll have trouble doing itconsistently. Second, outlining demands a patient individual who can see thevalue of slowly going through new material. If you’re the type who wants tostudy as quickly as possible, outlining may not be for you.If you decide to create outlines, highlight the important facts of new materialin a consistent fashion.5: Pretend to be a teacher. Imagine that you’re teaching a class and have topresent the information you’ve learned in your own words. Explain the conceptsout loud as if you were in front of a room full of students. This is one of thebest ways to pinpoint the material you’ve understood and reveal the conceptsthat need additional review.In conclusion, realize that you are unique. After you have given each method afair trial, choose the ones that work best for you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR GRADES: METHODS TO STUDY• Do your best in the first part of the semester. This will help youestablish a solid foundation, build your self-esteem, and leave you somebreathing room.• Take advantage of “other” materials, including review books, onlinemagazine articles, and old exams. There is more to education than the textbooks.• Make the “preludes to methods” part of your study symphony. These includebeginning study sessions with a quick review of previous work, studying indefined units, rewording poorly written statements, learning by firstunderstanding, and applying what you learn.• Use overview and summary techniques.• Create test questions for yourself to check your comprehension and to learnhow to choose important facts.• Underline to focus, to be active, and to review.• Create outlines only if you’re a patient person since it is time consuming.• Pretend to be a teacher to gauge how well you’ve understood the material.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageContent":"8 [Contents.xhtml#rch8]IT’S A CLASS ACT [Contents.xhtml#rch8]CLASS SKILLS [Contents.xhtml#rch8]Screaming 5-year-olds clutch their mommy’s leg and look as though Godzilla iswaiting for them behind the classroom door. Then they plead with their mommy,asking, “Why do I have to go to kindergarten?” Years later, those same studentshave given up the screaming and leg clutching, but they may still be asking thesame question: “Why do I have to go to class?” Their rationalization skills havelikely improved. They leave Godzilla out of the argument and contend that theycan get all the necessary information online or that their classes are so boringthat someone could get rich by recording them and selling the lectures toincurable insomniacs.If you can relate to these thoughts and think going to class is a big waste oftime, it may simply be because you’re lacking in some basic class skills. Whenyou have the skills needed to operate at peak efficiency during class, you cangreatly reduce your study time and perform better on homework and exams.Before I discuss the specific skills necessary for making class time asuccessful experience, I first want to answer the question, “Why should I go toclass?” There are many reasons for attending class: • increase your knowledge of a particular subject • have the professor clarify questionable points for you • meet other students • observe how other students approach the class • find a compatible study partner • make sure you aren’t dropped from the roster (if attendance isrequired)Of course, the most important reason to attend class is the lecture itself.During the lecture, you will usually be taught: • how to learn the subject • what information the teacher thinks is important • what will be on exams (important clues for exams are almost alwaysgiven in class) • how to assimilate the subject so it will have practical value foryouIf you master the lecture, your study time will decrease significantly becauseyou’ll know what is important and how to go about learning and assimilating it.In this chapter, you’ll discover seven strategies that will help you get themost out of class time.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE MINDFULNESS EQUATION: BEING PRESENT IN THE MOMENT ADDS UP TO MORE GRAYMATTERYou may have heard about the power of mindfulness to help you calm stress andrelax, but did you know it can help your brain? Research shows that mindfulnessmeditation increases the brain’s gray matter volume in brain regions involved inlearning and memory processes, self-regulation, and more.1[Bibliography_4.xhtml#c8_rfn1] Basically, mindfulness is intentionally focusingyour attention on something. For the purposes of making the most of theclassroom experience, being mindful means being fully present and payingattention in class.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1. BE PREPAREDOnce you’ve made the commitment to attend class faithfully, the next importantstep is to prepare yourself for what is going to happen there. As I saidearlier, preparation is paramount to accomplishment.Prepare yourself. This means you need to get enough sleep the night before. Didyou know that getting less than six hours of sleep at night is associated withlower overall brain activity and can adversely affect your productivity? Aim forseven to eight hours of sleep each night. You also need to eat in the morningbefore school and at lunchtime to maintain your mental energy, but don’t eat toomuch or it can make you fall asleep. (You’ll discover much more about what toeat to help you stay focused and alert in chapter 15 [Chapter15.xhtml#ch15].)Get some physical exercise every day. Regular exercise has been found to improvememory, relieve stress, and boost moods, as well as reduce symptoms of ADHD,depression, and anxiety.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[../images/moniter.jpg]TECH TIP FROM CHLOE AND ALIZÉIf you’re taking an online course, understand that communication is differentfrom a face-to-face setting. Online classes that are straight lectures can bevery beneficial and big time-savers. But if a class involves demonstrations orrequires student interaction, you may be better off in a classroom setting.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Read the syllabus. It’s important to know what is going to be happening in classbefore the class starts. Believe me, it is very disheartening to get to classonly to discover that you forgot about the midterm that day or the paper that isdue. Read the course outline and find out what is happening.Read the section of the text that deals with the upcoming class. This servesthree purposes. First, it familiarizes you with new vocabulary words, thusdecreasing the distraction of asking your friend, “What’s a cluster headache?Could it be this class?” While they are laughing at your question, you both havemissed the next three important points. A tip is to write down all of yourquestions as you go and save them for after class so you don’t miss anything inbetween. Second, reading ahead gives you the opportunity to solidify newinformation, because the lecture will be your second exposure to the material.After reading the text you may have some unanswered questions, which you canthen ask in class. Third, you’ll be able to participate intelligently in class,which will further solidify the material as well as impress the professor (whichis not the goal, but certainly cannot hurt).2. SET GOALSSet specific goals for what you want to accomplish during class. Getting alittle ahead in whatever material you can will help optimize your time in classand relieve some stress. These goals may involve having your questions answered,seeing what the professor emphasizes in a certain section, and trying to figureout what will be on the exam.One goal that I always had when preparing for class was to try to get a copy ofthe professor’s lecture notes. This was not always possible, because manyteachers lecture from memory or do not want their notes copied. It has been myexperience, however, that most teachers have extensive notes on their lecturetopic. If they are approached in the right way, they are happy to let studentscopy them.The advantages of having these notes are obvious: You won’t have to worry thatyour notes are incomplete, and you’ll often find the important points underlinedor starred, thus emphasizing what the teacher thinks is important. Even if youdo get a copy of your teacher’s notes, I still recommend taking notes duringclass because it is a method of active learning that keeps your brain engagedand reduces your chances of tuning out or daydreaming during class.3. AVOID DISTRACTIONS AND STAY AWAKETo get the most out of class, you need to minimize distractions so you can stayfocused, and you need to stay awake and alert. The number one rule is to be sureto use the restroom before class. You simply can’t concentrate on what theinstructor is saying if you’re in desperate need of a bathroom break. Similarly,if you feel like you’re dying of thirst or your stomach is grumbling loudly, itwill be hard to stay focused on the class material. Make it a habit to bring awater bottle with you and carry snacks you can munch on in between classes.Classrooms are often too hot or too cold, so dress in a way that allows you toadd or remove a layer to keep comfortable. And try to avoid sitting next tostudents who talk loudly or use their phones during class, who annoyingly taptheir pens on the tabletop, or who eat smelly food during class. Sitting nearthe front of the class lessens distractions and helps you observe the professorbetter, thus enabling you to pick up nonverbal cues that would not be as evidentfrom farther away.Did you know that checking your phone in class could cost you half a grade onexams? That’s what researchers at Rutgers University discovered in a 2018study.2 [Bibliography_4.xhtml#c8_rfn2] The study found that having a tech devicein class didn’t lower comprehension in that particular lecture, but it reducedscores on final exams by 5 percent, which is the equivalent of half a grade.What’s more surprising is that students who didn’t have a device in class alsogot lower scores if others in the lecture used their tech tools.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[../images/moniter.jpg]TECH TIP FROM CHLOE AND ALIZÉIf you can’t resist the temptation to scroll through your social media feed orcheck your messages, put your phone away in your purse or backpack so you can’tsee it.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you find that you tend to fall asleep in class, here are a few suggestionsthat may help. First, try drinking some cold water before class. Did you knowthat fatigue can be a sign of dehydration? Water makes up more than half yourbody weight, and your brain and body can’t function optimally without it. Aglass of water before or during class can help you feel more awake andrefreshed. Some students find that fidgeting with a small toy—quietly!—can helpkeep you stimulated as well. If you keep your hands busy, you’ll be less likelyto nod off. Of course, don’t do this if you need to be taking notes. Anotherhelpful technique to avoid falling asleep during class is to sit as near to thefront of the room as possible. It’s embarrassing to fall asleep in class, so ifyou’re in direct view of the teacher, you’ll be less likely to snooze.4. UNDERSTAND THAT HEARING DOES NOT EQUAL LISTENINGMany of you may be asking, “Why do I need to read about how to listen? I’ve beendoing it all of my life.” I’ve got news for you: Just because you’ve been doingsomething for a long time does not necessarily mean your skill level isenviable. If you take a poll among parents and children, husbands and wives, youwill invariably find complaints about nearly everyone’s skill in listening.There are five major steps for effective listening in a classroom situation: • Put yourself in a position to adequately hear the lecturer. Thismeans sitting close to the front of the room, keeping distractions out of sight,and asking the professor to speak up (or repeat) if you’re having troublehearing. • Process what you hear. Hearing, by itself, gives you little or noinformation. Think of all the millions of things you hear every day that yourbrain never processes—street noise, birds chirping, other people talking ontheir phone, your roommate’s YouTube videos, and so on. You need to payattention in order to process what is being said. • Acknowledge that you have heard and processed the information. Aclassroom situation is a two-way street and should involve feedback to theprofessor as the material is being presented. Otherwise, you could just listento lecture tapes. If the professor doesn’t think anyone is paying attention tothe lecture, enthusiasm will diminish and put an end to any chance for aninteresting and stimulating class. We all need feedback, so acknowledge thelecturer with nods when you understand what is being said or with questions whenyou do not. This is part of being an active listener. • React to the lecture. If you’re hearing, processing, andacknowledging what is being presented during a lecture, you will usually reactto it on an emotional level. This can be good if you agree with what is beingsaid, because you’ll feel an emotional bond with the professor. It can even begood if you disagree with what is being presented, because you can have adialogue on the subject, thus increasing your knowledge and maybe evenincreasing the professor’s. Remember that if you disagree with the teacher, thatdoesn’t mean you have nothing in common and can’t learn from them. Disagreementis valuable, if only to solidify your own stand on a subject. People who don’tthink like you still have much to offer, so be tolerant and get as muchinformation from your instructor as you can. • Assimilate what you’ve heard. After you have heard, processed,acknowledged, and reacted to what was presented in class, it’s time to make theinformation a part of yourself. This task can be accomplished only if you havethe big picture of the lecture in mind and understand how and why theinformation is important for the class and your educational goals. If you cantake what was said and give practical meaning to it, assimilation is takingplace. If you’re near the end of a lecture and are having trouble doing this,ask the instructor to help you put it together. Discover the importance of whatyou are doing and how it all fits into the big picture. It will make you anactive listener.5. BECOME A NOTE-TAKING PROIn order to be a successful student, you need to learn to be a swift andefficient note-taker. Why is note-taking so important? You may think you have avery good memory, but each semester the average student spends more than 250hours in lectures, and by the time finals week arrives, those first few weeks ofclass may seem decades away.Notes are the best source for reviewing for exams. In my experience, I foundthat more than 75 percent of the test material for most courses is covered inthe lectures. If you take good notes and study them, this usually results in anautomatic 75 percent or higher on a test; the rest is icing on the cake.Moreover, if you have a good set of notes, your study time will decrease becauseyou’ll have most of the important material in front of you, and you’ll have moredirection about how to learn it.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[../images/moniter.jpg]TECH TIP FROM CHLOE AND ALIZÉIf you take notes on your laptop or tablet, be sure to have a file open andready to go when class begins. Create a folder for each class and use separatefiles for each lecture named by date so you can find them easily. After class,go through your notes and bold or highlight the most important concepts.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Another reason for taking good notes is that you’ll then have them when you needto study for any national exams that you might take, such as the ACT or SAT,GRE, MCAT, LSAT, and so on. And as I have learned over and over again, notes canbe a valuable reference source for you in years to come.Taking good notes takes practice. The following tips can help you master the artof note-taking.Invest in the right tools. Whether you prefer typing on a laptop or handwritingin a spiral notebook, make sure you have the tools that work best for you.Make your notes readable. If your writing is so tiny you can barely see it orit’s illegible, there is no sense in spending the time taking notes. Write asclearly as you can. If a teacher speaks so fast that you’re having troublegetting everything down, ask them to slow down. Most instructors will be glad todo so and will welcome the feedback. Chances are if you are having troublekeeping up, so are others.Label your notes for easy searching. Put the date and the specific subject ofthe lecture at the top of that day’s notes. This will help you organize themwhen studying for exams and will also help you file them.Use abbreviations. To take notes faster, use abbreviations. It doesn’t matter ifyou make them up; just be consistent in their usage. Some common ones that I useare:#number@at~about or approximatelyb/cbecauseb4beforebtwnbetweenespespeciallyetcet cetera, and so onexfor exampleiesuch asimptimportantreregardings/tsomethingthothoughw/withw/iwithinw/owithoutxtimes (e.g., 5x a day)yrsyearsOrganize your lecture notes. Teachers usually follow an outline in lecturing. Ifyou can incorporate their outline into your notes, the notes will be easier tofollow and refer to later. If you cannot detect an outline in the lecture, thenroughly make your own as you go along.Leave margins. When taking notes, be sure that you leave yourself plenty of roomto fill in gaps that will inevitably occur. It’s a good idea to leave a widemargin at the left-hand side of the paper. This will enable you to put mainideas in the margin to indicate what is in the body of the notes.Delineate lists. If a teacher says they are going to explain five steps of achemical process, four reasons why the Civil War started, or three types ofbrain disorders, be sure to make a numbered list of those key elements. You canalso use dashes, bullet points, asterisks, or stars to indicate the major pointsin a list.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[../images/moniter.jpg]TECH TIP FROM CHLOE AND ALIZÉIf you have trouble making up your own abbreviations for common words that youuse a lot, check online for lists of abbreviations.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Compare notes. It’s very helpful to have another, trusted person in your classwith whom you can compare notes. This practice will help both of you fill in thegaps and check your accuracy.Write the right amount. I have known students who sit back and try to assimilatethe material by just hearing the lecture and jot down only a few words here andthere in their notebooks. I have also known students who compulsively writeevery word that is said. It’s obvious that the answer lies somewhere in betweenthese two extremes. If you’re having trouble striking a balance, make sure totip the scale toward the compulsive note-taker’s side. Copious notes areworthwhile, and you can eliminate the excess when you review your notes later.The most important clues about how much to write will come from the professor.The more effort it takes to explain the material to you, the more you shouldtake notice of what they are trying to say. The syllabus takes a great deal ofeffort to prepare, so know what is in it.Check the board. If a teacher writes anything on the chalkboard orwhite board—names, dates, tables, charts, terminology—write it in your notes. Ittakes effort for the professor to do that, so you should recognize the emphasisthey are making.Watch for verbal and nonverbal cues in the lecture. If a teacher says thatsomething is important, why doubt it? After all, the teacher is the one who willbe creating the test. If something is repeated in class three different ways,take note of the increased effort on the teacher’s part, and be sure that youhave that point on paper. If a teacher pauses and looks as if they are waitingfor you to write the point, write it. Watch for changes in tone of voice andlisten to the emphasis placed on certain words. Also be aware of what theteacher’s body language is telling you. Learn to observe and really get to knowyour instructors. It is a skill to be able to read them, and the only way tobecome skillful at this is to make a conscious effort to try to put togetherwhat they say and how they say it.Highlight the big stuff. When it becomes obvious that you do not understand apoint, put a big question mark next to it in your notes so that you won’t forgetto go back to it and have it clarified. Likewise, if you know that something isimportant, underline or star it so that you will remember its importance later.And by all means, if a professor says that something is going to be on a test,make appropriate notation of the fact.Get the big picture. After the big stuff, it’s time to fill in as many detailsas you and the teacher deem necessary. Remember, take your cues from thelecturer—they are getting paid to do it.Stick it out ’til the end. The last point I want to make on note-taking involvespersevering to the end. The last 10 to 15 minutes of a class are usually veryimportant. The teacher will likely summarize the main points and illustratetheir practical usage. They will also tell you what to expect next time. Manystudents are so impatient for the class to end (constantly looking at theclassroom clock, hoping that the lecturer will see them and get the hint) thatthey miss some important information. Be attentive to the end to get the mostout of the class.6. MASTER THE ART OF ASKING QUESTIONSAsking questions in class can be a tricky business. On the one hand, you wantclarification on any points you’ve misunderstood. On the other hand, if you aska long, detailed question with only two minutes left in the class, you riskannoying your classmates who can’t wait to rush off to their next class or tolunch. Here are some suggestions to help make your questions count.Make sure your questions are pertinent. I have heard it said that there is nosuch thing as a stupid question. If you had attended class with me and heard aparticular student ask the sort of questions that even trivia books would thinkare trivial, you would agree that some questions are indeed stupid, or at leastinappropriate. Be sensitive and don’t waste your classmates’ valuable time. Ifyour question is trivial or goes off on a tangent, that’s okay; just ask theprofessor about it after class. Reserve in-class time for questions that pertaindirectly to the subject matter.If you’re getting lost, ask sooner rather than later. If you find yourselflosing the big picture in class, odds are that other students feel the same way.The sooner you ask the teacher to stop and direct you to it, the better. Theteacher will be glad to clarify questionable points up front rather than go backto them later.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[../images/moniter.jpg]TECH TIP FROM CHLOE AND ALIZÉIf you don’t get to ask all your questions in class and your teacher isn’tavailable after class, ask for their email address so you can email yourquestions. Most college professors and some high school teachers give studentstheir contact info so you can ask questions. You can also visit instructorsduring their office hours for additional assistance.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Be as specific as possible. If you ask a question in a vague or open-ended way,the professor might not address the piece that’s stumping you.Don’t hesitate to challenge your teacher in a respectful manner. If you don’tagree with a professor and want them to further defend their position on asubject, that’s okay. It’s one of the best ways for students and teachers tolearn from one another. If the teacher is truly knowledgeable on the subject,they won’t be threatened by you. Learning to debate in a mutually respecfulmanner is a good habit to acquire.Don’t hog class time with your questions. Give others a chance to ask questionsand join the dialogue. Also, when it is near the end of the class, considersaving the question until after class. Being polite is also an art!7. REVIEW THE CLASSAfter class is over, what then? For some students, the moment they walk out ofclass, they forget everything about that subject until the next time they stepinto the classroom. This is not the way to be a successful student. With alittle effort outside the classroom, you can ensure better performance onhomework, essays, and tests.Go to the professor and clarify any questionable areas in your notes. The soonerthese areas are clearly understood, the better.Recopy your notes as soon after class as possible. While redoing your notesmight seem time-consuming and unproductive, it can serve several importantfunctions. First, the simple act of copying your notes will reinforce thematerial in your mind and help you retain it better. It is a well-known factthat if you review the material within a short time after class, you willremember it longer than if you don’t see it again for two weeks. Second, itallows you to reorganize scattered or rushed notes and make them more orderlyand readable. Third, redoing your notes gives you the opportunity to fill in anygaps and answer any questions that you had about them during class time.Finally, a complete set of notes will serve you well when test time draws near,and even beyond that if you end up taking advanced courses in the same area. Ifyou do not buy in to this idea, at least go over your notes within 72 hours forre-exposure and to fill in the gaps.Make up questions on important information that you think will be on the test.Write these in your new set of notes. If you practice, you can become so good atanticipating what will be on exams that you will have answered a majority of thetest in your notes. See how good you are at getting on the professor’swavelength.Make a companion set of “big picture” fact sheets. These notes contain onlymajor points and can be useful for quick study immediately before an exam. Ifyou write these sheets as you go, they will be of tremendous value to you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR GRADES: CLASS SKILLS• Go to class to increase knowledge, clarify questions, interact with otherstudents, find a compatible study partner, and keep your attendance record inorder.• Prepare for class by getting adequate sleep, staying hydrated, staving offhunger, sitting close to the front, and realizing that what is said in class isusually on the exams.• Effective listening in class involves hearing, processing, acknowledging,reacting, and assimilating.• Lecture notes are usually your best review source for exams.• When note-taking, use abbreviations, write as clearly as possible, ask theprofessor to slow down if you’re having trouble keeping up, leave plenty of roomfor the main ideas in the margins, and compare your notes with another student.• When deciding how much to write, be cognizant of the effort that theteacher has expended to convey the information and watch for verbal andnonverbal cues.• When asking questions, keep to the point, ask questions as soon as theycome up, be specific, and be polite.• Recopy your notes to improve legibility, reorganize them, fill in the gaps,and re-expose yourself to the material.• Make up your own test questions, and create “big picture” fact sheets.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageContent":"9 [Contents.xhtml#rch9]PARIETAL RELATIONS [Contents.xhtml#rch9]MEMORIZE FASTER WITH BETTER RETENTION [Contents.xhtml#rch9]“Argyle met three fenderless valiants, while Lucy tripped on his lice.” Huh? Iknow this sounds like a great beginning to a science fiction novel where themain character, an argyle sock, meets three cars in a bad section of town aftertheir fenders have been ripped off. Meanwhile, the sock’s owner, a man namedLucy, is tripping over some very large lice. This kooky picture survives manyyears after my friend Alan Richardson, MD, coined it to help remember the 10essential amino acids (protein building blocks). Here’s what that strangesentence means:“Arg/ile (arginine, isoleucine) met (methionine) three (threonine) fenderless(phenylalanine) valiants (valine) while Lucy (leucine) tripped (tryptophan) onhis (histidine) lice (lysine).”This is one of the best examples of how to boost your memory by using a specificregion of your brain called the parietal lobe. Located near the back of yourhead, the parietal lobe is involved in sensory processing and directional sense.It also has very powerful associative properties that make this type of memorytechnique work. All Alan did was take things that he knew—argyle socks, fenders,lice, and so on—and associate them with new material that he wanted to remember.He stored the information in his brain as he learned it, and those associationsprovided a way for him to start looking for the material when he needed toretrieve it.The skill of being able to recall what you have learned is one that has infinitevalue to students. In this chapter, you’ll discover several techniques that willhelp you develop a better memory so you can learn information faster and retainit longer.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------HOW THE BRAIN MAKES MEMORIESMaking memories is a complex process that takes raw input from yoursenses—sight, hearing, smell, touch, and taste—and converts these experiencesinto memories. There are three primary steps involved in memory-making: 1. Encoding occurs when your brain pays attention to sensory input,whether unconsciously due to emotions tied to the experience (think of yourfirst kiss) or by consciously focusing on something (as in the case ofstudying). Research indicates that when we associate a purpose with experiencesand events, we tend to recall them more clearly and retain them longer. 2. Storage occurs when your brain makes it possible for you to retrievethe memories you have encoded. The hippocampi, located in the temporal lobes,act as gateways in the storage process. Contrary to what you may think, memoriesaren’t neatly collected into one central storage unit in the brain for easyretrieval. They are typically broken up into small chunks and tucked away inseveral areas of the brain. 3. Recall is when your brain retrieves an encoded, stored memory. To doso, your brain has to actively search out and gather all those little chunks andput them back together. It isn’t as simple as hitting “play” on a video on yoursmartphone. It’s more like one of those TV movies that depict a reenactment ofan event. This helps explain why different people’s memories of the same eventcan differ and how memories can evolve over time. Recalling memories stimulatesneural pathways, and actively working your memory strengthens it.Memory and the Seahorse TwinsIf you had a million-dollar racehorse, would you feed it junk food? Would yougive it beer or put drugs in its food? Of course not! As an intelligent person,you would never treat such a valuable horse that way. Did you know there is aneven more valuable horse-shaped structure in your brain? Actually, you have twoof them, but if you’re like most people, you probably aren’t aware of them ortheir importance. No bigger than your thumbs, they reside within your temporallobes, which is part of your emotional brain. We call them the hippocampi, whichis Greek for “seahorse,” because their shape resembles the cute marine creature.These two structures play a vital role in your memory. They help you rememberwhere you left your history book, the names of the all the important brainregions for your anatomy class, and what you studied last night for today’squiz. You can help keep your hippocampus healthy by optimizing the BRIGHT MINDSfactors featured in chapter 5 [Chapter05.xhtml#ch5].--------------------------------------------------------------------------------MEET THE THREE TYPES OF MEMORYTo begin, let’s take a brief look at the three types of memory: immediate,short-term, and long-term.Immediate Memory. Your immediate memory enables you to remember information forless than a second, just long enough to apply it or respond to it. It allows youto process only one thing at a time. Most of these memories are lost since theyare not encoded. Here are a few examples of how you use immediate memory in yourschoolwork. • When you’re rewriting a paper, you use your immediate memory everytime you transcribe a few words. • When you’re reading a textbook, you continually use your immediatememory to give yourself the chance to process what is printed. • When you’re listening to a lecture, you use your immediate memory totake notes.The best way to improve your immediate memory capability is to pay attention towhat you’re doing, reading, or listening to. Your immediate memory initiallyintakes material; you then decide whether to discard the material or to put itinto your short-term memory bank.Short-Term Memory. Your PFC governs short-term memory, allowing you totemporarily store several pieces of information for a short time (a minute orless). The loss of this type of memory is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer’sdisease or other forms of dementia. In diagnosing this syndrome, I typically askthe patient to remember three things—for example, a ’66 Chevy, a red ball, andLombard Street in San Francisco. Then I will ask the person to tell me the threethings several minutes later. The dementia patient, having an impairedshort-term memory, will usually not respond correctly.Short-term memory is enhanced by concentrating on the information to beretained, understanding the information in its context, and grouping similarpieces of information together. If you find that you’re losing the capacity toretain thoughts for a few minutes, try to concentrate on what you’re doing, andyou should find that your short-term memory will improve. Sometimes justreminding your brain to remember something will actually help you make thatconnection (ironic, right?).Short-term memory serves as a transition between immediate and long-term memory.After deciding to retain something, you remember it long enough in yourshort-term memory to work on its long-term retention.Long-Term Memory. Long-term memory involves the retention of material beyond afew minutes and could last for days, weeks, or even years. The number of itemsthat can be stored in your long-term memory is limitless. Long-term memories areprocessed in the hippocampus, then stored in a variety of brain regions—soundsin the temporal lobes, visual cues in the occipital lobes, sensory cues in theparietal lobes, and so on. Undoubtedly, you have subconsciously found many waysto organize and retrieve the information stored here. However, if yousystematically order the material you want to remember into associations thatyour parietal lobe can catalog for you, it will be easier to retrieve.These three types of memory operate interdependently. In order to depositinformation into your long-term memory bank, you must first make substantialdeposits into your immediate and short-term memory accounts.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------MEMORY IN THE BRAINType of MemoryLength of Time It LastsAssociated Brain RegionImmediateLess than 1 secondVisual-sensory cortex (parietal/occipital lobes)Short-termLess than 60 secondsPrefrontal cortexLong-termHours to yearsHippocampus, the brain’s “gateway” memory structure--------------------------------------------------------------------------------WHY MEMORY FAILSBefore outlining specific techniques for improving your long-term memory, let’sfirst explore four common reasons why memory fails.A lack of focus on the details. If you don’t pay attention to what is beingpresented, the material will not enter any memory system. It will be lost beforethere is any chance of assimilation. This is often the reason why we have a hardtime remembering names; we simply don’t focus on them. Stay away from anythingthat will divert your attention from your purpose. If you want to remembersomething important, make a point to stay laser-focused on the information—and Imean I want you to actually picture lasers coming from your brain as in StarWars. Now that’s hard to forget!A lack of understanding of what you are trying to memorize. If you don’tcomprehend the information you’re trying to store, you won’t know where to putit in your memory bank. Absentmindedly repeating phrases that you don’tunderstand is a poor way to study and an inefficient use of time.A lack of seeing the “big picture.” If you can’t place the details of thematerial to be retained into a larger context, then the information will bescattered throughout your brain like fallen leaves blown about in autumn. Getthe big picture first; it will help your understanding and memory.A lack of motivation. If you don’t see the point of memorizing something, you’llhave a hard time putting forth the effort to do it. If you need to convinceyourself of its importance, do it promptly. Your time is valuable. Perhaps youdislike a particular class and find it boring, but it’s required for your major.It’s crucial that you motivate yourself to study for it. Think of the result ofyour efforts, and you’ll realize that it’s a good cause.Turning these points around, here are the first four things you can do toimprove your memory: • Pay attention and focus on what is being presented. • Realize that understanding comes before retention. • Remember that it’s more effective to fit details into the “bigpicture” than haphazardly. • Convince yourself that it’s important to memorize the material.SIX TOOLS FOR BUILDING A BETTER MEMORYMany educators say that memory aids have no place in education, claiming that aslong as you understand something you’ll remember it. Wrong! Memory aids are veryvaluable in helping you retain concepts and their supporting facts. They cansave you time and increase your retention dramatically.I recommend six memory tools, or mnemonics, that can improve your ability tostore and retain material. They worked for me when I was in school, they’veworked for many of my patients, they work for Chloe and Alizé, and they can workfor you, too. All of these methods involve using associations betweeninformation already possessed and the information that needs to be stored. Thesetechniques will help you become an active learner, and any time you combineactivity with study, your chances of retention are greater.Memory Tool #1: How to remember dates and numbersThe first of these mnemonics is a very helpful tool that’s been around for overa century. Professor A. Loisette wrote about it in his book Assimilative Memoryor How to Attend and Never Forget, which was published back in 1896. Thistechnique provides a simple code for translating numbers into certain letters.This makes it easy to remember any series of numbers by just making up words orsentences using the letters that correspond with the numbers. Here’s one exampleof this system:NumberConsonant(s)Rationale1t, dt has one downstroke, d looks like a 0 + 1 = 12Nn has two downstrokes3Mm has three downstrokes4Rr is the fourth letter of “four”5Lcapital L is the Roman numeral for 506g, Jg looks like an upside-down down 6, and capital J looks like a backward 67soft csoft c starts with the same sound as 78Fboth 8 and cursive f have 2 loops9p, bbackward p or upside-down b looks like 90z, sz is the first letter of “zero”; s looks like a backward zIn this system, all other consonants and vowels have no number value. You canmaster this code in 10 minutes or less, and it will be one of the mostprofitable 600 seconds of your life! Once you’ve got it, you can then translateany number into a word or sequence of words that can be easily associated inyour brain. Here are a couple examples:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[../images/moniter.jpg]TECH TIP FROM CHLOE AND ALIZÉIf you have trouble remembering important dates, you can easily enter holidays,birthdays, and appointments in your smartphone calendar and set reminders toalert you when those days arrive.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- • If you need to remember that gold melts at 1,943 degrees Fahrenheit,recall “This bullion really melts.” The first letter of each word is t = 1, b =9, r = 4, m = 3. (Note: A gold bar is also called a gold bullion.) • If you need to remember that the coldest temperature ever recordedin Antarctica is –89 degrees Celsius, recall the first letters of “freezingbutt”: f = 8, b = 9.You can use your keys as the first letter of each word in a phrase, or as all ofthe keyed letters in a single word. Use this technique to remember dates, times,or other numbers.Memory Tool #2: Rhyme to rememberRhymes are a very popular tool for recalling rules or organization. For example,think of these common rhymes you may have learned as a child: • I before E except after C. • Spring ahead, fall back. • In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue.Rhymes help connect items that may otherwise seem completely unrelated into ametrical pattern. They are very good at establishing definite orders, becauseany mistake in the order of recall will destroy the rhyme.There’s another way you can use rhyme to aid in retaining a sequence of facts.First memorize these simple rhymes: • 1 is a bun • 2 is a shoe • 3 is a tree • 4 is a door • 5 is a hive • 6 are sticks • 7 is heaven • 8 is a gate • 9 is a line • 10 is a henNow you can choose up to 10 facts you need to remember in a precise order andmentally picture an association between each of them and their correspondingnumber’s object. In less than a few minutes you can easily memorize their order.Try this method with unrelated facts to observe its usefulness to you. Forexample, let’s say you have to remember the six wives of England’s King HenryVIII in order from first to last. Here’s how you could do it: 1. Catherine of Aragon: She ate a bun and now it’s gone. (last part ofAragon) 2. Anne Boleyn: She wore bowlin’ shoes. (sounds like Boleyn) 3. Jane Seymour: She climbed a tree so she could see more. (see more =Seymour) 4. Anne of Cleves: She leaves through the door. (leaves sounds like“Cleves”) 5. Catherine Howard: Her last name starts with the same letter ashive. 6. Catherine Paar: She shot par with her golf sticks (aka clubs). (parsounds like “Paar”)Memory Tool #3: Use places to remember specific thingsThe Greek poet Simonides was said to have left a banquet just before the roofcollapsed, killing all those inside. Many of the bodies were unrecognizable, butSimonides was able to identify them by remembering their place at the table.The practical use of the “loci method” involves placing an associative object ina certain location. Then by going back in your mind to the location, the objector fact should come back to you. For example, in memorizing a speech that isorganized and outlined, choose the ideas or the major subdivisions and associatethem in some way with the different rooms in your home. As you’re delivering thespeech, imagine yourself walking from room to room discovering the associationsyou have made in the proper order. Here’s an example for a speech on the fivemajor regions of the brain:Brain RegionRoomAssociationPrefrontal cortexFront doorStart at the front door for the prefrontal cortex.Temporal lobeLiving roomThe temporal lobe is involved in auditory processing, and you listen to music inyour living room.Parietal lobeKitchenThe parietal lobe is involved in sensory processing, like the tastes and smellsof cooking in the kitchen.Occipital lobeFamily roomThe occipital lobe is involved in visual processing, like when you watch TV inthe family room.CerebellumBackyardThe cerebellum is involved in motor coordination, like when you play catch inthe backyard.If you practice this technique, your associative powers will become limited onlyby the number of locations you can imagine.Memory Tool #4: Use acronyms or initialismsUsing acronyms (words like NASA that are formed from the initial letters ofwords) can be very helpful. Similarly, initialisms use the first letters ofwords, but they do not form a pronounceable word (like that wacky sentence atthe beginning of this chapter). When I have a series of facts to memorize, thefirst thing I do is examine their first letters to see if I can arrange theminto an associative word or phrase. In general, the more colorful, the greaterthe chance it will be easily remembered. Here is an example of this method:“On old Olympus’s towering top, a Finn and German viewed a hop.” Each firstletter corresponds to the first letter of the 12 cranial nerves in their properorder: olfactory, optic, oculomotor, trochlear, trigeminal, abducens, facial,acoustic, glossopharyngeal, vagus, accessory, and hypoglossal.Time for a pop quiz! Can you remember the example of an initialism I used at thebeginning of this chapter? If not, feel free to go back to that page to reviewits superb qualities.In my academic and professional career, I have compiled well over 1,000 of thesesentences. Even though I don’t recall all of them, I remembered them when examday arrived or for as long as I needed them. Practice this method. Your memorywill thank you!Memory Tool #5: Create pictures to boost your memoryDid you know that about 30 percent of the brain’s neurons are devoted to visualprocessing, while only 8 percent are dedicated to touch and a paltry 3 percentto hearing? Because the mind thinks in images, it can be very helpful to createpictures to remember information. Constructing big pictures with central figuresand supporting details also fits the theme of this book. It is important to keepthree things in mind when forming these images: • Include action, since your brain thinks in movies rather than instill photographs. The more action there is, the more details you can employ ina scene. • Make the picture as weird and offbeat as possible. It will be easierto remember the details as you recall the strange or unique things in thepicture. • Associate the overall theme of the scene with something that willallow you to remember why it is related to the concepts or details found in it.See the below example.One of the best mnemonic images I ever created was for the infective organismchlamydia, which is responsible for causing at least five ailments:elephantiasis (severe swelling of the leg), lymphogranuloma venereum (a venerealdisease), pneumonia, anal abnormalities, and a disease termed “parrot fever.” Inthe image I created, the scene’s locale is the bottom of the ocean where a largeclam (chlamydia) is sitting. On top of the clam stands an elephant(elephantiasis) with Elvie (pronounced LV for lymphogranuloma venereum), anacquaintance of mine, sitting on her back, coughing (pneumonia). Now Elvie had areputation for excessive hip movement, and that is how the association with analabnormalities is made. Finally, perched on her shoulder is a talkative parrot(parrot fever) who is ready to tell Elvie about any new discoveries thatmedicine makes with chlamydia, leaving room to expand the information in thepicture when it becomes necessary. I have retained the details of this image forseveral years and have found this technique a significant aid to my memory.Memory Tool #6: Make connectionsThe last mnemonic method involves finding sets of connections for informationthat needs to be stored. This can be in the form of combining any of theprevious five techniques or by employing number and letter sets. All that isinvolved in these sets is the recall of the number of items in a group: “Thereare nine circles of hell in Dante’s Inferno, and I have only six; I must thinkof three more.” This technique works even better with long lists broken intolettered groups. For example, let’s say your science teacher wants you tomemorize the 10 basic types of clouds:Low-Level Clouds • Cumulus • Cumulonimbus • Stratocumulus • StratusMid-Level Clouds • Altocumulus • Altostratus • NimbostratusHigh-Level Clouds • Cirrus • Cirrocumulus • CirrostratusIt can seem like a random list to recall, but if you remember that five of themstart with C, two of them start with A, two of them start with S, and one ofthem starts with N, it will be easier to recall all of them. This is a simpletool, and if you can find these similarities, your work will be easier. If youhave too many sets to remember, this method can be confusing, but combining thismethod with others will help alleviate that problem.It is helpful to begin forming these mnemonics at the first exposure to thematerial, as this allows time to find associations. It might not always be easyto find associations initially, but usually you can find one or more of the sixcategories into which you can place the material. Be versatile and use anymethod that works for you.The power of mnemonics is in their ability to reduce long, unrelated strings ofinformation into short, related lists. Practice the techniques! If you investtime in training your memory, the work will save you from boring repetition. Ifyou’re not having a particularly creative time, however, then repeat theinformation until you know it. At least with repetition you are being activewith the material, and activity is a prerequisite to learning.This chapter can be summarized with four rules for efficient memorization: • Pay attention to what you’re learning. • Process the material internally, ensuring that it fits together in alogical sequence and that you understand its whole. • Establish a relationship between the material you want to learn andmaterial you already possess—association is key. • Realize that any mental activity performed on material, such asforming pictures, rhymes, or acronyms, increases the depth of processing andautomatically helps you form connections that improve retrievability.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR GRADES: PARIETAL RELATIONS• Association is the key to memory.• Immediate memory initially intakes material and is enhanced by focusingattention on the material to be remembered.• Short-term memory is the temporary storage place for information and isenhanced by concentration, grouping, and understanding.• Long-term memory is just that—long-term storage of material—and isinitially dependent on immediate and short-term memory.• Memory usually fails because of an initial lack of focus, understanding,context, or motivation.• Mnemonics will improve your recall. Learn how to use them to youradvantage.• Repetition is useful if your associative powers dim.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageContent":"10 [Contents.xhtml#rch10]TWO HEADS ARE BETTER THAN NONE [Contents.xhtml#rch10]STUDYING WITH A PARTNER [Contents.xhtml#rch10]You’ve heard the proverb “Two heads are better than one.” Well, I say that twoheads are better than none. Often there is “no head” at work trying to learn,assimilate, or memorize information because you’re lost, bogged down, or boredby what you’re doing. With two heads working together, you can eliminate most ofthese problems and make far greater progress. In this chapter, you’ll learn thereasons for studying with another person, the best ways to choose a study buddy,and the most effective methods for group study—including why you should keepyour group to only two or three people at most.Why Study with Someone Else?Studying with a partner can be valuable for many reasons, such as increasingyour understanding of the material, getting better grades, and establishingstrong and lasting friendships (not necessarily in that order). Studying withanother person also helps break the monotony of rigorous, solitary study. Simplyput, it’s usually more fun to have someone “suffer” with you, and anything thatis fun usually results in increased time spent on that activity.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------GETTING SOCIAL: ONE OF THE 4 CIRCLES OF A HEALTHY BRAIN AND LIFEWhen I was in medical school, the dean, Dr. Sid Garrett, gave a lecture on howto help people of any age for any problem. What he said has stuck with me eversince. Dr. Garrett told us, “Always think of people as whole beings, never justas their symptoms.” In his view, when treating someone, we should always takeinto consideration the four circles of health and illness: • Biological: how your physical body functions (body and BRIGHT MINDSfactors) • Psychological: developmental issues and how you think (mind) • Social: social support and your current life situation (connections) • Spiritual: your sense of meaning and purpose (spirit)At Amen Clinics, we use these four circles to take a balanced, comprehensiveapproach to optimizing brain health. Having a good study partner plays into thesocial circle and can help you deal with school stresses as well as other lifechallenges. Having this type of social support can bolster your brain in manyways.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Studying together helps clarify weak areas. By sharing your notes, each of youwill be able to pick up points you missed, fill in the gaps in your notes, andcome to a better understanding of what material was emphasized in class. It’seasier to look up questions when two people benefit from the information and canshare the information-finding chore. If you can’t make sense of the materialtogether, you’ll need the help of your instructor.Having a lively, humorous, or just plain compatible partner makes it so mucheasier to press on when you want to shove off. Keeping each other motivated is amajor benefit. Besides, having someone to talk to and bounce ideas off of willkeep you awake through those long study sessions.The last reason for studying with a partner is that you can see how your partnerstudies, which gives you an opportunity to incorporate new and different methodsinto your study arsenal. Ultimately, it can improve your overall study skills.In my experience with study partners, I benefited the most when:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[../images/moniter.jpg]TECH TIP FROM CHLOE AND ALIZÉOne of the best things about group study is you can divvy up the research. Thismeans you only have to spend half as much time scouring the internet while stillgetting 100 percent of the information you need.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- • They told me what they perceived to be the main thoughts on thesubject matter. • They told me what they thought the test questions would be. • I compared their thoughts to my own. I was likely to miss severalimportant points (as was my partner), but by comparing our knowledge andinsights, we were both able to have a more complete overall picture. • I heard information repeated and answered questions aloud before theexam. Seeing and hearing information improves retention tremendously!CHOOSING YOUR STUDY PARTNERNow that you know that studying with another person is beneficial, how do you goabout finding a good partner? Choose carefully, because the right partner canhelp you reap tremendous benefits, while the wrong partner can really screw upyour progress and your grades! Here’s what to look for in a good study buddy.Look for equality and compatibility. Finding a study partner is sort of likechoosing a mate. You’re going to be spending a lot of time together, so it’simportant that your time is enjoyable and productive. Make sure the personyou’re considering shares some of the same study habits or similar ones. If youprefer to study at 6 o’clock in the morning so you can head to the gym beforeclass and they prefer to study at midnight on the way home from a party, it’sprobably not going to work. You need to find someone of equal intelligence,speed of comprehension, and style of organization. Otherwise, the person withgood study skills ends up acting as a tutor, which is not the intent of thismethod. (You’ll learn more about the value of tutoring later.)Try a few partners. Spend the first part of the semester studying with a fewdifferent people until you find someone who is in your league in terms ofintellect, skillset, and motivation. Don’t dive headfirst into a studyrelationship; it takes time to find the right person, so check out your options.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[../images/moniter.jpg]TECH TIP FROM CHLOE AND ALIZÉThink of choosing a study partner like those dating apps that let you swiperight or swipe left to accept or reject a person. Go on lots of “study dates” atthe beginning of the semester until you find a study partner who’s a good matchfor you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Find someone with the same major or interest in the same field. Make sure thatyou find someone with whom you enjoy working, especially someone in your majorfield of study. Then you’ll have more than one course to study together.Reliability counts. It is very important to make sure that your partner isreliable and diligent in your work together. If they are chronically illprepared for your sessions, or have not appeared for the third consecutive studysession, it’s time to find another partner.Two is the magic number. Keep your study group to two people and definitely nomore than three at the most. Larger groups are for parties and prayer meetings,but not for studying. You’ll quickly discover that even with three peopletogether, you’ll have trouble pacing yourself and staying on track.Don’t choose someone simply because you’d like to date them. Yes, I said tothink of the search for a study partner like looking for a mate, but datingisn’t the real goal. If you find yourself attracted to your study partner, yourbrain will release chemicals and hormones that will distract you from yourstudies and make it harder for you to learn the material. Choose someone youlike, but not someone you’ll fall in love with.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[../images/moniter.jpg]TECH TIP FROM CHLOE AND ALIZÉIf you’ve chosen a good study partner and you enjoy working together but yourschedules don’t match up all the time, use FaceTime, Skype, Google Hangouts, orany other online video conferencing apps and sites. A study session on thecomputer is better than none!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------METHODS FOR STUDYING WITH A PARTNERTo get the most out of studying with a partner, follow these guidelines.Be prepared. Each partner should have a set of rewritten notes and should readthem once before getting together. When reading your notes and assigned readingmaterial beforehand, observe any areas that you’re missing, any concepts youdon’t understand, and any ideas you think are especially important. Come to thestudy session prepared to give, instruct, and clarify these points with yourpartner. You will leave reinforced and informed.Teach each other. If you can teach something, you know it. If each of you comesto the study session as if you were going to teach it, you will both come awaywith a solid understanding.Set time limits for your sessions. You probably have other subjects to tackle,so set a start and an end time for your sessions. Take adequate breaks duringyour sessions to keep yourself fresh, but remember your purpose and minimize thelengthy chats. In general, it’s a good rule to take a 10-minute break after 50minutes of study. The achievement of good grades and learning requires 50minutes per hour.Take turns. Once you and your partner have discussed what you want to accomplishin your session and have a good set of notes and questions in front of you,simply take turns reading aloud, reviewing, or questioning each other on thematerial in a systematic way. Be sure to leave time for discussion of themisunderstood points. If areas of question arise, try to answer them quickly. Ifthe answer is not readily available, jot it down to ask the professor and moveon. Get through the material once quickly and decide what needs more work. Whengoing through the subject matter, alternate with your partner and be sure you’vegone through all the material at least twice. In the first round, you expound onthe material and ask the questions. In the second round, you listen and answerquestions.Create your own test questions. Devise questions as you go along, trying toanticipate what questions will be on the exam. This is a good study method whenstudying alone and is enhanced with two heads. You can also write down yourunanswered questions as you go along and have a “scavenger hunt” later to seewho can find the answer first. Also, when studying together, try to createparietal pictures. As you recall from chapter 9 [Chapter09.xhtml], parietalpictures are kooky, exaggerated mental pictures to aid your memory. Your jointeffort will enhance their quality.Minimize distractions. All of the other rules and ideas for good studytechniques, such as minimizing distractions, apply when studying together. Sodon’t study in front of the television or in a room with loud music.Recap and review. After you’ve covered the material, clarified points, and notedquestions for the professor, be sure to restate the main points and review them.Have one person make a list (make sure you have two copies) with the majorpoints and facts that you can use for a quick review.It’s okay to get personal. At the beginning of this chapter, I mentioned thatone of the advantages of studying with a partner was the establishment of strongand lasting friendships. I remember the many hours I spent studying with somereally amazing people. The fellowship and empathy we shared made those timessome of my most precious memories. Keep in mind that we are relational beings,and if we can enhance our study skills and establish positive, reinforcingrelationships at the same time, we indeed have a powerful tool.Move on if it isn’t working. If the sound of the other person’s voice drives youup the wall, you hate the way they fidget in their chair, or you get annoyed byeverything they do, then your study skills will diminish. If your sessionsaren’t as productive as you’d like them to be and you don’t see a way to worktogether to improve them, it’s time to call it quits and find a new studypartner.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR GRADES: TWO HEADS ARE BETTER THAN NONE• Reasons for studying with another person include increasing yourunderstanding, clarifying information, comparing notes and impressions on theimportant points, and seeing how your partner studies.• Equality and compatibility are the two main criteria in choosing a partner.• Ideally, study with only one other person at a time, and never more thantwo.• When studying together, be prepared for your session, set time limits andstick to them, create test questions, make a recap list, and examine materialquickly at first and in detail later.• The establishment of strong and lasting relationships is an important andbeneficial byproduct of studying with a partner.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageContent":"11 [Contents.xhtml#rch11]GO TO THE SOURCE [Contents.xhtml#rch11]A PRACTICAL APPROACH TO TEACHERS [Contents.xhtml#rch11]During my 21 years as a student, I had many outstanding instructors. Forexample, my pathology professor epitomized the essence of inspired teaching. Hetaught in an organized, concise, interesting, and humorous fashion that made hisclass presentations pertinent and practical.This special professor made learning a tough subject enjoyable. He alsoencouraged close relationships between his students and himself. I rememberpiling into his car with three other classmates to go to a funeral home inHenryetta, Oklahoma, to perform our first autopsy. He was the masterpathologist, and by cultivating a close relationship with him, we learned morethan the “dead facts.” We began to understand the workings of a superbpathologist’s mind in solving medical problems. This concept has tremendousvalue. You can get the facts from any good textbook, but you can only see how itis done firsthand by observation. Cultivating solid relationships with yourinstructors is basic to learning more than the bare facts.As you’ve seen in this book, your teachers can be a tremendous resource to you.This topic is so important that I have devoted a full chapter to it so you canlearn how to take full advantage of the student-teacher relationship. Thischapter is divided into three sections: • Part 1 deals with the value you can derive from your instructorbefore the class actually begins. • Part 2 discusses the aspects of a productive student-teacherrelationship during the course. • Part 3 deals with the interaction you might want to have with theinstructor after the class is completed.PART 1: ENGAGE YOUR TEACHER BEFORE THE COURSE BEGINSApproaching the professor before a class begins can be valuable for a number ofreasons, including the following.1. It helps you establish rapport with the professor, thereby making you morethan just a face without a name in class. This is the first step in establishinga relationship with the professor. This practice has value even if there aremore than 100 students in a class because after you have approached aninstructor once, you will feel more comfortable approaching them again. Ifyou’re hesitant or fearful to approach your teacher, remember that they arethere to help you become the best doctor, lawyer, communications specialist,entrepreneur, bioengineer, computer scientist, child psychologist, creativewriter, or whatever it is you want to be in life. Getting acquainted with yourteachers is the first step toward building a valuable relationship with them.2. You may have a lot of questions about a course, such as: What is this classall about? Do I have the adequate prerequisites? How much study time does theprofessor think will be needed for this course? What sources other than thetextbook are helpful? It can be helpful to have these questions answered beforethe class begins so you can be better prepared for the class.3. The beginning of the course is also a good time to ask the teacher forsuggestions on how to approach the subject. As experts in the subject, theyshould be able to direct you to the best ways for you to assimilate the materialthey’re presenting. After all, one of the definitions of the word teach inMerriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary is “to guide the studies of.” So letteachers do their job by letting them show you how to study their subject.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------KNOW YOUR TEACHER’S BRAIN TYPEIn addition to knowing your own brain type, it is a good idea to know the braintype of the important people in your life, and that includes your teachers.Understanding their brain type gives you better insight into how to approachthem for help. Based on our brain imaging work at Amen Clinics, we haveidentified 5 primary brain types: • Brain Type 1: Balanced—Teachers who have a balanced brain tend to beflexible and easy to approach. • Brain Type 2: Spontaneous—Teachers with a spontaneous brain are morelikely to be fun-loving and to appreciate creativity. Stretch yourself in theseclasses and try thinking “outside the box” on your assignments to appeal to thistype. • Brain Type 3: Persistent—Teachers who have this brain type aretypically “my way or the highway” kind of people. Don’t attempt to argue withthem and be sure to stick within their guidelines to do best in their classes. • Brain Type 4: Sensitive—Teachers who have a sensitive brain tend tolook at the negative side of things. Cheering them up with a positive spin on asubject can help. • Brain Type 5: Cautious—Teachers with this brain type are more likelyto be anxious. For better results and interactions with this type, don’t fueltheir anxiety.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------4. For college students, approaching the instructor before a class begins givesyou the advantage of dropping the class early if you find that you aren’tadequately prepared for it, if it isn’t what you expected, or for any otherreason. This may sound like a negative suggestion, but dropping a class early ismuch smarter than dropping it three weeks into the semester. At that late date,it can be very hard to replace it with another class, and even if you do, you’llbe three weeks behind in that class when you start it. As soon as possible, youshould establish if the class you’re taking is what you expected and what youcan handle.PART 2: MASTERING THE STUDENT-TEACHER RELATIONSHIPS DURING THE COURSEDeveloping a productive student-teacher relationship during a course involvesfive major areas: approaching, questioning, notes, tests, and ways of enhancingthe relationship.1. Learn how to approach your instructors. Remember that you have a right toexpect certain things from your instructors. It is reasonable to expectorganized and interesting lectures that have some practical value. It is fair toassume that the instructor’s job involves helping you master the techniques oflearning the subject. It is reasonable to expect to be treated fairly and withdignity during lectures and laboratory sessions as well as in grading.When approaching the instructor, be humble and open to suggestions. Actingarrogant or giving the impression that you already know everything iscounterproductive. Most teachers enter the field because they feel that theyhave something of value to give to students. If you approach them thinking theyare there to support your preconceived ideas or just to give you a good grade,then you will invariably have trouble with them. However, if your attitude isone of respect for the teacher as well as enthusiasm for the subject at hand,you can gain from a productive relationship.If you’re having misunderstandings or problems with a professor, approach themwith a group of students to discuss the grievances. On the first day of medicalschool I was randomly chosen by my anatomy professor to chair a studentgrievance committee. He felt students needed a collective voice to deal with anyclass problems. As it evolved, the committee served three main purposes. • It was valuable in giving positive and negative (but constructive)feedback to the teachers regarding their lectures, including whether or notclass material was being understood by the students. • The committee functioned after exams to question the validity ofcertain questions and their answers. This was very productive, because thecommittee was able to have answers revised or questions deleted, thus raisingthe curve of the test by more than 10 points on several occasions. • We sat with different course directors and discussed the overalleffectiveness of the class. This committee was very productive and operatedsymbiotically between teachers and students.If you have questions, put forth some effort to understand the concept beforeusing your instructor as a sounding board. In my committee, if we had questions,we tried to research the answer first. If we still did not understand, then wewent ahead and asked. Conversely, if you expect the teacher to take you throughthe concept step by step without doing any research, you are likely to be viewedunfavorably.2. Asking questions and dialoguing are integral parts of the learning process,and these skills need to be cultivated continually. Your approach to theprofessor, as mentioned above, is of the utmost importance in this regard. Also,doing your part in researching material that is not well understood is crucialto having any meaningful dialogue on the questions you might have throughout thecourse.During a course, the first question to ask is, “Why am I taking this course, andhow will it enhance my educational goals?” Since the professor has probably hadmany years of training on the subject, they should be able to give you theanswer. Also, if you did not talk to the professor before the class began, thisis a good time to ask questions about how to approach the subject matter. Inaddition, if you need a certain grade in a class, this is the appropriate timeto ask the instructor how to get it. The more information you have, the betterchance you will have to obtain your goal.The more you approach a teacher with well thought out and researched questions,the more they will be able to help you assimilate the material in a course. Usethe time before and after class, as well as the teacher’s office hours. Studentswho say they can never talk to the professor usually are not trying hard enough.Remember, teachers are the best source of help to you in learning the subjectmatter, so go to them with your questions.If you have the backup of a student grievance committee, that’s great; if not,you should still approach the professor with questions or feedback that youmight have. By all means, if you have a question on a test you have taken,challenge (after researching) the answer that the professor keyed as the rightone.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[../images/moniter.jpg]TECH TIP FROM CHLOE AND ALIZÉBe sure to get your professor’s email address so you can send them questions orconcerns. Don’t overuse it though! Wait until you have all your questions andsend a single email rather than filling their inbox with question afterquestion.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------3. As suggested earlier, try to get a copy of the teacher’s lecture notes beforethe lecture. This will give you valuable information on what is important andhelp keep writer’s cramps at bay during the lecture. Also, it will give you theassurance of having complete notes and will be helpful in guiding you toorganize your notes. Do not neglect this valuable source of information. Even ifthe teacher will not let you copy their notes, you still will gain from theinteraction by demonstrating to the instructor your interest and desire to dowell in the class.4. As far as tests are concerned, it is wise to have as much information on themas possible before the exam. Most teachers will gladly tell you what they expectfrom you on a test and will give you many helpful clues on how to prepare forthe exam. So try to obtain as much information on the content of the exams asthe instructor will give you.5. Remember that teachers are people too. Another worthwhile goal to have duringthe semester is that of enhancing your relationships with your faculty. We areall relational beings and need to interact on a human level. Spend time gettingto know your professors, their backgrounds, and their professional and personalgoals. We learn from their lives as well as from the lecture material. This isespecially true if the teacher is in a discipline you might enter. You can learnso much more from your professors, and your relationships with them will becherished long after you have forgotten 80 percent of the details they gave youin class!Also, this relationship will be valuable to you in the future if you needletters of recommendation from your teachers. This certainly is not the mostimportant reason for establishing lasting relationships with your instructors,but you will probably need these letters in the future, and it is verybeneficial to get them from a teacher who knows you.PART 3: YOUR EFFORT SHOULDN’T END WHEN THE CLASS ENDSWhen the class is nearing its end or has finished, you have three majorresponsibilities.1. You have the responsibility of evaluating the class honestly for futurestudents. This gives the teacher valuable feedback on their performance. It hasbeen my experience that teachers are genuinely interested in students’suggestions for improvement. Students are generally too kind in theirevaluations, not wanting to hurt the instructor’s feelings or not wanting tojeopardize their grade or recommendation. It does no good, and it is evenharmful, to rate a class better than it was. If your honesty will affect yourgrade or recommendation, then turn it in anonymously, or wait until after thegrades are posted to return it. This is your way of grading the professor; seehow it feels!2. You have the responsibility of obtaining letters of recommendation foryourself for future use. These are best written right after you have taken acourse. The professor knows you and your work and will be able to write a morepersonal letter for you. The first step in obtaining this letter is to ask theprofessors of your choice (the more the better) if they would write you apositive letter of recommendation. If someone hedges, let them off the hook—youdon’t want noncommittal letters. If they agree, then ask for a copy of theletter so you can read it and decide whether or not you’ll be able to use it. Ifyou use this method, your letters of recommendation will have more meaning, andthus be superior to letters written two years after your last contact with theprofessor. Also, if you’re asking for a letter of recommendation for a collegeor grad school application, be sure to ask for it well in advance of theapplication deadline. Giving a teacher ample time to craft the letter willusually result in a stronger recommendation.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[../images/moniter.jpg]TECH TIP FROM CHLOE AND ALIZÉIf you want to rate your professor or get a preview of what a professor or classis like, visit www.ratemyprofessors.com [http://www.ratemyprofessors.com].Submissions are anonymous.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------3. It is your responsibility to obtain the best possible grade in the class.Some people say that you shouldn’t be concerned with grades, or that they aren’ta true measure of your knowledge. College and graduate school admissions boards,however, are keenly aware of your grades, and they use them to compare you withthousands of other applicants. If you can get a better grade, it is certainlyworth a try. An extra effort is especially helpful if you are on the borderlinebetween an A and a B or a B and a C.Here are two strategies I have successfully used to obtain a higher grade inborderline situations: • Ask for a higher grade due to the competitiveness of your major orcareer goals. If it is possible and fair, most teachers want to see theirstudents become successful. So if they can in good conscience give you thehigher grade, they will. • Try gently pointing out the injustice of giving someone with an 89.9percent average a B while at the same time giving an A to someone with a 90.1percent average. In my case, it worked, but obviously, this does not alwayswork, as illustrated in a Peanuts cartoon I once read. In it, Peppermint Pattywonders out loud to her teacher how the letter D by itself is a wonderful,important, and dignified letter. “When a minus is put behind it,” she argues,“it loses its dignity, appears drained, and has lost its power and strength.”Her teacher would not change her grade but promised if she was ever on trial forher life, she would want Peppermint Patty for her lawyer.If you never try to raise your grade or seem concerned about it, then theprofessor will assume that grades are not important to you, and they will notfeel bad about giving you the lower grade. If, however, you make your desiresknown to your teachers, they will at least give your request some thought.Starting from the very first day of class, it is your job to establish with yourteacher the kind of student you are and your goals. And most importantly, youneed to follow through! This practice can make a significant difference in yourgrade point average. If you never try to talk a police officer out of a speedingticket, then you will always simply take what they give you. But if you try totalk your way out of a ticket, you might have a 20 percent chance of succeeding.Over a lifetime, that is significant; the same is true of your GPA.I opened this chapter by writing about a superb pathology professor; I willclose by telling you about another professor I had. This instructor was similarto the first one in that his lectures were organized, practical, andinteresting. He also encouraged close relationships with his students and servedas a role model and mentor to many of us. He was secure enough to share with ussome of his shortcomings and how he learned from the mistakes he had made in hiscareer. He hoped to help us avoid some of the pain that accompanies mistakes. Healso taught us that there is more to us than our studies—that to be happy andfulfilled, we need to cultivate other areas of our lives that have value, suchas our family and social relationships, our physical well-being, and ourintellectual and cultural growth. He taught us from his knowledge and from hislife, and the gift of himself that he gave to us was more valuable than anyother source of information available!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR GRADES: GO TO THE SOURCE• There are many advantages to cultivating relationships with yourprofessors.• Approach your instructors before a course begins to establish a rapportwith them, have questions answered, learn how to approach the class, and dropthe class early if it is not suitable for you.• A student’s attitude toward teachers should include expecting qualitylectures, getting help from them, and being treated with dignity. Studentsshould approach teachers with a humble and teachable spirit, come to them with agroup when trouble arises, and ask questions after doing some preliminaryresearch.• During a course, the professor will be able to answer your questions, guideyour studies and note-taking, and provide necessary information for upcomingexams.• As a class is coming to an end, your responsibilities include evaluating ithonestly, obtaining letters of recommendation, and discussing your grade if youthink it should be higher.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageContent":"12 [Contents.xhtml#rch12]PRESSURIZE YOUR CABIN [Contents.xhtml#rch12]PREPARING FOR AND TAKING TESTS [Contents.xhtml#rch12]Pressure has long been known to have strange effects on people, especiallystudents. The pressure of exams is one of the most severe tests of a student’sability to cope under stress. Students have been known to buckle duringstrenuous times, doing things like staying awake three nights before an exam tocram 60 pages of math theorems and formulas that they have never seen before,eating coffee grounds to keep their eyelids open long enough to memorize thenumber of ribs on a female catfish, or popping “smart pills” to try to enhancetheir cognitive powers.There is no doubt that for most students, test time is an anxious period filledwith certain unavoidable pressures. The trick is to have the extra adrenalineand pressure work in your favor instead of driving you to act foolish. You caneither let the excess energy help motivate you to prepare adequately for yourupcoming task or let it feed your delusions that somehow God will send an angelto dictate the test answers to you.This chapter is about regulating pressure under the load of exams. It has beensaid on more than one occasion that I received a high mark on an exam because ofmy skill at taking exams, not because of my knowledge. I think some of thosecomments might have been derogatory, but I took them as a compliment. If a Bstudent operates at an A level on exams, that student will see more open doorsand have more choices for future goals.Unfortunately, the opposite fact is more often true. Students who know thematerial well often achieve a lower grade on an exam because of poor test-takingskills, not because their knowledge is lacking. Knowing the material well isonly part of being a good test-taker. There are established skills in testpreparation, test-taking, alleviation of test anxiety, and review of exams oncethey are graded.Much of this book has been geared to prepare you for exams, so you will findsome repetition in this chapter. However, as someone once said, “Repetition isthe mother of education.” I guess I did not repeat that person’s name enough . .. (Just kidding! It was John Paul Richter in l807.)A TIMELINE FOR PREPARING FOR EXAMSIt’s very important to understand that there is usually no correlation betweenthe amount of time studied and the grade on a test. Your study methods andtest-taking techniques will decide the outcome of the exam. This section onpreparing for exams is divided into four parts: • Several weeks before the exam • Several days before the exam • The day before the exam • The day of the examSeveral Weeks Before the Exam1. Set up a study schedule and stick to it. The first thing to do when startinga new class is to set up a study schedule that will allow you enough time tolearn the material adequately. The time to begin preparing for the first exam isat the beginning of the class. I tried to arrange my study schedule so I wouldbe ready to take the exam three days before it was actually given. This gave methe opportunity right before the exam to study with a partner and obtain theirinsights, ask the professor any last-minute questions I still had, and leave myoverall study schedule intact. This way, I wasn’t neglecting everything else inmy life. Even though I didn’t always achieve this goal, I aimed for it. Thisapproach keeps you from feeling that you have to pull an all-nighter rightbefore the test.2. Study in units that are organized and concise. This will give you anadvantage in your review because you’ll know how much material you have coveredand how much is left to tackle. Also engage in periodic overall reviews. Taketime once a week to briefly review all of the material that you have studied fora new section, and you’ll find that the review before the exam will go muchfaster, because the material will be fresh in your memory, and you will haveassimilated more of it.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[../images/moniter.jpg]TECH TIP FROM CHLOE AND ALIZÉInput your study schedule in your phone’s calendar and set reminders and alertsto help you stick to it.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------3. Make sure you have a complete set of lecture notes. For most classes, about75 percent of the test questions come directly from the lecture material. Recopyyour notes soon after class to complete them, improve their neatness, and giveyou more exposure to them. Your notes are usually your best guide to studyingfor an exam.4. Keep a separate sheet of the test questions that you have created on thestudied material. As you saw in chapter 8 [Chapter08.xhtml#ch8], devising yourown questions boosts active learning and helps you recognize important conceptsand facts. If you keep a record of these facts, they will be helpful during yourreview.5. Create a “big picture” fact sheet. On your fact sheet, list only the majorconcepts and their supporting facts, along with any formulas or key words thatyou would find useful in a very quick review. I used to write this sheet as Idid my initial studies, and it would never total more than three to four pagesin length. It was very useful for a one- to two-hour review, and it was idealfor study prior to the exam.6. At least one week before the exam, ask your professor the “Four Whats”: • What specific topics are going to be covered on the exam? • What material will be emphasized on the test? • What type of questions will be on the test? (This often will giveyou important clues on how to prepare for the exam.) • What clues can the professor give you for preparing for the test?Many teachers are willing to guide students in their review for exams. It is notonly impractical to try to study everything that you have been taught in thewhole semester before an exam, but you will likely remember absolutely nothingon test day. It is much more sensible to find out as much as possible about theexam from the teacher; after all, they are the exam’s source.Several Days Before the ExamThis is often the pressure cooker time for many students, but if you followthese simple principles, you’ll be able to harness the steam to help your brainwork more efficiently.1. Study effectively with a partner. As you have seen, this will help you havemotivation and stamina for review while giving you another perspective on theexam material. This time can also be used for clarifying questionable material,and you’ll have the opportunity to use someone else as a sounding board tomeasure your understanding of it.2. Attend the classes right before the exam. Many students think that this isthe time to skip class to get in a few extra hours of study. During the last fewclass sessions before an exam, however, the teacher usually gives importantinformation about the upcoming test. This time is also very useful in class,because if new material is presented, its proximity to the exam will help youretain it. Remember, your best source for exams is your lecture notes, so go toclass to the end and take notes.3. Have a good attitude and confident mindset when you study. This reducesstress and allows your brain to function at more optimal levels.4. Continue to revise and update your “big picture” fact sheet. During yourreview, if you get bogged down in the details, go to the “big picture” of whatyou’re studying. If you have a solid foundation for the main ideas, you canbuild with the facts. If you’re trying to nail facts onto a flimsy base, you’llcertainly discover your knowledge broken or splintered.5. Harness the cram monster and make it work for you! Many educators will tellyou that cramming before an exam reveals poor study habits. I disagree. Crammingis worthwhile and, if used correctly, can dramatically increase your test score.The trick is to use cramming for review, not first exposure. If you’re crammingmaterial that you have never seen before, you will find yourself in big trouble.Intensive study of material that has been partially assimilated, however, willincrease your short-term memory of it and thus help you on exams. Many studieshave shown that the major factor in retention for exams is recentness ofexposure to the material. So cram what you know; you’ll learn it better andremember it longer. Scan over your materials and if you happen to see a subjectthat requires additional review, study it more thoroughly, maybe make somesticky notes, and keep going!6. If, for whatever reason, you find yourself in the position of cramming coldmaterial just before an exam, here are a few hints to help you weather theinevitable storm: • Make sure that you know the lecture notes. • Read the chapter introductions, topic sentences, graphs, italicizedwords, and most importantly the chapter summaries. • If your professor allows this, try to get a copy of old exams to seewhat material was emphasized previously (which is a good idea even if you knowthe material). • Get a review book that gives you just the bare facts of the sectionand review from that.The Day Before the ExamUse this time for an overall quick review of the material, relying on your notesand “big picture” fact sheets.” Review these at least twice—once to learn whatareas still need polishing and a second time to be exposed to the material onelast time.Your study habits aren’t the only thing that will make a difference on exam day.Your lifestyle habits can also impact your performance. Eat a healthy diet (moreon this in chapter 15 [Chapter15.xhtml#ch15]) in the days and weeks before yourtest and be sure to get a full night’s sleep before an exam. Not only will youfeel more refreshed and energized the following morning, but memories are alsoconsolidated in the brain while you snooze.The Day of the ExamIt is a good idea to have something to eat before the exam, but don’t pig outbecause your energy will wallow in the mud as the blood flow shifts from yourbrain to your stomach. A small portion of lean protein and a healthy fat, likeavocado, is a good idea. Protein and fat take longer to burn off than carbs,which give you a quick boost of energy but will wear off fast. If the test isgoing to be an extended affair, bring a protein bar or some nuts into the examroom with you to increase your energy level, if necessary.Arrive a few minutes before the exam begins and bring extra paper and writingmaterials. You don’t want to be frazzled from the start and break your focus. Ifyou arrive too early, then you will just have more time to kill, allowing youranxiety level to rise. If you’re late, you’ll have missed the instructions,putting you at a disadvantage from the start, which will make your anxiety levelgo through the roof!Stay away from congregations of students right before the exam. Some “NervousNellie” will invariably bring up some picky detail you didn’t study, therebyincreasing your anxiety even though that factoid most likely won’t appear on thetest.When you go into the exam room, try to find a seat that is as far away fromdistractions as possible. Usually this means not sitting in the front row, neardoors or windows, or near a noisy test taker. I remember my first anatomy exam.I thought it would be a good idea to sit next to my best friend so that we couldgive each other emotional support. But, to my shock and distraction, he was theloudest test taker in the state of Oklahoma (a real “boomer Sooner”)! His pencilblazed loudly across the test, and he breathed as though he was nourishing hisbrain with oxygen, as an engineer would feed his locomotive with coal. We stayedbest of friends in medical school, but that was partially due to the fact that Ihad a choice of not sitting near him during exams.One of the most important things to remember before starting an exam is to trustyourself. Trust that you know the answers and trust your judgment for the onesyou don’t remember. Once you’re in your seat, there is no more last-minutestudying—all you have is your brain to fall back on. Take a deep breath andtrust yourself to get you through it.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE 6 DON’TS OF TEST PREP• Don’t skimp on sleep. If you don’t get enough sleep before a big test,you’re more likely to forget what you studied the night before.• Don’t rely on smart pills. Taking so-called smart pills in hopes of a boostin energy, alertness, and memory can lead to long-term brain issues. Researcherssay they can lead to difficulties multitasking, planning, and organizing.• Don’t take your little brother’s ADHD medication. According to a 2018study, ADHD drugs may fail to improve cognitive function in healthy students andmay in fact impair functioning.1 [Bibliography_5.xhtml#c12_rfn1]• Don’t guzzle Red Bull, coffee, soda, or other caffeine-laden drinks.Caffeine can give you an initial boost of energy and make you feel more alert,but when it wears off it can leave you feeling sluggish and give you brain fog.• Don’t pig out on junk food. Eating doughnuts, candy, or other junk foodsbefore a test can give you brain fog.• Don’t forget to hydrate. Even mild dehydration can dull your concentration,reduce alertness, and give you a headache.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------TAKING THE EXAMCongratulations! You’ve made it to test day. Now it’s time to get down tobusiness and ace this thing. Here are some general test-taking tips that you’llfind helpful, as well as recommendations for answering essay and objectivequestions.General Test-Taking TipsFirst, get an overview of the test to determine the number and types ofquestions. Then determine the approximate amount of time you have per questionand divide your time appropriately.Next, read the test instructions! I can’t stress enough how important this is.They may tell you that you have to answer only a certain percentage of thequestions on the test, or they may give you a choice of one of two essayquestions.Answer the questions you know first. This will ensure that you get credit forwhat you know if you run out of time. If you’re unsure about any questions, markthem and return to them later. Remember that another question later in the testmay give you valuable information for an earlier one.Answer questions as you think the teacher would have you answer them.Take questions at their face value. Sometimes you’ll read a question and willknow the answer right off the bat, but then you start to second-guess yourinstincts. And then you second-guess that, and the cycle continues until theteacher tells you to put pencils down. Trust your instinct.Most teachers create tests that are straightforward and are not trying to foolyou with hidden meanings or trick questions. If you have a question about someaspect of the test, ask the professor about it during the exam. If they don’twant to answer the question, they’ll tell you. Often, however, they will clearup confusing points for you.Finally, fight the tendency to finish quickly. There is no correlation betweenthose students who finish first and those who do the best on a test. Work untilyou are satisfied that you have answered all of the questions to the best ofyour ability. If you have time, reread the instructions to make sure youcompleted the test correctly.Tips for Answering Essay and Short-Answer QuestionsEssay questions are usually the hardest questions to answer because the teacherdoesn’t provide you with a choice of answers to jog your memory. If you keep thefollowing six principles in mind when answering these questions, however, youwill find them less troublesome:1. Read the question slowly, underlining key words and phrases as you do. Thiswill help you determine just what is being asked in the question and the type ofanswer the teacher wants. Pay attention to length restrictions.2. Organize your answer before you write it, using the words and organizationpresented in the question. Outline the different points that you need to make,incorporating introductory and summary statements. This will prevent the answerfrom reading like a list of facts.3. Start with general statements and support them with facts and examples, whichwill help the organization of your answer. Such a presentation will beappreciated by the professor, who will have spent much of their time wadingthrough swamps of unorganized essay answers.4. When you’re sure of the answer, be concise and write only what is requested.When you need to fudge an answer, write as much as you can on all of the topicsthat you feel relate to the question. Hopefully, the teacher will find somethingof value in your answer to warrant some points. Always write something! You willnot get any credit for questions left blank, but you may pick up a point or twofor “educated guesses.”5. Be conscious of time restrictions. It’s very easy when writing lengthyanswers to lose track of time, so keep your watch on your arm or desk or checkthe clock periodically to remind you to budget your time. Note that mostteachers won’t let you have your smartphone on your desk during a test, even ifyou say it’s just to check the time.6. If you have time, review your work to make sure you have adequately answeredthe questions and have checked your grammar and spelling.Tips for Answering Objective QuestionsWhen given a choice, I would rather take an objective test any day. This isbecause the answer is usually provided for you in the question, and all you needto do is to match the information given with what’s stored in the parietal lobesof your brain. Here are some strategies that can be helpful in answeringmultiple-choice, matching, and true-false questions. 1. Read the question slowly, then answer quickly. If you’re in doubt,answer with your first impression. This allows your subconscious mind to play arole in answering questions. 2. Beware of universal statements. They are almost always wrongbecause in academics there are very few universal truths. These statementscontain words like always, never, no, none, all, every, and most. 3. Use a notation system to keep track of your thinking during thetest. I use T (true), PT (partly true), F (false), and PF (partly false) toindicate my impression of a statement. This helps me separate the differentchoices and decreases the need for backtracking. This system is also veryhelpful for questions that contain “all of the above” or “none of the above”alternatives. When you’re not sure of an answer, consider only those you havemarked with a T or PT. This will increase your odds of getting the answer right. 4. When you’re unsure of an answer, try these strategies: • The most general alternative tends to be correct. • The longest option is often correct. • Repetition of the question in the answer often indicates theanswer is true. • If two opposite options are offered, choose one of them. • Choose true instead of false, because negative alternativesare harder to write. • If the answer is a number, the correct alternative is often amiddle value, so eliminate the highest and lowest options. • In blind guessing, choose the same option throughout, usuallyB or C. Remember, these are only tips, not hard-and-fast rules. Your knowledge isyour best guide. 5. Avoid looking for patterns of answers in true-false ormultiple-choice questions. There is usually not an even distribution in theanswer key. 6. Use the process of elimination for matching. Match those you knowfirst. Then select the rest from a reduced set of options. 7. When solving a problem, work out your answer before looking at thepossible options. This will eliminate bias in your work. Also, save toughproblems until last, unless they have a disproportionately high amount ofcredit.If you follow these strategies, you’ll find your test scores increasingsignificantly. Remember, there is a skill in learning, but there is also skillin communicating what you know on tests.OVERCOMING TEST ANXIETYThe best way to alleviate exam jitters is to be prepared. For most people, thelevel of anxiety before and during the exam correlates inversely with the amountof time spent and the efficiency of that time—the more time and efficiency, theless anxiety.I have treated several patients who had severe anxiety and they performed farbelow their level of competence as a result of it. I was taught a simplehypnotic technique to counteract test anxiety by Donald Schafer, MD, of theUniversity of California, Irvine. This technique has worked well for my patientsand should work for you if you diligently follow these simple steps: • First, close your eyes and concentrate on your breathing for a fewminutes. Let it become slower, deeper, and more regular. • Then imagine yourself, comfortable and relaxed, at the place whereyou usually study. • After you do this, pick up a pen or pencil (whichever you will useon the test) and suggest to yourself that when you do this just as the testbegins, you will feel as comfortable as you do sitting in your study chair athome, or wherever you study. • Repeat this suggestion several times, and let it work for you onexams.If this doesn’t work for you during the test, try closing your eyes and takingthree slow, deep breaths. Take a minute to try to imagine a relaxing scene likelying on the beach or sitting near a warm fire in winter. This method shouldhave a relaxing effect on you. If anxiety is causing you to blank out onmaterial you know, take a minute and do these relaxation exercises. Thispractice will often remove the block.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------3 BRAIN-BASED TECHNIQUES TO CALM YOUR NERVES AND ENHANCE COGNITIVE FUNCTIONBEFORE A TESTBreathe: Whenever you feel tense or anxious about a big test, try this simplebreathing exercise to help you relax. Deep breathing also increases oxygen tothe brain, which decreases brain fog and increases focus—two things that willhelp you on your exam. 1. Take a deep breath. 2. Hold it for one to two seconds. 3. Slowly exhale for about five seconds. 4. Repeat 10 times to feel more relaxed.Practice meditation or pray: Meditation and prayer—as little as five minutes aday—have been found to have a number of benefits that can benefit you intest-taking, including: • soothing stress • sharpening focus • boosting moods • improving memory • enhancing overall prefrontal cortex (PFC) function2[Bibliography_5.xhtml#c12_rfn2] • improving executive function3 [Bibliography_5.xhtml#c12_rfn3] • reducing feelings of anxiety, depression, and irritabilityThe Ultimate Brain-Based Therapy: Harness your senses: Your brain is influencedby the environment around you. Take control of your sensory inputs to get into abetter “head space” before a test. • Sight: Take a few moments to look at nature pictures4[Bibliography_5.xhtml#c12_rfn4] or images of fractals (never-ending, repeatingpatterns found in nature),5 [Bibliography_5.xhtml#c12_rfn5] which have beenfound to reduce stress. • Sound: Music can calm you down, help you focus, and give you a moodboost. Create a playlist that works for you and listen to it on the way to yourtest. • Touch: Ask a friend to give you a hug. This simple act prompts yourbrain to release the feel-good neurotransmitter oxytocin, which causes areduction in the stress hormones cortisol and norepinephrine. • Smell: A variety of scents have been found to help calm nerves,including lavender oil (for anxiety6 [Bibliography_5.xhtml#c12_rfn6] and mood7[Bibliography_5.xhtml#c12_rfn7]), rose oil,8 [Bibliography_5.xhtml#c12_rfn8],9[Bibliography_5.xhtml#c12_rfn9] and chamomile.10[Bibliography_5.xhtml#c12_rfn10] • Taste: Foods flavored with cinnamon, mint, sage, saffron, or nutmeghave been shown to act as mood boosters.11 [Bibliography_5.xhtml#c12_rfn11]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------AFTER THE EXAMAfter your test is graded and handed back to you, you have threeresponsibilities: 1. Go over the exam and note what questions you missed and why youmissed them. This is a helpful, although painful, way to learn. Keep in mindwhat Oprah Winfrey has said about this: “Failure is a great teacher, and if youare open to it, every mistake has a lesson to offer.” 2. If you have questions that are marked wrong and you disagree withthe keyed answer, approach the professor with your challenge. Be prepared;teachers will often change answers for students, but only if they canpersuasively defend their choice of another answer. 3. If you note that some of the questions are written in an ambiguousfashion, tactfully bring them to the teacher’s attention. Most teachers welcomefeedback and have no desire to claim omnipotence. This will help keep futurestudents from being faced with the same poor test questions.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR GRADES: PRESSURIZING YOUR CABIN• Several weeks before the exam: Establish a study schedule, study in units,engage in periodic overall reviews, have a complete set of notes and a “bigpicture” fact sheet, and be sure to ask the instructor about the content of thetest.• Several days before the exam: Study with a partner, go to class, and cramfor review, not first exposure. When you need to cram cold material, know yournotes and chapter summaries and secure old exams if permissible.• The day before the exam: Do an overall, quick review emphasizing your notesand “big picture” fact sheet.• The day of the exam: Eat moderately, arrive for the test a few minutesearly, stay away from congregations of students, and find a seat away fromdistractions.• Test-taking generalizations: Quickly overview the test, read theinstructions, answer the questions you know first, answer as you think theprofessor would, take questions at their face value, and fight the impulse tofinish quickly.• When answering essay questions: Read the questions slowly, organize youranswers, work from general to specific, be concise when you know an answer andlengthy when you do not, always write something, be conscious of your time, andreview your work.• When answering objective questions: Read the question slowly, answerquickly, look for universal statements, use a notation system, use the odds forquestions if you do not know the answer, and change answers for goodreasons—otherwise, go with your first impression.• Alleviate test anxiety by being prepared and utilizing relaxationtechniques.• After the exam has been graded: Review it to see why you missed certainquestions, discuss disagreements with the professor from a standpoint ofknowledge, and give the professor your impression of the test.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageContent":"13 [Contents.xhtml#rch13]LETTING YOURSELF OUT [Contents.xhtml#rch13]WRITING AND SPEAKING [Contents.xhtml#rch13]In the spring of my junior year in college, I was required to write 12 papers,three of them term papers. My ethics class was assigned six papers, one dueevery two weeks. I remember being frustrated in that class because I would getmy papers back from the professor without any of his personal comments onthem—only the grade in the upper right-hand corner. I wanted to get feedback onmy work, and after he returned my fourth paper with only the grade marked in theupper right-hand corner again, I began to wonder if he was reading them at all.So, in my fifth paper I inserted a phrase at the bottom of the fourth page inthe middle of a paragraph that said, “If you are still reading this, I will buyyou a milkshake.” In the margin he wrote, “Make it chocolate.” It was his onlycomment on the paper!Writing is a skill that will serve you well not only in middle school, highschool, and college, but also throughout your life. Being able to write wellwill open many doors for you professionally. In the same way, being able tospeak well in public is a skill that many employers desire. This chapter isabout letting yourself out in writing and speaking. These two skills are groupedtogether in this chapter because of the many similarities between writing apaper and writing a speech. At the end of the chapter, you’ll find techniquesfor enhancing the delivery of speeches. There are many good books and resourceson writing and speaking effectively, so this chapter will be limited to eightsteps that I found helpful in my own academic career.1. Schedule your timeMeeting deadlines is an essential part of everyone’s life and especiallyimportant when writing papers or speeches. Many professors lower your grade forlate papers or won’t accept them at all after the due date. If your speech isnot written in time for you to practice it, you’ll feel very nervous when youpresent it. As soon as you get an assignment, prepare a reasonable schedulearound the remaining seven steps in this chapter. You’ll save yourself manyhours of lost sleep the few nights before the assignments are due.2. Choose a topic from the heartWhen choosing a topic for a paper or speech, opt for something you’re passionateabout or something that interests you. This will make the process more enjoyablefor you and will increase the likelihood that you’ll expend the necessary effortto complete the task on time. It will also make it more enjoyable for theaudience or reader because when you are passionate about something, it comesthrough in your work. If you’re bored by the subject, everybody else will bebored, too. Even if your instructor assigns a topic, try to find a way to injectyour personality into it to make it unique. Write with your heart involved.Stay away from abstract subjects. In general, people want to read or hear aboutthings that affect their daily lives, like how to get better grades whilestudying less.Don’t put extra pressure on yourself to find a topic that has never been writtenor spoken about previously. As King Solomon wrote in the Book of Ecclesiastes,“What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there isnothing new under the sun.” (Eccles. 1:9) This is still a good principle tofollow. Choose topics that are new to your audience or put a new spin on afamiliar subject to make it more interesting, but be reasonable in yourexpectations.3. Narrow it downAfter you have selected a topic, make sure it is narrow enough to handle in therequired numbers of words or minutes. If the topic is too broad—“The Definitionof the Universe,” “The Nature of Matter,” or “The Development of Human Thoughtand Its Significance for the Twenty-First Century”—you’ll spend the whole paperor speech on generalities and be unable to say anything specific or practical.If you’re not sure if your topic is too broad, ask your instructor for guidance.The goal in writing and speaking is not a lengthy dissertation that barelyscratches the surface of a topic, but rather an organized, tightly constructedidea, argument, or message.4. Do adequate researchResearching your paper or speech can be profitable and time efficient, or it canbe unproductive and stress-inducing. The first thing to do is zero in on thetopic you have in mind. What is the overall message you want to convey? Onceyou’ve locked in on what you want to get across, hit the books and the internetto find research to support your angle. Make sure to use the most reputablesources, such as books by experts in the field, journal papers and studies, TEDTalks, and newspaper and magazine articles.When researching a topic, take voluminous notes. The more information you havein front of you when writing the paper or speech, the easier it will be tocompile. Also, keep a bibliography on the sources you have used. This will saveyou time if you need to refer to them again or if your teacher asks where yougot a certain fact.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[../images/moniter.jpg]TECH TIP FROM CHLOE AND ALIZÉBe aware that Wikipedia and articles shared on social media are not necessarilyreliable sources. Always check the information with independent sources toverify accuracy.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------5. Make an outlineAfter you’ve researched the topic and taken adequate notes, make an outline ofthe paper or speech. Start by putting your thesis statement at the top of thepage. Below that, list the main points (aim for three to five items) thatsupport your thesis statement. Label them with Roman numerals (I, II, III, IV,V). Then expand the outline from there by adding supporting ideas for each mainpoint. By starting with the main concepts, you can easily see the “big picture”of how your paper or speech will flow. Then you can simply add the details.If you put sufficient thought and effort into the outline, you won’t have tospend time rewriting the paper if it turns out that you don’t like the way it’sorganized. Also, if you paraphrase the information in your outline instead ofcopying it out of a book or the internet word for word, it will make writing thepaper easier. This way, you can pull information right out of the outline andinto your paper.Having a detailed outline will decrease the time it takes to write the finalpaper or speech, because you will be less prone to writer’s block. Your outlinewill serve as a road map to remind you where you have been, where you are, andwhere you are going.6. Discuss your ideasAfter you’ve made an outline, it’s a good idea to discuss it with a friend orwith your teacher. They can give you valuable ideas and feedback on it, and atthis stage, it isn’t difficult to do major revisions. Don’t wait until after youhave finished writing your paper or speech to have your work reviewed. At thatlate stage, it is not only more difficult and time-consuming to make changes,but it is also more disheartening and ego-deflating. Pick someone to review yourwork who believes in you and whom you trust with your feelings. You’ll be morelikely to believe and accept any constructive criticism they might give you.7. Write a first draftWriting the first draft of the paper or speech is actually the easiest part ofthe process if you have chosen an interesting topic, have kept its scope narrow,have sufficiently researched and outlined it, and have discussed it with someoneyou respect.A simple rule to follow in writing or speaking is to first tell your audiencewhat you plan to say, then say it, and then recap what you have just said. Thiswill give the material an organized appearance, and it will also reinforce themajor points.When writing, try to keep in mind five simple concepts: • Say only one thing at a time and keep the arguments, examples, andcontributory ideas pertinent to the topic. • Ensure that the sentences have continuity and that the ideas flowcomfortably together. • Be as clear as possible. If you wish to make a point, be certain youhave made it. Clear writing indicates clear thinking. • Don’t use extra words or examples. Be as concise as possible topromote clarity. Take out or restructure any sentences or words that clutter thepaper. • Have some fun with it. If a point can be made in a funny or humorousway, it has a better chance of being remembered, and it will also keep theaudience’s attention focused on the paper or the speech. This is especiallyuseful when the information gets complicated or dense.When writing the first draft, let the ideas flow onto the paper. Don’t edit yourwork or make revisions as you go. You will have time later to correct thegrammar and punctuation. Just get the ideas onto the paper for the firstwriting. Some people spend so much time trying to perfect their writing as theygo that they never get past the first paragraph!8. Revise your workAs any professional writer will say, “writing is rewriting.” Don’t expect yourfirst draft to be your final draft. In fact, revising your paper or speech canbe just as time-consuming as writing the initial draft. This is the time toimprove sentence structure, choose stronger vocabulary, and correct punctuation,as well as ensure that the ideas flow in a logical sequence. This is usually notas interesting as writing the first draft, but if proper time is taken, thepaper or speech will take on a professional appearance, and the mechanics willnot distract from the information you are trying to convey.TIPS FOR SPEAKING IN PUBLICAfter a paper is finished, you turn it in and hope for a good grade, but afteryou’ve finished writing a speech, your work is only half over. The mostnerve-racking part for many is to get up in front of a group of people and sharetheir speech. I know this is true, because I used to get the feeling of having aherd of angry mosquitoes (most people get butterflies—I get mosquitoes) in thepit of my stomach as I was about to deliver a speech. Also, at the beginning ofmy speech, my voice would betray me and would sound as though someone wasletting the air out of a balloon slowly while stretching the opening of it,creating a painful, squeaky noise.By participating on two college speech teams and acting as the president of thesecond one, I learned the following helpful strategies to overcome my fear ofpublic speaking and deliver a winning speech: • Pick a topic you love. As mentioned earlier, be sure to choose atopic familiar to you and/or very interesting to you. If you’re excited by thematerial, you’re more likely to get the audience excited about it too. • Revise the script until you’ve got it just right. If you feel goodabout what you are going to present, you’ll feel confident about delivering it. • Perform your speech in front of friends or the mirror, or use yourphone to record yourself. This gives you the advantage of presenting the speechto a friendly audience—even if it’s just yourself—that can provide feedback. Ifyou know how you look as you are presenting the speech, you can adjust yourposturing and gestures until you feel comfortable. Take note of your timing andvoice level too. For example, pausing a few seconds before a major point is agreat way to indicate to the audience that you’re about to share something veryimportant. And practice making good eye contact with the audience. If your imagein the mirror walks away or falls asleep, you know you’re in trouble. • Time yourself. If your speech is supposed to be 10 minutes and thematerial you’ve written only comes to three minutes or goes on for 25 minutes,you’re going to have a big problem. Use the stopwatch on your phone to make sureyou can deliver the speech in the assigned time limit. • Practice, practice, practice! The more familiar you are with thesubject, the less chance you will feel overwhelmed by nerves. Even though youwrote the speech, you need to review it as much as possible, so if you do startto panic, you won’t blank on its contents. Just like the test-taking tip you sawin an earlier chapter: Trust yourself. • Keep a cheat sheet. Carry notes with you even if you are deliveringyour speech from memory. This will give you the added assurance that if youcompletely blank out on your presentation, you can quickly find your place andproceed. But use the notes only if you really can’t remember anything. If you’retoo focused on the notes, you’re likely to block the information that you need.And no audience wants to watch someone deliver a speech with their head down andtheir nose in their notes. • To memorize a speech, keep the outline uppermost in your mind. The“big picture” is very helpful here. If you know where you have been in yourspeech, where you are, and where you are going, you might block out a few words,but you can always move to the next major point. • Be enthusiastic! Realize that you’re developing a tool that can makeyou feel better about yourself. If you can write or speak well, you have apowerful vehicle for sharing your ideas with others. This is healthy from apsychological and social standpoint, because as you learn to communicate betterwith others, you’ll have the opportunity to be involved in more humaninteractions, and these will be more satisfying.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------4 STEPS TO SOOTHE PUBLIC SPEAKING ANXIETYThroughout my career, I’ve appeared on TV hundreds of times, and I really enjoyhaving the opportunity to share what we’ve learned from our brain imaging workwith the audience. But I wasn’t always a natural in front of the camera. Infact, I still vividly remember my very first TV interview for CNN in 1989. Theywanted to interview me about an article I had written for Parade magazine called“How to Get Out of Your Own Way.” It had struck a chord with readers and gottena huge response. But just before I was about to go on air, I became racked withanxiety. My heart started beating out of control, and I felt as though Icouldn’t catch my breath. I wanted to run from the studio. Luckily, as apsychiatrist, I treat people with anxiety, so I followed the same four steps Igive to my patients. 1. Slow down your breathing. When you take shallow, fast breaths, yourbrain gets less oxygen. And anything that reduces oxygen to the brain cantrigger feelings of anxiety, fear, and panic. 2. Don’t leave. Running away from the situation won’t solve the problem.In my example, if I had left the CNN studio that day, I probably never wouldhave agreed to do a TV interview again. 3. Write down your thoughts. You will learn much more about this in thefollowing chapter, but basically, if you write down what you are thinking, youcan challenge unfounded, fearful thoughts. In my case, I was afraid I wouldstutter and look stupid. But I had never stuttered in my life, so it was veryunlikely I would start then. 4. Take calming supplements or medications, if needed. If the firstthree steps don’t help, you may want to consider this final step.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR GRADES: LETTING YOURSELF OUT• Writing and speaking well will serve you all of your life.• In writing papers or speeches, follow eight steps: prepare a reasonabletime schedule, choose a topic interesting to you, narrow the topic, researchyour presentation, outline your work, discuss the outline with a professor orfriend, write a first draft, then revise your work.• Tell the audience what you plan to say, say it, and then review what yousaid.• When writing, keep five concepts in mind: say one thing at a time, writewith continuity, be as clear as possible, be concise, and use humor, whenappropriate.• When speaking, be interested in your topic; have a well-written speech;perform the speech in front of friends or mirror; practice, practice, practice;time yourself; carry notes with you; and memorize the outline of the speechfirst.• Be enthusiastic! The more you write or speak, the more you will improve andthe easier it will be.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageContent":"14 [Contents.xhtml#rch14]KILLING THE ANTs [Contents.xhtml#rch14]HOW TO FEEL GOOD EVERY DAY [Contents.xhtml#rch14]Don’t believe every stupid thought in your head. Did you know that your thoughtscan lie? And that they lie a lot? Your thoughts can make you feel sad, insecure,and incapable, and they can get in the way of your success in school. TakeMarcus, for example. He came to see me because he was having a lot of troublewith his schoolwork. In his first session with me, he told me:“I’m an idiot.”“My teachers hate me.”“I can never be as good as other kids.”I call these thoughts ANTs, or automatic negative thoughts. I taught Marcusseven simple strategies to gain control of his thinking, calm his mind, andfocus his attention so he could achieve the success in school he wanted. You canlearn from them too.1. YOUR THOUGHTS DIRECTLY AFFECT HOW YOU FEELEvery time you have a thought, your brain releases chemicals that impact the wayyou feel. Whenever you have a sad thought, a mad thought, or a hopeless thought,such as “I’m an idiot,” your brain releases chemicals that make you feel bad.Conversely, every time you have a happy thought, a loving thought, or a hopefulthought, your brain releases chemicals that make you feel good immediately.Thinking too many bad thoughts can make you feel bad—about yourself, about yourability to do your schoolwork, about your teachers, about everything—and canprevent you from achieving your goals.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------YOUR BRAIN IS HARDWIRED FOR NEGATIVE THINKINGFor our cave-dwelling human ancestors, negative thinking was a powerful tool inour survival arsenal. Focusing on the negative helped us avoid getting eaten bya saber-toothed tiger or falling off a cliff to our death. Being acutely awareof the potential dangers in life is part of why humans have survived so long. Asour society has evolved, however, we are no longer under constant threat fromwild animals or unknown terrain. But the human brain hasn’t evolved as quicklyas our surroundings. In fact, research shows that our brains are still moreattuned to negative experiences than positive ones.1[Bibliography_6.xhtml#c14_rfn1] Just look at the news we consume—it’s onedisaster after another. We’re far more likely to seek out negative news. In onestudy, people were 63 percent more likely to click on headlines with negativeadjectives than those with positive wording.2 [Bibliography_6.xhtml#c14_rfn2]The good news is that you can train your brain to flip this natural tendencyupside down and swap out negative, unhelpful thinking for positive thoughts thathelp you achieve your goals.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------2. ASK YOURSELF IF YOUR THOUGHTS ARE TRUELearn how to question the thoughts that prevent you from being the student youwant to be. My good friend Byron Katie created an exercise called “The Work”that can help turn around negative thoughts and beliefs that fuel anxiety anddepression. Basically, any time you have a negative, hurtful, distressingthought, ask yourself if it is true. For example, if you think “I’m terrible athistory,” ask yourself if it is true. Are you really terrible at it, or do youjust need to study harder? Or do you need to find ways to make the subject moreinteresting to you so you will want to learn it? When you see the truth of yourthoughts, you can take better control of your mind. What a comfort!3. MEET THE 7 TYPES OF ANTsBefore you can kill the ANTs, you need to learn how to identify them. There areseven different types of ANT species: • All-or-Nothing ANTs. These ANTs think in absolutes—things are allgood or all bad—and use words like all, always, never, none, nothing, no one,everyone, and every time.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------CAN YOU THINK YOUR WAY TO A BETTER BRAIN?I once did a study on negative thinking versus positive thinking withpsychologist Noelle Nelson, the author of The Power of Appreciation. Weperformed two SPECT scans on her brain under very different conditions. For oneof the scans, she spent 30 minutes contemplating all the wonderful things in herlife that made her feel grateful. After these positive thoughts, her SPECT brainscans showed very healthy blood flow and activity. For the other scan, I askedNoelle to spend 30 minutes thinking about all of her worst fears and worries.Her negative brain showed marked differences compared with her positive brain.Her negative brain showed lowered activity in two important regions, thecerebellum and temporal lobes. As you recall, the cerebellum is involved inprocessing complex information, and low activity in this area is associated withpoor learning, slowed thinking, and disorganization. Low activity in thetemporal lobes can cause problems with memory and moods. Noelle’s story showsthat negative thinking leads to negative changes in the brain that can undermineyour efforts in school. On the other hand, positive thinking boosts yourbrainpower for better performance.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- • Just the Bad ANTs. This ANT can’t see anything good! It sees onlythe bad side of any situation. • Guilt-Beating ANTs. These ANTs think in words like should, must,ought to, or have to that are actually demotivating. • Labeling ANTs. Attaching negative labels to yourself or someone elsestrengthens negative pathways in the brain and keeps you stuck in your old ways. • Fortune-Teller ANTs. Don’t listen to this lying ANT! FortunetellerANTs predict the worst possible outcome with little or no evidence. • Mind Reader ANTs. This ANT thinks it can see inside someone else’smind. It thinks it knows how others think and feel without even being told. • Blaming ANTs. Blaming others for your problems makes you a victimand prevents you from admitting your mistakes or learning from them.4. KILL THE ANTsTo kill the ANTs, you need to identify the species, then reframe the thoughtwith honest, rational thinking. Here are examples:ANTSpeciesKill the ANTI never do well on essay tests.All or NothingThat’s not true. I usually do well, but I missed the mark on this one. I’lllearn from my mistakes on this one and do better next time.I only got a 90 out of 100 on the exam. I’m worthless.Just the BadGetting a 90 is a great accomplishment, and I should be proud.I should work on the outline for my term paper, but I don’t want to.Guilt BeatingI want to finish my term paper this weekend because it’s important to me, andcompleting the outline will help me do it.I’m a lousy student.LabelingIf I stay focused and study really hard, I can get good grades.The other students are going to hate my speech.Fortune-TellerI can’t predict this without having proof.My study partner must be mad at me because she didn’t reply to my text rightaway.Mind ReaderI don’t know that for sure. Maybe she’s just busy studying for another class.I’ll speak to her about it.It’s my teacher’s fault I didn’t get a better grade.BlamingI need to look at my part in the problem and figure out what I can do betternext time.5. TAKE A BREAK TO PREVENT BURNOUTFor students, there’s so much pressure to succeed, it can leave you feelingoverwhelmed and stressed out. I know from personal experience what it feels liketo be burned out—when you’ve been working for so many hours that you can’t thinkstraight anymore . . . and you still have more work to do. Here are some tips tohelp you avoid getting caught up in a pressure cooker. • Accept your limitations and know when enough is enough. Learn to beokay with not being able to be superhuman, and don’t expect perfection fromyourself. It’s bad enough that your teachers are putting a lot of pressure onyou; don’t make it worse by putting added pressure on yourself. • Try to step back, take a break, and relax. Your best work is donewhen you’re well rested and relaxed. In fact, too much stress releases chemicalsin your brain that reduce your cognitive performance and lower your ability toproblem-solve. I know it can be hard to take a break, but your best reallyrequires rest. Remind yourself that this is not an excuse to procrastinate ornot do work but permission to prevent burnout. • Schedule breaks. Time management is a very important factor inavoiding burnout. Figure out what things you want to make time for and put themin your schedule.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[../images/moniter.jpg]TECH TIP FROM CHLOE AND ALIZÉRemember to put “me time” in your schedule and set an alert as a reminder topower down and give your brain and body a rest.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------6. SPREAD KINDNESS TO YOUR TEACHERSOne thing I have found that makes school so much better is befriending yourteachers. Whether you like it or not, you’re going to see these people on aregular basis, so why not make it a more pleasant experience? It takes simplethings like being respectful in class, having a positive attitude, and tellingyour instructor when you appreciate something about their teaching style. Onevery important thing to keep in mind is to avoid overdoing it. Teachers haveseen it all before—the “kiss-ups,” the ones who bring them chocolate, and theones who say, “My mom’s the head of the PTA, now give me that A.” Your teacherscan see through any phony attempts to be BFFs with them. It could backfire andwork against you. On the other hand, you might actually end up liking them andgetting even more out of the relationship.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR GRADES: KILLING THE ANTs• Your thoughts directly affect how you feel. Bad thoughts make you feel bad;good thoughts make you feel good.• Question the veracity of the thoughts in your head: Ask yourself if theyare true.• Meet the seven types of ANTs. These automatic negative thoughts can makeyou feel bad and keep you from achieving your goals.• Kill the ANTs.

The gift’s contentsinclude better grades, more comprehensive knowledge, and more effective use ofyour time. But the results are up to you! If you use this gift—practicing theprinciples described and approaching your studies with an enthusiasticattitude—you’ll be very satisfied with it. However, if you neglect to use yourgift—sticking with old, unproductive habits and patterns or giving up on yourgoals when the going gets tough—you’ll be setting yourself up fordisappointment.Realize at the outset that you are primarily responsible for your success. Don’tfall victim to the Blaming ANT by blaming others or circumstances for yourfailures. This is a dangerous habit, because you’re admitting to a loss ofcontrol over your life. And if you’re not in control of yourself, who will be?This final chapter is intended to finish the wrapping of your present by placinga splendid bow on it. The end of this book will show you that developing your“other sides,” sowing healthy seeds, and directing your pain will strengthenyour overall abilities as a student and as a person.Everyone realizes there is more to life than just being a student, but if youaren’t careful, you’ll find yourself engaged only in studying or activitiesrelated to studying. When this happens, you’ll forfeit the necessary educationoffered by the other areas of your life. Decide at the outset what place studieswill have in your world, but don’t let them dominate you. You’ll have a morewell-rounded education if you take care of your body, establish solidrelationships, and cultivate outside interests.1. Take care of your physical sideBe extremely attentive to your physical health. Your body is the instrument oflearning, and it must be finely tuned. There are many studies suggesting thatregular exercise augments your mental stamina, memory, attention, problemsolving, planning, and organizing, and even enhances feelings ofself-confidence. Exercise also increases production of endorphins in your body,natural chemicals that add to your sense of well-being. In addition, understandthat being overweight will cause your body to divert energy from your braincells to feed your fat cells. Your ideal body weight is also your peakbrainpower weight.Feed your body a balanced diet to operate at peak efficiency. To fuel your brainand body for better performance, follow these nine rules for brain-healthyeating. • Rule #1: Focus on high-quality calories. The quality of your foodmatters much more than the quantity. Compare a 500-calorie cinnamon roll to a500-calorie plate of salmon, spinach, red bell peppers, blueberries, andwalnuts. One will drain your energy and increase inflammation; the other willsupercharge your mind and keep your body healthy. • Rule #2: Drink plenty of water. Your brain is 80 percent water.Staying hydrated helps optimize the brain’s power. Being dehydrated by just 2percent impairs performance in tasks that require attention, immediate memoryskills, and physical performance. • Rule #3: Eat high-quality protein in small doses throughout the day.Consuming protein helps stave off hunger and prevents energy crashes. • Rule #4: Eat smart carbohydrates. Carbs that are low glycemic andhigh in fiber—think vegetables and fruits like blueberries, pears, andapples—stabilize blood sugar and provide sustained energy. • Rule #5: Focus your diet on healthy fats. Did you know that 60percent of the solid weight of your brain is fat? Good fats are essential toyour health. Choose healthy fats like avocados, fish (wild salmon, trout, seabass), nuts and seeds, olives, olive oil, and coconut oil. • Rule #6: Eat from the rainbow. Include natural foods in your dietthat reflect the color of the spectrum, such as blueberries, pomegranates,yellow squash, and red bell peppers. This will boost the power-packed flavonoidsto elevate antioxidant levels in your body and help keep your brain young. • Rule #7: Cook with brain-healthy herbs and spices. Herbs andspices—including ginger, garlic, oregano, cinnamon, turmeric, and thyme—containmany health-promoting substances and add flavor to your food. • Rule #8: Make sure your food is as clean as possible. Whenever youcan, eat organically grown or raised foods, as pesticides, hormones, andantibiotics used in the food industry can accumulate in your brain and body andcause problems. • Rule #9: If you struggle with any mental health or physical issues,eliminate any potential allergens or internal attackers. People often feel andperform better when they go on an elimination diet that gets rid of wheat (andall food containing gluten), dairy, corn, soy, processed foods, all forms ofsugar and sugar alternatives, and food dyes and additives.2. Develop your relational sideMuch satisfaction and fulfillment in life comes from your relationships withother people. If you neglect this aspect of your life because of your studies,then you are cheating yourself. Valuable, practical lessons are learned fromthese encounters, and it is to your advantage to cultivate the relationshipsthat are important to you.Using your studies as a way to avoid meaningful associations will perhaps lessenyour pain in life, because relationships can often be painful. However, fewpeople reach their full potential as humans without significant personalrelationships. As I mentioned in the first chapter, there is no growth orsuccess without some pain and risk-taking. We are all relational beings; don’tlet your studies cheat you out of being human.3. Cultivate your interests outside of schoolMany careers are born not from formal education, but from hobbies orextracurricular activities, like photography, journalism, sports, or studentgovernment. Engaging in these outlets will help you develop areas of your lifethat are often not challenged in teaching institutions. Also, these activitiesmay give you an added bonus of becoming a more interesting person.One hobby that I had in high school and part of college was raising my raccoon,Hermie. Hermie taught me many invaluable lessons. First, she taught me the artof diplomacy. One time I came home and found my mother and Hermie in a majorskirmish. It seemed Hermie decided that it would be great fun to TP my mother’sbathroom, turn on all the faucets, and play in the toilet bowl. In addition, shecontinually flushed the toilet—lowering the water pressure in the neighborhood.When my dad got home, my mother declared that it was either her or the raccoon,that they both could not live in the same house! Dad did not help matters byhesitating before he answered her! Believe me, I had to make major concessionsto keep Hermie from getting the boot.In college, I became known as the guy with the raccoon, and all the otherstudents wanted to meet Hermie. It turned out to be a great way to meet newpeople and make friends I probably never would have encountered if it weren’tfor Hermie.Developing your “other sides” is about learning how to become a whole person. Bytaking care of your body, establishing nurturing relationships, and cultivatingyour outside interests, you’ll be enhancing your total education. Never forgetthat you’re much more than a student! A major purpose of this book is to helpyou become a more efficient student, so you’ll have more time to develop other,equally important aspects of your life. This is the pretty bow on the present!SOWING SEEDSJesus told this parable: “A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he wasscattering the seed, some fell along the path; it was trampled on, and the birdsof the air ate it up. Some fell on rock, and when it came up, the plantswithered because they had no moisture. Other seed fell among thorns, which grewup with it and choked the plants. Still other seed fell on good soil. It came upand yielded a crop, a hundred times more than was sown.” (Luke 8:5–8)Time and effort (seeds) are not the deciding factors for your schoolperformance. You all know many students who study constantly yet have no graspof the information or do poorly on their exams. Conversely, you know studentswho get As in their classes, regardless of the amount of sleep they get or howmany breaks they take. The yield of the harvest from your studies will dependupon the quality of the seeds and the way they are planted. Reviewing the majorpoints of this book—basically, getting the big picture of Change Your Brain,Change Your Grades—will help you to cultivate the soil of your mind. • Having a balanced lifestyle is important for everything you do inlife. Many things go into performing well in even just one thing. Sleep,exercise, and energy can make a huge difference in your grade on an exam.Keeping a balanced lifestyle, to the best of your ability, will always increaseyour chances of success. • Changing bad study habits and patterns requires being motivated tochange, actually deciding to change, having the right attitude and tools forchange, persevering to entrench new ways, and setting yourself up to win. • Preparation is paramount to accomplishment. Start at the beginningof the beginning to lay a solid foundation of knowledge. • Study with a purpose. Know what you want to accomplish, what youhave studied, and what still remains to be learned. • The big picture is what you will remember, and it is your key tounderstanding the details. • Start with generalities and work toward specifics. • Develop the discipline of organizing your time, your resources,and—most of all—yourself. Use a systematic approach to your classes and berealistic in the time and energy you plan to devote to them. • Utilize the resources available to you. Read the syllabus andfoundational material in your texts. Obtain review books and old tests. Gleanall you can from your teachers and other students. • Approach your classes with a conscientious attitude in the beginningof the course, planning to do your best to establish a foundation and enhanceself-confidence. Know your goals going in, as this will keep you from gettingdiscouraged. • Try different study methods to see what works best for you indifferent situations. Study in defined units with frequent review, and alwaystry to apply what you are learning. • Go to class—it is the basic tool of education. In order to profitthe most from lectures, be prepared for them by reading ahead to give yourselfmore familiarity with the material. • Listening in class involves hearing, processing, acknowledging,reacting to, and assimilating the material. Active listening is necessary if youare to assimilate the subject matter. • When taking notes, take your cues from the lecturer. Remember, notesare the basis for most exams—a good set of notes is imperative! Rewrite themafter class in order to get more exposure to them. • Memory succeeds with associations. Understand the material beforeyou attempt to memorize it. Become skilled with the use of memory aids todevelop associations. • Learn to study with a partner. This practice will break the monotonyof studying, help you clarify questionable areas, and give you anotherperspective on the important points when it’s time to review for exams. • Prepare for exams by budgeting your study time, studying in units,and engaging in periodic overall reviews. Ensure that you have a complete set oflecture notes, made-up test questions, and a “big picture” fact sheet. • Find out as much as you can about the exam beforehand. Utilize oldtests (if permissible) to see how the professor asks questions and what materialthey have deemed important in the past. • Cram for review, not just exposure. Recentness of exposure is thelimiting factor for short-term memory. • During the exam, read the instructions carefully, answer thequestions that you know first, take questions at their face value, and fight thetendency to finish quickly. • Learn from exams by reviewing them afterward and questioning theprofessor if you disagree with them. • When writing a paper or a speech, schedule your time, choose anarrow topic, research it well, make an outline, discuss your ideas, and thenwrite and revise your work. • Keys to becoming an effective speaker involve believing in yourtopic, writing a good speech, practicing it, and delivering it with enthusiasm. • Develop the other areas of your life—your education in life involvesmuch more than any school can offer.The final method of planting seeds for your education is that of helping otherstudents. When you excel in a class, be willing to tutor those who arestruggling in it. I have spent many hours tutoring other students, and theharvest I have reaped for my efforts was invariably greater than that sown.Every time you teach something, it helps engrave that information deeper intoyour parietal lobe. For one neuroanatomy midterm exam, I spent over 15 hoursworking with two students who were having trouble in the class. When it wasover, I not only had the satisfaction of knowing I had helped two friends pass atough exam, but I also had the pleasure of writing a perfect exam for myself.You will reap what you sow, so use your talent and resources in the mostproductive ways possible."},{"pageContent":"Appendix A [Contents.xhtml#rapp1]107 BRIGHT MINDS WAYS TO GROW YOUR BRAIN [Contents.xhtml#rapp1]B is for Blood Flow 1.
