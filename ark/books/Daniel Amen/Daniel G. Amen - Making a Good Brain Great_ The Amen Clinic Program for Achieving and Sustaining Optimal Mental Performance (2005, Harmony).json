Having scanned and worked with more thanthirty thousand brains, more than any other living soul, it is very clear to methat the brain is involved in everything we do and everything we are. I havelearned that when your brain works right, you work right, and that when yourbrain is troubled, you have trouble in your life. Brain health is essential toall aspects of the quality of life.Your brain can be even better than it is right now—and I will show you how, stepby step! Whether you are already functioning at a high level (at work, in yourrelationships, or within yourself) and want to keep it that way, or you arestruggling to get through the day and need help, improving the inner workings ofyour brain is the most important first step to having the life you want.I live in Newport Beach, California, which is a wonderful place, but it has thereputation for being home to the greatest number of plastic surgeons and forbeing what some would call a plastic society. What many people do not realize,when they go to a plastic surgeon to have their noses redone, their breastsenlarged, or their wrinkles alleviated, is that they still will be the same onthe inside after the procedure is finished and the stitches removed. Change ismuch more effective from the inside out. My goal in this book is to teach you tolove and care for your brain as much as you love and care for your skin, yourbelly, and your bottom. It sounds silly at first, but when you ponder it for awhile, it makes perfect sense. To be your best self, you must have a brain thatworks at its best. This is what we strive to do at the Amen Clinics (in NewportBeach and Fairfield, California; Tacoma, Washington; and Reston, Virginia); wework hard to help balance the function of people’s brains and improve theirlives. Whether you are struggling in school, at work, at home, in relationships,or within yourself, the Amen Clinics work hard to help you to get the best brainand life function possible. Your brain and your life are inseparably linked.The great news is that the brain is malleable and able to change. With targetedstrategies, you can make a good brain great. But if you don’t actively work outa plan to help it, the brain becomes significantly less active with age. Lowerbrain activity and blood flow causes people to have trouble remembering factsand names, they become more easily fatigued, they struggle to learn newinformation, and they are at greater risk for more serious problems, such asstrokes or Alzheimer’s disease as they move into their fifties, sixties, andseventies. Isn’t it strange that most people are focused on taking care of theirskin, weight, job, home, and pet, while ignoring the part of them that mattersmost? It doesn’t have to be this way. This book is your guide to loving, caring,and nurturing your brain.To show you what I mean, here are a few examples of the kinds of people who canbenefit from the information in Making a Good Brain Great.Bart, at forty-seven, is a very good doctor who has built a thriving practice.His patients and employees love him, and he is respected in the medicalcommunity. He has been working hard for many years, but he has not taken verygood care of himself. He feels tired at the end of the day and doesn’t have muchenergy for his wife and young children. In the last ten years, Bart has put onan extra fifteen pounds and doesn’t feel quite as sharp as he once did. No onewould notice his problems, but he can feel that he is clearly not his best self.Angela, thirty-eight, owns a boutique dress shop. She is happy, energetic, and agood businesswoman. Her employees adore her, and she has been in a stablemarriage for fifteen years. One of her concerns is that both her father and hermother suffered from memory problems in their sixties, and she fears those sameproblems will happen to her.Marian, twenty-six, works at an ad agency. She is alternately “a star” and then“the problem” employee. At times she does wonderful work, and at other times shedrives everyone crazy with her temper, moodiness, and unpredictability. She hasbeen on the verge of being fired several times, but each time she pulled herselftogether and again did great work, for a while.John, sixty-two, is a business professor at a major southern Californiauniversity. Over the years he has been seen by others as successful, happy, andfunny. After a seemingly minor fall from a ladder at his home two years ago, hejust hasn’t been himself. It has been hard for him to describe the difference,and no one else seems to notice it. For the first time he finds himself lategrading papers, more distracted at meetings, and a bit more irritable with hiswife.What do Bart, Angela, Marian, and John have in common with one another and withmillions of others? They are successful, competent people who need to optimizetheir own brain function to be at their best. Bart has an overworked, stressed,malnourished, and tired brain; Angela has a brain at risk for early dementia;Marian has a brain that has erratic storms of activity; and John hurt his brainin a fall. All their brains are functional, but they need to be tuned, balanced,and properly nourished to remain in excellent health. Without this regimen theyare all at risk for brain deterioration that, although subtle, will rob them oftheir best abilities and potential.Here are the basic principles that Bart, Angela, Marian, and John and the restof us need to keep in mind.• The brain is involved in everything you do. How you think, how you feel, howyou act, and how well you get along with other people has to do with themoment-by-moment functioning of your brain.• When your brain works right, you tend to be effective, thoughtful, creative,and energetic.• When the brain is troubled, you may have problems with depression, anxiety,work performance, impulsivity, anger, inflexibility, memory, and relationships.• Your brain dysfunction, even when subtle, may be getting in your way ofsuccess.• Your brain has only so much reserve. A lifetime of abuse or neglect (smoking,too much caffeine or alcohol, drug abuse, brain injuries, excessive stress) alladd up and take years of healthy mental functioning away from you.• With the right plan, you can reverse damage and optimize your own brain andsubsequently improve your life.• You (and your brain) can be better than you are, even if you are already ingood shape!Making a Good Brain Great is a practical guide to understanding and optimizingthe functioning in your own brain, so you can be the best person possible. Itwill also teach you how to enhance the brains of your children and those youlove. Unfortunately, many of the things that we do as parents, partners, andfriends that we think are loving, such as encouraging people to eat secondhelpings, are actually harmful to brain function.The book is divided into two parts. Part I, a basic primer on the brain, willexplain why it is essential to love and nurture the brain and how it isintimately involved in all you do. It outlines the nine basic principles of theAmen Clinics (Chapters 1–9). Part II contains the Amen Clinic Program for Makinga Good Brain Great. These practical strategies and exercises are based onreal-life experience with thousands of people. It will also teach you when andhow to seek professional help if brain problems need more extensive evaluationand treatment, such as John’s minor brain injury and Marian’s emotional brainstorms. The ultimate lesson in this book is for you to learn how to love,respect, and care for your brain, as you would love, respect, and care for acherished child or grandchild. When you develop this deep sense of caring foryour brain, you will be more likely to protect and nurture it, so that over timeit will help you be effective in love, work, and all you do.THE PROBLEMMost people do not consider caring for their brain to be an essential aspect ofgood health. Even though you probably already accept the basic brain principlesoutlined above, individuals rarely think about the day-to-day health of theirown brain. Until they came to our clinic, Bart, Angela, Marian, and John nevergave their own brains much thought, or considered how they work or how to keepthem healthy. It is rarer still for people to actively exercise and nourishthem. Schools teach no required classes on practical brain science for everydayliving, yet the brain is more important than geography, economics, algebra,literature, and world history combined. In fact, the brain is the place whereall this knowledge lives.Without much forethought, people pollute their brains with caffeine, cigarettes,alcohol, and drugs and by living in toxic cities. Without knowing they’re doingit, they hurt their brains by hitting soccer balls with their heads, playingtackle football, snowboarding and skiing without helmets, or riding motorcycles(even with helmets). People stress their brains by working at an ever-frenziedpace, holding on to resentments from the past, not getting enough sleep, anddriving in nightmare traffic. And without realizing it, people deprive the brainof proper nutrients, eating fast-food diets and not using appropriatesupplements.Brain dysfunction is the number-one reason people fail at school, at work, andin relationships. After all, the brain is the organ of learning, working, andloving. When the brain is ineffective, so are we.THE PROMISEBy taking simple steps to balance and optimize your brain function, you will beable to enhance and take better control of your life. With appropriateforethought (using your brain), you can learn how to keep your brain healthythroughout life. My goal has been to write a practical, easy-to-read book thatwill teach you the latest neuroscience research on how to achieve the best brainfunction possible—your ultimate brain. The brain is the supercomputer that runsyour life. Improving brain function enhances your ability to love, work, andlearn. The principles and exercises in this book are based on years ofcutting-edge neuroscience research with thousands of people who have come to theAmen Clinics, such as Bart, Angela, Marian, and John.Over the last fifteen years the Amen Clinics have amassed the world’s largestdatabase of brain scans related to behavior. We look at the brain on a dailybasis using a sophisticated study called brain SPECT imaging. We have looked athealthy brains and brains in trouble. We have looked at the brains of youngchildren, teenagers, adults, and the elderly. We have looked at brains onmedication, drug and alcohol abuse, supplements, prayer and meditation,gratitude, and a wide variety of psychological and biological treatments. At ourclinics we look at, optimize, and restore the brain. This book will describemany of the lessons we have learned in the process.THE PROGRAMThe Amen Clinic program offers a wealth of practical information on how toachieve the best brain possible. It starts by teaching you to protect your brainfrom injuries, toxic substances (such as alcohol and too much caffeine), andlack of sleep. It gives practical instructions on how to eat so your brain isproperly nourished, and how to do mental workouts to keep your brain strong. Acritical component of the program is physical exercise, which boosts blood flowand other positive nutrients to the brain. But not just any exercise will do:your exercise should get your heart rate up (helping your heart) and involve thecoordination centers of the brain, as dancing and tennis do. The program teachesabout the brain’s need for physical affection, as well as how to rid your brainof bad thoughts that interfere with love and health. Another important part ofthe program deals with music. Listening to certain types of music enhances brainfunction; other types may have a negative impact. Ways to counteract stress areexplored, as it has been recently discovered that chronic stress disrupts neuralpathways and kills certain brain cells. The program concludes with ways to keepthe brain healthy as you age, how to use nutritional supplements throughout lifeto enhance brain function, and a fifteen-day program to get started on the rightpath.Come join me on one of the most important journeys of your life—a journey intothe health and longevity of your brain."},{"pageContent":"PART ININE BRAIN-CENTERED PRINCIPLES TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE"},{"pageContent":"1YOUR BRAIN IS INVOLVED IN EVERYTHING YOU DOThe great sins of the world take place in the brain: but it is in the brain thateverything takes place . . . It is in the brain that the poppy is red, that theapple is odorous, that the skylark sings, (and that we love and hate eachother).—Oscar WildeYour brain is involved in everything you do. This is the first principle of theAmen Clinics. The sensation of waking up cuddled next to your husband’s orwife’s warm body is felt in the brain. The brain directs your urge to make loveand be physically close. Getting ready for the day by planning, grooming,eating, and communicating with your husband and kids is directed by the brain.Negotiating traffic, while talking on your cell phone, is a result of your braingiving orders. Managing your business, planning trips, evaluating employees,running meetings, attending luncheons, and answering e-mails are allaccomplished by your brain’s hard work. Leaving the office on time, playingtennis, lifting weights, and joking with your friends to unwind are activitiesspearheaded by the brain. Enjoying the sunset, helping the kids with homework,and assisting your wife with dinner are a result of moment-by-moment brainfunction. Your brain is the command and control center that runs your life.Our work at the Amen Clinics is based on nine deceptively simple principles.Understanding these ideas will lay the foundation for making a good brain great.These principles stem directly from the brain-imaging work that we have beendoing intensely for the past fifteen years. Do not let the simplicity of theseprinciples fool you. If you allow them to become part of your everyday life,they will change nearly everything you do in the direct service of brain health.PRINCIPLE 1: Your brain is involved in everything you do.How you think, how you feel, how you act, and how well you get along with otherpeople has to do with the moment-by-moment functioning of your brain. Mostpeople know that the brain is the organ of behavior, but few people understandthis principle at a deep emotional level. We spend more time and money onbeautifying our hair, our skin, our clothes, and our homes than we do on caringfor our brain. After looking at over thirty thousand brain scans, I have come torealize that how your brain works influences every part of who you are and whatyou do: from athletic skills to parenting, from management skills to your freetime activities, from social aptitude to artistic talent, and from drivingability to the type of music you like. Look at any aspect ofbehavior—relationships, school, work, religion, sports—and in the middle of itall is brain function.Let’s take four common examples of behavior and look at them through the lens ofthis first principle: motherhood, business management, dating, and attending asporting event.There are many different types of mothers. There are mothers, like my own, whoare outgoing, relaxed, fun-loving, upbeat, and playful. There are mothers whoare more serious, who focus on their children’s faults or tend to be too busy orpreoccupied to play with them. There are mothers who constantly push theirchildren to be their best and mothers who lead quietly by example. There aremothers who use guilt and nagging as the primary motivator of behavior, andmothers who cheer a child’s every positive move. Ultimately, the type of mothera woman may be is determined by her brain. Mothers who are more serious tend tohave higher amounts of activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The prefrontalcortex is involved with goal-setting, planning, forethought, and judgment. HighPFC levels are involved with goal-oriented behavior. Outgoing, playful, lessserious mothers have a little less activity in this part of the brain.Guilt-driven mothers tend to have higher activity in the brain’s emotionalcenters (limbic brain), which in turn causes them to focus on the negative, suchas all of her child’s faults. Few people know that the type of mother they havehas everything to do with the moment-by-moment functioning of her brain.There are in the world just as many different types of business managers asmothers, based in part on brain function. There are motivational managers andquiet managers. There are absent managers and micromanagers. There are managerswho scream and yell to get their way and managers who encourage. There aremanagers who enjoy firing people and managers who hold on to employees muchlonger than they should. Managers who have high PFC activity tend to be veryinvolved and directive; taken to an extreme, they are micromanagers. Managerswith low PFC activity tend to be idea people and relatively hands-off; taken toan extreme, they are absent. A part of the brain that we will discuss in detaillater on is the anterior cingulate gyrus, which runs lengthwise through thefront part of the brain. It is the brain’s gear shifter, allowing you to beflexible and shift between tasks. Managers who have good activity in this partof the brain tend to be flexible and are able to adapt to changes in thebusiness climate. Managers who have excessive activity in this part of the braintend to be rigid and inflexible. These managers tend to hold on to patterns ofbehavior long after they are helpful. Even though brains run businesses, fewpeople think about the brain at work.Our species has many varied ways to, as my eighteen-year-old daughter would say,hook up. Dating and mating are brain functions, even though the urges may feellike they come from lower in your body. There are shy people who rely on randomchance to find a mate. There are outgoing people who will ask a hundred or morepotential partners out on a date in search of their one true love. There arethoughtful, planning daters and those who do courtship on the spur of themoment. There are commitment-phobic daters who run at the first signs ofattachment and those who commit too easily. There are people who are overwhelmedby feelings of insecurity and jealousy and those who lack sufficient caring. Inthe center of the dating scene is the brain. The brain allows us to payattention to potential mates, to evaluate their suitability for us, to attach,to care, and to draw people toward us or push them away. The brain helps usevaluate honesty, fidelity, and reliability. Healthy PFC activity helps usfollow through on our commitments, showing the other person that we arereliable, predictable, and likely to make a good dad or mom. Lower levels ofactivity in the PFC will make us more spontaneous and fun (with lessforethought) but may also make us late for appointments, too pushy for earlysex, and more driven by emotion. We often judge our dates based on looks, but werarely consider their brain function. I believe this will change in the comingcentury. In fact, if you date my daughter for more than four months, you have toget a brain scan to determine if you can continue to see her. I’m not kidding.There are many different types of sports fans, depending again, in part, onbrain function. I watch many sports fans at the Staples Center in Los Angelesand at Angels Stadium in Anaheim, while undergoing the trials, tribulations, andjoys of rooting for the Los Angeles Lakers and the Anaheim Angels. My bigbrother, Jim, is an intense fan. He yells at the referees and umpires when hethinks they make a mistake, and he often loudly second-guesses the coaches andmanagers when they play the subs. There are quiet fans who show little emotionand fans who seem as though they are going to wet their pants when the home teammakes a mistake. There are forgiving fans and fans who hold grudges. There arefans who lack PFC activity and throw objects onto the court or field and fanswith high PFC activity who worry the whole game through. There are fans who arerude to people who wear opposing jerseys and fans who make friends with thepeople around them. There are pseudofans who show up to be seen (Lakers gamesare always events), and fans who cry when the home team loses. There are familyfans who use sporting events as a bonding mechanism, between father and son (orin my case, between father and two daughters). As the brain is involved inathletic skill, it is also involved in the type of sports fan you are.The first principle, like all of the principles, is very simple. Your brain isinvolved in every aspect of your life and the person you are."},{"pageContent":"2WHEN YOUR BRAIN WORKS RIGHT, YOU WORK RIGHTWHEN YOUR BRAIN IS TROUBLED, YOU HAVE TROUBLE IN YOUR LIFEYour brain determines your effectiveness in life. Even though this principle issimple, it is also controversial and a bit unsettling. The basic idea is thatsince your brain is involved in everything you do, it has to work at an optimallevel in order for you to be your best self. When your brain works right, it iseasier for you to be an effective parent, child, friend, lover, manager, orcommunity activist. When your brain works right, you have full access to yourtrue nature. On the other hand, when your brain is troubled you are more likelyto struggle at work, in relationships, within yourself, and in society. Whenyour brain is troubled, you have trouble being your best self and often actoutside your own values, morals, and desires.PRINCIPLE 2: When your brain works right, you work right; when your brain istroubled, it is hard to be your best self.This principle came to me after looking at hundreds of scans on my own patients.Not only do I read scans, I also work directly with patients and families,looking into the lives of the people behind the images. Early in my imagingwork, it became clear to me that the quality of brain function represented bythe scans was very often associated with the quality of the decisions, outcomes,and emotional connections in the lives of my patients. In analyzing the images,I started to think about the difference between will-driven behavior andbrain-driven behavior. Will-driven behavior comes from a healthy brain. Itallows you to exert conscious choice over a situation to work in your own bestinterest. Will-driven behavior is goal directed and productive; it helps youreach the goals you have set for your life. An example would be deciding to goto medical school, then working diligently over time to make that happen,despite all of the various obstacles that get in your way.Before I explain brain-driven behavior, I want to take a short side trip toteach you a little about the scans we do at the clinics. It will help clarifythe difference between will-driven and brain-driven behaviors. The imaging studywe do is called brain SPECT imaging. SPECT stands for “single photon emissioncomputed tomography.” It is a nuclear medicine study that uses tiny doses ofradioisotopes to look at blood flow and activity patterns in the brain. SPECTscans are different from standard MRI and CAT scans, which show brain anatomy orwhat the brain physically looks like. SPECT scans look at function or how thebrain works. SPECT results are actually very easy to read and understand. Welook at areas of the brain that work well, areas that work too hard, and areasthat do not work hard enough. We compare individual patient scans against alarge database of both healthy and abnormal scans.The images in this book are all three-dimensional (3D) brain images, of twokinds. The first kind is a 3D surface image, which captures the top 45 percentof brain activity. It shows blood flow of the brain’s cortical or outsidesurface. These images are helpful for visualizing areas of healthy blood flowand activity as well as those with diminished perfusion and activity. Theyassist us in looking at strokes, brain trauma, and the effects of drug abuse. Ahealthy 3D surface scan shows good, full, symmetrical activity across thebrain’s cortical surface (Images 2.1 and 2.2). A low level of activity shows upas a hole or a dent. The holes or dents usually represent not zero activity butlow activity. To make these images, we ask the computer to look at the top 45percent of brain activity; anything below that level shows up as a hole or adent. We choose that number because it represents two standard deviations belownormal, both from our own studies and from those of other scientific groups.image [images/Amen_9780307338136_epub_001_r1.jpg]The second type of SPECT image we will look at is the 3D active image, whichcompares average brain activity to the hottest 15 percent of activity. Suchimages are helpful in visualizing overactive brain areas, as seen in activeseizures, and many types of anxiety and depression, among other irregularities.A healthy 3D active scan (Images 2.3 and 2.4) reveals increased activity (shownby the light color) in the back of the brain, the cerebellum, and the visual oroccipital cortex, and average activity everywhere else (shown by the backgroundgrid).image [images/Amen_9780307338136_epub_002_r1.jpg]Note: These icons will be used throughout the text to help readers understandthe orientation of the scans and how they differ from normal. “Image a”comprises two icons: a healthy 3D surface SPECT scan looking down at the top ofthe brain; the icon below it is a model of the brain viewed from the sameperspective. “Image b” shows a healthy 3D surface SPECT scan viewed from below(the undersurface); the lower icon is a model of the brain from the sameperspective. “Image c” shows a healthy 3D active SPECT image looking down fromthe top of the brain; the lower icon is a model of the brain from the sameperspective. “Image d” shows a healthy 3D active SPECT image viewed from below(the undersurface); the lower icon is a model of the brain seen from the sameperspective. Remember, 3D surface scans help us see underactive areas, while 3Dactive scans let us see overactive areas.image [images/Amen_9780307338136_epub_003_r1.jpg]Not everyone’s brain looks the same. Brains are like faces, and there isvariation among them. From an aesthetic standpoint on scans, some brains arebeautiful, while others may be a bit misshaped and funny-looking. Some brainsare short and round, while others are long and skinny. But beautiful or not,looking at more than thirty thousand brain SPECT studies has made it clear to usthat a healthy brain shows good, full, even, symmetrical activity. A healthybrain has all of its major parts intact, and they work together in a relativelyharmonious fashion. Age variations are normal: the brain scans of children andteenagers reveal more activity than do those of adults. Yet even an elderlybrain, if properly cared for during life, looks healthy.Let’s look at several examples of healthy and unhealthy brains. In one of thegraduate courses I teach, I asked for volunteers for a healthy brain study.Christy, one of my students, came up after class very excited. “You have to scanmy eighty-two-year-old grandmother, Anna,” she said. “She is one of the mostnormal people I know. You will love her.” On Christy’s advice and with hergrandmother’s agreement, we screened her grandmother and indeed found her to behealthy and sweet; she met all the criteria for the study (no substance abuse,no brain injuries, no first-degree relatives with psychiatric illness, etc.).Anna had been married for fifty-eight years and was a loving wife, mother, andgrandmother. She had a sharp, curious mind and was active in her church andcommunity. She had solid relationships that spanned many years. Anna had one ofthe healthiest brains I had ever seen, out of thirty thousand (Images 2.5 and2.6)!image [images/Amen_9780307338136_epub_004_r1.jpg]Bruce, twenty, had experienced many years of serious drug abuse, includingheroin, marijuana, speed, hallucinogens, ecstasy, and pain-killers. I met himwhile working on a drug education video for high school students and youngadults. Bruce was having problems remaining sober, he had family troubles overhis drug use, and he felt ashamed about his behavior. As you can see, Anna’sbrain at eighty-two is much healthier than Bruce’s young drug-affected brain(Image 2.7).image [images/Amen_9780307338136_epub_005_r1.jpg]As we age, our brains normally get less and less active. But when aneighty-two-year-old brain looks significantly healthier than a twenty-year-oldbrain, then we can assume (accurately) that the twenty-year-old is in trouble.A healthy brain, in my experience, is associated with effective, goal-directedbehavior. People with healthy brains tend to make the best employees, the besthusbands and wives, the best parents, friends, employees, and citizens. Peoplewith troubled brains, on the other hand, tend to struggle in all areas of life.Think about Alzheimer’s disease. Do you think the people who suffer from thisdevastating illness still have access to their full selves, to their own freewill? Not possible. People with Alzheimer’s disease have a serious deteriorationof brain function and often behavior. My friend Leeza Gibbons, founder ofLeeza’s Place, a series of support centers for those afflicted with Alzheimer’sdisease and their families, has a mother with this devastating illness. Hermother went from being a kind, gentle, proper woman to someone who was angry,irrational, and combative. She was no longer her true self (Image 2.8).image [images/Amen_9780307338136_epub_006_r1.jpg]Overactive brain activity has been associated with obsessive-compulsive disorderas well as with bipolar disorder and other conditions. Heather, aseventeen-year-old girl, was struggling with alcohol abuse when I scanned herand her brother as part of the Emmy-winning show called The Truth AboutDrinking. Even though she was only seventeen, she had already been drinkingfairly heavily and was also struggling with family problems. On her scan, we sawan extremely overactive pattern of activity (Image 2.9). No wonder she drank—shewas trying to settle down the pattern of overactivity in her brain.image [images/Amen_9780307338136_epub_007_r1.jpg]In another example, Jimmy, a forty-five-year-old man, came to see me withpost-traumatic stress disorder from being in a fire. His scan showed multipleareas of increased activity that were consistent with his anxiety, depression,and fear (Image 2.10). His emotions and emotional brain systems were working waytoo hard, and my job was to calm them down.image [images/Amen_9780307338136_epub_008_r1.jpg]Okay, now we come back to the difference between will-driven and brain-drivenbehavior. Brain-driven behavior occurs when the brain hijacks your will andcauses you to act in ways that are unhelpful or even downright destructive.Patients who have obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), Tourette’s syndrome (TS),or drug abuse are examples of people with potential brain-driven behaviors. Aperson who suffers from OCD has distressing repetitive thoughts and/or performscompulsive behaviors, such as excessive lock-checking or hand-washing orengaging in elaborate rituals. Even though the person knows these thoughts orbehaviors are irrational, he can’t just say no to them. In severe cases, thethoughts and behaviors hijack or steal the majority of his time during hiswaking hours. Imaging studies have revealed that patients with OCD havesignificant hyperactivity in the front part of the brain. They overthink(obsessions) and overact (compulsions). TS is an involuntary tic disorder, withboth motor and vocal components. Even though a person with TS tries to suppressthe unwanted tics, the behaviors build and build until they have to beexpressed. The tics can involve facial twitches, shoulder shrugs, punching,throat-clearing, snorting, even swearing. In people with TS, scan studies haveshown abnormal hyperactivity in deep-motor and emotional centers of the brain.Drug or alcohol abuse often leads to an addiction that is out of control. Eventhough continued use has serious consequences, such as financial and relationaldisaster; even though continued use causes intense shame and self-loathing; andeven though the person has tried to stop many times, she can no longer controlthe behavior. I once treated a thirty-two-year-old cocaine addict who was goingthrough a divorce in large part because of his drug abuse. He had becomesuicidal over the prospect of losing his family. In my office, he cried abouthis drug use, saying it was like someone had a gun to his head—he had to use,regardless of the consequences. He had lost control over the decision of whetherto use cocaine. Brain images show that sometimes drug abusers have overall lowactivity in the brain and use stimulants such as cocaine or methamphetamines toincrease activity; sometimes they have excessive activity in the brain and areusing to try to settle things down. Many lives and families have been ruined bythe brain-driven behavior caused by drugs and alcohol. The addictions literallyhijack the brain.Why is this concept of will-driven versus brain-driven behavior so disturbing?It upsets the basic premise in our society that we all have the same level offree will. Isn’t everyone the same? I wish it were so, but looking at tens ofthousands of scans has shown me that we are not all the same. I grew up veryRoman Catholic, went to Catholic schools, and was an altar boy for many years.When I was growing up, life was very clear for me. There was heaven for the goodpeople, hell for the bad ones, and purgatory for those who weren’t bad enough togo to hell but weren’t good enough to get to heaven on the first try either. Ibelieved we all had the same level of free will, a level playing field, and thaton Judgment Day we would be judged based on how we behaved, how we used ourtalents, and of course, how we treated our mothers.As a child, I really had no opinion on the death penalty—I just didn’t give it alot of thought. But as an adult, shortly after looking at the first brain scansI ordered, I started to get a very uncomfortable feeling. The brain function ofmy patients who did bad things was much worse than that of people who wereliving productive, healthy lives. If the brain is the organ of behavior and freewill, and brain function was impaired, then obviously we all did not have thesame level of free will. As I think of it, free will varies on a scale of 0 to100. A person with a very healthy brain has nearly 100 percent free will. Apatient with OCD or TS or drug addiction has significantly less, and a personwith late Alzheimer’s disease has virtually none. Uh-oh, I thought to myself,killing people with bad brains is akin to killing sick people. That was not thesign of an evolved society. Subsequently I have scanned more than sixtymurderers and more than two hundred other convicted violent felons. The braindysfunction I saw was often dramatic.As I began to feel unsettled about how our society judged people, I also hadpersonal battles to fight. When defense attorneys found out about my imagingwork, they started sending me criminals to scan. We scanned violent children,teenagers, and adults, and we often found serious abnormalities in their brains.From a clinical perspective, it was very exciting work, because violent peoplewho used to be hard to treat often got better much faster when we had the scaninformation to work with. We were more effective at uncovering the problems andtargeting the right treatment. Now I was being asked to go into court to helpexplain bad behavior. Some of my colleagues, family, and prosecuting attorneysvehemently objected, and it caused quite a firestorm. Nonetheless I believedjuries were entitled to the information and that as a society we needed to learnthis important principle: when your brain works right, you work right, and whenthe brain is troubled, it is very hard to be your best self! We should bethinking about treatment rather than just punishment. The implications of thisprinciple for society are massive. Does it mean we should screen all people whodo bad things? Should we make psychiatric examinations and brain scans part ofthe intake process at juvenile hall? Should we rethink the death penalty?I was recently asked to be an expert witness in a criminal case that illustratesthis principle about brain function. Peter Chiesa, a sixty-two-year-old marriedman, was in the midst of a twelve-year feud with his next-door neighbors overtrees on an easement to their property. They had litigated the feud, and evenafter the legal intervention they still fought about it. During those twelveyears Peter’s behavior became more and more irrational. He had sustained a braininjury when he fell twelve feet from the top of a haystack onto his head andlost consciousness for an undetermined period of time; he suffered a stroke; andhe had coronary artery bypass surgery. This surgery has now been associated withincreased risk for developing serious thinking problems and early dementia. Allof these factors were likely contributing to Peter’s increased paranoia andvolatility. He sought psychiatric care, and his wife, twelve years younger thanhe, became more and more watchful over him. One day while his wife was at work,Peter woke up to the sound of a chain saw. He realized that the neighbors werecutting down the disputed tree branches.In a rage, he called 911. “I am going to kill the motherfuckers,” he shouted tothe operator. “You better get someone out here immediately.” He then took his.357 Magnum and confronted the two women who were violating his trees. As theirtwo young boys watched, Peter shot and killed both women.George Wilkinson, the psychiatrist who evaluated Peter for the defense, asked meto scan Peter’s brain (Images 2.11 and 2.12). To no one’s surprise, it showedsevere damage, especially in the prefrontal cortex (judgment center) and thetemporal lobes (associated with memory, mood stability, and aggression). Thescans were used at his trial. The purpose was not to get him off—that doesn’thappen, nor should it, when you kill two innocent women with their childrenwatching—but to show the jury that Peter was not operating as a normal personwith full access to his own faculties. The charges against him carried thepossibility of the death penalty.image [images/Amen_9780307338136_epub_009_r1.jpg]While I was on the witness stand, the prosecutor asked me, “Dr. Amen, didn’t yousay that Mr. Chiesa had serious problems in the prefrontal cortex, the planningpart of the brain?”“Yes, sir,” I replied.“Doesn’t the fact that Mr. Chiesa called 911 ahead of time indicate goodplanning?” he asked sarcastically.“No!” I said with emphasis. “Calling 911 actually indicates bad planning. Whatidiot would call 911 ahead of time if you planned to kill people?” I continued,“When we get upset, many people have violent thoughts, such as ‘I am going tokill the motherfuckers,’ but we do not call 911 or act on the bad thoughts. Goodplanning would have been to take a shower, make something to eat, or take awalk. Good planning avoids killing people in cold blood in front of theirchildren and helps you avoid spending the rest of your life in jail over treebranches.” The prosecutor objected to my answer, but the jury heard every word.Peter was convicted of second-degree murder rather than first-degree withspecial circumstances and was no longer eligible for the death penalty.Here’s a more common, if less dramatic, example of brain-driven behavior. Peoplewith attention deficit disorder (ADD) are often chronically late anddisorganized. Many imaging studies report that ADD is associated with lowprefrontal cortex activity, the part of the brain responsible for forethought,judgment, impulse control, and organization. Jill was nearly fired from her jobfor chronic lateness when she came to see me. Her boss had given her the finalwarning. She told me that she tried to get to work on time but was late sevendays out of ten. Her school history was consistent with ADD. Her teachersconsistently reported problems with attention span, restlessness, poor judgment,disorganization, and underachievement. Her scans (Image 2.13) revealed lowactivity in her prefrontal cortex (the front third of the brain). With propertreatment and better time-management skills she was able to keep her job. It waseasy for people to say she had an attitude problem, until they looked at herbrain. With better brain function, Jill became a more timely, better employee.image [images/Amen_9780307338136_epub_010_r1.jpg]When your brain works right, you work right. When your brain is troubled, it isvery hard for you to be your best self. The exciting news is that with targetedtreatments and appropriate interventions, such as diet, medication, supplements,exercise, and other innovative treatments, the brain can improve—even a brain asdamaged as Peter’s. There is much hope, but it is critical to start with theinformation that your brain matters and that taking care of it needs to be partof your life."},{"pageContent":"3YOUR BRAIN IS THE MOST COMPLICATED ORGAN IN THE UNIVERSE“The brain has the storage capacity of 6 million years of the Wall StreetJournal.”—Greg Iles, Footprints of GodYour brain is the most complex, mind-blowing organ in the universe. It weighsonly about three pounds, usually around 2 percent of the body’s weight.Unbelievably, given that it is the bedrock of the personality—some think eventhe soul—it is 80 percent water! The brain uses 20 percent of the oxygen webreathe and about 20 percent of the calories we consume. When whole-body scansare performed on people, they show the brain to be so active, compared to therest of the body, that it looks like a small powerful heater, while everythingelse appears ghostlike.The brain contains more than a hundred billion neurons (also called nerve cellsor brain cells), which is about the number of stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. Italso has trillions of supportive cells called glia. Each neuron is connected toother neurons by as many as forty thousand individual connections (calledsynapses) between cells. Multiply a hundred billion neurons times forty thousandsynapses—the brain has more connections than there are stars in the universe. Apiece of brain tissue the size of a grain of sand contains a hundred thousandneurons and one billion synapses, all “talking” to one another.PRINCIPLE 3: The human brain is the most complicated organ in the universe.A neuron’s main job is to generate an electrical signal called an actionpotential, which it does if it is sufficiently excited by other neurons. Theaction potential of a single neuron is like a lightning bolt that may stimulateother neurons. The stimulated neurons can then generate their own signals thattravel to and stimulate yet other neurons to which they are connected, creatinga network of neurons that perform a specific brain function. Action potentialstravel down nerve cells at speeds of about sixty miles per hour. The signals cantravel at these high speeds because a part of each neuron, called an axon, iswrapped in and insulated by a special substance called myelin. Like insulationsurrounding an electrical wire, myelin keeps the energy focused and moving inone direction. Axons that are not insulated by myelin, either by design ordisease, transmit signals ten times slower. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is called ademyelinating disease because it damages the myelin protection of neurons.It’s commonly said that we only use 10 percent of our brains. Nonsense! You maynot use every neuron in your brain at the same time, but each one is important.The brain never turns off or even rests throughout your entire life. It is veryactive at night, especially during dreaming. We cannot take out 30 percent ofyour brain and have you still be you. The brain can always work at greatercapacity (and we’ll discuss how to get the most out of your brain), but neverlet anyone tell you that 90 percent is off-line.Brain development is a fascinating construction tale, in which genes andenvironment collaborate to make us who we are. At some times during gestation,the fetus’s brain makes 250,000 new nerve cells per minute. Babies are born with100 billion neurons, but only a relatively small number of them are myelinatedor connected. In the first decade of life, a child’s brain forms trillions ofconnections. New research has shown that early childhood experiences do not justcreate a background for development and learning, they directly affect the waythe brain is wired. In turn, the wiring profoundly affects our feelings,language, and thought. Experiences do not just influence a child’s development;they finish the job of molding and sculpting the brain. About three-quarters ofthe brain develops outside the womb, in response to environment and experience.Nature and nurture always work together.Brain development is especially rapid during the first year. Brain scans showthat by twelve months a baby’s brain resembles that of a normal young adult. Byage three a baby’s brain has formed about one thousand trillionconnections—about twice as many as adult brains have. Also, the areas of thebrain that develop early, such as vision, are the first areas to becomemyelinated (wrapped in myelin), which helps that part of the brain become moreefficient. The years between ages three and ten are a time of rapid social,intellectual, emotional, and physical development. Brain activity in this agegroup is more than twice that of adults, and although new synapses continue tobe formed throughout life, never again will the brain be able to master newskills or adapt to setbacks so easily.At age eleven, the brain begins to prune the extra connections at a rapid rate.The circuits that remain are more specific and efficient. The brain is one ofthe best examples of the “use it or lose it” principle. Connections that areused repeatedly in the early years become permanent, while those that are notused are pruned.During late adolescence and into the mid-twenties, the front third of the brain,the prefrontal cortex or executive brain, continues to develop. Even though wethink of eighteen-year-olds as adults, their brains are far from finished.Myelin continues to be deposited in the PFC until age twenty-five or twenty-six,making the executive part of the brain work at a higher and more efficientlevel. Were you more mature at twenty-five than at eighteen? I sure was.Ironically, the car insurance industry knew about maturity and brain developmentlong before society did. Typically, automobile insurance rates change when adriver reaches age twenty-five, because at that age drivers are more thoughtfuland get into significantly fewer accidents. Their judgment centers work better.The knowledge that brain development continues into early adulthood is criticalto disseminate. Teenage and early-adult smoking, drug or alcohol abuse, andbrain injuries from risky sports all have the potential to disrupt braindevelopment, in some cases permanently.After about twenty-five, just as we reach peak development, the brain slowlystarts shrinking. Some research has suggested that the male brain shrinks fasterthan the female one. I think the reason is that men do more stupid things totheir brains: statistically they have more problems with alcohol, they play moretackle football, and they hit more soccer balls with their heads. In college 70percent of football players and 62 percent of soccer players get at least oneconcussion per year.When it comes to the brain, size matters. The stegosaurus brain was about thesize of a walnut. The adult human brain weighs 1,300 to 1,400 grams. The averagecat brain weighs only about 30 grams. This is why human curiosity helped inventspace travel and cures for cancer, while cat curiosity needs nine lives. Thehighly convoluted folds of gray matter on the outside surface of the brain areknown as the cerebral cortex. The cerebral cortex is about two millimeters thickand has a surface area of about two and a half square feet. This is about thesize of three and a half sheets of 81⁄2-by-11-inch paper.In order to work properly, the brain needs fuel, oxygen, and stimulation. Justlike any other living thing, a brain needs fuel to grow, function, and repairitself. Glucose and oxygen run the engine powered by the brain cells. Unlikeother cells in your body, glucose is the only fuel your brain knows how to use.Anything that impairs glucose delivery to brain cells is life-threatening. Thebrain needs oxygen to produce energy; without it, the energy powerhouses ofneurons called mitochondria would not produce enough energy to keep your brainalive. Because blood delivers glucose and oxygen to the brain, nothing must getin the way of blood flow if the brain is to stay healthy. Unconsciousness willoccur only eight to ten seconds after a loss of blood supply to the brain.In addition to blood flow, the human brain is dependent on proper stimulation togrow and develop in healthy ways throughout childhood and to maintain itsfunctioning into old age. When you stimulate neurons in the right way, you makethem more efficient; they function better, and you are more likely to have anactive, learning brain throughout your life. The best sources of stimulation forthe brain are physical exercise, mental exercise, and social bonding, which wewill discuss in greater detail later on.If, as the New Testament says, the body is the temple of the Holy Spirit,certainly the brain is the inner sanctum."},{"pageContent":"4YOUR BRAIN IS VERY SOFT, HOUSED IN A VERY HARD SKULLINJURIES CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE, AND NO ONE KNOWS ABOUT ITYou may find some of the information in this chapter scary, eye-opening, andmaybe even hard to believe. But both the statistics and my experience say thatit is a critical piece of the brain health puzzle and I cannot sugarcoat orgloss over it.When the brain is alive, pulsating with activity, it is like a delicate,intricate, organized spiderweb suspended in crystal-clear fluid. The consistencyof the brain has been described as being similar to soft butter, custard, tofu,or somewhere between egg whites and Jell-O. Remember, it is 85 percent water.Yet we often think of the brain as firm and rubbery, mostly because the brainsdissected in anatomy labs and the ones shown on TV were fixed in formaldehyde.Your very soft brain is housed in a protective hard, thick skull. When you holda skull in your hand and look inside, you notice that it has many ridges, someas sharp as a knife. Immediately you get the idea that an injury that rattledthe soft butterlike brain could cause serious damage.One of the most important lessons I’ve learned from looking at more than thirtythousand brain scans is that brain injuries, even “mild” ones without a loss ofconsciousness, matter more than most people, including doctors, think. Millionsof people in our society have suffered significant brain injuries, yet no oneknows about it. If you never look at the brain, you miss what many researchershave called the silent epidemic. Two million reported new brain injury casesoccur every year, and millions of others go unnoticed.PRINCIPLE 4: The brain is very soft and is housed in a very hard skull. Braininjuries can change a person’s whole life, and no one knows about it.As a society, we have no respect for the physical fragility of the brain. Weallow children to hit soccer balls with their heads. We allow teenage boys totake their most precious organ, put it in a hard football helmet, and slam itagainst other so-armed teenagers. We allow children to snowboard without helmetsor ride a four-wheel vehicle in the desert, and we buy them their firstmotorcycles. After you read this chapter, my hope is that you will never drivewithout your seatbelt or allow a child to hit a soccer ball with her head.Why are brain injuries so important? Some basic brain facts are in order here.• Your brain is more intricate, delicate, and complicated than any computerthat we can design.• Your brain is very soft, which makes it easily bruised or damaged. When I wasa little boy working in my father’s grocery store, I used to see cow brains forsale in little white cups. The cow brains were so soft that they took on theshape of the cup. Human brains are the same.• Your skull is really hard. Inside your skull there are many ridges, roughareas, and sharp bony edges.• Your brain lives in a closed space. When you experience a blow to the head,there is no place for the brain to go, so it ends up slamming against the walls,ridges, and sharp bony edges in the skull, ripping small blood vessels, causingmultiple minute bleeds and over time many areas of tiny scars.• You do not have to lose consciousness in order to have a significant braininjury. Consciousness is controlled by structures deep in the brain. Asignificant injury may occur to the cortex or outside surface of the brain,sparing the brainstem and therefore causing no loss of consciousness.• Brain injuries tend to be additive. When an injury damages a certain part ofthe brain, not all people have symptoms, because the brain has built-inreserves. For example, one needs to kill 30 percent of the hippocampus (an areaon the inside of the temporal lobes) before memory symptoms occur. Usually theydevelop vulnerabilities. The next brain injury, even if it seems minor, may wipeout the reserve, causing major problems.• Many people forget or do not realize that they have had a serious braininjury. In our clinic we ask people five or six times whether they have had abrain or head injury. You would be amazed at how many people, after repeatedlysaying no to this question, suddenly get an aha look on their face and say, “Whyyes, I fell out of a second-story window at age seven.” Or they suddenlyremember they went through the windshield of a car headfirst, or had aconcussion playing football or soccer, or fell down a flight of stairs.• Not all brain injuries, even serious ones, will cause damage. The brain isbuffered by clear fluid called cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF helps to bufferthe brain against injury. Still, damage can occur more than most people know.One patient stands out in my memory over all others. Mark was atwenty-six-year-old man with Tourette’s syndrome, a disorder that causes bothmotor and vocal tics. About 15 percent of people with TS have coprolalia orcompulsive swearing. Mark was being treated for drug abuse and was in the middleof his hospital program when he was brought to our clinic. The third time Iasked him about a head injury, he started to get irritated at me and swore,“F——— no!”Having seen his scan (Image 4.1), I knew I had to persist. I asked if he’d everplayed sports, a common question that frequently elicits forgotten headinjuries.image [images/Amen_9780307338136_epub_011_r1.jpg]“F——— no!” he replied, more agitated than before.I then asked him if he had ever been in a car accident.“F——— no!” he said once again. As his irritation with me escalated, all of asudden he stopped, got a quizzical look on his face, and said, “Does amotorcycle accident count?”“Tell me about it,” I said.“I was riding my motorcycle around a lake,” he said, now animated andcooperative, “when all of a sudden a baby deer darted out in front of me. Tomiss the deer I spilled the bike on my left side. I wasn’t wearing a helmet andbroke my left jawbone. Do you think that counts as a head injury?”Caught up in the moment and amazed that he hadn’t told me this informationbefore, even though I had asked seven times, I answered, “F——— yes!”A concussion or mild “traumatic brain injury” (TBI) is far more than just a bumpon the head. According to the American Academy of Neurology, “There is no suchthing as a minor concussion.” A study from UCLA found that “the level of brainglucose use in people who suffered mild concussions was similar to that incomatose, severely brain-injured patients . . . Even mild head injuries resultin major changes to the brain’s metabolism and could make victims susceptible tomore serious damage from a repeated blow.” According to lead researcher Dr.Marvin Bergsneider, “We know that just because people are walkie-talkies—becausethey can walk and talk—that that’s not the full story . . . Many people blow off[concussions] as being innocuous. What this study indicates in that clearlyconcussions can be serious.”While often there are no immediate symptoms with a concussion and nothingirregular shows up on the CT scan or the MRI, subtle changes occur. Over aperiod of a few weeks or even months, the individual may become tearful, angry,or irritable; have trouble thinking clearly or concentrating; or suffer fromheadaches, confusion, blurred vision, memory loss, or nausea. Other devastatingsymptoms can occur as if in slow motion. There may be personality changes,temper problems, dark thoughts, and difficulty expressing emotions orunderstanding others. Recovery, according to Dr. David A. Hovda, the director ofthe Brain Injury Research Center at UCLA, depends not only on the severity ofthe blow but also on how many previous concussions a person has suffered. Once aperson has suffered a concussion, he or she is as much as four times more likelyto sustain a second one.Concussions can occur in many different ways. Transportation-related incidentscause the greatest number, 47 percent of all concussions. These includeautomobile accidents, biking accidents, snowboarding, sledding, injuriesoccurring while walking (such as when author Stephen King was hit by a car), orwhile in-line skating or skateboarding. The number of pedestrian and bicyclecollisions with motor vehicles increase among school-age children. Kidsunrestrained or improperly restrained in cars are at risk for traumatic braininjury as well. Inappropriate restraint devices resulted in a 3.5-fold increasedrisk of significant injury and a more than fourfold increased risk ofsignificant head injury for the two-to-five-year-olds. Domestic falls accountfor 27 percent of the traumatic brain injuries among children. More people (ofall ages) die from home falls than from home fires.Older people, who may be unsteady on their feet, are especially prone to falls;one-third of people over sixty-five fall at least once a year. While most mayworry about breaking a hip or suffering other fractures during a fall, traumaticbrain injury should also be of major concern. Individuals with neurologicalproblems such as Parkinson’s disease or a prior stroke, or those suffering fromthe effects of multiple medications or poor eyesight due to cataracts or maculardegeneration, may be most susceptible to falling. Concussions are a frequentoutcome of physical abuse and one often not reported, as the individual involvedmay be reluctant to seek medical aid.The American Academy of Pediatrics has warned that “on repetitive heading ofsoccer balls in young athletes, the bottom line is probably ‘less is better.’ ”Heading drills, in which a child’s head is knocked repeatedly, as happens withforward and defensive players, are of greater concern to pediatricians than isthe occasional head-punt in a game. A pair of studies conducted in Norway and inthe United States compared the mental functioning of large groups of adultsoccer players to adults of similar age and circumstances who did not playsoccer. Out of 106 soccer players in the Norwegian study, 81 percent hadimpairment of attention, concentration, memory, and judgment that ranged frommild to severe. In the U.S. study, attention and concentration deficits weresignificantly more common among those who “headed” the ball most often.When it comes to brain injury, football is no better than soccer. Footballplayers are struck in the head thirty to fifty times per game and regularlyendure blows similar to those experienced in car crashes, according to aVirginia Tech study that fitted players’ helmets with the same kinds of sensorsthat trigger auto airbags.Golf is good. Tennis is terrific. Table tennis is the world’s best sport!Football, boxing, and soccer are bad for the brain! As a society, we need toseriously rethink what we allow our children to do.WHERE IS THE BRAIN VULNERABLE?A number of brain areas are especially vulnerable to injury (see Images 5.1 and5.2). These include:• The prefrontal cortex, at the front of the brain, where judgment,concentration, attention span, impulse control, organization, planning, andexpressive language are centered.• The anterior cingulate gyrus, the brain’s “gear shifter,” which runs deepthrough the front part of the brain, where damage causes people to get stuck onnegative thoughts or behaviors.• The parietal lobes, at the top back part of the brain, coordinate andinterpret sensory information from the opposite side of the body; they alsohandle directions, construction, and advanced mathematics.• The temporal lobes, underneath the temples and behind the eyes, which housememory, receptive language, temper control, and mood stability.• The limbic system, deep within the brain, which can cause problems withdepression, negativity, and libido.• The occipital lobes, at the back of the brain, which can cause problems withvisual processing.Brain injuries can interrupt, delay, or alter social and intellectualdevelopment, sometimes seriously. A number of years ago I wrote a newspaperarticle on brain injuries. The day the article appeared in the paper, I receiveda call from a distraught mother. Four years earlier her sixteen-year-old son hadsustained a brain injury from a bicycle accident. The front tire of his bicyclehit a curb, and he flipped over the handlebars onto the left side of his face.He was unconscious for about thirty minutes. Over the next several months hispersonality changed. He went from being a straight-A student and a sweet youngman to being someone who had no interest in school and was easily angered anddepressed. He also started frequent use of alcohol. Three years later he shotand killed himself. The mother had blamed herself for his downward spiral. Noone had told her that a minor brain injury could ruin her son’s life. My articlehelped her understand the terrible tragedy. I only wish a doctor could havediagnosed her son’s brain trauma sooner so he could have been properly treatedand this senseless tragedy avoided.The good news is that brain injuries can be treated. Medication, therapy, andcognitive retraining have all been found to be helpful. We cannot prevent allinjuries, so early diagnosis and proper treatment is essential. The mostimportant strategy for us as a society is to prevent injuries by respecting thebrain and stopping reckless, stupid behavior.SOME THOUGHTS ON PREVENTION:• Think about your brain before you do activities that might put it at risk.• Kids must wear protective gear while playing football and hockey; do not letthem hit soccer balls with their heads, and encourage them to play noncontactsports.• Always fasten your seatbelt in a car.• Use age-appropriate restraints in the backseat of a car when transportingchildren.• Always wear a helmet when you ride a bike (even as an adult).• Stay off motorcycles.• Walk facing automobile traffic, not with your back toward it.• Use a proper ladder to reach something high up rather than a chair orcountertop.• Never shake a baby or a toddler.• Always fasten the safety belt on a high chair and a changing table.• Use a safety gate to protect toddlers from falling down stairs.Your brain is soft, your skull is hard. After looking at thirty thousand brainscans, I would not let my children hit a soccer ball with their heads, playtackle football, or snowboard without a helmet. I encourage my own kids to playtennis, golf, table tennis, and track. Your brain matters. Respect and protectit."},{"pageContent":"5KNOW AND HEAL THE BRAIN SYSTEMS THAT RUN YOUR LIFEAMEN CLINIC BRAIN SYSTEM QUIZWhatever any man does he first must do in his mind, whose machinery is thebrain. The mind can do only what the brain is equipped to do, and so man mustfind out what kind of brain he has before he can understand his own behavior.—Gay Gaer Luce and Julius Segal, Sleep, 1966To make a good brain great, it is important to have a basic understanding of howthe brain works, including its strengths and weaknesses. This chapter will be apractical hands-on guide to doing just that. One of the basic principles of ourwork is that certain parts of the brain tend to do certain things, and thatproblems in specific areas tend to cause identifiable troubles.PRINCIPLE 5: Certain brain systems are involved in specific behaviors and causeidentifiable problems when they misfire, but these systems can be targeted andtreated.Before I describe some of the main systems involved with behavior, take thefollowing quiz to see where you stand. Not everyone is able to get a brain scan,so I have developed this checklist to help predict areas of strength andweakness. A word of caution is in order. Self-report quizzes have bothadvantages and limitations. They are quick, inexpensive, and easy to score. Onthe other hand, people filling them out may portray themselves in a way theywant to be perceived, resulting in self-report bias. For example, some peopleexaggerate their experience and mark all of the symptoms as frequent, in essencesaying, “I’m glad to have a real problem so that I can get help, be sick, orhave an excuse for the troubles I have.” Others are in total denial. They do notwant to see any personal flaws, and they do not check any symptoms asproblematic, in essence saying, “I’m okay. There’s nothing wrong with me. Leaveme alone.” Not all self-report bias is intentional. People may genuinely havedifficulty recognizing problems and expressing how they feel. Sometimes familymembers or friends are better at evaluating a loved one’s level of functioningthan a person evaluating himself. They may have noticed things that their lovedone hasn’t. No quiz of any sort should ever be used as the only assessment tool.It is simply a catalyst to make you think, ask better questions, and get moreevaluation if needed.Making a Good Brain Great QuizCopyright 2005 Daniel G.

The brain isdivided into four main lobes or regions: frontal (forethought and judgment),temporal (memory and mood stability), parietal (sensory processing and directionsense), and occipital (visual processing) (Image 5.1). There are also importantstructures deep in the brain, such as the anterior cingulate gyrus (gearshifter), basal ganglia (anxiety center), and deep limbic system (emotionalcenter), plus a very important structure at the back bottom part of the braincalled the cerebellum or “little brain” (Image 5.2). A useful generalizationabout how the brain functions is that the back half—the parietal, occipital, andback part of the temporal lobes—takes in and perceives the world, while thefront half integrates this information, analyzes it, decides what to do, thenplans and executes the decision. All of these areas are involved with yoursuccesses and struggles in life.image [images/Amen_9780307338136_epub_012_r1.jpg]image [images/Amen_9780307338136_epub_013_r1.jpg]We’ll look at the functions of six brain systems involved with work, loving, andlearning, including the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, deep limbicsystem, basal ganglia, temporal lobes, and the cerebellum. I’ll briefly discussthe problems associated with each area and offer some strategies to help themheal. Never forget that with each brain system, balanced function is key.FRONTAL AND PREFRONTAL CORTEXThe frontal lobes (the front half of the brain) are divided into three areas:the motor cortex, which controls the body’s motor movements (such as walking,chewing, and moving fingers and toes); the premotor area, which is involved inplanning motor movements; and the prefrontal cortex, which is involved withexecutive functions such as planning, forethought, judgment, organizing, impulsecontrol, and expressing what is on your mind.The PFC is the most evolved part of the human brain, representing 30 percent ofthe entire cortex. In the chimpanzee, our closest primate cousin, the PFCoccupies only 11 percent; a dog’s PFC is only 7 percent; and a cat’s PFC, only3.5 percent. This concept fits my cat Annabelle, who has no forethought orjudgment. She lives totally in the moment and will drink out of the toilet, nomatter how many times she has been told no. The prefrontal cortex houses ourability to learn from mistakes, make plans, and match our behavior over time toreach our goals. When the PFC works as it should, we are thoughtful, empathic,expressive, organized, and goal-oriented. The PFC is often called the executivepart of the brain, like the boss at work. When it is low in activity, it is asif the boss is gone, so there is little to no supervision and nothing gets done.When the PFC works too hard, it is as if the boss is micromanaging everyone, andpeople are left with anxiety and worry. I call the PFC the Jiminy Cricket partof the brain. It houses our conscience and our ability to stay on track towardour goals. It is the part of the brain that, as Jiminy Cricket says in the moviePinocchio, “is the still small voice that helps you decide between right andwrong.”Problems with the PFC result in a “Jiminy Cricket Deficiency Syndrome”: adiminished conscience, poor judgment, impulsivity, short attention span,disorganization, trouble learning from experience, confusion, poor timemanagement, and lack of empathy. Low activity in this part of the brain is oftendue to a deficiency in the neurotransmitter dopamine; increasing it throughsupplements or medications is often helpful. Here is a quick summary of the PFC.Healthy activity in the PFC is associated with conscientiousness; abnormal PFCactivity is associated with inconsistency and troubled decisions. Research hasestablished this principle as a predictor of longevity. In reviewing 194 studiesDrs. T. Boggs and B. W. Roberts from the department of psychology at theUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign found that increased death rates wereassociated with impulsive behaviors (a lack of conscientiousness)—tobacco use,diet and activity patterns, excessive alcohol use, violence, risky sexualbehavior, risky driving, suicide, and drug use. You need a good PFC to live longand be happy!PREFRONTAL CORTEX SUMMARY (THE BOSS IN YOUR HEAD, SUPERVISING YOUR LIFE)PFC Functions (supervision)Low PFC Problems (lack of supervision)FocusShort attention spanForethoughtLacks clear goals or forward thinkingImpulse ControlImpulsivityOrganizationDisorganizationPlanning, goal-settingProcrastinationJudgmentPoor judgmentEmpathyLack of empathyEmotional controlFails to give close attention to detailInsightLack of insightLearning from mistakesTrouble learning from mistakesLoses thingsEasily distractedDiagnostic Problems Associated with Low PFC ActivityADHDSome types of depressionBrain traumaDementia, associated with bad judgmentSchizophreniaAntisocial personalityConduct disordersDiagnostic Problems Associated with High PFC ActivityOverfocused, rigid, and inflexible problems (same as for the anterior cingulate gyrus, page 40)Ways to Balance Low PFCOrganizational help, coachingIntense aerobic exercise (boosts blood flow)Goal-setting/planning exercisesNeurofeedbackRelationship counselingStimulating or exciting activitiesHigher-protein dietDevelop a deep sense of personal meaningStimulating Supplements, to boost dopamine to the brain, such as L-tyrosine orSAMeStimulating Medications (if appropriate), such as Adderall, Dexedrine, Ritalin,Wellbutrin, Strattera, or Provigil. We generally do not give stimulants topeople with schizophrenia. Obviously, any medication recommendations must bediscussed with your doctor. These are just general suggestions.ANTERIOR CINGULATE GYRUS (ACG)The ACG helps you feel settled, relaxed, and flexible. It runs lengthwisethrough the deep parts of the frontal lobes and is the brain’s major switchingstation. I think of it as the brain’s gear shifter, greasing our behavior andallowing us to be flexible and adaptable and to change as change is needed. Thispart of the brain is involved in helping shift attention from thing to thing,moving from idea to idea, and seeing the options in your life. The term thatbest relates to the ACG is cognitive flexibility. When there is too muchactivity in the ACG, usually due to lower serotonin levels, people are unable toshift their attention and become rigid, cognitively inflexible, overfocused,anxious, and oppositional. This part of the brain influences not only shiftingattention but cooperation. When the ACG works in an effective manner, it is easyto shift into cooperative modes of behavior. When it works too hard, people havedifficulty shifting attention and get stuck in ineffective behavior patterns,where they may be uncooperative or difficult, stuck in their own mind-set.The ACG has also been implicated in “future-oriented thinking,” such as planningand goal-setting. When it works well, people are able to plan their future in areasonable way. When it is underactive, people have little motivation orget-up-and-go. Damage to this part of the brain causes a condition calledakinetic mutism, where people have low movement (akinetic) and little speech(mutism). When the ACG works too hard, people plan too much, worry too muchabout the future, and become too serious or obsessed. Difficulties in the ACGcan cause a person to constantly expect negative events and feel very unsafe inthe world. When the ACG is overactive, people have a tendency to get stuck orlocked into negative thoughts or behaviors. They may become obsessive worriersor hold on to hurts or grudges from the past. They may also get stuck onnegative behaviors or develop compulsions such as hand-washing or excessivelychecking locks. One patient who had ACG problems described the phenomenon as“like being on a rat’s exercise wheel, where the thoughts just go over and overand over.” Another patient told me, “It’s like having a reset button in yourhead that is always on. Even though I don’t want to have the thought anymore, itjust keeps coming back.”The problems associated with excessive ACG activity include obsessive-compulsivedisorder, eating disorders, addictive disorders, and oppositional defiantdisorder. All of these disorders are associated with problems shiftingattention. There are also a number of subclinical patterns associated withabnormalities in this part of the brain. The term subclinical relates to problemtraits that do not reach the same level of intensity as a disorder but stillcause difficulties in a person’s life. Examples of these problems includeworrying, holding on to hurts from the past, cognitive inflexibility,automatically saying no, and being rigid. High activity in the ACG is often dueto a deficiency in the neurotransmitter serotonin, and increasing it throughsupplements or medications is often helpful. See page 40 for a quick summary ofthe ACG.ANTERIOR CINGULATE GYRUS (ACG) SUMMARY (THE BRAIN’S GEAR SHIFTER)ACG FunctionsExcessive ACG Activity ProblemsBrain’s gear shifterGets stuck on negative thoughts or behaviorsCognitive flexibilityWorriesCooperationHolds grudgesGo from idea to ideaObsessions/compulsionsSee optionsInflexible, may appear selfishGo with the flowOppositional/argumentative Upset when things do not go your way Upset when things are out of place Intense dislike for change Tend to say no without thinkingDiagnostic Problems Associated with Excessive ACG ActivityObsessive compulsive disorderAddictionsEating disordersPremenstrual tension syndrome, some typesChronic pain (stuck on pain)Post-traumatic stress disorderOppositional defiant disorderDifficult temperament (need to have one’s own way)Tourette’s syndromeDiagnostic Problems Associated with Low ACG ActivityLowered motivation, little spontaneous movement or speech(same as for the prefrontal cortex, page 38)Ways to Calm Excessive ACG ActivityNeurofeedbackIntense aerobic exerciseRelationship counseling, anger managementLower protein/complex-carb dietACG Supplements, to boost serotonin to the brain, such as 5-HTP, St. John’swort, or inositolACG Medications (if appropriate), SSRIs (Paxil, Zoloft, Celexa, Prozac, Luvox);Effexor; atypical antipsychotics in refractory cases, such as Risperdal,Zyprexa, or GeodonDEEP LIMBIC SYSTEM (DLS)The DLS lies near the center of the brain. About the size of a walnut, this partof the brain is involved in setting a person’s emotional tone. When the DLS isless active, the person has generally a positive, more hopeful state of mind.When it is heated up or overactive, negativity can take over. Due to thisemotional shading, the DLS provides the filter through which you interpret theevents of the day; it tags or colors events, depending on your emotional stateof mind. The DLS, including structures called the hippocampus and amygdala, havealso been reported to store highly charged emotional memories, both positive andnegative. The total experience of our emotional memories is responsible, inpart, for our emotional tone. Stable, positive experiences enhance how we feel.Trauma and negative experiences set our brain in a negative way.The DLS also affects motivation and drive. It helps get you going in themorning, and it encourages you to move throughout the day. Overactivity in thisarea is associated with lowered motivation and drive, which is often seen indepression. The DLS controls the sleep and appetite cycles of the body and isintimately involved with bonding and social connectedness. This capacity to bondplays a significant role in the tone and quality of our moods. The DLS alsodirectly processes the sense of smell. Because your sense of smell goes directlyto the deep limbic system, it is easy to see why smells can have such a powerfulimpact on our feeling states.Problems in the DLS are associated with depression, negativity, and lowmotivation, libido, and energy. Because sufferers feel hopeless about theoutcome, they have little willpower to follow through with a task. Since thesleep and appetite centers are in the DLS, disruption can lead to changes inhabits, which may mean an inclination to too much or too little of either. Forexample, in typical depressive episodes people have been known to lose theirappetites and to have trouble sleeping despite being chronically tired. Highactivity in the DLS may be due to deficiencies in the neurotransmittersnorepinephrine, dopamine, or serotonin; increasing these chemicals throughsupplements or medications may be helpful. See page 42 for a quick summary ofthe DLS.DEEP LIMBIC SYSTEM (DLS) SUMMARY (THE MOOD AND BONDING CENTER)DLS FunctionsExcessive DLS Activity ProblemsMood controlDepression, sadnessCharged memoriesFocused on the negative, irritabilityModulates motivationLow motivation and energySets emotional toneNegativity, blame, guiltAppetite/sleep cyclesPoor sleep and appetiteBondingSocial disconnections/isolationSense of smellLow self-esteemLibidoLow libidoFlight-or-fight responseHopelessness Decreased interest in things that are usually fun Feelings of worthlessness or helplessness Feeling dissatisfied or bored Crying spellsDiagnostic Problems Associated with Excessive DLS ActivityDepressionCyclic mood disordersPain syndromesDiagnostic Problems Associated with Low DLS ActivityLowered motivation, decreased reactiveness, misread incoming informationWays to Balance High DLS ActivityBiofeedback, increase left PFC activity (helps connections to DLS)Intense aerobic exerciseRelationship counselingCognitive-behavioral strategies to deal with automatic negative thoughtsBalanced diet, such as described by Barry Sears in The ZoneDLS Supplements, such as DL phenylalanine, SAMe, L-tyrosineDLS Medications (if appropriate), antidepressants such as Wellbutrin(buproprion), Effexor (venlafaxine), Norpramin (desipramine), Tofranil(imipramine), SSRIs (if ACG also present); anticonvulsants/lithium for focalincreased activity or cyclic mood changesBASAL GANGLIA (BG)The basal ganglia are a set of large structures toward the center of the brainthat surround the deep limbic system. The BG are involved with integratingfeelings, thoughts, and movements, which is why you jump when you get excited orfreeze when you are scared. The BG help to shift and smooth motor behavior. Whentheir activity is low, as in Parkinson’s disease, people can develop tremors andproblems with movement (writing, walking, jumping, etc.). In our clinic we havenoticed that the BG are involved with setting the body’s idle or anxiety level.When the BG work too hard, people tend to struggle with anxiety and physicalstress symptoms, such as headaches, intestinal problems, and muscle tension.High BG activity is also associated with conflict-avoidant behavior. Anythingthat reminds them of a worry (such as confronting an employee who is not doing agood job) produces anxiety, and high BG people tend to avoid it, because itmakes them feel uncomfortable. People with high BG activity also have troublerelaxing and tend to overwork. When the BG are low in activity, people tend tohave problems with motivation, attention, and moving their lives forward. Inaddition, the BG are involved with feelings of pleasure and ecstasy. Cocaineworks in this part of the brain. High activity in the BG is often due to adeficiency in the neurotransmitter GABA; increasing it through supplements ormedications is often helpful. See page 44 for a quick summary of the BG.BASAL GANGLIA (BG) SUMMARY (THE ANXIETY CENTER)BG FunctionsExcessive BG Activity ProblemsIntegrates feelings, thoughts,Sets anxiety levels and movementsAnxiety/panicSets body’s idleHypervigilanceSmooths movementMuscle tensionModulates motivationConflict avoidanceMediates pleasurePredicts the worst Excessive fear of being judged by others Tendency to freeze in anxiety situations Seems shy or timid Bites fingernails or picks skin Excessive motivation, can’t stop workingDiagnostic Problems Associated with Excessive BG ActivityAnxiety disordersWorkaholismPhysical stress symptoms (headaches, stomachaches)InsecurityDiagnostic Problems Associated with Low BG ActivityMovement disordersLow motivationWays to Calm High BG ActivityBody biofeedbackCognitive therapy to kill the bad thoughtsHypnosis, meditationRelaxation trainingRelaxing musicAssertiveness trainingLimit caffeine/alcoholBG Supplements, such as GABA or valerian rootBG Medications (if appropriate), antianxiety meds such as benzodiazepines (lowdose, short time), BuSpar, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, blood pressure medssuch as propranololTEMPORAL LOBESThe temporal lobes, underneath your temples and behind your eyes, are involvedwith language (hearing and reading), reading social cues, short-term memory,getting memories into long-term storage, processing music, tone of voice, andmood stability. They also help with recognizing objects by sight and namingthem. It is called the What Pathway in the brain, as it is involved withrecognizing and naming objects and faces. In addition, the temporal lobes,especially on the right side, have been implicated in spiritual experience andinsight. Experiments that stimulate the right temporal lobe have demonstratedincreased religious or spiritual experiences, such as feeling God’s presence.The hippocampus, situated on the inside aspect of the temporal lobes, encodesnew information and stores it for up to several weeks. When the hippocampus isdamaged, you can neither store new experiences nor retrieve experiences learnedwithin the past several weeks. The hippocampus is one of the first areas damagedby Alzheimer’s disease.In front of the hippocampus on the inside of the temporal lobe is analmond-shaped structure called the amygdala. The amygdala coordinates youremotional responses. Strong emotions can improve the encoding process ofhippocampal neurons and make it easier to retrieve the experience. This isuseful because it allows you to more easily remember events that were“emotionally stimulating,” such as being mugged, having good sex, or recalling afascinating fact you recently heard. I remember a taxi ride last year fromManhattan to JFK Airport like it was yesterday. I even remember the cab number,4118. A year later. The cab driver had very irritating music on, talked loudlyon his cell phone, paid little attention to the road, and nearly got us into twoaccidents. My emotional response to this terrible ride got his cab number stuckin my head. By emphasizing the memory of certain experiences over others, theamygdala allows you to respond more appropriately and quickly in thefuture—being able to recognize a potential mugger or dangerous cab driver aheadof time may save your life. When the amygdala functions appropriately, we tendto react to the world in a logical, thoughtful way. When it is overactive, ourresponses may be exaggerated for the situation. When the amygdala isunderactive, we fail to read situations accurately, and our response may notmatch what has happened. For example, if you laugh upon hearing from your wifethat her best friend died, your amygdala may not be working properly.Trouble in the temporal lobes leads to both short- and long-term memoryproblems, reading difficulties, trouble finding the right words in conversation,trouble reading social cues, mood instability, and sometimes religious or moralpreoccupation or perhaps a lack of spiritual sensitivity. The temporal lobes,especially on the left side, have been associated with temper problems. Abnormal(high or low) activity in this part of the brain is often due to a deficiency inthe neurotransmitter GABA, and balancing it through supplements or medicationsis often helpful.

Even though it represents only 10 percent of the brain’s volume, ithouses 50 percent of the brain’s neurons. It has long been known that thecerebellum is involved with motor coordination, posture, and how we walk. Onlyrecently has it become clear that the cerebellum is also involved withprocessing speed, like clock speed on a computer, which may be the reason it hasso many neurons. It is also involved with thought coordination, or how quicklyyou can make cognitive and emotional adjustments. The cerebellum helps youquickly make physical adjustments, such as while you are playing a sport, and ithelps you make emotional adjustments in stressful or novel situations. Whenthere are problems in the cerebellum, people tend not only to struggle withphysical coordination but also to get confused easily. Our research has foundthat low cerebellar activity is also associated with poor handwriting(coordination), problems maintaining an organized work area, being sensitive tolight, noise, touch, or clothing (such as tags), and being clumsy oraccident-prone. The cerebellum has been found to be low in activity in peoplewith autism, attention deficit disorders, and learning disabilities.Given that the cerebellum is the major coordination center in the brain,coordination exercises, such as sports and music, are some of the majorstrategies to keep the brain tuned to work at its best. At this point there isuncertainty about the neurotransmitter deficiency in this part of the brain, sowe do not know what supplements or medications may be helpful.

Because it isa symptom, it is too broad, and it has far too many causes to be considered adiagnosis or a single entity. What can cause chest pain? Many problems, such asgrief, panic attacks, hyperthyroidism, pneumonia, lung cancer, toxic exposure, aheart attack, abnormal heart rhythm, heart infection, rib injuries, indigestion,gastric reflux esophagitis, gallbladder stones, liver disease, kidney disease,and pancreatic cancer. Chest pain has many different possible causes and manypossible treatments.In the same way, what can cause depression? Again, many different problems, suchas grief, loss, chronic stress, a brain injury, stroke, toxic exposure,substance abuse, hypothyroidism, post-pneumonia or heart attack depressionsyndrome, anemia, cancer treatments, liver disease, kidney disease, andpancreatic cancer. Depression can be caused by low activity in the brain or byoverall increased activity. It can be caused by increased anterior cingulatehyperactivity (the worried sort of depression), or by increased deep limbicactivity (the sad, hopeless kind of depression), or by a combination of theseplus still other problems. There are many different types of depression.How does chest pain relate to ADD, anxiety, or depression? All of these problemsare symptom clusters, not causes. Many physicians and patients view these commonproblems as single or simple disorders, and they often have the idea that onetreatment fits everyone with a certain disorder. So if you get a diagnosis ofADD, you are likely to be prescribed a stimulant medication, such as Ritalin orAdderall; if you get a diagnosis of anxiety, you are likely to be prescribed anantianxiety medication such as Xanax; if you get a diagnosis of depression, yourdoctor is likely to prescribe an antidepressant such as Prozac or Lexapro.This simplistic approach to psychiatric diagnosis and treatment is a majorreason that most psychiatric medications are controversial. People rarely getemotional over stomach medications, or medicines for diabetes, cancer, heartproblems, or itching. But mention Ritalin or Prozac at a party, and nearlyeveryone has an opinion on whether it is good, bad, overprescribed, or the causeof the loss of the soul in America. This wide variety of responses and opinionsis the direct result of the extreme ranges of success and failure credited topsychiatric medications.PRINCIPLE 6: Most problems (such as ADD, anxiety, and depression) are not singleor simple disorders. One size does not fit everyone; people need anindividualized approach to optimizing their brain and their life.Principle 6 confuses some of our critics and infuriates others, but in ourexperience with thousands of patients, it is absolutely true. If you treat allpatients with the same group of symptoms the same way, you will make some peoplebetter and a lot of people worse. In our experience, attention deficit disorderis not one illness but rather at least six different sets of problems, and ifdoctors immediately turn to stimulant medications for everyone who has ADD, theymake four of the six types worse. Anxiety and depression are not separatehomogeneous problems, but rather a combination of overlapping issues with atleast seven different subtypes. While Prozac-like medications may work perfectlyfor some, giving all people with depression the same type of drug invitestreatment failures and in some cases may cause suicide or homicide attempts.There are many different types and causes of schizophrenia, autism, and bipolardisorder. Likewise, all alcoholics are not the same, and one treatment does notwork for every alcoholic. Most people who suffer from emotional or behaviorproblems do not neatly fit into discrete categories. Each person needs anindividualized treatment plan based on the problems in his or her own specificbrain. This is one of the bedrock principles of our work.Doctors should be treating not symptoms, but rather the underlying brainproblems that are causing the difficulties. When a doctor gives a patient adiagnosis of ADD, anxiety, or depression, it is like giving someone a diagnosisof chest pain. It does not honor the underlying diversity of brain issues inthese problems and leads to oversimplified treatments, making many people worseand adding to the negative debate about psychiatric treatments.The idea that “one treatment fits everyone” just doesn’t fit clinicalexperience. How did it evolve? Many professionals put entirely too much stock ina document called the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). With thepublication of the DSM by the American Psychiatric Association in the 1950s,psychiatrists began a process of describing discrete psychiatric syndromes, suchas schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, and obsessive-compulsivedisorder. The manual, and its four subsequent revisions, attempted to bringstandardization to psychiatric diagnoses so that researchers and clinicianswould have a common language to study these problems. At the time it was a giantstep forward from the jumbled way that psychiatric patients had previously beendescribed.The DSM was never meant to be the last word, but a continual work in progress.Unfortunately, it has now become a larger-than-life document that is oftenreferred to as the bible of psychiatry. The DSM is used in court, by insurancecompanies, in teaching programs, by doctors making diagnoses, and by imagingresearchers. The fatal flaw in the DSM is that on the surface it describes manypsychiatric illnesses, such as depression and ADD, as homogeneous disorders. Ifyou meet six out of nine criteria for major depression, then you have majordepression and should be treated with an antidepressant. If you meet six out ofnine criteria for inattention and six out of nine criteria for hyperactivity orimpulsivity, then you have ADD and should be treated with a stimulantmedication. Applying these medications, unfortunately, makes many patientsworse.Compounding the problem is the fact that 85 percent of psychiatric medicationsare prescribed by nonpsychiatric physicians. They are prescribed bypediatricians, family practice doctors, internists, cardiologists, orthopedists,and gynecologists. The lack of in-depth training among these physicians leads toan overly simplistic approach to diagnosis and treatment, ultimately wreakinghavoc in many people’s lives.In 2004 I was a guest on the Ricki Lake Show. The subject of the show was thecontroversy about using psychiatric medications in children. The show’s producerhad read my book Healing ADD, and told me I would be a voice of reason. When Iarrived at the studio, I got the feeling that something was wrong. Theyseparated all of the guests in different dressing rooms so that we wouldn’t talkto one another ahead of time. Why the secrecy? I wondered. They didn’t tell methey had brought in another doctor who was totally against ever using medicationin children. They were setting up conflict and tension, a common element in theshow. As I watched the program unfold, my discomfort grew. They had severalguests who had been helped by medication, but many more who had been hurt by it.It seemed that Ricki and the audience were becoming ever more frenzied againstthe use of psychiatric medicine in children, as if it were a political issuerather than a medical issue.Then in the segment before I was to come on, a couple appeared onstage bythemselves. They were the parents of a ten-year-old girl who had been diagnosedwith ADD. She had minor learning problems in school; a teacher had thought shemight have attentional problems and recommended an evaluation. The doctor whosaw her agreed she had problems and put the little girl on three differentantidepressants. The last one was called desipramine, the use of which had beenconsidered controversial in children since 1991 because of four reported deathsin children taking it. Most child psychiatrists, myself included, had stoppedusing it for children over a decade ago. When I heard desipramine mentioned on ashow that was clearly hostile to medicine, I knew that the medicine had killedthe little girl. It was gut-wrenching to watch the parents tearfully describehow the doctor kept raising the dose, until one day the child started to haveseizures and then died in the mother’s arms. If I was supposed to be the voiceof reason, what words could I possibly say to bring understanding and healing totraumatized parents and a tearful, angry audience shocked with disbelief? Noneseemed reasonable.Then I found myself on the stage, with a family doctor who was opposed tomedication, the parents of the deceased girl, and a hostile audience. As is mytendency in these situations, I prayed for wisdom. I started by saying thatmedicine is not the enemy, that it helps millions of people. The wrong medicineis the enemy. Using a “one treatment fits everyone” approach can cause seriousproblems. I said I was deeply sorry and disturbed by the loss of the littlegirl, especially when there were safer alternatives. The audience seemed tosettle down, but in a blur the show was over, and I was taken off to JFK Airportfor the trip home. When will we learn, I wondered, that people are different andneed individualized treatment programs, based on what is happening in their ownbrains? When will we learn to use the safest alternatives before going tostronger and riskier ones?The Amen Clinics use a brain system approach for diagnosing and treatingproblems. We believe that problems such as ADD, anxiety, and depression areoverall categories and that effective treatment takes into account individualvariations within each type. For example, patients with ADD have common symptomsthat usually relate to the prefrontal cortex, such as short attention span,distractibility, disorganization, procrastination, and poor internalsupervision. To treat ADD properly, it is critical to understand the complexityof ADD and the brain systems underlying each of its six subtypes. In addition,we know that there are many ways, in addition to medicine, to help balance thebrain. It is our job to inform people about what they have and give themdifferent treatment options so they can decide what is best for them. You cansee my books Healing ADD and Healing Anxiety and Depression (written withpsychiatrist Lisa Routh) to get a detailed explanation of the subtypes of thesedisorders.One treatment does not fit everyone. We are all different and have differentneeds. Individualizing interventions for you and for your specific brain isimportant to making a good brain great! Here is a brief example of the power ofthis principle. The following letter, written by the father of one of mypatients, is addressed to some parents who were considering bringing their childto one of our clinics (Images 6.1 and 6.2).Dear D,Just to give you a sense of “comfort” here . . . this is our story. Mytwelve-year-old had very serious behavioral issues . . . uncontrollable fits,etc., etc. She was more work than our other four kids put together . . . and hadher mother and me climbing the walls as well as losing our tempers. Ourpediatrician diagnosed ADD . . . and prescribed certain drugs that just madethings worse. We went to Dr. Amen after a recommendation by a close friend, whois a superior court judge. After Dr. Amen’s diagnosis (ring of fire) he was ableto take my daughter off the drugs and on to vitamins . . . The change inbehavior has been no less than a miracle . . . e.g., my daughter no longer getsSTUCK and in a rage at her mother or myself.Our pediatrician, who also recommended Dr. Amen, told us that he was about fiveyears ahead of his time. This process certainly helped her mother and Iunderstand (and appreciate) our daughter. We had come to the point (and eventhreatened several times) of sending her to a boarding school. She was having amajor negative impact (with language) on our four-year-old and tormenting ourthree teenagers constantly. It was making our home unlivable.D, our daughter is now my most charismatic, enjoyable, and entrepreneurial kid .. . a TRUE JEWEL. She will break all the boundaries. But now we know how or haveanother tool to help discipline her gifts . . . a good part being propernutrition.Sincerely,C."},{"pageContent":"7HOW DO YOU KNOW UNLESS YOU LOOK?NEW KNOWLEDGE FROM IMAGING“The brain science of my time is not up to the task of explaining patients’symptoms.”—Sigmund Freud, “The Project for a Scientific Psychology” (1895)“Brain imaging . . . is the future of psychiatry.”—Steven Hyman, Scientific American (2003)“He who joyfully marches to music in rank and file has already earned mycontempt. He has been given a large brain by mistake, since for him the spinalcord would fully suffice.”—Albert EinsteinIn the late 1800s neurologist Sigmund Freud became obsessed with constructing amodel of the mind based on brain science. At a pivotal time in his career, in1885, he studied with one of the founding fathers of neurology, Jean-MartinCharcot, at the Sâlpetrière Hospital in Paris. Charcot, the world’s firstneuropsychiatrist, understood that the mind and brain work together and usedhypnosis to treat patients with hysterical symptoms. After spending severalmonths with Charcot and then treating patients in his own practice in Vienna,Freud came to believe, as his mentor had done, that hidden mental processesexert powerful effects on the conscious mind and physical brain. He postulatedthat hysteria (physical symptoms without a clear physical cause, such ashysterical blindness), and problems like it, resulted not from faking illnessbut rather from subtle changes in the brain. Try as he did to prove thisconnection, Freud remained frustrated that he lacked the tools to visualize andunderstand emotional problems and the brain. In 1895 in “The Project for aScientific Psychology,” Freud finally seemed to give up his quest when he wrote,“The brain science of my time is not up to the task of explaining patients’symptoms.” Freud went on to develop psychoanalysis, which used language,emotion, relationships—and not the brain—in the healing process. He knew thatone day neuroscience and psychology would be back together. His ideas were justtoo early to become a reality.Over 110 years ago Freud was on to something important, but he did not have thetools to see the connection between the mind and the brain. A great deal ofwonderful scientific work has been done since that time. Finally, we are now onthe verge of fusing neuroscience and psychology. But today as in Freud’s time,new ideas take time to be accepted.One of the tools that have been seminal in bringing about Freud’s dream is theuse of functional brain imaging to understand thoughts, feelings, and behavior.With the newer imaging modalities, we can actually see what is happening in thebrain while people are dreaming, thinking, obsessing, gambling, focusing,drinking alcohol or using drugs, fantasizing, and feeling sad or mad. At theAmen Clinics we have scanned young children with autism and drug exposure;children with ADD and learning disabilities; bipolar teenagers and adults;suicidal and homicidal patients; marital couples in trouble; drug, sex, andgambling addicts; pedophiles and arsonists; and almost any thought, feeling, orbehavioral problem you can imagine. Twenty-eight thousand scans later, we agreewith Freud: there is a huge connection between the mind and the brain. But howwould you know unless you looked?We use imaging technology to help us make difficult brains better and goodbrains great, because it allows us to obtain a baseline to evaluate brainhealth. Like whole-body scans, fast coronary artery CT scans, and fractionatedcholesterol levels, brain imaging is now at the point where we can specificallysee how the brain works and make targeted interventions to help it. We can seewho needs help and who doesn’t. Imaging allows us to see if your brain isworking too hard in certain areas or not hard enough. It allows us to visualizeif your brain has been hurt, traumatized, or exposed to toxic chemicals. Itallows us to give people targeted help and then do follow-up scans to see if weare making the progress we want.One of the most gratifying compliments that I have received in my career camewhen the chairman of the department of psychiatry at the University ofCalifornia, Irvine, introduced me at a faculty retreat saying, “If Freud werealive today, he would be doing the imaging work that Dan is doing at hisclinics.”PRINCIPLE 7: Imaging the brain is essential to knowing how to help it. Imaginghelps physicians be more effective, increases patient compliance, and decreasesstigma. Imaging helps give direction on how to make a good brain great!Why are psychiatrists the only medical specialists who never look at the organthey treat? For the past fifteen years I have encouraged psychiatrists to availthemselves of this new technology. Freud would have used it. Why not the modernpsychiatrist? Unfortunately, the odds are that even if a patient has a seriousproblem with feelings (depression), thoughts (intrusive frightening ones), orbehavior (aggressive or self-destructive), the treating physician will still notorder a brain scan as part of the evaluation process. You can try to killyourself in most cities of the world, and virtually no psychiatrist will look atyour brain. You can kill seven people, and most prosecutors will try to keepbrain-imaging science out of court. Doctors prescribe psychotherapy or powerfulcombinations of medications without ever looking at how an individual patient’sbrain works. When it comes to behavior, learning, and emotional problems,doctors prescribe treatments in the dark. The lack of brain imaging, in myopinion, has kept psychiatry lagging behind medicine’s other specialties,decreasing its effectiveness with patients, and reinforcing the stigma thatsurrounds people who struggle with mood, learning, or behavior problems. It istime to work toward using imaging on a daily basis to look at people whostruggle, and also at people who want to be better than they are.Can you imagine the outcry that would erupt if other medical specialties actedwithout looking? If orthopedic doctors set broken bones without X-rays? Ifcardiologists diagnosed coronary artery blockages without doing angiograms orfast CT scans? Or if internists diagnosed pneumonia without ordering chestX-rays or doing sputum cultures? Yet the state of the art in psychiatry, even atthe end of the first decade of the twenty-first century, is to refuse to look atthe organ it treats. We diagnose and treat patients based upon symptom clusters,not upon underling brain dysfunction.I am trained as a psychiatrist with psychoanalytic roots. I also have aspecialty in children, teenagers, families, and brain imaging. In the early1970s, before college, medical school, and my psychiatric training at the WalterReed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C., I was an infantry medic for theU.S. Army’s Third Armored Division, stationed near Frankfurt, Germany. Myspecialty was as an X-ray technician. I spent most of my days taking pictures ofbody parts. Among other things, I took pictures of bones, lungs, abdomens,kidneys, and skulls. When I entered medical school in 1978, I was used tolooking at troubled organs and using imaging in many different parts ofmedicine, including preventive medicine, with procedures such as chest X-raysand mammograms.One of the most influential experiences in my professional life came when I wasa third-year medical student. I was doing a pediatric rotation at St. John’sHospital in Tulsa, Oklahoma, when I met a baby boy and his worried mother. Lukewas ten weeks old when his mother brought him to the hospital because heappeared to be floppy. He had little muscle tone and could not hold his head up,which was not normal at that age. The neurologist who examined the baby while Ilooked on was certain that Luke had been exposed to raw honey containing acertain toxic material called botulinin. The doctor said we just had to waitthings out and the baby would be okay. I asked the doctor why he wouldn’t ordera brain scan to rule out other problems, such as a brain tumor, which was apotential cause of floppy baby syndrome. The neurologist became very irritatedwith me and said he was going to teach me not to order too many tests and wastemoney. Clinical history, he said, is the most important part of the examination.The whole incident made me very uncomfortable. How did he know without looking?I wondered. The baby continued to get worse. The neurologist dug in his heels.Finally one night on call I was urgently paged to the baby’s room. It was clearthat Luke had just had a stroke. He was paralyzed on one side and appeared to beblind. When we took him to X-ray, his brain scan revealed that he had a braintumor that had just caused a stroke in the back part of his brain, resulting inpermanent blindness. Luke’s mother was devastated. I was sad and furious beyondwords. How can you know unless you look?This experience, along with many others, inspired me to become deeply involvedin brain-imaging technology. There are so many different causes of behavior,learning, and emotional problems that I think it is unconscionable forphysicians not to look at the brain, the organ of behavior, learning, andemotion.Many people ask me why psychiatrists don’t look at brain function. Frankly, thereal answer is beyond my comprehension. I can’t fathom why psychiatristswouldn’t want more information that helps them ask better questions and makebetter decisions for patients. Nonetheless, here are some potential candidatereasons.• Doctors do not do what they are not trained to do. Imaging is usually not apart of psychiatric training programs. UC Irvine is one of the only places inthe world where psychiatric residents get an in-depth education in using imagingfor mental health problems.• Imaging is not a part of psychiatric tradition. (We haven’t done it in thepast.)• Most psychiatrists do not know how to look at brain scans, even when they aredone, and do not know what they mean.• Most psychiatrists do not know what to do with the information from brainscans.• There is a perception among psychiatrists that in our age of managed care itis hard to get brain-imaging studies approved by insurance companies.• Most psychiatrists still believe that brain-imaging tools are experimental.It is time for psychiatrists to shed these mistaken beliefs and learn aboutimaging. The brain is the organ of behavior, and imaging technology can behelpful and vital to people today. As Steven Hyman, former president of HarvardUniversity, wrote in Scientific American magazine in 2003, brain imaging andgenetics are part of the future of psychiatry. I have argued for fifteen yearsthat the future is now. Harold Bursztajn, director of Harvard’s Psychiatry andthe Law program, says that brain imaging helps physicians ask better questions.The next generation of mental health professionals is in for a wild ride, asneuroscience and psychology come back together.The Society of Nuclear Medicine, one of the professional groups that overseefunctional brain imaging, advises that there are four standard reasons to orderbrain SPECT studies: to evaluate suspected brain trauma, to evaluate patientswith suspected dementia or cognitive decline, to evaluate seizure activitybefore surgery to help decide where to operate, and to detect and evaluateblood-vessel disease in the brain. The society’s guidelines also say that manyadditional indications appear promising. At the Amen Clinics, because of ourexperience, we have added these further reasons to get a scan: to evaluateviolence, suicidal behavior, substance abuse, subtyping ADD, anxiety anddepression, and complex or resistant psychiatric problems, and to evaluate brainhealth for determining appropriate prevention strategies.Imaging is a critical component of brain health and part of the future ofpsychiatry. Shortly after my book Healing the Hardware of the Soul hitbookstores in 2002, I received a very kind letter from a psychiatrist inBerkeley, who wrote,“All truth goes through three stages.First, it is ridiculed,Second, it is vehemently denied, andThird, it is accepted as self-evident.”Routine brain imaging is currently between steps two and three—some passionatelydeny its usefulness, while others are ordering studies. More than a thousandphysicians and mental health professionals have sent patients for scans. In thenext decade, imaging will become a routine part of what we do. In the Appendixyou will find a more thorough discussion of brain SPECT imaging, when and why toorder a scan, and common questions and answers about the technology. I realizethat not everyone who needs a scan will be able to get one; the quiz in Chapter5 will help people to get the help they need.How do you know unless you look?"},{"pageContent":"8YES, YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR BRAIN AND CHANGE YOUR LIFE!“Everyone thinks of changing the world, but no one thinks of changing himself[or his brain].”—Leo TolstoyThe most exciting concept in this book, and in our work at the Amen Clinics, isthat the brain can change. You are not necessarily stuck with the brain youhave. You can make it better! Like your body, you can start working today toincrease its circulation, growth, connections, and efficiency. You can enhanceyour brain, your temperament, and your personality, as well as your ability tolove and connect with others.At the Amen Clinics we have performed hundreds of before-and-after SPECT scanswith a wide variety of interventions, such as medication, meditation,psychotherapy, supplements, and dietary interventions. When you do the rightthings for the brain, you enhance it. When you do the wrong things for thebrain, you make it worse. And we can prove it.PRINCIPLE 8: You can change your brain and change your life.Our imaging work and the work of many other scientists have shown that manythings can change the brain in a negative way, such as drug abuse, smoking, toomuch caffeine, head trauma, working in a toxic environment, too much stress, alack of exercise, poor diet, a traumatic experience, negative thoughts,infection, allergic reaction, cancer treatment, coronary bypass surgery, a lackof education, and many more. The opposite is also true: you can change yourbrain in a positive way. Part II of this book is dedicated to helping youachieve the best brain possible, to enhance it, optimize it, and literally makeit work at peak efficiency.The first step to achieving this goal is to believe that you can change thebrain. Once you develop this belief, you can put a program in place to make ithappen. In this chapter I will give you four stories from my recent practice toillustrate the possibility of changing brains and changing people’s lives.JACK CAN STAY HOMETwelve-year-old Jack was brought to my clinic by his parents. He was strugglingin school, had severe temper problems, and had alienated his brothers, hissisters, and the kids in the neighborhood. His parents brought him totherapists, but he refused to get out of the car to talk to them. Hispediatrician put him on four different medications, without much success. Hewould often spit out the medicine in front of his mother. Life was a dailybattle, and Mom wanted to run away from home. They had even started thepaperwork to send him away to a therapeutic boarding school—when they heard melecture at a local church. When I met Jack, I could see that a sweet boy residedsomewhere hidden inside, even though he cursed at me throughout our firstmeeting. His SPECT scans showed severe overall increased activity throughout hisbrain (Images 8.1 and 8.2). It is a pattern we call the ring of fire, becausethe brain looks as if it is hot or overactive throughout the cortex. For thefirst time since Jack’s parents had begun dragging him to mental healthprofessionals, Jack paid attention to his doctor. He asked questions about thescan and wanted to learn more about his brain. Willingly, he took thesupplements and fish oil I prescribed, he worked with me to get better controlover his temper, and he started to do better in school, at home, and with hisfriends. Four months after we began treatment, I ordered a follow-up scan onJack. His brain, as evidenced by his loving behavior, had dramatically settleddown. By changing or balancing his brain, I was able to change his life.image [images/Amen_9780307338136_epub_015_r1.jpg]STEVEN AND THE SANTA MONICA FARMERS’ MARKET DISASTEROn July 16, 2003, Steven, a thirty-three-year-old bicycle repair mechanicworking in Santa Monica, California, insisted on taking an early lunch. He wasnot sure why he needed to go to the downtown farmers’ market, but he felt drawnto it. While he was walking, eighty-seven-year-old George Russell Weller lostcontrol of his 1992 Buick LeSabre and barreled through the three-block-longfarmers market. Bodies were flying, people were screaming, and Weller’s car washeaded straight for Steven. Steven knew he would be hit. He later said, “Ithought he was going to run over my legs . . . I thought I would lose my legs.”At the last possible moment, Steven was able to jump out of the way. Then allhell broke lose. Ten people were killed, and more than fifty were injured.Steven, who had been a military tank commander in the first Gulf War, used themedical skills he had learned to help save others. Still, a woman died in hisarms.Traumatized, Steven went back to work. But for months he couldn’t sleep andcouldn’t stop shaking. By chance—or fate, if you believe in such things—LindaAlvarez, one of the anchors at CBS News in Los Angeles, took her bicycle toSteven’s shop. Shortly after the disaster, Linda and Steven talked about it in apassing conversation. That was when Linda noticed that Steven was shaking. “Itstarted that day,” Steven said, showing her his trembling hands, “and it won’tstop.” The image of Steven’s hands stayed with Linda. A month later, whileworking on another story, Linda learned about work I was doing with a treatmenttechnique called Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR).EMDR is a psychological treatment designed for people who develop post-traumaticstress disorder (PTSD), an emotional response to severe trauma that changes thenervous system. EMDR uses special eye movements and other forms of brainstimulation to activate the whole brain, together with a stepwise process toremove the negative emotional charges on memories. With my colleagues KarenLansing, Chris Hanks, and Lisa Rudy, I had just finished a study of six policeofficers involved in shootings who had developed PTSD. EMDR was very effectivein alleviating the officers’ symptoms, as well as normalizing brain functionseen on SPECT scans.CBS producer Angeline Chew called and asked if I would be interested in workingon a story about EMDR, using Steven’s story as an example. After talking toSteven, who was a willing participant, I recruited EMDR expert Sara Gilman tohelp. Sara is a seasoned trauma specialist and a close friend. We bothinterviewed Steven and felt he would be a good candidate for EMDR and that hisstory was worth telling through the eyes of EMDR and emotional healing. As inthe case of most people who develop PTSD, the Santa Monica Farmers’ Marketdisaster was not Steven’s only trauma. He grew up in a severely abusivealcoholic home. One of his earliest memories is of his father burning down thefamily house. He also remembered that his father dangled him over afour-hundred-foot bridge. At the age of eleven his favorite uncle, afirefighter, died in a fire set by an arsonist, and Steven faced death as a tankcommander during the Gulf War. Steven had many layers of trauma.As part of his evaluation, we scanned Steven three times: before treatment,during his first EMDR session with Sara, and after eight hours of treatment.Initially, Steven’s brain showed the classic PTSD pattern; his limbic oremotional brain was extremely hyperactive. Sara then went to work with him,cleaning out the traumas one by one using EMDR. His brain actually showedbenefit during the first treatment and was markedly improved after only eighthours. His shaking subsided, and he felt significantly better. One of the mosttouching things Sara told me was that during the process Steven started to beable to forgive his father, and he even wondered what his father’s brain wouldhave looked like. He had held a deep and understandable resentment toward hisfather, but the work with brain science gave him a new perspective on himselfand his father. When Sara and I helped him balance and change his brain, hislife improved as well.CATHY PLAYS ON TO HELP HER TEAMOne of my nieces (I have twenty-one nieces and nephews) is an amazing highschool basketball player. Only five feet two inches tall, she played guard andhelped lead her team to the state finals. Watching her play was one of thehighlights of my life. One day my niece called me about a teammate, Cathy, whowas about to be tossed off the basketball team. Cathy was a great player and animportant part of the team, but she struggled with a terrible temper. She hadproblems with teammates and her coaches and frequently was thrown out of gamesbecause of negative interactions with referees. When Cathy came to see us, herscan showed two significant problems: low activity in her left temporal lobe (anarea often associated with irritability and temper outburst) and increasedactivity in the anterior cingulate gyrus (often associated with arguing andtrouble letting go of negative feelings and emotions). We put Cathy on somemedications to balance her brain: an anticonvulsant to stabilize her temporallobe and an antidepressant to calm her anterior cingulate gyrus. Within a monthCathy was more stable. Her temper was under control, and she became happier andmore flexible. She was not thrown out of any more games and helped her team havean amazing year. As we helped balance and change Cathy’s brain, she and herteammates were better off.JIM IS BETTER THAN EVERJim, fifty-two, was the head of a large nonprofit support group. He was an ableadministrator and a loving husband and father, and he was successful in hisother business endeavors. Over the two years before he came to see us, henoticed that his memory was not as good as it had been and that his energy levelwas waning. Jim heard me lecture at a science and technology conference inWashington, D.C., sponsored by the National Science Foundation. When he visitedour clinic, it was clear that he was a successful, healthy male. Yet his brainwas sleepy, which meant that it was underactive, especially in his prefrontalcortex and temporal lobes. These findings put him at risk for more seriousproblems later on. Based on his scan results, I put him on a handful ofsupplements and fish oil, changed his diet, and advised him to increase hisexercise. We agreed that six months later we would get a follow-up scan to seehow he was doing. The scan showed very nice overall improvement. Jim said hehadn’t felt this good since he was in his twenties.As you can see from these examples, it really is possible to change your brainand change your life. By enhancing brain function, you give yourself, yourchildren, and your loved ones the best possible chance to be effective and happyin life."},{"pageContent":"9THE MYTH OF THE PERFECT BRAINWE ALL NEED A LITTLE HELP“The normal man is a fiction.”—Carl Jung“The only normal people are the ones you don’t know too well.”—Rodney DangerfieldJack is typical of many of the people who come to my clinics. Even though he wasa competent, high-level computer executive, he struggled with his mood andtemper. He was so ashamed of his shortcomings that he avoided getting help untilhis wife threatened to divorce him (a very common scenario in our clinics). WhenI first saw him, he said that he thought everyone else was normal except him,that everyone else was saner, better looking, and more confident, had more sex,and in general had a better time in life than he was having. As I listened,inwardly I smiled. A week with me, I thought, would completely dispel his notionthat everyone else was normal. My next thought was a bit more sensitive. Iremembered a time early in my psychiatric career when this odd thing kepthappening to me. It seemed that anytime I got the idea that someone was reallygreat, normal, healthy, and had it all together, within three weeks he would bein my office telling me about the pain, stress, traumas, sins, ordisappointments in his own life. It happened so often that I started to believethat we all need a little help. Here are two brief examples.One of the physicians at Fort Irwin, an army post in the middle of the MojaveDesert where I spent two years as the chief of the community mental healthcenter, had a barbecue at his house to welcome me when I first arrived at thisisolated duty assignment. I met his wife and kids and had a wonderful time. Iremember how much I admired him. Even though he was “very army” for a militarydoctor, he was smart and competent and seemed to truly care about the soldierswe were serving. Three weeks later his wife came to my office in tears and saidhow worried she was about his drinking. As it turned out, this physician had aserious drinking problem and was eventually sent to an inpatient program to getclean and sober.One of my best friends through the years is a military chaplain. He is a kind,sensitive man with a big heart and a sharp wit. His soldiers love him, and hewas rapidly promoted. I remember one particular day when I was thinking abouthow much I admired him (I need to stop having these thoughts), I got an urgentmessage that he had called. When I phoned him back, he was in a panic and had tosee me right away. It was toward the end of the day, so I met him at theofficers’ club for dinner. I listened to him tell me about another side ofhimself well into the evening. During the day he had lost four hours of time andwas afraid he was losing his mind. He did not know how he got to work or wherehis car was parked. And this was not the first time it had happened. It turnedout that he had a multiple personality disorder from severe childhood abuse,which he didn’t tell me about until he felt as though he was cracking up. I wassaddened by his suffering and amazed at how functional he was given themultitude of traumas in his life.A quick look at some of the statistics on mental illness will put to restanyone’s notion that the vast majority of people are without pain. According tothe Epidemiological Catchment Study sponsored by the National Institute ofMental Health, 49 percent of the U.S. population at some point in their liveswill suffer from a psychiatric (brain) illness, most commonly anxiety,depression, or substance abuse. Twenty-nine percent will have two psychiatricillnesses, and 17 percent will have three. Millions of people suffer, yet manythink that others have it better. Most people have no idea how lucky they reallyare. It is normal to have struggles, and it is better to count your blessingsthan to feel messed up.PRINCIPLE 9: Very few people have perfect brains. We all need a little help.When I first started my brain-imaging work, I was not very concerned with theconcept of normal, because I had so many sick people to try to help. In ourclinic’s database, we have more than sixty murderers and hundreds of violentpeople. We have thousands of patients with ADD, anxiety, depression, braintrauma, substance abuse, and bipolar disorder. But building a database of normalpeople also became essential to my work. We needed normal people to docomparison studies on our patient group and to be able to understand and publishour results.I knew that finding normal people would be a challenge. The people who I thoughtwere normal often ended up in my office asking for help. Still, I had no ideahow hard it would be to find truly normal brains. For our research project, wehad fairly strict criteria for normal. This strictness was essential to our workand to being able to publish our studies. To be “normal” in our study, peoplehad to meet five criteria:• No psychiatric illness at any point in their lives (that eliminated 49percent of the population),• No significant head injuries,• No substance abuse,• No neurological problems, and• No first-degree relative (mother, father, sibling, or child) with apsychiatric illness, including substance abuse problems.Participants were thoroughly interviewed about the above issues and were given astructured psychiatric screening test, the Minnesota Multiphasic PersonalityInventory (MMPI), which is a test of personality and a memory screening test.I recruited people from within my own family (not the best place to start,except for my mother, who has a drop-dead-perfect brain), from my parents’country club, from churches and schools, by placing ads in the Los AngelesTimes, and by placing flyers at local universities in student and teacher boxes.I even distributed flyers at my lectures (although there are not many normalmental health professionals). At the end of the second year of the study we hadscreened over fifteen hundred people and had scanned no more than sixty-five.Only about one in twenty-three people who thought they were normal actually metour criteria. Here are three examples of people who thought they were normal butactually were not.Brad came to us as the fiancé of one of our employees. Everyone loved Brad. Hewas in school and worked and seemed like an all-around great guy. In theinterview, however, it became clear that he struggled in school and thatteachers thought he was not living up to his potential. He often procrastinated,was disorganized, had poor handwriting, and had experimented for three yearswith marijuana and cocaine. He never thought his substance abuse was a problem,so he didn’t mention it until we pressed him on the subject.Steve was a youth pastor who worked in a local church. He saw himself as kind,competent, and perfectly normal. His wife, on the other hand, saw him astemperamental, rigid, and moody. From his mother we found out that he had had aserious head injury as a child, where he fell backward from the top of a swingonto his head and sustained a brief loss of consciousness.Gina seemed to meet all of our criteria and scored normally on our tests, exceptthat she had some mild problems with the memory test. Her scan showed markeddecreased activity in her prefrontal cortex. Puzzled, I interviewed her again.She had forgotten to tell me that she was being evaluated for chronic tiredness.She also cried very easily at emotional family events and even at commercials.She said, “It is definitely not normal to cry at KFC commercials showing amother and son eating fried chicken together.”The research team was amazed that so many people who thought of themselves asnot only normal but almost perfect were in reality troubled with mood orattentional problems or had histories of serious brain injury or forgottensubstance abuse. As part of the screening process, we had spouses and parentsfill out information on potential study subjects to make sure we always hadanother person’s point of view.Halfway through we changed the name of the study from the Amen Clinics NormalStudy to the Amen Clinics Healthy Brain Study. Some may think that the namechange was subtle, but we did not. We now believe that normal is a myth andhealthy brains are actually rare. There are very few healthy brains among us. Weall need a little help. This idea is actually comforting to me. It lessensjudgment, because it is hard to say “I am better than you.” It helps us see thatbrain health is fragile and must be taken seriously. And as a society, we needto make brain health a priority.Along the same lines, we have found that many people who struggle do not knowthat they have problems. Did you know that 95 percent of people who haveAlzheimer’s disease are not diagnosed until they are in the moderate-to-severestages of the illness? Clearly, it is much better to know that a problem isbrewing early, so you can implement prevention and treatment strategies as soonas possible. Many people do not know that they have sustained brain injuriesthat have affected their lives. Many people also have no idea that they havemood or attentional problems; yet ask their spouses, and you will get an earful.When I turned forty, I got a routine eye exam. To my surprise, I could not seepast five feet out of my left eye. I was in serious need of glasses, yet I hadhad no idea. If we all need a little help, then early screening is an essentialtool for keeping our brains healthy as we age."},{"pageContent":"PART IITHE AMEN CLINIC PROGRAM FOR MAKING A GOOD BRAIN GREAT"},{"pageContent":"10PROTECT YOUR BRAINThe first step in making a good brain great is to work to protect it. Just as aparent shields a child from harm, you must take a proactive approach to keepingyour brain safe from trouble. As simple as this idea is, most people neverreally think about brain security. We let those we love, including ourselves,snowboard without helmets, hit soccer balls with their heads, ride in unsafecars, go off-roading in four-wheel vehicles, drink too much alcohol, smokemarijuana, consume drinks with excessive amounts of aspartame, sugar, orcaffeine, become sleep deprived, and live with high levels of stress. Lovingyour brain means protecting it. I know many of you are thinking: Oh no, morethings I can’t do—caffeine, alcohol, head injuries, paint fumes—why can’t aperson just have some fun? Be careful, that is deprivation thinking. Just think,with a good brain, you can have better relationships, more love in your life, domore good for others, have more fun, be better at sports, have more sex, and beable to make and keep more money. It all depends on how you think about it.Without good functioning of your brain, trust me, you will not have more fun.PROTECT YOUR BRAIN FROM PHYSICAL TRAUMAAfter years of looking at the brain, I have concluded that protecting it is thefirst priority. I make sure my kids and loved ones drive safe vehicles,especially the youngest drivers. The young ones are at the greatest risk forharm, as their brains are not fully developed and they have more problems withimpulsivity and poor judgment. As parents, we should read the safety ratings ofvehicles, help our children get the safest cars, and strongly discourage themfrom riding motorcycles or mopeds.Also, if possible—and they do not always listen—I would never let my childrenhit soccer balls with their heads or play tackle football or other sports thatput them at risk for injuries. Some people have criticized me for being tooprotective. But it seems like a no-brainer (pun intended). One day myson-in-law, Jay, told me he was taking my daughter four-wheeling in California’sdesert. I protested. He said it was very safe and they are careful to wearhelmets. I still protested. Sometimes knowing the truth still doesn’t allow youto communicate it so others can see it as you do. A couple of months later theytold me about an accident that brought shivers down my spine. Jay had beenriding at forty miles per hour when the front tires of his four-wheel vehiclehit the top of a boulder buried in the sand. The accident launched Jay at fortymiles per hour off the vehicle. How fast was his brain going while in midair?Forty miles per hour. He hit the sand helmeted-head first. His brain went fromforty to zero in an instant. What do you think happened inside his skull? Hisbrain bounced around multiple times. He was unconscious for a brief period oftime. Given that he was then dating my daughter, I had already scanned him earlyin their relationship (sort of a rule in my family—take my daughter out for awhile, get scanned to see if you can come back). Two months after the accidentthe scan showed a dent in his prefrontal cortex (Images 10.1 and 10.2). Thefour-wheeling was not exactly a smart idea. Both kids now get it. Protecting thebrain from head injury is a critical part of being your best.image [images/Amen_9780307338136_epub_016_r1.jpg]When it comes to sports, I often say, “Golf is good, tennis is terrific, tabletennis is the world’s best sport.” Few head injuries occur with these sports,and both tennis and table tennis are highly aerobic. But when it comes tocontact sports, despite a parent’s pleading, some kids will still want to play.At this point, I believe children and teens should be screened for theapolipoprotein (apo) E4 gene. People who have this gene are 2.5 to 5 times morelikely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (AD). People who have this gene and alsosustain a head injury have a tenfold risk of developing AD. If children or teenshave the gene—and 25 percent of the population has it—there is no way in my mindthat they should be allowed to play games where they might be injured. It isjust too risky (Image 10.3).image [images/Amen_9780307338136_epub_017_r1.jpg]Given the extraordinary increase in risk of AD when someone with the apoE4 genehas a head injury, it would be wise to know your apoE genotype before you decidewhether to engage in high-risk activities. If you decide to get an apoE genotypeblood test, then it should be done under the strictest confidence so thatinsurance companies and others cannot obtain this information and potentiallyuse it against you. It would be best to pay for the test on your own and keep itin your personal records, without allowing it to be included in your medicalrecords.Those who should consider getting an apoE genotype blood test include:• Those who are considering playing contact sports where there is a high riskof injury to the head• All professional athletes who engage in high-contact sports (boxing,football, soccer, hockey, etc.)• Those with a brother, sister, father, or mother with AD• People who sustained a head injury with loss of consciousness or who have hadmultiple head injuriesPROTECT YOUR BRAIN FROM EMOTIONAL TRAUMA AND STRESSEmotional trauma, like physical trauma, can disrupt brain development and causenegative changes in the brain. We have studied many people who have beenemotionally traumatized in fires, floods, earthquakes, and car accidents. Wehave studied people who have been robbed, raped, stabbed, shot, molested, andritually tortured. We have seen policemen and firefighters who have beentraumatized by losing friends during emergencies and having babies die in theirarms. Emotional trauma changes brain function.Our studies of emotional trauma indicate that the brain responds to trauma byfiring up or flaming certain brain systems. Scans show that the deep limbicsystem, anterior cingulate gyrus, basal ganglia, and right temporal lobes allbecome hyperactive. It is as if all systems become hyperalert to be on guard forfurther trouble. When people have been traumatized, they have trouble sleeping,become moody, fearful, and anxious, and experience many physical “motoroverflow” symptoms, such as headaches, muscle tension, or bowel problems. Inaddition, they are exposed to high levels of stress hormones, which have adirect negative effect on brain function. Chronic or lasting stress releasescertain hormones that have been found to kill cells in the hippocampus, one ofthe major memory centers located in the temporal lobes. Stress from having toomuch to do, day in and day out, or from having unresolved emotional traumaclearly hurts brain function.Protecting the brain from emotional trauma, and learning how to deal withchronic stress, are critical to brain health. In Chapter 18 we will discussdestressing the brain. For now, it is important to understand that stress andtrauma hurt the brain, and that taking an active role in protecting the brain iscritical to health.For people who have been traumatized in the past I often refer them for EyeMovement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR; see Chapter 8). This specificpsychological treatment for trauma has been found to be effective not only inalleviating the symptoms of emotional trauma but also in rebalancing brainfunction. We performed a study of six police officers who were involved inshootings and subsequently developed post-traumatic stress disorder. PTSD ischaracterized by insomnia, nightmares, reliving the trauma, feeling emotionallynumb, feeling that your life is shortened, and frequently intense anxiety. Theseofficers were suffering both physical and emotional symptoms secondary to thetrauma. We scanned each of the officers three times, before, during, and aftertreatment. All the officers showed dramatic improvement during the treatmentprocess. In addition, the scans revealed that the treatment significantly helpedbrain function. You can learn more about EMDR at www.emdria.org[http://www.emdria.org].Be watchful for too much stress and for traumatic events. Make sure to get thetrauma treated and have a mechanism to lower the stress in your body.PROTECT YOUR BRAIN FROM TOXIC EXPOSUREToxic exposure, like injury, emotional trauma, and stress, hurts the brain. Manysubstances have the potential to be brain toxic, and most people have no cluethat they do. From many medications to drugs of abuse, from alcohol to caffeine(uh-oh, I may upset some folks here), from nicotine to environmental toxins, andfrom vaccines to pesticides, there are many things that can hurt your brain.Understanding the sources of brain poisons can help you avoid them.Many medications are brain toxic. From a psychiatric standpoint, I was taught touse a class of antianxiety medications called benzodiazepines, such as Xanax,Ativan, and Valium, to treat patients with intense feelings of anxiety andpanic. As soon as I started performing SPECT studies, I saw that thesemedications were often toxic to brain function. Scan after scan on thesemedications showed an overall diminished or dehydrated pattern of activity, justas with drugs of abuse, which we will discuss shortly. It didn’t take long forme to stop using these medications and look for other ways to heal anxiety andpanic. In much the same way, pain-killers often showed brain toxicity on scans:Vicodin, Darvon, Percodan, Oxycontin, and others caused overall decreased brainactivity. No wonder they help pain—they make people feel numb all over. Ofcourse, this doesn’t mean that these medications are never indicated. Manypeople would rather die than live with chronic pain. It does mean, however, thatwe should look for other ways to work with chronic pain, rather than just givingpain-killers that also numb the brain. We should look toward acupuncture,hypnosis, biofeedback, herbs, and behavioral treatments to deal with pain.Whenever you take a medication, check to see the effect it has on the brain.Cognitive impairment is often spelled out in the side-effect profile given topatients by pharmacists.Many patients who are on eight to ten different medications have come to see mecomplaining of memory problems. If I see trouble on their scans, my first goalis to decrease the number of medications they are taking. I have been amazed athow helpful that can be. One of my favorite patients came to me on eightdifferent medications. Her frontal lobes were severely decreased in activity,and she had trouble forming her words. By better targeting her treatment, I wasable to stop six of her medications and lower the doses of the two others. Herspeech got better, her thought processes became clearer, and she had betterenergy than she had had in years. Her follow-up scan showed marked improvement.Well-informed people understand clearly that drugs of abuse hurt the brain, butothers debate it and argue. Drugs of abuse include alcohol, cocaine,methamphetamines, heroin, inhalants (the worst), marijuana, LSD, Ecstasy, andmany others. When I first started to order scans, I was the director of adual-diagnosis (mixed substance abuse and psychiatric disorder) treatment unit.I have seen well over a thousand scans of drug abusers (e.g., Image 10.4). Thevast majority of them showed significant damage. More than 115 scientificstudies have demonstrated the negative effects of drugs on the brain. The scansprove it. Through the years I have been grateful for my overall lack ofsubstance and alcohol use. The scans had such powerful effects on my patientsthat I brought them home to show my children. I effectively induced anxietydisorders related to substance abuse in all of my children. I am happy that noneof them has had a problem with drugs or alcohol, despite a significant familyhistory of alcoholism on their mother’s side. The power of the images led me todevelop and be part of a series of posters and videos on substance abuse. TheTruth About Drinking, produced by Arnold Shapiro and hosted by Leeza Gibbons,won an Emmy for best educational television program in 1998. Our poster, “WhichBrain Do You Want,” now hangs in over fifteen thousand schools. The images arevery clear: alcohol and drugs damage the brain—stay away from them.image [images/Amen_9780307338136_epub_023_r1.jpg]One of the most common brain toxins is alcohol. At the Amen Clinics we have seenmany alcoholics, and they have some of the worst brains of all. Alcohol affectsthe brain by reducing nerve cell firing; it prevents oxygen from getting intothe cells’ energy centers; and it reduces the effectiveness of many differenttypes of neurotransmitters, especially those involved in learning andremembering. Alcohol is a double-edged sword, depending upon the quantity ofintake. Large amounts of it—four or more glasses of wine, or the equivalent inhard liquor on a daily basis—increase the risk of dementia. But small amounts—aglass of wine once a week or once a month, but not daily—may reduce dementia byup to 70 percent. The reduced risk seems to be related to the fact that alcoholand cholesterol compete with each other, and sometimes it is good for alcohol towin. That is, small amounts of alcohol compete with HDL, the good cholesterol,which actually removes the harmful types of cholesterol. When a person drinks alittle alcohol, HDL is not allowed to bind to the cell membrane, so it is forcedback into the bloodstream, where it lowers LDL and other harmful cholesterols.This reduces the person’s risk of heart disease, atherosclerosis, and strokes,all of which are known causes for dementia. On the other hand, a recent studyfrom Johns Hopkins reported that even small amounts of daily drinking loweredoverall brain size. When it comes to the brain, size matters! My advice is thatsmall amounts of alcohol after age twenty-five are okay, but don’t push it. Whywait until you’re twenty-five to drink? The brain is not fully developed untilthen, especially in the prefrontal judgment area. Why poison it before it hashad a chance to fully develop?Nicotine prematurely ages the brain. Nicotine, found in cigarettes, cigars, andchewing tobacco and in nicotine patches, tablets, and gum, causes blood vesselsto constrict, lessening blood flow to vital organs. Smokers have more problemswith impotence; it is bad to have low blood flow to sexual organs. Nicotineconstricts blood flow to the skin, making smokers look prematurely older thanthey are. Nicotine also constricts blood flow to the brain, eventually causingoverall lowered activity and depriving the brain of the nutrients it needs. Ifnicotine is so bad, then why do people smoke? In the short run nicotine, likealcohol and other drugs of abuse, makes many people feel better. It stimulatesthe release of several brain neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine, whichimproves your reaction time and your ability to pay attention; dopamine, whichacts in the pleasure center of the brain, reinforcing its use; glutamate, whichis involved with learning and memory (although high glutamate levels causeprogrammed cell death and are involved in causing Alzheimer’s disease); andendorphins, which are often called the body’s natural pain-killer. No wonderpeople use nicotine and have trouble quitting. But if you want a healthy brain,do what you can to stay away from it.Unfortunately, caffeine is not much better. Caffeine also constricts blood flowto the brain and many other organs. A little caffeine a day is probably not aproblem, but more than a cup or two can certainly be trouble. Am I the only oneworried about the proliferation of coffee companies? New coffee shops haveseemed to spring up on every street corner, selling highly caffeinated drinksfilled with sugar and fat. As a society, we are going from one or two cups a dayto one or two cups three or four times a day. Why do so many people consume somuch caffeine? Understanding the drug’s actions can help us see why people useit so much and why we should significantly curb our use.Adenosine, a chemical in the brain that causes drowsiness by slowing down nervecell activity, is a key to understanding caffeine addiction. When we are tired,adenosine triggers the brain to slow down so we will go to sleep and naturallyrejuvenate brain function. The purpose of sleep is to replenish certainchemicals in the brain to help with efficient nerve cell firing. Adenosine tellsus when we need to sleep. Caffeine blocks the effects of adenosine by occupyingthe adenosine receptor sites and preventing the brain from seeing it. So even ifyou are tired and are in need of sleep to rejuvenate your brain chemistry,caffeine tricks the brain into thinking it is wide awake. Several sleepresearchers suggest that we are a sleep-deprived nation and that caffeineaddiction is a leading cause. Caffeine, a stimulant, causes the release ofadrenaline from the adrenal glands, putting the body into a fight-or-flightmode, where the pupils dilate, the heart beats faster, blood vessels on theskin’s surface constrict to slow blood flow from cuts and also to increase bloodflow to muscles, blood pressure rises, blood flow to the stomach slows, theliver releases sugar into the bloodstream for extra energy, and muscles tightenup, ready for action. Caffeine puts us in a “ready state” for trouble.Caffeine also increases dopamine levels in the same way that amphetamines do.Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that, in certain parts of the brain, activatesthe pleasure center. Obviously, caffeine’s effect is much less than that ofamphetamines, but the mechanism is similar. The dopamine/pleasure centerconnection may contribute to caffeine addiction. It is easy to see why your bodylikes caffeine in the short term, especially if you are sleep deprived and needto stay active. Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors, so you feel alert. Itraises adrenaline in your body, giving you a boost. And it raises dopamineproduction to make you feel good. The problem with caffeine is that it leads toa downhill spiral. Once the effects wear off, you feel fatigued and depressed.So you take more caffeine to get going again. As you might think, having yourbody in a constant state of readiness isn’t very healthy, and you tend to feeljumpy and irritable. The most important long-term problem is the effect caffeinehas on sleep. As we have seen, adenosine is important to sleep, especially todeep sleep. Significant caffeine consumption may prevent you from falling andstaying asleep. Sleep deficits add up quickly, so the next day you feel worseand need caffeine to get out of bed. The cycle continues day after day. Ninetypercent of Americans consume caffeine every day. Like other drugs of abuse, onceyou get in the cycle, you have to keep taking the drug. Even worse, if you tryto stop taking caffeine, you get very tired and depressed and you get a terriblesplitting headache. These negative effects force you back to caffeine even ifyou want to stop.As little caffeine as possible is a good rule, if you want to respect andnurture your brain.CAFFEINE CONTENTAccording to the National Soft Drink Association, the caffeine content of soda(in milligrams, per 12-oz. can) is as follows:Red Bull80 (per 250 ml) Jolt71.2 Sugar-Free Mr. Pibb58.8 Pepsi One55.5 MountainDew55.0 (no caffeine in Canada) Diet Mountain Dew55.0 Surge51.0 Coca-Cola45.6Shasta Cola44.4 Shasta Cherry Cola44.4 Shasta Diet Cola44.4 Mr. Pibb40.8 SunkistOrange40 Dr Pepper39.6 Pepsi Cola37.2 Diet Pepsi35.4 RC Cola36.0 Canada DryCola30.0 Barq’s Root Beer23 Canada Dry Diet Cola1.2 7-Up0 Diet Rite Cola0Sprite0 Mug Root Beer0 Diet Barq’s Root Beer0 Minute Maid Orange0 A&W Root Beer0Coffee (6-oz. serving) Espresso100 Brewed80–135 Instant65–100 Decaf, brewed3–4 Decaf, instant2–3 Tea, iced (12 oz.)70 Tea, brewed, U.S.40 Tea,instant30 Herbal0 (may vary)Since many people have trouble judging portion sizes, here are the amounts ofcaffeine in Starbucks standard servings (in milligrams):Coffee, grande (16 oz.)550 Caffe Americano, short (8 oz.)35 Coffee, tall (12oz.)375 Coffee, short (8 oz.)250Source: www.cspinet.org/nah/caffeine/caffeine_corner.htm[http://www.cspinet.org/nah/caffeine/caffeine_corner.htm]Another group of stimulants that are a source of concern is weight-losssupplements. Many of them contain high amounts of caffeine or caffeinelikesubstances. Now that ephedra is illegal, other herbal stimulants are gainingpopularity, such as guarana, yerba maté, and cola nut, to name a few.When it comes to toxic exposure, there are a number of controversial areas toconsider. Some scientists report that mercury from any source is neurotoxic,such as the mercury found in certain fish, dental fillings, and thepreservatives in vaccinations. In one study Dr. Hugh Fudenberg, one of theworld’s leading immunogeneticists, reported that people who have had fiveconsecutive flu shots increased their risk of Alzheimer’s disease tenfoldcompared to those who had one, two, or no shots. Dr. Fundenberg claimed it wasdue to the mercury and aluminum in flu shots. There is also great concern aboutthe vaccinations we give to children: many of them contain the preservativethimerosal, which also contains mercury. Studies are conflicting, but why wouldwe ever give children a known neurotoxin when other alternatives are available?In the 1950s kids routinely got five shots by the time they were two years old.Today’s health guidelines call for more than twenty-two shots. Autism has risenmore than twelvefold in the last decade. As some new studies have suggested, itis likely a genetic-toxin interaction. The genetic makeup of some childrenallows them to tolerate large doses of vaccinations containing mercury, whileothers do not. Clearly these are controversial areas. My advice is that less ismore. If you don’t need to do it, don’t.Artificial sweeteners are another area of concern. I have downed my share ofdiet drinks in my life, but when I read about the negative effects of artificialsweeteners, I get concerned. Many of my patients have felt better after stoppingtheir intake of artificial sweeteners, and some have said their headaches wentaway, their joint pain improved, their memory improved, and surprisingly theylost weight. My sense is that it also depends on our own genetic makeup. Somepeople seem to have no problems with artificial sweeteners, while others haveterrible reactions. Again, less is more.Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is another problem for many. Personally, I getheadaches and irritable when I eat something with MSG. But it is nothing likethe reaction of one of my patients. This midwestern man came to see us with ADDand some anxiety and depressive symptoms. He told us he became violent whenexposed to any MSG. We scanned him, and at his request we did an additional scanon MSG. The MSG scan showed a terrible left temporal lobe deficit, which isoften associated with violence or rage reactions. I told him he had a choice:stay away from MSG, or take medication to protect his temporal lobes. To mysurprise, he decided to take the medication just in case. When I asked why, hesaid that if he lost his temper one more time, his wife would leave him, and younever knew what had MSG in it. Whenever possible, hold the MSG.Paint fumes and vapors from other solvents are brain toxins to avoid. As agroup, indoor wall painters have some of the worst brains I have seen. I onceevaluated a movie set director whose scan showed a toxic appearance. Onquestioning, it was clear he had been exposed to high levels of paint fumes onmany of the sets he had worked on. Getting proper ventilation was one of thekeys to helping him heal. In my conversation with him, he told me painters werethe nuttiest people he ever worked with. He said they often got into fights forlittle to no reason and seemed unreliable. “Even the women act crazy,” he said.No wonder, if they are exposed to chemicals that hurt the viability of braintissue.PROTECT YOUR BRAIN FROM SLEEP DEPRIVATIONSleep deprivation from a number of causes also hurts the brain. People who getless than seven hours of sleep a night have lower activity in the temporallobes, the part of the brain involved in learning and memory. Shift workers,those suffering from jet lag, teens who have their sleep schedules off-kilterfrom school schedules, and those suffering from sleep apnea are all at risk forpoorer brain function. Those who are sleep-deprived score poorer on memory andmath tests, have lower grades in school, and are at much greater risk fordriving accidents. According to the National Highway Traffic SafetyAdministration, drowsiness and fatigue cause more than a hundred thousandtraffic accidents each year, and young drivers are at the wheel in more thanhalf the crashes. Sleep deprivation is also associated with depression andattention deficit disorders. Recently, sleep apnea (snoring loudly, holdingbreath when sleeping, and feeling tired during the day) has been linked toAlzheimer’s disease.Sleep is involved in rejuvenating the brain; without it, people can literallybecome psychotic. When I was chief of mental health at Fort Irwin, I saw anumber of soldiers start to hear voices and become paranoid after being awakethree days in a row. Fort Irwin is home to the national training center thatteaches soldiers desert warfare. Troops spent days at a time in war gameswithout much sleep. Mental health casualties were always high during thoseperiods of time.New research suggests that people who put on a few extra pounds may be able toblame lack of sleep for the added weight. Eve Van Cauter, a professor ofmedicine at the University of Chicago, coauthored a study reporting that peoplewho are sleep-deprived eat more simple carbohydrates than people with goodsleep. Sleep regulates two hormones, leptin and ghrelin, that are involved inappetite. People tend to replace reduced sleep with added calories. Van Cauterand colleagues wrote in the Annals of Internal Medicine that they studied twelvehealthy men in their early twenties. They measured circulating levels of leptinand ghrelin before the study, after two nights of only four hours of sleep, andafter two nights of ten hours of sleep. After four hours of sleep, the ratio ofghrelin jumped 71 percent, compared to a night when the men slept nine hours.The sleep-deprived men chose candy, cookies, and cake over fruit, vegetables, ordairy products.A second study found that the less people sleep, the more they weigh, using ameasure called body mass index, which scales weight to height. It also foundlower leptin levels and higher ghrelin levels in people who sleep less. Dr.Emmanuel Mignot of Stanford University and colleagues examined a thousand peoplein the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study, measuring the participants’ sleep habits,their sleep on the night before the exam, and their leptin and ghrelin levels.They found that people who consistently slept five hours or less per night hadon average 14.9 more ghrelin and 15.5 percent lower leptin levels than those whoslept eight hours a night. Both of these studies demonstrate an importantrelationship between sleep, appetite, and metabolic hormones.Work to sleep at least seven or eight hours each night. Practice good sleephabits, such as avoiding much caffeine and nicotine; stay away from alcohol as asleep aid, as it will wear off and cause you to wake up in the middle of thenight; avoid exercise before bed; and learn relaxation techniques to calm yourmind.Protect your brain!"},{"pageContent":"11EAT RIGHT TO THINK RIGHTFOOD AS BRAIN MEDICINEI am what I ate . . . and I’m frightened.—Bill CosbyYou are what you eat. Literally. All the cells in your body, including yourbrain cells, make themselves new every five months. Some, like your skin cells,make themselves new every month. Proper nutrition is critical to maintaining ahealthy brain and body. Food is as powerful as any medicine that science candesign. Intuitively, we know food has a powerful impact on how we feel. Eatright, and you feel better. Eat wrong, have three doughnuts to start your day,and you could end up feeling lethargic and stupid thirty to sixty minutes later.If you desire to have a great brain, you must give it consistent nutrition. Thisis one of the easiest, most effective strategies to get results quickly. Thischapter will be your road map to eating for brain health.The way we Americans feed ourselves and our children is scandalous. Just takebreakfast, for example. Think of what we feed our children and ourselves: sugarycereals, muffins, doughnuts, frozen pancakes and waffles with liquid sugar(maple syrup), and cinnamon rolls. All these things are laden with calories,refined carbohydrates, and damaged fats that cause blood sugar spikes and dropsthat make us feel hungry and erratic throughout the day.We are also exporting our poor eating habits to other countries. My wonderfulfriend in China, Tang Yiyuan, a scientist at the Chinese National Academy ofSciences, says the most popular restaurants in Beijing are American fast-foodrestaurants. As the Chinese diet is starting to resemble the American diet, hesays, they are seeing an increased incidence of illnesses, such as diabetes andheart disease. Given what we know about nutrition, health, and illness, it isneglectful or even self-abusive to eat the standard American diet, which has toomany refined carbohydrates, too much bad fat, and way too many calories (many ofwhich are empty and toxic).As a society, Americans are constantly bombarded with advertisements thatpromote sales and encourage illness:Do you want to “go large” with your order? It’s only thirty-nine cents!Do you want fries with your meal?Do you want an appetizer?Do you want bread first [which makes you hungrier so you eat more]?Do you want dessert? It comes with the meal!Do you want another drink? A bigger drink? It is a better deal!You get toys with the children’s meals!Happy hour—you can drink more for less!If you’re good I’ll take you for French fries or get you dessert. [Poornutrition as a reward for good behavior sets us up later in life to rewardourselves with food that is not good for us.]Free refills, bottomless fries, all-you-can-eat buffets [I have to keep eatingto get my money’s worth].When the fast-food restaurant says “Do you want to go large?” say no. Why payextra money to be fat and have less brain function?One group of people who need to have the best diets are teenagers and youngadults, as their brains are still developing. Unfortunately, they are famous forhaving the worst diets. Many teens and young adults have little education innutrition and give in to their desires for “bottomless fries” or “supersizedmeals” without thinking about the consequences. Because of their underdevelopedprefrontal lobes, teens succumb to their impulses and eat whatever they want,whatever tastes good, whatever is on the table. Yet teenage obesity andadult-onset diabetes in teens are reaching epidemic proportions. The teenage andyoung adult brain is going through vast changes, and giving it proper nutritionhelps to build better adults. Parents and schools need to take an active role inteaching kids how to eat, not just abdicate our role because we think ourteenagers won’t listen to us. My experience with three teenagers and hordes oftheir friends is that if you educate them, give them tasty, healthful options,and gently nudge them in the right direction, they make better choices.An important concept to remember here is that exposure equals preference. Withthe food you provide for them at home, you are teaching your kids what to likeand therefore what to choose to eat. Expose your kids to a wide variety ofhealthy choices so that they will learn to like the right food and make goodchoices when they are away from you.SEVEN SIMPLE BRAIN-PROMOTING NUTRITIONAL TIPSHere is the seven-step plan to get your diet under control and to use food asbrain medicine.1. INCREASE WATER INTAKEGiven that your brain is about 80 percent water, the first rule of brainnutrition is to hydrate your brain with adequate water. Even slight dehydrationcan raise stress hormones, which can damage your brain over time. Drink at least84 ounces of water a day. It is best to have your liquids unpolluted withartificial sweeteners, sugar, caffeine, or alcohol. Actually, caffeine is adiuretic and causes dehydration, which works against your brain’s need forwater. But you do not necessarily need to have all the water plain. As you’llsee in health spas, you can add pieces of fruit, such as lemons, limes, ororanges, to water to get a hint of flavor. You can also use herbal,noncaffeinated teabags, such as raspberry- or strawberry-flavored, and makeunsweetened iced tea. Green tea is also good for brain function, as it containschemicals that enhance mental relaxation and alertness.2. CALORIE RESTRICTIONSubstantial research in animals and now in humans indicates that acalorie-restricted diet is helpful for brain and life longevity. Eating lesshelps you live longer. It controls weight; it decreases risk for heart disease,cancer, and stroke from obesity (a major risk factor for all of theseillnesses); and it triggers certain mechanisms in the body to increase theproduction of nerve growth factors, which are helpful to the brain. Researchersuse the acronym CRON for “calorie restriction with optimal nutrition,” so theother part of the story is to make these calories count.Personally, I hate this principle. I love to eat. My grandfather, whose name Icarry, was a candy maker. My earliest, happiest childhood memories are of beingfive years old standing on a step stool at the stove in my grandfather’s homemaking fudge, English toffee, and pralines. I can still smell the candy cooking.It is comfort food for me, but it also makes my mind foggy and slow.Additionally I am handicapped by a mother who is an amazing Lebanese cook. Ilove her cooking, such as cabbage or grape leaves rolled and stuffed with lamb,rice, and allspice, cooked in a tomato-based broth; freshly baked pizza withonions, mushrooms, and sausage; or Syrian bread warm out of the oven, drippingin butter. The list goes on and on. I love her cooking, but I hate the idea ofbeing fat; this is a serious emotional conflict. My father says he has to getmad at my mom when she cooks such wonderful meals, which she loves to dowhenever one or more of her twenty-one grandchildren come to visit. I have heardmy father say to her, “It is like having a beautiful naked woman sitting on thecounter and saying ‘Don’t touch.’ It just isn’t going to happen.”Even though I hate the idea of “eat less, live longer,” it is what researchtells us to do, and it makes good sense. So grudgingly I strive to eat fewerthan eighteen hundred calories a day, and I recommend you do the same. Figureout how many calories you need to stay at your weight or even lose weight ifthat is your desire, and then go a little bit below it. I watch what I eat, knowthe calorie content of the food I put in my mouth, and even weigh portions whenI am not sure. One of my big fears in life was that I would become short, fat,and bald. I am only five foot six, and people tend to get shorter with age afterforty. I started to go bald in my twenties, like my grandpa the candy maker. Sothe only thing I have control over is my weight. I have a brother, whom I adore,who is a hundred pounds overweight. I worry more about his health than he does,but I know that if I ate whatever I wanted, I would be wearing parachutes forshorts and suffer from knee and back pain as he does.3. FISH, FISH OIL, GOOD FATS, AND BAD FATSRecently, while on vacation in Alaska, I saw a bumper sticker that read, “FishControl My Brain.” I smiled when I realized that the saying had an element oftruth to it, beyond the obsession with fishing. Fish as brain food? In fact,DHA, one form of the omega-3 fatty acids found in fish, makes up a large portionof the gray matter of the brain. The fat in your brain forms cell membranes andplays a vital role in how our cells function. Neurons are also rich in omega-3fatty acids. DHA is also found in high quantities in the retina, thelight-sensitive part of the eye. Research in the last few years has revealedthat a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids may help promote a healthy emotionalbalance and positive mood in later years, possibly because DHA is a maincomponent of the brain’s synapses. A Danish team of researchers compared thediets of 5,386 healthy older individuals and found that the more fish in aperson’s diet, the longer the person was able to maintain their memory. Dr. J.A. Conquer and his colleagues from the University of Guelph in Ontario studiedthe blood fatty acid content in the early and later stages of dementia and notedlow levels in their subjects when compared to healthy people.Since fish have a high content of omega-3 fatty acids, they can aid good brainhealth. In a well-designed study from Holland, researchers found that diets highin saturated fat and cholesterol increased dementia and stroke risk, while fishconsumption decreased the chances of getting those illnesses. The researchersevaluated the food intake of 5,386 normal aging persons and followed them for2.1 years. Those with a high intake of total fat, saturated fat, or cholesterolwere, respectively, 2.4, 1.9, and 1.7 times more likely than those with a lowerintake to develop dementia. Eating fish reduced dementia risk, especially thatdue to Alzheimer’s disease. In a study published in the British Medical Journal,French researchers reported that older people who eat fish at least once a weekhave a significantly lower risk of developing brain problems. “There is aninverse relationship between the frequency of fish consumption and the incidenceof dementia,” according to the lead author, Dr. Pascale Barberger-Gateau. Olderpeople who ate fish at least once a week had about a 33 percent decrease indementia risk over seven years. Dr. Barberger-Gateau and colleagues evaluatedfish, seafood, and meat consumption among 1,674 normal aging individuals oversixty-seven years old living in southwestern France. Over the seven years offollow-up, they found that increased fish and seafood consumption significantlyreduced the chance of developing dementia. One concern about fish is the levelof toxins, such as mercury, found in some species. Once or twice a week is agood policy. High-quality, purified fish oil is another option (see Chapter 20).Five Reasons to Buy Wild SalmonMany people know that wild salmon is better than farmed salmon. Here are fivereasons why, as listed by the Sierra Club.1. Farmed salmon pollute. They are raised in farms of floating net-pens. Theimmense accumulation of waste products can spoil the local environment andspread disease. In addition to natural wastes, farmed salmon are givenantibiotics as well as other drugs that may harm humans and local ecosystems.2. Farmed salmon escape. Storms, sea lions, and net breaks cause large releasesof farmed salmon into the environment. A significant portion of salmon farmed inthe Pacific are, in fact, Atlantic salmon. Escaped fish may ultimately competewith and displace native stocks.3. Farmed salmon are expensive. Farmed salmon represent a net loss of protein,requiring three to five pounds of fish meal to yield a pound of salmon. Thinkabout the energy expended to catch, process, and transport the fish meal, and“less expensive” salmon seem very expensive.4. Eating wild salmon is better for you. Like livestock, farmed salmon aregiven the same antibiotics that are used to treat humans, a practice condemnedby the World Health Organization for contributing to worldwide antibioticresistance. Wild salmon are not only drug- and antibiotic-free, they also havehigher levels of beneficial omega-3 fatty acids and lower levels of harmfulsaturated fats. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, farmed Atlanticsalmon contain 70 percent more fat than wild Atlantic salmon and 200 percentmore fat than wild Pacific pink and chum salmon. But perhaps most important,farm-raised salmon have been found to contain significantly higherconcentrations of PCBs, dioxin, and other cancer-causing contaminants thansalmon caught in the wild.5. Wild salmon are tastier. They have better texture than farm-raised fish,which tend to be mushy and insipid. Without added dyes, farmed fish also lackthe trademark color of natural salmon.To get the very best salmon, buy it fresh and in season. The best choicesinclude trawl-caught and Copper River salmon from Alaska. Most canned salmon iswild, but look on the label. Keep in mind that while many wild salmon runs arethreatened, endangered, or even extinct, many are also still healthy. As ageneral rule, wild stocks in Alaska are faring far better than those ofCalifornia and the Pacific Northwest. As for Atlantic salmon, there arevirtually no harvestable wild runs left in the United States.Given the recent data on the healthful effects of eating fish and omega-3 fattyacids, it is reasonable to increase the amount of fish in your diet or take adaily fish oil, omega-3 fatty acid supplement. If you do take a fish oilsupplement, you need to ensure that it has been tested for contaminants andheavy metals and protected from oxidation during the processing so that itdoesn’t get rancid. (For more on fish oil and omega-3 fatty acid supplements,see Chapter 20.)Many myths and misconceptions surround dietary fat, which has resulted in awidespread fat phobia, although this has lessened with the popularity oflow-carb diets. It is important to remember that not all fat is bad, and thatsome is essential. The solid weight of your brain is 60 percent fat. The hundredbillion nerve cells in the cerebral cortex require essential fatty acids tofunction. Myelin, the white fatty covering on the axons of nerve cells thatspeed the conduction of electrical impulses, is extremely important for thewell-being of the nervous system. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), commonlyknown as Lou Gehrig’s disease, and multiple sclerosis (MS) are calleddemyelinating diseases, because a loss of myelin is the essential feature.Certainly high-circulating fat can kill you with heart disease and strokes, buttoo-low fat levels can also cause problems such as depression and anger,sometimes even suicide and homicide.There are two main categories of fat—good fat (the unsaturated kind) and bad fat(the saturated kind). Saturated fats are molecules whose binding sites areliterally saturated or filled with hydrogen molecules. They are stiff andcontribute to hardening of the arteries and cholesterol plaques. Saturated fatsare found in red meat, eggs, and dairy foods (like butter and milk). They do notspoil as easily as their healthier counterparts, the unsaturated fats. There arealso fats that have been chemically altered by adding hydrogen so that they actlike saturated fats; these are called partially hydrogenated oils. The foodindustry uses them because they do not oxidize and get rancid, but you shouldstay away from them, as they are more damaging than saturated fats and belong ina special category all their own, known to critics as “Frankenfats.”The binding sites of unsaturated fats (mono- or polyunsaturated) are not fullysaturated by hydrogen and are more flexible, which is why unsaturated fats meltat a lower temperature than saturated fats. They rot more easily when exposed toair, they metabolize more easily, and they lower blood cholesterol levels.Monounsaturated fats lower LDL cholesterol, the type of cholesterol that makes amajor contribution to hardening the arteries. Monounsaturated fats also raiseHDL cholesterol, which protect against cardiovascular disease. Whilepolyunsaturated fats also provide the beneficial effect of lowering LDLcholesterol, they also lower HDL cholesterol, which is not good. Themonounsaturated fats are therefore preferred over the polyunsaturated fats.Monounsaturated fats are found in avocados, nuts (such as almonds, cashews, andpistachios), canola oil, olive oil, and peanut oil. Polyunsaturated fats arefound in safflower oil, corn oil, and some fish.The polyunsaturated fats found in salmon and mackerel, and the monounsaturatedfats found in canola oil and soybean oil, are high in the essential fatty acids(EFA) called omega-3 fatty acids. EFAs cannot be made by the human body andtherefore must be obtained from diet (hence the name essential fatty acids).Omega-3 fatty acids are considered good fat because they are importantcomponents of our cells and the cell membranes that are essential for life andhealth.It is hard to get enough omega-3 fatty acids into our diet. The fast andprocessed foods that are now part of our everyday diets are often deficient inthem. Even if your diet includes several meals of fish per week, you still maynot be ingesting sufficient amounts of omega-3. This is because much of the fishwe consume is now farm raised or does not contain significant amounts ofomega-3. When you are ordering fish in a restaurant or buying it at the store,ask if it was caught in the wild or farm raised. Ideally, adults should consumeat least 900 mg of long-chain omega-3 (DHA + EPA) per day, either from foodsources or dietary supplementation. (For information on DHA and EPA, see page198.) Omega-3 fatty acids are found in deep, cold-water fish, such as salmon,mackerel, and sardines. Omega-6 fatty acids are also important but are usuallyfound in adequate amounts in corn, safflower, sunflower, and soybean oils.Flaxseed oil is not as good a source of omega-3, because your body has toconvert its omega-3 fatty acid (alpha-linolenic acid, or ALA) to DHA. Thisconversion can be inefficient, and some people of specific ethnic backgrounds orwho suffer from diabetes may not be able to convert from ALA to DHA at all.Fish, however, do the work for us by converting omega-3 to DHA and EPA. You cantherefore eat less fish than flaxseed oil and still get what your body needs.Heart disease was the first area investigated with regard to the health impactof omega-3 fatty acids. In the early 1970s researchers noticed that the Inuitpeople of Greenland had a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet yet were able tomaintain healthy hearts. Subsequent investigations concluded that this was dueto the high level of omega-3 fatty acids in their native diet of fish and marineanimals. Since then several other studies, including two large American studiesin 1997 and 1998, have revealed the same thing: that cardiovascular health isenhanced in weekly fish eaters when compared to those who ate fish onlyinfrequently. Don’t forget: Whatever is good for your heart is also good foryour brain!GOOD FATS VERSUS BAD FATSGood Fats (most are high in omega-3)Bad Fats (most are high in omega-6)AnchoviesBacon AvocadosButter Brazil nutsCheese (regular fat) Canola oilCreamsauces CashewsDoughnuts Flaxseed oilFried foods, such as Green leafyvegetables potatoes/onion rings HerringIce cream Lean meatsLamb chopsLow aft cheesesLow-carbohydrate bars Olive oilMargarine Peanut oilPotato chips(fried) Pistachio nutsProcessed foods SalmonSteak SardinesWhole milk Soybean oilTrout Tuna Walnuts Whitefish4. LOTS OF DIETARY ANTIOXIDANTSA number of studies have shown that dietary intake of antioxidants from fruitsand vegetables significantly reduces the risk of developing cognitiveimpairment. The research was done because it was theorized that free radicalformation plays a major role in the deterioration of the brain with age. When acell converts oxygen into energy, tiny molecules called free radicals are made.When produced in normal amounts, free radicals work to rid the body of harmfultoxins, thereby keeping it healthy. When produced in toxic amounts, freeradicals damage the body’s cellular machinery, resulting in cell death andtissue damage. This process is called oxidative stress. Vitamins E and C andbeta-carotene inhibit the production of free radicals. Working independently ontwo continents, researchers in Rotterdam and in Chicago found evidence tosupport these hypotheses.Good sources of vitamin C are tomatoes, fruits (especially citrus and kiwi),melon, raw cabbage, green leafy vegetables, peppers, sprouts, broccoli, andcabbage. Important sources of vitamin E are grains, nuts, milk, egg yolk, wheatgerm, vegetable oils, and green leafy vegetables.Blueberries (also called brain berries) are an especially good source ofantioxidants. A series of studies feeding blueberries to rats have examined theberries’ effects on learning new motor skills as well as protection againststroke. Rats that were fed blueberries better learned new motor skills as theyaged compared to their study counterparts. Rats fed a blueberry-enriched dietthat were then given a stroke (in the name of science) lost only 17 percent ofthe neurons in their hippocampus, compared to 42 percent neuron loss in rats noteating blueberries.Strawberries and spinach have also shown significant protective effects in ratmodels, although not as strongly as blueberries. In addition, the rats receivingthese antioxidant-enriched diets all showed increased levels of vitamin E intheir brains. “The exciting finding from this study is the potential reversal ofsome age-related impairment in both memory and motor coordination, especiallywith blueberry supplements,” said Molly Wagster, Ph.D., a health scienceadministrator with the National Institute of Aging.THE BEST ANTIOXIDANT FRUITS AND VEGETABLES (ACCORDING TO THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OFAGRICULTURE)BlueberriesBlackberriesCranberriesStrawberriesSpinachRaspberriesBrussels sproutsPlumsBroccoliBeetsAvocadosOrangesRed grapesRed bell peppersCherriesKiwisEat from the rainbow (many colors) of fruits and vegetables to ensure that youare getting a wide variety of antioxidants to nourish and protect your brain.5. A BALANCE OF PROTEIN, GOOD FATS, AND CARBOHYDRATESGiven the weight issues in my family, I have read many of the diet books thatare popular in America. Some I like a lot, while others make me a little crazy.Eating protein and fat only and avoiding most grains, fruits, and vegetables maybe a quick way to lose weight, but it is not a healthy long-term way to eat foryour body or your brain. The best thing about the Atkins Diet and its manyclones is that it gets rid of most simple sugars. Diets high in refined sugars,such as the low-fat diets of the past, encourage diabetes, tiredness, andcognitive impairment. Yet to imply that bacon is a health food and that orangesand carrots are as bad as cake seems silly. The more balanced diets, such as TheZone by Barry Sears, Sugar Busters! by H. Leighton Steward and a group ofLouisiana-based physicians, The South Beach Diet by cardiologist ArthurAgatston, and Powerful Foods for Powerful Minds and Bodies by René Thomas makesense from a body and brain perspective. The main principle to take away fromthese programs is that balance is essential, especially balancing proteins, goodfats, and good carbohydrates. Having protein at each meal helps to balance bloodsugar levels; and adding lean meat, eggs, cheese, soy, or nuts to a snack ormeal limits the fast absorption of carbohydrates and prevents the brain fog thatgoes with eating simple carbohydrates, such as doughnuts. In fact, psychologistKeith Connors of Duke University found that adding protein to the breakfast ofADD children improved the effectiveness of their medication. Limiting mostcarbohydrates to those with a low glycemic index (such as nuts, apples, pears,and beans), which measures how quickly blood sugar and insulin rise in responseto a food, allows one to get the energy and nutrients of carbohydrates, and thebrain to use the carbohydrates exclusively for fuel, without bingeing orovereating them. And consuming healthy fats, such as those with higher levels ofomega-3 fatty acids, makes for balanced meals and balanced minds. At each mealor snack, try to get a balance of protein, high-fiber carbohydrates, and fat.In 2000 I did a study with five ADD college students, including my own son,using the Zone diet plus high-dose purified fish oil. Each teen stayed on thisregimen for five months. We tracked their school performance and didbefore-and-after brain SPECT scans. All the students performed better in school,and all lost weight. In fact, one girl complained that she lost so much weightthat her breasts were significantly smaller. (Breast tissue is primarily fattissue.) Their scans showed positive changes as well, calming overactive areasinvolved in mood control and enhancing the concentration centers of the brain.Diet and fish oil help to balance brain function. The nice thing about thisapproach is that there are no side effects; unlike the medications used to helpbalance brain function, which sometimes are clearly needed, diet and fish oilhave no downside!Critics of the higher-protein diets say that the brain exclusively usescarbohydrates for energy, which is true. But they forget that protein is anessential component of nerve cells, axons, and dendrites—the machinery of thebrain. Low-protein diets leave the brain without critical resources.Neuroscientist Marian Diamond had an experience in Kenya that stimulatedimportant research. She found that pregnant women would not eat protein becauseit meant they would have to deliver a larger baby. It was much easier, in theirview, to reduce their protein intake to ensure a smaller baby and an easierdelivery. Dr. Diamond then wondered about the effect of reduced protein intakeon a developing infant’s brain. That became the subject of a series ofexperiments in her laboratory as soon as she returned home to Berkeley. One ofher graduate students, Arianna Carughi, fed half the pregnant rats a normalhigh-protein diet and the other half a low-protein diet. The body weight of thebabies whose mothers had been fed the reduced-protein diet was found to be 50percent less than that of the babies whose mothers had been given a normalprotein diet. And the brains? The dendrites in the reduced-protein baby rats didnot develop fully. When they placed the protein-deprived babies in an enrichedlearning environment, their dendrites did not increase significantly, as theydid in the normal-protein babies living in an enriched environment. It is clearthat a protein-rich diet is vital for growing healthy nerve cells that canrespond positively to enriched living conditions. Protein is essential to braingrowth.6. PICK YOUR TOP TWENTY-FOUR HEALTHY FOODS, AND PUT THEM IN YOUR DIET EVERY WEEKTo stick with a “brain healthy” calorie-restricted nutritional plan, you musthave great choices. I am fond of the book Super Foods Rx by Steven Pratt andKathy Matthews, which lists fourteen top food groups that are healthy andreasonable in calories. I have added several more choices (indicated by a doubleasterisk) that are especially good for the brain. Choose from among thesetwenty-four foods each week. They are healthy, low in calories, powerful inantioxidants, lean in protein, and rich in high-fiber carbohydrates and goodfat.The American Cancer Society recommends five to nine servings of fruits andvegetables a day. Mixing colors (eating from the rainbow) is a good way to thinkabout consuming healthy fruits and vegetables. Strive to eat red things(strawberries, raspberries, cherries, red peppers, and tomatoes), yellow things(squash, yellow peppers, small portions of bananas and peaches), blue things(blueberries), purple things (plums), orange things (oranges, tangerines, andyams), green things (peas, spinach, and broccoli), and so on.Lean Protein1. Fish—salmon (especially Alaskan salmon caught in the wild; farmed fish arenot as rich in omega-3 fatty acids), tuna, mackerel, herring (also listed underFats)2. Poultry—chicken (skinless) and turkey (skinless)3. Meat—lean beef and pork4. Eggs (enriched DHA eggs are best)5. Tofu and soy products (whenever possible, choose organically raised)6. Dairy products—low-fat cheeses and cottage cheese, low-fat sugar-freeyogurt, and low-fat or skim milk7. Beans, especially garbanzo beans and lentils (also listed under ComplexCarbohydrates)8. Nuts and seeds, especially walnuts (also listed under Fats). Great recipe:soak walnuts in water and sea salt overnight, drain and sprinkle with cinnamon(a natural blood sugar balancer), and low-roast four hours at 250°F—it makesthem easier to digest.Complex Carbohydrates9. Berries—especially blueberries (brain berries), raspberries, strawberries,and blackberries10. Oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruit11. Cherries12. Peaches, plums13. Broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts14. Oats, whole wheat, wheat germ. Oatmeal should be the long-cooking kind, asinstant has a higher glycemic index—the manufacturer breaks down the fiber tospeed the cooking time and basically makes it a refined carbohydrate. The samegoes for bread—look for at least three grams of fiber. Remember that unbleachedwheat flour is white flour—the label must say whole wheat.15. Red or yellow peppers (much higher in vitamin C than green peppers)16. Pumpkin squash17. Spinach—works wonderfully as a salad, or a cooked vegetable; adds fiber andnutrients18. Tomatoes19. Yams** Beans (also listed under Lean Protein)Fats20. Avocados21. Extra-virgin cold-pressed olive oil22. Olives** Salmon (also listed under Lean Protein)** Nuts and nut butter, especially walnuts, macadamia nuts, Brazil nuts, pecansand almonds (also listed under Lean Protein)Liquids23. Water24. Green or black tea7. PLAN SNACKSI love to snack; I just like to munch on things to get through the day. Whensnacking, as I’ve said, it is helpful to balance carbohydrates, proteins, andfats. Since I travel frequently, I have learned to take my snacks with me, so Iam not tempted to pick up candy bars along the way. One of my favoritelow-calorie snacks is dried fruits and vegetables. I don’t mean the kind ofdried fruits and vegetables stocked in typical supermarkets, which are filledwith preservatives. I mean the kind that just have the dried fruit and veggies.A company called Just Tomatoes, in Walnut, California (www.justtomatoes.com[http://www.justtomatoes.com]), makes great products. They make dried peaches(my favorite), strawberries (second favorite), mangoes, apples, cherries(fabulous), blackberries, blueberries (oh, so good), persimmons, and raspberrieswithout anything added. They also make a product called Just Veggies that is awonderfully sweet and crunchy snack of carrots, corn, peas, bell peppers, andtomatoes. It tastes like an unusual but wonderful popcorn and is as guiltless asnack as you will ever find. I keep some in my desk drawer and briefcase—perfectfor those afternoon hunger attacks. When you have dried fruit or veggies—allcarbohydrates—add some low-fat string cheese or a few nuts to balance it outwith protein and a little fat.• Deviled eggs with hummus: slice the eggs, discard the yolks, and fill with 1tablespoon hummus; add paprika to taste.• Low-fat cottage cheese with fruit and a couple of almonds or macadamia nuts• Low-fat yogurt and nuts• Ham and apple roll-up with a macadamia nut or three almonds• 1 ounce of string cheese and a half cup of grapesFrom the Barry Sears website www.drsears.com [http://www.drsears.com]: you cancreate an infinite number of healthy brain snacks by mixing one item from eachgroup.PROTEINS• 1⁄4 cup low-fat cottage cheese• 1 oz. part-skim or “lite” mozzarella• 21⁄2 oz. part-skim or “lite” ricotta cheese• 1 oz. sliced meat (turkey, ham, etc.)• 1 oz. tuna packed in water• 1 oz. low-fat, part-skim, or “soft” cheeseCARBOHYDRATES• 1⁄2 apple• 3 apricots• 1 kiwi• 1 tangerine• 1⁄3 cup “lite” fruit cocktail• 1⁄2 pear• 1 cup strawberries• 3⁄4 cup blackberries• 1⁄2 orange• 1⁄2 cup grapes• 8 cherries• 1⁄2 nectarine• 1 peach• 1 plum• 1⁄2 cup crushed pineapple• 1 cup raspberries• 1⁄2 cup blueberries• 1⁄2 grapefruit• 1–2 Akmak or other whole-grain fat-free crackersFATS• 3 olives (green or black)• 1 macadamia nut• 1 tbsp. guacamole• 3 almonds• 6 peanuts• 2 pecan halves• 1 tbsp. almond butterBRAIN-HEALTHY RECIPESHere are some brain-healthy recipes I use frequently in my own life. My favoriteis Dorie’s Truly Amazing Lamb, Beans, and Rice. It was one of my favorite foodsgrowing up. Originally it contained three times its current calorie count. Mymother and I worked on the recipe to decrease the calories but keep the flavor.When I cooked it recently for a group of family and friends, every diner’s platewas scraped clean. You can keep taste but get rid of calories—it just takes alittle thought. Consistency is what counts with nutrition.

I am fortunate to live in California, where we have ElPollo Loco (suits a psychiatrist), where it is easy to find balanced, healthfulmeals. Due to customer demand, most fast-food restaurants also have healthieralternatives. For a fast-food breakfast, I often have a combination of scrambledeggs and a piece of fruit from McDonald’s. For lunch or dinner there are manychoices. The Wendy’s large-size chili (no fries, saltines, or Coke) is only 300calories and is a good balance between carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Jackin the Box’s chicken fajita pita (hold the onion rings and soft drink) is also300 calories and is nicely balanced. Burger King’s BK Broiler, minus a quarterof the bun, also fits this category. At Subway a turkey breast sub with extrameat helps make a balanced meal (no cookie, of course). They also have a greatlow-carb wrap sandwich to which you can add a variety of veggies. I am very fondof the new salads at most fast-food restaurants. Some of them are quite tastyand very low in calories, but be careful with the salad dressings, as they oftenhave more calories than the salads themselves.LET’S GO SHOPPING THROUGH THE MARKETI grew up in grocery stores. My father owns a grocery chain in southernCalifornia, and I have spent my life in and out of them. Many people getconfused about how to shop in a brain-healthy way. So here are some tips.1. Stay away from foods at the checkout stand. They are impulse foods (gearedto people with low frontal lobes), such as candy and soft drinks, and grocershope to add to your bill by getting you to buy them before you leave.2. Shop on the outside aisles of the store. You will find the producedepartment, meat and fish department, and dairy departments on the outsideaisles. It’s best if most of your food comes from there.3. Bring a list, and stick to it. Planning ahead of time will get you in andout with what you need and help you avoid impulse buying.4. Do not shop when you are hungry! You will buy more food, and more junk food,than you need.5. Buy in bulk when possible. I buy twenty to forty packages of frozenblueberries at a time. The checkout clerks often look at me in a strange way. Ialways tell them about brain berries.6. In the produce department go for the spinach, broccoli, red peppers,oranges, lemons, and limes.7. In the meat department get skinless chicken and turkey, salmon, and ahituna. In my fast-paced lifestyle, I often buy a roasted chicken (very tender)and cut it up to put in omelets and on salads throughout the week.8. In the dairy case look for plain yogurt and soymilk, DHA eggs, or EggBeaters.9. In the deli case look for low-fat cheeses, such as mozzarella and stringcheese. Choose lean meats, such as Canadian bacon.10. In the frozen-food section look for frozen fruits and vegetables. I alreadymentioned the blueberries. Stir-fry vegetables are often low in calories andhave many of the foods we want with no preservatives.11. Stay away from store-bought fruit juices. Many people, especially parents,have the mistaken idea that they are health foods, but they are mainly liquidsugar with a few vitamins added. Whole fruit is much better, or the pulp-filledjuices you squeeze at home.12. There is no constitutional amendment that children have a right to junkfood. Parents somehow feel that they are depriving their kids if they are notallowed to have cookies and ice cream. Teach them how to eat for their brainswhen they are young, and they are likely to develop good habits that will servethem their whole lives. Exposure equals preference, so what you feed them nowcan help determine their long-term food choices.At work I do not allow employees to have candy on their desks. It invitessharing—not only the candy but also the low blood sugar, the foggy minds, andthe lower productivity that come from the candy. What businesses serve atmeetings is silly. If they understood about eating for the brain, they wouldlose the coffee, juices, muffins, Danishes, and doughnuts and replace them withwater, herbal teas, fruit, cheeses, whole grains, deviled eggs, and nuts.Recently the Amen Clinics had a company board meeting. Here was the menu,seeking to honor healthy brains.• Spinach Salad, with red peppers, tomatoes, and an olive oil vinaigrette• JT’s Grilled Salmon and Trout• Steamed broccoli and asparagus• EZ Blue Rider (for dessert)One final thought on food. Your thoughts about and attitude toward food willeither help you create a better brain or throw you off track. But it is easy tostay the course if you see this nutritional plan as not only good for you but anadvantage for your brain and body. If you feel deprived or have a negativeattitude about it, there is no way you’ll stick to it."},{"pageContent":"12BRAIN WORKOUTSKEEPING THE BRAIN YOUNG THROUGH MENTAL EXERCISE“We must CHALLENGE the brain. It gets bored; we know that well.”—Marian Diamond“You know you’ve got to exercise your brain just like your muscles.”—Will RogersYour brain is like a muscle: the more you use it, the more you can continueusing it. New learning causes new connections to form in the brain. No learningcauses the brain to start disconnecting itself. No matter what your age, mentalexercise has a global, positive effect on your brain.In three decades of brain research, celebrated neuroscientist Marian Diamond, ofthe University of California at Berkeley, has helped revolutionize the way wethink about brain health. In a lecture to the American Society on Aging in 2001she said, “We now know that with proper stimulation and an enriched environment,the human brain can continue to develop at any age.” Her work used middle-agedrats, the equivalent of sixty-year-old humans, and older rats, somecorresponding to humans at ninety. Dr. Diamond and her co-workers were able toshow that with added enrichment—such as colorful toys and balls, exerciseequipment, new mazes, and other rodents for companionship—the size and cognitiveability of the rats’ brains improved. Rats that were raised in social groups andhad a changing variety of toys and other experiences were much better at runningmazes than were rats reared in isolation and deprived of stimulation. Theirbrains also looked different. They had many more sprouting dendrites, nervecells, and blood vessels and a thicker cerebral cortex. “We used middle-agedrats partly because they have a similar cortex to humans,” Diamond said.Diamond, in her early seventies, says it was “comforting to find we can changethe brain at any age. We’re saying that if you use your brain, you can change itas much as a younger brain.” She said it may take the older brain longer torespond, but change does happen. In her opinion, people would be wise to thinkof their brain as a muscle. Left in isolation, evidence shows, brain cells beginto shrink and shut down.The best mental exercise is acquiring new knowledge and doing things that youhave not done before. New learning helps the brain. Doing the things you havealways done is not helpful for the brain, even if those things are fairlycomplicated. For instance, I have spent many hours over the past fifteen yearsreading brain scans. When I first started reading them in 1991, it took me a lotof time and mental effort. My brain worked hard to read them correctly. Over theyears, as my brain has become more and more familiar with the scans and thetechnology that underlies them, reading a scan takes much less time and mentaleffort. If all I did from here on out was read scans and not engage in otherforms of novel learning, my brain would no longer benefit from the work.Whenever the brain does something over and over, even a complicated task, itlearns how to do it using less and less energy. Learning a new medicaltechnique, a new hobby, or a new game helps establish new connections, thusmaintaining and improving the function of other less-often-used brain areas.The famous Nuns Study, conducted by researchers at the Rush University MedicalCenter in Chicago, shows the power of this “use it or lose it” principle ofmental exercise. The researchers studied how often 801 older nuns, priests, andother clergy engaged in mentally stimulating activities, such as reading anewspaper, over five years. They discovered that those who increased theirmental activity over the five years reduced their chance of developingAlzheimer’s disease by one-third. These more mentally active individuals alsoreduced their age-related decline in overall mental abilities by 50 percent, inconcentration and attention span by 60 percent, and in mental processing speedby 30 percent.Learning has a very real effect on neurons: it keeps them firing and makes iteasier for them to fire. The brain has approximately a thousand trillionsynapses, each one of which may wither and die if it is not actively firing.Like muscles that don’t get used, idle nerve cells waste away. The brain hasmany, many different circuits. Any set of circuits that does not get used growsweak. For example, middle-aged people who go back to college often feel slow andstupid at first, but after a few semesters of mental exercise, they findacademic studies easy again. With age, the level of activity of the enzymes inone’s cells starts to decline. The cells become less efficient, and the brainisn’t quite as agile as that of an eighteen-year-old. But in some ways youngerpeople are at a disadvantage. In certain respects the fifty-year-old will dobetter in academic studies, because as one ages one’s frontal lobes are betterdeveloped, which usually helps a person pay better attention in class and askbetter questions. A more developed frontal lobe allows you to take betteradvantage of new knowledge, to know what to focus on, and to relate it to lifeexperiences so that it has more useful value to you. The eighteen-year-old maybe able to memorize facts more easily, but his frontal lobe isn’t as good atselecting which facts to memorize.The human brain depends on proper stimulation, such as from reading, to grow anddevelop in healthy ways throughout childhood and to maintain its functioninginto old age. When you stimulate neurons in the right way, you make them moreefficient; they function better, and you are more likely to have an active,learning brain throughout your life. Long-term potentiation (LTP) is thephysiology of learning. It is the process of invigorating (or potentiating)neurons to do their job over a long period of time. Learning is accomplished,quite simply, through the repetition of an act that causes actual physicalchanges in neurons and their synapses. LTP causes the nerve endings to getbigger, which creates a significant advantage on three fronts. One, they areharder to damage. Two, the larger surface area on the neurons allows for greatersignals to pass between cells, enhancing efficient communication. And three, inthe process of potentiation, receiving neurons can generate their own signalswith less input in the future; this means that once LTP has occurred, it takesless energy to do something well. For instance, a pianist who has beenpracticing a piece by Rachmaninoff will be able, after a year, to play itwithout struggle, without thinking about it, because he has been steadilystimulating the synapses in the neurons that control his finger movements sothey can execute the proper sequence to play the piece. He has “potentiated” hisneurons in just the right way to accomplish that goal. In order to keeplearning, he must begin work on a new piece.THIRTEEN PRACTICAL WAYS TO EXERCISE YOUR BRAIN1. Dedicate yourself to new learning. Put fifteen minutes in your day intolearning something new. Einstein said that if someone spent fifteen minutes aday learning something new, in a year he would be an expert. As in school orbusiness, commitment is critical to achieving greatness—or a great brain.2. Take a class about something new and interesting. In many areas of thecountry community colleges and groups such as the Learning Annex(www.learningannex.com [http://www.learningannex.com]) offer low-cost classes ona wide variety of subjects. Attend a new class on a subject totally unrelated toyour day-to-day life. It is important to challenge your brain to learn new andnovel things. Examples include square dancing (great exercise), chess, tai chi,yoga, or sculpture. Working with modeling clay or Play-Doh can be good for bothchildren and adults to help them grow new connections. It helps develop agilityand hand-brain coordination.3. Cross-train at work. Learn someone else’s job. Maybe even switch jobs forseveral weeks. This benefits the business and employees alike, as both workerswill develop new skills and better brain function. For example, in a grocerystore employees can be taught to work as checkout clerks, stock shelves, orderproducts, and alternately work in the produce, grocery, and dairy sections ofthe store.4. Improve your skills at things you already do. Some repetitive mentalstimulation is okay, as long as you look to expand your skill and knowledgebase. Common activities such as gardening, sewing, playing bridge, reading,painting, and doing crossword puzzles have value, but push yourself to dodifferent gardening techniques, more complex sewing patterns, play bridgeagainst more talented players, read new authors on varied subjects, learn a newpainting technique, and work harder at crossword puzzles. Pushing your brain tonew heights helps to keep it healthy and strong.5. Limit television for kids and adults. A study published in the journalPediatrics reported that for every hour a day children watch TV, there is a 10percent increased chance that they will be diagnosed with ADD. This means thatif children watch five hours a day, they have a 50 percent chance of beingdiagnosed with ADD. According to the American Academy of Child and AdolescentPsychiatry, children spend three to four hours a day watching TV. Another study,and several others like it, showed that increased television watching inchildhood put people at risk for problems as adults. Dr. R. J. Hancox andcolleagues from the department of preventive and social medicine in Dunedin, NewZealand, assessed approximately a thousand children born in 1972–73, at regularintervals up to age twenty-six. They found a significant association betweenhigher body-mass index, lower physical fitness, increased cigarette smoking, andraised serum cholesterol. All these factors are involved in brain illnesses,such as strokes or Alzheimer’s disease. Yet another study found that adults whowatched TV two or more hours a day had a significantly higher risk ofAlzheimer’s disease. Watching TV is usually a “no-brain” activity. To be fair,these studies did not specify if watching programs that teach you something havethe same effect as situation comedies or sports. I suspect that no-brain TVshows are the primary problem.6. Limit video games. As a child psychiatrist and a father of three children, Ihave thought a lot about video games over the past fifteen years. At first, Ifound them great fun to play. Then I started to worry. Action video games havebeen studied using brain-imaging techniques that look at blood flow and activitypatterns. Video games have been found to work in the basal ganglia, one of thepleasure centers in the brain (see Chapter 5). In fact, this is the same part ofthe brain that lights up when researchers inject a person with cocaine. Myexperience with patients and one of my own children is that they tend to gethooked on the games and play so much that it can deteriorate their schoolwork,their work, and their social time, a bit like a drug. Some children and adultsactually do get hooked on them.Some scientific literature reports that video games may increase the frequencyof seizures in people who are sensitive to them. You may remember the seizurescare on December 16, 1997, when the Japanese cartoon “Pocket Monster” (Pokémon)showed an explosion of red, white, and yellow lights that triggered 730 Japanesechildren in one evening to go to the hospital with new-onset seizures. Thecondition is called photosensitive seizures (seizures triggered by light). Ioften think video games trigger subclinical seizures in vulnerable kids andadults, causing behavior or learning problems.Two studies from the University of Missouri examined the effects of violentvideo games (a significant percentage of video games) on aggression. One studyfound that violent real-life simulation video-game play was positively relatedto aggressive behavior and delinquency. The more people played, the more troublethey seemed to have. Academic performance deteriorated with increased time spentplaying video games. In the second study, laboratory exposure to a graphicallyviolent video game increased aggressive thoughts and behavior. The results fromboth studies suggest that exposure to violent video games will increaseaggressive behavior in both the short term (such as laboratory aggression) andthe long term (such as delinquency). A comprehensive review of other studiesfound time and again that exposure to violent video games is significantlylinked to increases in aggressive behavior, aggressive thoughts, aggressivefeelings, and cardiovascular arousal, and to decreases in helping behavior. Noneof this is good for overall brain health.I recently had an experience that highlights how important TV and video gamesare to mental health problems. Joshua, a twelve-year-old boy, had been seeing mefor several years for aggression, oppositional behavior, moodiness, and schoolfailure. It took me quite a while to get him stabilized, but with parenttraining, psychotherapy, and some supplements, he was doing great. Then he wentto stay with his dad for three weeks and totally relapsed. His father let himwatch all the TV and play all the video games he wanted. Joshua quickly revertedback to his nasty behavior and actually started to pull out his own hair (a signof anxiety and compulsiveness). When we stopped both TV and video games, hequickly improved.When video games came into my home, my son was in the sixth grade (fifteen yearsago). I noticed over time that he played more and more, even when he was told tostop. His grades went down, and his level of defiance went up. After two yearsof difficult behavior, I took the games out of the house. Thankfully, my girlshave never been very interested. I do not think video games give kids or adultsany long-term value. They do not help you get most jobs (one exception may beflight-simulator games), and I think they train the brain to need more and morestimulation to be able to focus. There are many reasons why the incidence inlearning and behavior problems has doubled in the last twenty years. I believevideo games may be part of the puzzle.7. Join a reading group that keeps you accountable to new learning. Almost anymental activity you enjoy can be used to protect your brain. The essentialrequirement is that it activates several different brain areas, one of whichshould be the hippocampus (in the temporal lobes), which stores new informationfor retrieval later on. By recalling information (using your hippocampus), youare protecting your brain’s memory centers. In essence, as long as you learnsomething new and work to recall it later for discussions, you are protectingyour short-term memory.Reading stimulates a wide variety of brain areas that process, understand, andanalyze what you read, then store it for later recall if you decide it’s worthremembering. The neurons in these activated brain areas are stimulated withspecific patterns of information. Each time you read, the neurons activated inyour brain’s visual circuits further strengthen their synapses so you canprocess what you read with increasing efficiency. Each time you try tounderstand what you read, the neurons in your working memory circuits strengthentheir synapses so you can understand reading material with increasingefficiency. Each time you try to learn something you read for recall later, theneurons in the hippocampus further strengthen their synapses so you can encodeand store new information with increasing efficiency. Each time you try andrecall what you just learned, after a delay of at least two minutes, neurons inthe frontal lobe further strengthen their synapses so you can retrieve storedinformation with increasing efficiency. Given this information, it is evenbetter to join a reading group, where you are pushed to remember what you readfor later discussion, than to read novels or newspapers that you may justforget.8. Practice does not make perfect. Perfect practice make perfect. The brain doesnot interpret what you feed into it; it simply translates it. When you arelearning to play the piano, the brain doesn’t care if you are becoming a greatpiano player or a terrible piano player. Consequently, if you repeat imperfectfingering, you will become very good at playing imperfectly. If you are trainingyourself to be a perfect pianist, it is essential that you practice perfectlyand not learn bad habits or sloppy fingering of the keys. To play well, it ishelpful to work with a professional who can correct your mistakes. Your braindoesn’t care what you give it, so if you care whether you do something well orbadly, you must be certain that you are giving your brain the right training.This is why it is essential that children have good teachers who watch andmonitor their progress, and why we need to have effective training programs inthe workplace. Teaching someone to do something well at the start prevents themfrom developing bad habits, which get solidified in the brain and aresubsequently hard to retrain.I was once a consultant to a large medical practice that had significantemployee turnover problems. As I investigated the problem, I discovered that theoffice manager was poorly trained and had little social skill. She was rude andinappropriate with patients, and she subsequently modeled that behavior to thefront office staff. She was resistant to retraining (a cingulate gyrus thatlikely worked too hard), and ultimately she needed to be replaced.Effective initial training in the workplace and in school is essential todeveloping effective, happy employees and students. We do not just train people,we train brains.9. Break the routine of your life to stimulate new parts of your brain. Toactivate the other side of your brain and gain access to both hemispheres, dothe opposite of what feels natural. Write with your other hand, shootbasketballs with both hands, hit baseballs left-handed (if you areright-handed), play table tennis left-handed, shoot a rifle sighting with yourother eye, use the mouse with your other hand—make your brain feeluncomfortable. In essence, break the patterned routine in your life to challengeyour brain to make new connections. Here are some more ideas.• Make love in a different way.• Try a sport you’ve never tried before.• Take a class in a subject you know nothing about.• Learn new cooking recipes.• Do some volunteer work—see how good you’ll feel when you help others.• Try a different shampoo/soap/shaving cream/razor/toothpaste/perfume/cologne.• Go to church, or a different church.• Go to an opera or symphony concert.• Join a self-development group.• Spend time reading the dictionary or a reference book—learn a new word eachday.• Take time out each day to strengthen a special relationship, with a spouse,lover, child, or friend.• Make a new friend—call up someone and ask him or her to do something withyou.• Contact an old friend you haven’t talked to in a while.• Submit a new idea at work, maybe even one you’ve thought about for a whilebut were too embarrassed to mention because you thought no one would beinterested in it.• Forgive someone you hold a grudge against. This is a new activity for manypeople.10. Compare how similar things work. Evaluating similar items—how differentpitchers throw a curve ball, the many ways painters can paint ocean scenes, thevarying spices in meals—gives your brain a sensory workout. Looking atsimilarities and differences helps the brain’s ability to think abstractly andchallenges our frontal lobes. Learning to see, hear, feel, or taste subtlechanges will enhance your sensory ability and stimulate brain growth.11. Visit new and different places. Traveling to new and interesting placeshelps the brain by exposing it to new experiences, scents, sights, and people.Using maps stimulates the brain in new and different ways and also exercises ourparietal lobes, which are responsible for visual-spatial guidance.12. Cultivate smart friends. People are contagious. You become like the peoplewith whom you spend time. Work on developing friendships with new, interestingpeople. You can trade ideas, get new perspectives, and generally stretch yourmind if you are surrounded by fascinating folks. In playing any game, if youwant to be better, you have to play with people who are better than you, to pushyou to your limit. The same principle holds true in pushing your brain to newheights. Spend time with people who challenge you.13. Treat learning problems to help kids and adults stay in school. Numerousstudies show that better-educated people have less risk of Alzheimer’s diseaseand cognitive decline. Millions of children, teens, and adults suffer from ADDand learning problems that cause them to struggle in school or with learningdespite having normal or even high intelligence. Recognizing these problems andgetting them the help they need is essential to making lifelong learning areality. You can take an online test for ADD at www.amen[http://www.Amen]clinic.com [http://www.clinic.com].Mental exercise is as important as diet and physical exercise for keeping bothyour body and brain strong."},{"pageContent":"13EXERCISE FOR YOUR BRAINPhysical exercise protects and enhances your brain. It is perhaps the singlemost important thing you can do to keep your neurons healthy over time. Moderateexercise improves the heart’s ability to pump blood throughout the body andhelps maintain healthy blood flow to the brain, which increases oxygen andglucose delivery. Exercise also reduces damage to neurons from toxic substancesfrom the environment and enhances insulin’s ability to prevent high-blood-sugarlevels, thereby reducing the risk of diabetes. Physical exercise also helpsprotect the short-term memory structures in your temporal lobes (hippocampus)from high-stress conditions. Stress causes the adrenal glands to produceexcessive amounts of the hormone cortisol, which has been found to kill cells inthe hippocampus and hurt memory. In fact, people with Alzheimer’s disease havehigher cortisol levels than normal aging people.Physical exercise makes the whole body healthier. It does this by improving thetone of the blood vessels, which decreases the risk for high blood pressure,stroke, and heart disease and increases blood flow to every organ in the body tomake them hardier. Additionally, it helps maintain coordination, agility, andspeed. The Honolulu Study of Aging found that untreated high blood pressureduring midlife (forty to sixty years old) greatly increases the risk fordementia. For middle-aged people with a systolic blood pressure of 160 mm Hg orhigher, or a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher, the risk ofdementia after seventy years old was 3.8 to 4.8 times greater than those whosehigh blood pressure was treated. This study emphasizes the importance of gettingregular exercise and proper treatment for any medical conditions you may have.Exercise actually stimulates neurogenesis, the ability of the brain to generatenew neurons. When laboratory rats exercise, research shows, they generate newneurons in the frontal lobe and hippocampus, which survive for about four weeksand then die off unless they are stimulated. If you stimulate these new neuronsthrough mental or social interaction, they connect to other neurons and becomeintegrated into brain circuits that help maintain their functions throughoutyour life. This is why people who only work out at the gym are not as smart aspeople who work out and then go to the library. Exercise exerts a protectiveeffect on hippocampal neurons that lasts about three days. Therefore the minimumfrequency of exercise is every three days, or three times a week. Studies haveshown that the more frequently you exercise, the greater the benefits.Lack of exercise negatively affects blood supply in the body. Exercise increasesthe chemical nitric oxide, which helps keep blood vessel walls open and round.In order to keep your blood vessels open, blood must pulse through them. Withoutgood blood flow, the levels of nitric oxide drop and cause the blood vesselwalls to become distorted and limit the flow of blood. The most effective way tomake blood flow pulse through arteries is to exercise. Without pulsatile flow,the blood vessels in the deep areas of the brain distort and limit blood flow,increasing the chance of tiny strokes. Over a period of years, these strokesaccumulate and cause these deep brain areas to stop working. The deep brainareas control leg movement, coordinated body movement, and speed of thinking andbehaving. Strokes in these areas produce a clinical picture that closelyresembles Parkinson’s disease because it affects similar brain areas. This iswhy people who do not exercise after forty years of age are not as mentallysharp as people who exercise regularly.Developing a regular habit of physical exercise is a major preventive strategyfor age-related memory problems, but don’t wait until you’re seventy-five tostart exercising. The Sydney Older Persons Study found that exercise levels inpersons seventy-five years and older did not reduce risk of Alzheimer’s diseaseor other causes of dementia. This means that it is important to establish aregular habit of exercise in your life now, not to wait until your seventies tostart.Exercise also enhances the production of glutathione, which is the majorantioxidant in all cells, to protect your muscles and other tissues against freeradical damage. Conversely, chronic inactivity (“couch potato” syndrome) reducescell glutathione levels, so that free radicals can damage your cells and triggerprogrammed cell death.Research has shown that the benefits of mild to moderate exercise include:• Protecting brain cells against toxins, including free radicals• Repairing cellular DNA to help protect against programmed cell death• Reducing the risks of cognitive impairment and dementia due to Alzheimer’sdisease by about 50 percent in persons over sixty-five• Preserving mental abilities after age seventy• Reducing the risks of heart disease and stroke by improving cholesterol andfat metabolism, plus improving blood, oxygen, and glucose delivery to tissues• Reducing the risk of diabetes by making insulin better control your bloodsugar (glucose) and increasing your lean-to-fat mass ratio• Reducing the risk of osteoporosis by reducing bone loss (estrogen enhancesthis effect)• Reducing the risk of depression• Reducing the risks of colon and breast cancer• Reducing the risks of falling by improving muscle tone and endurance, andreducing strokes to the deep brain areasIn a large study from Quebec, Dr. D. Laurin and colleagues explored theassociation between physical activity and the risk of cognitive impairment anddementia. They gathered information from a community sample of 9,008 randomlyselected men and women sixty-five or older who were evaluated in the 1991–92Canadian Study of Health and Aging, a prospective group study of dementia. Ofthe 6,434 eligible subjects who were cognitively normal at baseline, 4,615completed a five-year follow-up. Screening and clinical evaluations were done atboth times of the study. In 1996–97, 3,894 subjects remained without cognitiveimpairment, 436 were diagnosed as having cognitive impairment but no dementia(mild cognitive impairment), and 285 were diagnosed as having dementia. Comparedwith lack of exercise, physical activity was associated with lower risks ofcognitive impairment, Alzheimer’s disease, and dementia of any type. High levelsof physical activity were associated with even more reduced risks. Theyconcluded that regular physical activity could represent an important and potentprotective factor against cognitive decline and dementia in elderly people.The best kinds of exercise improve the pump force of your heart (cardiovascularexercise) and strengthen the muscles of your body (resistive exercise).Cardiovascular exercise involves gradually warming up your muscles, thenexercising them for thirty minutes or more (by walking, running, swimming,rowing, cycling, stair climbing, cross-country skiing, and so on), to developmuscle tone for endurance. Resistive exercise builds muscle strength byexercising the muscles against resistance (by doing sit-ups, push-ups, liftingweights, rowing, stair climbing, swimming, cycling, cross-country skiing, and soon). As you can see, several types of exercise fall into both categories,including rowing, stair climbing, swimming, cycling, and cross-country skiing.You can also make walking and running into resistive exercises if you addweights.TABLE TENNIS IS THE WORLD’S BEST BRAIN SPORTMy favorite exercise is table tennis. Some people laugh when I say this atlectures, but I am very serious. “Ping-Pong,” they scoff, “is only a basementrecreational game.” You certainly haven’t met my mother (the mother with theperfect brain). I remember when I was a young child and would sit in thebackyard, amazed that she would beat all comers to the table. She was intenseand had wonderful reflexes. I remember watching her trying to keep up with thelittle white ball. I played a lot as a child with my siblings, but I didn’treally become skilled until I spent three years in Germany as a young soldier inthe U.S. Army. The military, as highlighted in the movie Forrest Gump, hastennis tables in almost all recreation centers. With my childhood background, Iwas better than most players and won several tournaments. I then developed afriendship with a soldier from the West Indies, René, who was achampionship-caliber player. We spent hour after hour playing at the USO inFrankfurt. One of my strategies in life is to try to be with people who arebetter than me at whatever I am doing. They help me be better, and losing toRené was no big deal as long as I kept getting better. I was thrilled that atthe end of my tour I was finally able to beat him. We joined a German tabletennis club and spent many hours interacting with our new friends around thetable.If you are an American, you still may think that calling table tennis a sport issilly, but I think it is the best brain sport ever. It is highly aerobic, usesboth the upper and lower body, is great for eye-hand coordination and reflexes,and causes you to use many different areas of the brain at once as you aretracking the ball, planning shots and strategies, and figuring out spins. It islike aerobic chess. Plus, it causes very few head injuries. Table tennis—orPing-Pong, the name given to the sport by the Parker Brothers game company tosell more equipment—is the second most popular organized sport in the world.Even more impressive, it is the youngest of the world’s major sports. At thecompetitive level, players hit the ball in excess of ninety miles per houracross the table!Table tennis is now recognized as an Olympic sport, making its debut in the 1988Seoul games. You can find the sport televised throughout the world at any giventime. From the Hong Kong Invitational to the World Table Tennis Championships tothe Olympics, table tennis is completely sold out for all sessions.In the United States there are many table tennis clubs and even more greatplayers. The best way to start playing table tennis is to get a table and learnthe basics of the game. I often recommend getting a USATT (United States ofAmerica Table Tennis) coach to ramp up skill quickly. The game is more fun ifyou can play well. You can learn more about table tennis rules, equipment,coaches, and places to play at www.usatt.org [http://www.usatt.org].Exercise has profound and broad-based effects on health. A study done at CaseWestern Reserve University looked at how much TV people watch each day, whichcorrelates with their exercise level. People who watched two or more hours of TVa day (couch potatoes) were twice as likely to develop Alzheimer’s. In contrast,people over forty years old who exercise at least thirty minutes per session twoor more times a week reaped many benefits.The data on exercise is impressive and incontrovertible. Our distant ancestorsexercised as part of daily life when they hunted and gathered food, fled theirenemies, and tracked down a mate. In the modern world, where we sit in a cubiclein front of a computer screen all day, then come home at night and slump in arecliner to watch TV, we have to make an effort to do what our ancestors did asa matter of course. Our bodies did not evolve to be motionless and inert; theyevolved with muscles, hearts, and cardiovascular systems that need to beactivated.The greatest obstacle most people have in committing to regular exercise ismaking it a habit. People don’t think twice about brushing their teeth,showering, or dressing in the morning, or adjusting the rearview mirror whenthey climb into the car, because these activities are all habits that they’vetrained their brains to perform automatically. A habit is a series of actionsyour brain executes, when you tell it to do so, fairly automatically and withouteffort. But it requires many repetitions before your brain learns toautomatically perform a function. Think of how many times it took you to learnto ride your bike without training wheels. The real challenge of exercise is totrain your brain to make exercise a habit.The best chance of making exercise a habit is to schedule a specific time andplace to exercise each day or at least on specific days each week. Considerusing the same shoes and clothing and doing the workout in the same place, buthave a variety of exercises to choose from so you can vary the routine. The ideais to exercise consistently according to schedule for the first few months.After several months you will find that you no longer think about whether youwant to get out there and work out or not—you just do it. When you reach thatpoint, it has become a habit, one that will keep you and your brain healthy andthat will save you more money than any other single thing you will ever do foryour health. It’s well worth the effort."},{"pageContent":"14COORDINATE YOUR BRAINCoordination enhancement, like exercise, helps balance brain function. Thebrain’s major coordination center is thought to be the cerebellum, about thesize of a fist, located at the back bottom of the brain. It is involved inbalance, posture, gait, and motor coordination. In addition, it is thought to bepart of thought coordination, or how quickly you can integrate new informationand think on your feet. Given that the cerebellum has about half of all thebrain’s neurons, it may also be involved in processing speed, much like thePentium chips running our newer computers.If you are as old as I am—fifty, at the time I am writing this book—you mayremember the old AT and XT processing chips in the computers of the early 1980s.They were amazing at the time, but compared to the computers of today, they wereever so slow. I remember trying to pull up image files on the old computers.Sometimes they would take twenty or thirty minutes to upload. The image wouldcome up one line at a time. And remember the early days of very slow Internetmodem connections? It would take so long to go to a new site or downloadmaterial that you could get a cup of tea and read the paper. Having a small orsluggish cerebellum is like living in a Pentium world with an old XT computer inyour head; you are slower, have less processing speed, and are more easilyfrustrated. In fact, problems in the cerebellum are associated with slowmovements, slowed speech, and slowed thought processes.My patient Ralph’s case clearly illustrates the functions of the cerebellum andwhat happens when things go wrong. Ralph was sent to me by his neurologistbecause he was having family problems; he was often socially inappropriate andwas argumentative and uncooperative. As a child he had had a viral braininfection that left him with a permanent inability to perform coordinatedmovements, speak clearly, and behave appropriately at work or in socialcircumstances. He had been fired from many jobs because of this “attitude”problem. Despite being intelligent, he also had problems with learning andmemory. His SPECT scan showed virtually no activity in his cerebellum—damagefrom the viral attack when he was young. At the time of the scan his speech wasslow, his thought processes were delayed, it took him almost a minute to answerquestions, and his walk was slow and unsteady. After treating him for threemonths with memantine (a new medication for memory loss) and targeted exercises,the family reported that he was more coordinated, spoke more clearly, andbehaved more appropriately. Soon he was able to start working again.After doing research on our database, we found highly statistical relationshipsbetween low cerebellar activity and the following issues:• Poor planning skills• Absence of clear goals or forward thinking• Inattention to detail• Difficulty expressing empathy for others• Trouble maintaining an organized work or living area• Messy room and/or multiple piles around room• Poor or messy handwriting• Messy or disorganized notebook/paperwork• Frequent lateness or rushing• Not writing down assignments or tasks and forgetting what to do• Light sensitivity, irritation from glare, sunlight, headlights, orstreetlights• Feeling of tension, tiredness, sleepiness, or headaches with reading• Problems judging distance and difficulty with escalators, stairs, ballsports, or driving• Greater sensitivity to the environment than others• Greater sensitivity to noise than others• Particular sensitivity to touch or to certain clothing or clothing tags• Unusual sensitivity to certain smells• Sensitivity to movement or craving for spinning activities• Tendency to be clumsy or accident-proneAccording to our database, people’s main struggles with low activity in thecerebellum appear to be centered on planning, goal-setting, details,organization, time management, perception, coordination, and filtering outextraneous input. Interestingly, alcohol intoxication affects all of theseareas—clumsiness, bad judgment, disorganized behavior, altered perceptions—andhas been found to be directly toxic to cells in the cerebellum. The scans of ouralcoholics tend to show very low activity in this part of the brain. Clue numberone to enhancing cerebellar activity—reduce alcohol consumption.The next step to optimizing cerebellar function and cognitive speed and agilityis engaging in regular exercises that activate this coordination center.Activating the cerebellum helps it work more efficiently and with greater speed.In our scans, professional athletes and musicians (not the drug-affected ones)show the best cerebellar activity. They dedicate their lives to usingcoordinated body efforts to perform their skills. The ongoing repetition ofcoordinated activities (practice) dramatically helps this part of the brain. Theaverage person who wishes to make use of this principle needs to putcoordination exercises into his or her weekly routine. Any exercise thatenhances fine or gross motor coordination can be helpful, such as playing amusical instrument, learning or practicing a sport that requires skill (withlittle risk of a brain injury, such as golf, tennis, or table tennis), doingmartial arts or yoga, and dancing.Juggling may be a particularly good exercise for the brain. When people spendthree months learning to juggle, according to a paper published in Nature, partsof their brains grow. Researchers in Germany split twenty-four students into twogroups, one of which was given three months to learn a classic three-ballcascade juggling routine. Brain scans were then carried out on both sets ofvolunteers. The brains of the jugglers and nonjugglers were scanned before andafter the three-month learning period. The jugglers had more gray matter in thetemporal and parietal lobes. The study indicates that the brain can grow andbecome stronger based on what we do and practice. A cool website to learn tojuggle is www.juggling.org [http://www.juggling.org].There are also structured programs geared toward enhancing cerebellar activity.Two of these programs are the Interactive Metronome and the Brain Gym.The Interactive Metronome (IM) combines the concept of a musical metronome witha computer program that measures, assesses, and improves a person’s rhythm andtiming. It helps the brain plan, sequence, and process information throughrepetition of interactive exercises. The individual performs thirteen differenthand and foot exercises while auditory guide tones direct him or her to matchthe metronome beat. The difference between the individual’s response and thecomputer-generated beat is measured in milliseconds (ms), and a score isprovided. A low ms score indicates improved timing and overall performance. Theprogram consists of either twelve or fifteen one-hour sessions that can becompleted in three to five weeks.The IM program has been shown to produce significant results in children andadults with a wide range of physical and cognitive difficulties, including ADD.The March–April 2001 issue of the American Journal of Occupational Therapyidentified five core areas of statistically significant improvements gainedthrough the IM program:Attention and focusMotor control and coordinationLanguage processingReading and math fluencyAbility to regulate aggression/impulsivityIM also seems to improve golf scores. A study published in the Journal ofGeneral Psychology concluded that IM training improves golf accuracy as well asother complex motor activities. This program is worth looking into to helpbalance coordination and cognitive processing. You can learn more about it atwww.interactivemetronome.com [http://www.interactivemetronome.com].Brain Gym is a technique known worldwide to enhance learning and coordination.It was first developed by Dr. Paul Dennison in the early 1970s and involves aseries of exercises designed to boost overall brain function. It has beenreported to help both children and adults with ADD and learning disabilities andalso helps to alleviate stress. In the 1970s it was already established thatcertain development movements were necessary for brain function. The theory isthat activities, such as crawling, that stimulate both sides of the brainfacilitate speech and language. But Dr. Dennison discovered that cross-crawlactivities (touching the left hand to the right knee alternating touching theright hand to the left knee) worked by stimulating both the expressive and thereceptive hemispheres of the brain and facilitated integrated learning. When youfind yourself exasperated by your crawling child, you can relax in the knowledgethat it is not only natural but a necessary stage in development. Many of mypatients have reported benefits from Brain Gym exercises. You can learn moreabout this technique at www.braingym.com [http://www.braingym.com]. Below areseveral examples of the exercises. Try a few to see if they work for you.BRAIN BUTTONSHow to do it: Make a C shape with the thumb and index finger of one hand, andplace them at either side of your breastbone just below the collarbone. Gentlyrub for 20 or 30 seconds while placing your other hand over your navel. Thenchange hands and repeat. This reportedly helps with clear thinking, “keepingplace” while reading, crossing the visual midline for reading, and increasingenergy for the task at hand.LAZY-8SHow to do it: Extend one arm in front of your face. With your thumb pointingupward, slowly and smoothly trace a large figure 8 on its side in the air. Keepyour neck relaxed and your head upright, moving only slightly as you focus onthe thumb and follow it around. This reportedly helps with reading, speedreading, writing, and hand-eye coordination.THINKING CAPSHow to do it: With your thumb and index finger, gently pull and unroll the outerpart of your ear, starting from the top and slowly moving to the lobe. Pull thelobe gently. Repeat the whole exercise three times. This reportedly helps withspelling, self-awareness, short-term memory, listening ability, and abstractthinking skills.CROSS CRAWLHow to do it: While standing, alternately touch your left knee with your righthand, then your right knee with your left hand. Continue for 10 to 15repetitions. This reportedly helps with reading, writing, listening, memory, andcoordination. It activates both sides of the brain simultaneously.CALF PUMPSHow to do it: Stand an arm’s length away from a wall, and place your hands (ashoulder width apart) against it. Extend your left leg straight out behind youso that the ball of your foot is on the floor and your heel is off the floor.Your body is slanted at 45 degrees. Exhale, leaning forward against the wallwhile also bending your right knee and pressing your left heel against thefloor. The more you bend the front knee, the more lengthening you will feel inthe back of your left calf. Inhale, and raise yourself back up while relaxingand raising the left heel. Do the movement three or more times, completing abreath with each cycle. Then switch to the other leg and repeat. This reportedlyhelps with concentration, attention, comprehension, imagination, and the abilityto finish tasks. This exercise removes the sense of being held back and notbeing able to join in.Work to enhance your cerebellum through coordination exercises. Not only will ithelp you think more clearly and faster, it will help improve your judgment,attention, and overall brain health."},{"pageContent":"15BRAIN SEXMAKING LOVE IS GOOD FOR YOUR BRAINJohn turns his head toward a beautiful woman standing at the curb while sittingin his car at a long traffic light. His eyes instinctively go to her hair, hereyes, her lips, her breasts, her hips, and her shape. Her beauty is hypnotic.The vision is instinctively pleasurable, but it also holds him hostage. As thelight turns, his eyes are glued to her as she crosses the street in front of hiscar; he watches how she moves, how her hair flows around her shoulders, and howher breasts gently bounce. As she passes him and walks away, he watches themovement of her bottom as she goes to the other side of the street. The momentis automatic, reflexive, and more powerful than any feeling on earth. Even whenhe tries to pull his attention away, an internal force drives him back to takeanother look. He is grateful that his wife isn’t with him. It is so hard to keephis eyes from wandering when he is with her, even though he knows that she feelsdemeaned when he looks at other women in front of her. The male brain: verydifferent from the female brain. The male brain is often driven by beauty,shape, fantasy, and obsession. It can leave a man quivering with pleasure,hoping for more, or it can hijack and ruin his life. The female brain is drivenmore often by language, communication, and bonding.Even though it feels genital, sex occurs mostly in the brain. Your brain decideswho is attractive, how to get a date, how well you do on the date, what to dowith the feelings that develop, and how long those feelings last. Your brain isinvolved with everything you do, including everything sexual. It is the largestsex organ in the body (weighing about three pounds).In the last three chapters we have focused on mental exercise, physicalexercise, and coordination. Sex uses all three of these skills: mental exerciseto socially connect with someone attractive; physical and coordination exercisesto make the connection happen. As we will see, sex is a key to keeping the brainhealthy.This chapter will explore some brain basics about sexuality, such as how thebrain becomes male and female and its role in attraction, attachment,commitment, and sexual performance, and then give you some practical tips toenhance the brain as it relates to your sexuality. Did you know that sexualcompetence and frequency have been associated with longevity? Understanding theneuroscience of sexuality may save your life. In a 1997 study published in theBritish Medical Journal, researchers from Queens University in Belfast tracked athousand middle-aged men for over ten years and found that those who reportedthe highest frequency of orgasm enjoyed a death rate half that of those wholagged behind. In another study, men who had sex at least three times a weekdecreased their risk of a heart attack or stroke by half! Other studies haveshown that regular sex improves sleep, moods, and testosterone levels. Researchfrom the University of Pennsylvania reported that individuals who have sex atleast once or twice a week show 30 percent higher levels of an antibody calledimmunoglobulin A, which is known to boost the immune system. Other studies haveshown that frequent sexual activity is tied to lower risk of breast cancer inwomen and prostate cancer in men.A word of caution: it is not indiscriminate sex that is associated withlongevity. Random sex is associated with sexually transmitted diseases, such assyphilis and AIDS, both of which can shorten your life and destroy brainfunction. The sex described in this chapter is sexual activity with a committed,loving partner.HORMONES AND THE BRAINHOW THE BRAIN BECOMES MALE OR FEMALEThe moment of conception determines whether you’ll be male or female. Males getan X chromosome from their mothers and a Y chromosome from their fathers (XY),while females get X chromosomes from both their moms and their dads (XX).Inheriting a Y chromosome triggers two bursts of hormones, mostly testosterone,that change a male’s brain and body. The first burst, early in the womb,produces a brain that is different from that of girls. From early in infancy,girl brains are more interested in smiles, communication, people, and security;boy brains are more interested in objects, actions, and competition. With higherlevels of testosterone, the left parietal lobe, responsible for direction sense,visualizing objects in three dimensions (good for catching a football orwatching a woman walk across the street), and mathematics becomes more highlydeveloped. Without testosterone, the language centers of the brain become moredeveloped, which is why girls like to talk and boys like to play catch. Inaddition, testosterone beefs up the area of the brain that is interested in sex.Not surprisingly, it is twice as large in men as in women.The second burst of testosterone, during puberty, starts to turn a boy into aman. He now has twenty times the level of testosterone of most girls, histesticles descend, his voice deepens, his body becomes hairier, he hasbetter-defined muscles, and he grows like a beanstalk. His mind becomes highlyfocused on girls; where before they were gross, now they are almost all he canthink about. Bursts of estrogen and other female hormones help turn girls intowomen with breasts and rounder hips.HOW LONG IS HIS RING FINGER?According to University of Liverpool researcher John Manning, the size of aman’s ring finger and genital are related to how much testosterone he receivedin the womb; the higher the testosterone level, the longer they are. In fact,looking at the length of a man’s ring finger in comparison to his index fingerwill give an idea of the size of a man’s penis. If the ring finger is longer, itmeans testosterone levels were healthy; if they are the same size or smaller, itmeans levels were lowered. Women can estimate the length of a man’s penis bysaying, “Show me your hands.” Those who have unusually long ring fingers(indicating high testosterone) are also at greater risk for autism, dyslexia,stuttering, and immune dysfunction. A large member may not be all that great. Onthe other hand, a male with an unusually short ring finger is at higher risk forheart disease and infertility. Size matters, but it can go both ways.BALANCED TESTOSTERONE FOR BRAIN HEALTHTestosterone increases assertiveness and sexual interest. For some men,testosterone levels stay high throughout life; for others, they start to waneduring middle age. Lower levels in teens tend to be associated with shy andunassertive behavior. In adult men, lower testosterone levels have beenassociated with low energy, decreased memory, poor work performance, decreasedsexual desire and performance, and loss of strength and endurance. Lowtestosterone levels in females have been associated with decreased sexualinterest. Small doses of testosterone are often prescribed to raise a woman’slibido (not too much, however, as facial hair, aggression, and muscular bicepsare generally not her goal).ATTRACTIONWHY BEAUTIFUL WOMEN MAKE MEN STUPIDThere is now scientific proof of something people have long suspected—beautifulwomen make men stupid. Canadian researchers showed men pictures ofconventionally pretty and not-so-pretty women. The men rolled dice—and were toldthey could receive either $15 the following day or $75 after waiting a few days.The men who saw the pictures of the beautiful women were more likely to take the$15—proving, researchers say, that men stop thinking about long-termconsequences once love chemicals kick in. (By the way, the same test was done onwomen—and men’s attractiveness had no affect on their thinking processes.)Beautiful women seem to cause a man’s limbic system to fire up (emotionalcharge) while his prefrontal cortex heads south, leaving the judgment area ofthe brain vacant. Las Vegas knows this principle very well. Casinos havebeautiful waitresses dressed in low-cut, short dresses serving free alcohol—bothlower PFC activity. No wonder the house has the edge.HOW SHE LOOKS HIJACKS HIS BRAINWhen men get together, they often talk about how a woman looks and how shemoves. Why? Thirty percent of the human brain is dedicated to vision. When a mansees an attractive woman, the visual areas of his brain fire with activity. Sheliterally hijacks a large portion of his brain. It can feel emotionallyoverwhelming, even addictive. Using sophisticated imaging equipment, researchersfrom Emory University in Atlanta found that the amygdala, an area of the brainthat controls emotions and motivation, was much more activated in men than inwomen when viewing sexual material for thirty minutes, even though both sexesreported similar levels of interest in the images. This may be one of thereasons men are much more interested in pornography than women. It is also nomistake that women spend more time caring for their physical appearance. Howthey look has much more impact on a man’s brain than the other way around.SPARKING ATTRACTIONWhen someone is attracted to someone else, areas deep in the brain, rich in theneurotransmitter dopamine, light up with pleasure. Dopamine neurons are involvedwith feelings of reward and motivation. This is the same area of the brain wherecocaine works to produce a sense of euphoria. In addition, the brainstem getsinto the act of attraction when sexy visual cues trigger the release of theadrenalinelike chemical phenylethylamine (PEA), the same chemical found inchocolate, which speeds up the flow of information between nerve cells. Takentogether, the release of dopamine and PEA explains why, when we are aroundsomeone we are attracted to, we feel a “rush” and our heart beats faster.Attraction is a powerful drug.IS BEAUTY ONLY SKIN DEEP?Forget the idea that beauty is only skin deep. It is perceived in the brain,especially in the left front side. In a Spanish study, 160 different styles ofartwork and 160 photos were presented to eight women. The brain’s activity wasrecorded, and the results showed striking differences in the left side of theprefrontal cortex when they considered what was beautiful. The left PFC is alsothe happy side of the brain. When it is stimulated, people feel joy; when it ishurt, it often leads to depression and irritability.Other researchers have suggested that men and women are attracted tosymmetrical, fertile, healthy, younger-looking people. Your brain looks at a manor woman to decide whether you want your children to carry his or her genes. Welook for signs of health, such as clear skin and bright eyes. The theory behindbody symmetry is that asymmetrical features (such as eyes or breasts) suggestthe presence of underlying health problems, thus yielding more troubledoffspring. One of my patients was dating a woman with a lazy eye that divertedwhen she was tired. Even though he said he loved her, the asymmetry of her eyesbothered him, and he had no idea why.NOSING AROUND WITH SEXSmells trigger arousal and sexual response. Research shows that baby powder doesit for women, cinnamon for men. There is a direct connection between your senseof smell in the olfactory bulb at the top of the nose and the erection center ofthe brain, called the septal nucleus. When cells in your olfactory bulb arestimulated in a certain way, it sends signals to the erection center to stand upand pay attention. Your brain gets an erection and sends signals lower in thebody. Unpleasant smells, such as that of a man or woman who has not bathedrecently, send a different set of signals that cause the septal area and thepenis or clitoris to flatten. Researchers have found that people who have smelland taste disorders have a high frequency of sexual dysfunction. Measuringpenile blood flow with what looks like a small blood pressure cuff, researchersfound that sexual arousal in men was enhanced by the smells of lavender andpumpkin pie. Doughnuts, licorice, and cinnamon were also at the top of the list.No wonder Cinnabon is everywhere. In a women’s study, increased vaginal bloodflow, a sign of sexual arousal, was associated not with men’s colognes (don’twaste your money) but rather with baby powder. Women associate baby powder withfreshly diapered, cute babies, and then they want one. A similar study foundthat women’s sexual desire increased when they stood close to a nursingmother—close enough to smell her. Breastfeeding women and their infants producea “chemosignal” that actually increases sexual desire in other women, accordingto research from the University of Chicago. While a chemosignal may not beperceived as an odor, it has a definite impact on mood and menstrual cycles whenit’s absorbed through the nose. “This is the first report in humans of a naturalsocial chemosignal that increases sexual motivation,” said lead researcherMartha McClintock in a news release announcing the study findings.COMMITMENTHIGHS AND LOWS OF NEW LOVEWhen you meet someone who literally causes sparks to fly in your brain,hopefully the attraction is mutual. You find a special person and start spendingmore and more time with him. Attachment then starts to change your brain’schemistry. Several recent studies have shown that new love not only raisesdopamine and PEAs (giving you a “high” sensation) but also starts to lower theneurotransmitter serotonin. Serotonin is involved with mood regulation andemotional flexibility. Low serotonin levels have been associated withobsessive-compulsive disorder, impulsivity, and excessive activity in thebrain’s anterior cingulate gyrus. When the ACG works too hard, people tend toget stuck on certain thoughts or behaviors (sounds like falling in love).Remember the last time you fell in love? All you could think about was your newlove, and no matter how busy you were, you could always find time for her. Yourmoods were up when you thought about her, then went down when she didn’t answerher cell phone the first time you called. You felt more reckless, and yourfriends wondered about your judgment. Lowered levels of serotonin make youvulnerable to depression if the relationship ends prematurely. In extreme cases,lowered levels of serotonin can trigger obsessive behavior, such as calling allthe time, jealousy, or even stalking if your affection is not returned.Several years ago one of my friends was scanned as part of our healthy study.Several months later he fell madly in love. One day he dropped by my office totell me about his new love. I could hear in his voice that he was very takenwith his new woman. I did a repeat scan on him just to see his brain in love.The second scan showed significant increased activity in the ACG, indicatingthat his brain was literally obsessed with this woman.TO BE TOGETHER OR NOT TO BE TOGETHEROxytocin is an important hormone produced in the brain that is involved withbonding and attachment. When we feel connected, empathic, in love, the brain’semotional centers secrete higher levels of oxytocin. Women have naturally higherlevels of this chemical, which boosts nonsexual bonding between a mother andnewborn and is produced when a mother breastfeeds her baby. Usually low inmales, orgasm causes oxytocin levels to skyrocket five times, making it easierfor men to feel emotionally connected, keeping marriages alive. Dads with moreof it stick around to help raise the kids. Oxytocin can be stimulated by touch,while making love or simply holding hands.Love changes the brain. Oxytocin and serotonin are not as exciting to the brainas the dopamine and PEA released during the attraction stage, but they havelonger effects and are part of the chemistry of what keeps us in love. After awhile attraction chemicals cannot be sustained at such high levels. You start tonotice your new love’s asymmetries, and the intense feelings of euphoria andobsession start to wane. When you go through withdrawal from these chemicals,you begin to feel unbalanced and may even miss the high. You deal with thelowered pleasure chemicals either by becoming committed, because you truly lovethis new person and see real potential for the relationship, or by lookingelsewhere for a new high.WHY IS COMMITMENT EASIER FOR WOMEN?Once you find an attractive partner, how does your brain decide if you want tokeep him or her? Commitment is usually harder for men than women. Even thoughour goals are the same—continuity of the species—women are more oriented towardraising children. There is not one human society where men are primarycaretakers for kids. Our brains are different. It doesn’t mean that men don’thelp or that they are not essential in childrearing. We just have differentroles. Unless women have experienced emotional trauma, they are usually moreready to settle down and start a family. This may frighten a man as he thinksabout the responsibilities involved in raising children and being faithful toone woman, although this is easier for men with lower testosterone levels. AnAmerican study of more than four thousand men found that husbands with hightestosterone levels were 43 percent more likely to get divorced and 38 percentmore likely to have extramarital affairs than men with lower levels. They werealso 50 percent less likely to get married at all. Men with the least amounts oftestosterone were more likely to get married and stay married, maybe because lowtestosterone levels make men calmer, less aggressive, less intense, and morecooperative.In addition to testosterone, another clue about commitment comes from newresearch on the hormone vasopressin. This chemical is involved in regulatingsexual persistence, assertiveness, dominance, and territorial markings. Notsurprisingly, it is found in higher levels in the male brain. Why do some menconstantly live with the discomfort of a wandering eye, while others remaincontent with fidelity? The difference may have to do not only with testosteronebut with this hormone as well. In male voles (little rodents), the levels ofvasopressin seem to make the difference between stay-at-home dads andone-night-stand artists. The voles with a certain brain distribution ofvasopressin were monogamous, while others with a different pattern were not.Several other brain factors are important to the issue of commitment. People whohave healthy activity in the prefrontal cortex can focus for longer periods oftime, have greater empathy, and tend to make better husbands and wives. They areless prone to seek excitement, less impulsive, and more cooperative. People whohave low activity in this part of the brain tend to be impulsive (morevulnerable to affairs), be easily distracted (trouble listening), get boredeasily, and be on a constant search for the high that comes with new love. LowPFC activity is often associated with people who have ADD or who have had abrain injury. People who have too much activity in the PFC tend to be obsessive,oppositional, and argumentative. This behavior can push potential mates away. Ahealthy brain makes it easier to have a lasting, committed relationship.ORGASMCAN YOUR BRAIN HAVE AN ORGASM?It seems as though you can’t watch an hour of TV without seeing a commercial forViagra, Cialis, or Levitra. Humans are definitely interested in enhancing sexualperformance. From a brain science point of view, you can enhance your sexualityby stimulating the right hemisphere of the brain. As discussed, the brain isdivided into two halves or hemispheres. The left side is more involved withlanguage, logic, details, and planning, while the right side is more associatedwith music, rhythm, creativity, social skills, and spirituality. A number ofstudies have found that the right hemisphere, along with the limbic system, isinvolved with sexual pleasure and orgasm. Fascinating research has shown thatpeople with right-hemisphere seizures can experience orgasm as a precursor tothe seizure. In medical literature there are twenty-two reported cases ofright-hemisphere seizures associated with the feeling of having an orgasm. In astudy from Finland, eight male volunteers were studied with brain scans whilethey were having orgasm (must have been a fun study). The results showed overalldecreased blood flow during orgasm in all brain areas except in the rightprefrontal cortex, where the cerebral blood flow increased significantly.WHY SHE CRIES OUT “OH GOD!” WHEN SHE’S HAVING AN ORGASMThe right hemisphere has also been talked about as the God area of the brain.When scientists stimulate the right hemisphere, people have more religious orspiritual experiences. They also report feeling the presence of God in the room.When she moans “Oh God, oh God,” she may be connecting sexual pleasure to adeeper spiritual place in her brain. Music and dancing, which are oftenprecursors to sex, enhance the right hemisphere.WHY ORGASMS ARE BETTER THAN PAXILOrgasms can also have an antidepressant effect. They cause intense increasedactivity in the deep emotional parts of the brain, which then settle down aftersex. Antidepressants tend to calm activity in the same part of the brain. Peoplewho engage in regular sexual activity experience less depression, and orgasmfrequency may be one reason why. In addition, prostaglandin, a hormone foundonly in semen, is absorbed by the vagina and may have a role in modulatingfemale hormones and moods.OTHER BRAIN-SEX ISSUESWHEN THINGS GET WEIRDWeird sexual fetishes or fantasies ultimately are brain symptoms. They fall intothe category of impulsive-compulsive disorders: impulsive because the personcannot control the behavior, and compulsive because even though he may want tostop, he cannot. A person who suffers from an obsession with voyeurism,exhibitionism, bestiality, S&M, or infantilism (being treated like a baby) oftenhas too much activity in the emotional parts of the brain (as do people who haveobsessive-compulsive disorders) and too little activity in the PFC or judgmentcenter. A Harvard study of twenty-six men bothered by unusual sexual fantasiesfound that using medications to balance these two areas of the brain gave thesemen significant relief.AFFECTION IS KEY TO HEALTH AND LONGEVITYRegular sexual contact with a committed partner helps to keep your body andbrain healthy. Don’t avoid it with excuses about being too tired or too busy forphysical affection. Also, try to avoid spending too much time at work to theexclusion of social endeavors. A lack of relationships sets us up to bedepressed or to seek pleasure through solitary sexual activities, which are notas good for the brain. Men and women need touching, eye contact, and sexualconnection to stay healthy. When you feel loved, nurtured, cared for, supported,and intimate, you are much more likely to be happier and healthier. You have amuch lower risk of getting sick and, if you do, a much greater chance ofsurviving the illness.AEROBIC SEXOne of the most compelling benefits of sex comes from studies of aerobicfitness. It is estimated that the act of intercourse burns about 200 calories,the equivalent of running vigorously for 30 minutes. Most couples average about24 minutes for lovemaking. During orgasm, both heart rate and blood pressuretypically double, all under the influence of oxytocin. A study conducted inWales in the 1980s showed that men who had sex twice a week or more oftenexperienced half as many heart attacks after ten years as men who hadintercourse less than once a month.MAKE SURE YOUR BRAIN WORKS RIGHTTreat brain problems, such as depression or ADD, early so they don’t interferewith your relationships and lovemaking opportunities. Some antidepressants,especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as Prozac and Lexapro,interfere with sexual function. Others, such as Wellbutrin, do not. Make sure totalk to your doctor if a medication is causing a problem.WHY COFFEE AND CIGARETTES ARE THE ENEMIES OF SEXStay away from too much nicotine and caffeine. Both substances constrict bloodflow to vital organs such as your brain and genitals. Less blood flow usuallymeans less function.WHY SHE BUYS SO MANY PAIRS OF SHOESWomen need sweet words, gentle touches, thoughtfulness, and especially foot rubsto get in the mood for sex. The foot sensation area of the brain is next door tothe clitoral and penile areas, which may be one of the reasons that some womencollect shoes and that some men have foot fetishes.Erotic love is essential to human health. There is clear evidence that an activesex life leads to a longer life, better heart health, and better brain function.Making love with a committed partner helps our bodies and brains work better.MORE MONEY DOES NOT MEAN MORE SEX, BUT MORE SEX CAN MAKE YOUR BRAIN HAPPIERThere is positive news for people who have more activity in the bedroom than intheir bank accounts. After evaluating the levels of sexual activity andhappiness in sixteen thousand people, Dartmouth College economist DavidBlachflower and Andrew Oswald of the University of Warwick in England found thatsex so positively influenced happiness that they estimated increasingintercourse from once a month to once a week is equivalent to the happinessgenerated by getting an additional $50,000 in income for the average American.In addition, they reported that despite what most people think, people who makemore money do not necessarily have more sex. There was no difference, in theirstudy, in sexual frequency among various income levels. The happiest people inthe study were married people, who had on average 30 percent more sex thansingle folks. The economists estimated that a lasting marriage equated to thehappiness generated by an extra $100,000 annually, while divorce depleted anestimated $66,000 annually worth of happiness. Taking care of your marriage cansave you lots of money.SUMMARY OF SOME OF THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF REGULAR SEXUAL CONTACTFor women, in research studies, regular sex with a partner has been associatedwith:• More regular menstrual cycles• More fertile menstrual cycles• Lighter periods• Better moods• Better memories• Increased pain relief• Better bladder control• Fewer colds and flu• Reduced stress• Staying in shape• Increased youth-promoting hormone DHEA• Increased testosterone and estrogen• Weight control—sex burns about 200 calories per half-hour, yoga 114, dancing(rock) 129, walking (at 3 mph) 153, weight training 153For men, regular sex with a partner has been associated with:• Increased heart rate variability (a sign of heart health and a calmer mind)• Improved heart cardiovascular function (three times a week decreased the riskof heart attack or stroke by half)• Higher testosterone levels (stronger bones and muscles)• Improved prostate function• Improved sleep"},{"pageContent":"16IMPROVING REALITYTHE BRAIN’S ROLE IN PERCEPTIONThe mind is its own place, and in itselfCan make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.John Milton, Paradise Lost (1667)Your brain creates your reality. It is not what happens to you in life thatdetermines how you feel; it is how your brain perceives reality that makes itso. Most people are unaware that they are controlled not by events or people butby the perceptions their brain makes of them. I once heard the following story:at the turn of the last century, a shoe company sent a representative to Africa.He wired back, “I’m coming home. No one wears shoes here.” Another company sentits representative, and he sold thousands of shoes. He wired back to hiscompany, “Business is fantastic. No one has ever heard of shoes here.” Theirbrains perceived the same situation from different perspectives, and theyobtained opposite results. The view that your brain takes of a situation hasmore reality in it than the actual situation itself. Noted psychiatrist RichardGardner once wrote that the world is like a Rorschach test, where a person isasked to describe what he or she sees in ten inkblots that mean absolutelynothing. What we see in the inkblots and what we see in life is based on ourinner view of the world formed in neural connections.PERCEPTION AND REALITYOur perceptions bear witness to our state of mind and the state of our brain. Acalm limbic or emotional brain leads to more rational thought; an overactivelimbic brain is associated with greater anxiety and sadness. An enhanced lefthemisphere is associated with happy or optimistic perceptions; while anoveractive right hemisphere (or low left hemisphere) is associated with fear andnegative thinking. As our brain functions, so do we perceive. Therefore, inreality, we should seek to change not only the outside world but our own brainsand attitudes. It is how your brain perceives situations, rather than the actualsituations themselves, that causes you to react. I often write this equation formy patients:A + B = CA is the actual event,B is how we interpret or perceive the event, andC is how we react to the event.Most people think the A things in life, what happens to us, determine ourbehavior. In large part, it is actually the B stuff. Other people or events (A)cannot make us do anything. It is our brain’s interpretation or perception (B)that causes our behavior (C). Here are two examples.STEPHANIEStephanie overheard a discussion at lunch between her husband and herstepdaughter about a trip they were all planning the following summer. Stephanieheard only part of the conversation and thought they were planning the itinerarywithout her input. She became irate and stormed out of the restaurant. AsStephanie replayed the event for me during a marital therapy session—sure shehad interpreted the whole event correctly even though her husband said she wasmistaken—I wrote on a pad of paper, A + B = C. The conversation between herhusband and stepdaughter was A; her interpretation was B; and her storming outof the restaurant was C. I asked Stephanie if she could have reacted in anyother way. At first she said no, she knew what she saw. But then logic helped tosoften her position. Reluctantly, she said other intentions were possible, andperhaps she misinterpreted what happened—the B stuff. She had actually nevertried to give input on the trip but just fumed when she was not specificallyasked her opinion. She was sensitive to her stepparent role and had troublebeing assertive in asking for what she wanted.IANIan, twenty-four, came to our clinic in Newport Beach from Minnesota forproblems with drug abuse and ADD. He was having family troubles and was takingmuch longer than expected to get through college. His brain SPECT study showedmarked decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex (consistent with ADD) andscalloping throughout the surface of his brain (consistent with the drug abuse).When he saw his scan (the event, A stuff) he became visibly upset, thought hewas brain damaged and hopeless (his interpretation, B stuff), and stormed out ofmy office (his reaction, C stuff). He came back a few minutes later wanting tohear the rest of the explanation about his scan. Before we talked more I wroteout the equation A + B = C. We talked about his interpretation (B stuff) and howit had caused him to overreact (C stuff). In fact, his scan was very good news.He already knew that he was having problems, because that was why he came morethan two thousand miles to see me. The scan showed damage from drugs, but if hestopped, the damage was likely to heal over time. If he kept using the drugs, itwould worsen. That piece of information was critical, so he could make betterdecisions and stop using drugs. The evidence of ADD on his scan was also veryimportant because doctors had suspected ADD through the years but were neversure. Now we were sure of his diagnosis and could get him the proper help. Goodnews. When he listened and understood what his scan really showed, he was morerelaxed and had hope that things could be better (new B stuff and a newattitude).Just as the brain can distort reality, it can also improve it. So much begins inthe brain. Balancing your brain through diet, exercise, music, stress reduction,and supplements will help your perceptions. At the same time, balancing andimproving your perceptions can help balance the brain. Psychotherapy—or therapyfor your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors—has been found to actually enhancebrain function. How your brain works is certainly involved in how you think,feel, and act, but how you think, feel, and act can also influence brainfunction. The brain and behavior help or hurt each other.Researchers in the last decade have shown that many different forms ofpsychotherapy help to balance brain function. Several studies have shown thatcognitive therapy (teaching people to correct negative thought patterns and tothink in more rational, positive ways) enhances brain function. A Canadian studyfound that cognitive therapy helped not only to heal depression but also tobalance brain function in a similar way to medication (but without the sideeffects or expense of medication). Other research groups from Canada and Swedencame to the same conclusions. The Swedish study took eighteen patients withsignificant social anxiety and divided them into three groups: one received anantidepressant, one received cognitive therapy, and a third did not receive anytreatment. Both the antidepressant and the cognitive therapy groups improved(also showing improvement on brain scans), while the group that did not get helpstayed the same. One of my favorite studies comes from Canada, where researchersexamined twelve patients who had paralyzing spider phobias. They performedimaging studies while the patients looked at pictures of spiders and showed thatduring that time one of the brain’s fear centers exploded with activity. Thenthese patients were taught cognitive therapy to deal with their fears of thetiny arachnoid creatures. After treatment they were rescanned while looking atthe same spider pictures. This time the fear centers were calm. Therapy forthoughts helps change brain function. Change your thoughts, change your brain!In the same way, changing your relationships can change your brain. A landmarkstudy from UCLA found Interpersonal Psychotherapy (ITP), which teaches people toget along better with others by improving social support, communication,conflict resolution, and assertiveness training, to be an effective cure fordepression. ITP also helps to reset brain function, enhancing prefrontal cortexactivity (improving focus and judgment) and calming limbic activity (making onefeel more positive).A number of studies have found that patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder(repetitive bad thoughts or inappropriate behaviors) are helped by behaviortherapy. Behavior therapy involves telling the brain that certain behaviors arenot only irrational and but also symptoms of the brain working too hard andfooling the person. It teaches patients to change counterproductive behaviors,stop the bad thoughts that come into their minds, and wait out urges to docompulsive behaviors rather than just give in to them and expose them to theirfears. Three different brain-imaging studies found that, like medication,behavior therapy can help bring healing to suffering patients and balance thebrain. In this disorder the brain works too hard, especially in the basalganglia (anxiety) and the anterior cingulate gyrus (gear shifter). Behaviortherapy helps to settle down or rebalance these areas. Change your behavior,change your brain.One of the most interesting scans that I have done through the years were thoseof a psychologist, Noelle Nelson, who was at the time writing a book titled ThePower of Appreciation (now in print). She wanted to be scanned after spending ahalf-hour meditating on all the things she was thankful for in her life. In thatscan her brain looked healthy. I then asked her to do one more scan afterthinking about all the things she hated in her life. I felt that we needed acomparison scan to see the difference that an attitude of gratitude can make inthe brain. Reluctantly, she agreed, even though she knew that thinking about thethings she hated in life would make her feel bad. They did. She thought abouther fears of getting sick, of being unable to work or to support her animals.She thought that if her dog got sick and died because she was out of work, shewould get depressed and never recover. Her second scan was very different fromthe healthy gratitude scan: both her cerebellum and her left temporal lobe weredeactivated (Images 16.1–16.4). Decreased cerebellar activity is associated withdecreased motor coordination and thought coordination. People get clumsier andless able to think their way out of problems. Lowered left temporal lobeactivity is associated with dark thoughts and memory problems. Negative thoughtpatterns change the brain in a negative way. Being grateful for the wonderfulthings in your life literally helps you have a brain to be grateful for.image [images/Amen_9780307338136_epub_018_r1.jpg]CHANGING YOUR REALITYHere are five steps to improve your brain and your reality.1. DO NOT BELIEVE EVERY FIRST THOUGHT YOU HAVE.It is easy to misunderstand or misperceive a situation. Think about all of thebrain systems involved in communication—sight and sound processing, decodingmeaning, and comparing incoming information with past experiences. You can seehow some things can get miscommunicated. Whenever you feel slighted, hurt, ornegated by someone else, try to get a clarification of the situation. Clearcommunication can solve many relational problems. Feed your brain accurateinformation, not just gut feelings. Correct your perceptions, change your brain.2. REALIZE THAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE EXTRAORDINARILY POWERFUL.Every time you have a thought, your brain releases chemicals. Every time youhave a positive, happy, hopeful, grateful thought, your brain releases chemicalsthat help you feel better and have more efficient brain function. Whenever youthink awful, miserable, negative thoughts, your brain works less efficiently andis likely to put you into an emotional slump. Learn how to direct your thoughtsto see the glass as half full. Your brain works better with positive thoughtfuel than with negative energy.3. RECOGNIZE THAT THOUGHTS LIE, ARE EASILY DISTORTED, AND CAN ROB YOU OF JOY.People who suffer from depression, anxiety, and panic disorders are filled withwhat I call ANTs, automatic negative thoughts. They tend to predict the worstand focus on whatever is negative about a situation. It is as though an ANTinfestation is sucking the life force out of the physical brain. If you sufferfrom this problem, it is important to develop an internal anteater to ridyourself of these pests and their nests. Whenever you feel sad, mad, or nervous,write out what you are thinking. You will notice that many of those thoughts areirrational and hurtful. The act of writing down the ANTs takes away their powerby turning off their emotional food supply and eventually choking the life outof them, allowing you to replace them with more helpful thoughts. Kill the ANTs,change your brain.4. USE THE PLACEBO EFFECT.Your brain takes what it sees and makes it happen. Negative thoughts can makenegative things happen, while positive thoughts can help you reach your goals.The expectation of success is a very powerful force by itself. Skilledphysicians have known for centuries that positive expectations play a crucialrole in healing many illnesses. Until about 150 years ago, medical therapeuticsmainly involved the doctor-patient relationship and the placebo effect. (Aplacebo is an inert substance that has no physiological effect on a problem.)Actually, most treatments by physicians in times past would have been moreharmful than beneficial to patients, if it weren’t for their faith in thehealing powers of the treatments and their own recuperative powers. The benefitsof the placebo effect are determined by the expectations and hopes shared by thepatient and the doctor. According to Dr. T. Findley, action, ritual, faith, andenthusiasm are the vital ingredients. Dr. Jerome Frank, after studying thepsychotherapeutic process, concluded that the therapist’s belief in histreatment and the patient’s belief in the therapist were the most importantfactors in effecting a positive outcome.Although placebos are pharmacologically inert, they are by no means “nothing.”They are potent therapeutic tools, on average about one-half to two-thirds aspowerful as morphine in relieving severe pain. One-third of the generalpopulation are placebo responders in clinical situations relating to pain,whether the pain is from surgery, angina, cancer, or headache. Placebo responsesare clearly not simply a result of patients fooling or tricking themselves outof pain—placebo administration can produce real physiological changes. Some ofthe physiological pathways through which placebo effects work have beenidentified. In 1978 a University of California research team found that theplacebo effect of pain relief in dental patients could actually be blocked byadministering naloxone, a drug that neutralizes the effects of morphine in thebody. This study and others have made it clear that belief in pain reliefstimulates the body to secrete its own pain-relieving substance. Theseendorphins act in the same manner as morphine. In one brain-imaging study,researchers found that when a placebo worked for depressed patients, their brainfunction also changed in a positive way. Change your beliefs, change your brain.5. TELL YOUR BRAIN WHAT YOU WANT, AND MATCH YOUR BEHAVIOR TO GET IT.Since your mind takes what it sees and makes it happen, it is critical tovisualize what you want and then match your behavior over time to get it. Toomany people are thrown around by the whims of the day, rather than using theirprefrontal cortex to plan their lives and follow through on their goals.THE ONE-PAGE MIRACLEA powerful yet simple exercise that I have designed is called the One-PageMiracle, so named because it has quickly focused and changed many people’slives. It will help guide nearly all of your thoughts, words, and actions forbrain health.Take a sheet of paper, and clearly write down your major goals. Use thefollowing three main headings: Relationships, Work/Finances, and Self. Under“Relationships,” write the subheadings of Spouse/Lover, Children, Family, andFriends. Under “Work/Finances,” write down your current and future work andfinancial goals. Under “Self,” write down your goals for your physical health,emotional health, spirituality, and interests. Your self is the part of you thatis outside your relationships and your work. Often it is the part of you that noone sees but you.Next to each subheading succinctly write down what’s important to you in thatarea. Write what you want, not what you don’t want. Be positive, and use thefirst person. Write what you want with confidence and the expectation that youwill make it happen, and include what you are currently doing to make it happen.Keep the paper with you so that you can work on it over several days. After youfinish the initial draft (you’ll frequently want to update it), place this pieceof paper where you can see it every day, such as on your refrigerator, by yourbedside, or on the bathroom mirror. In that way, every day you will focus youreyes on what’s important to you. This makes it easier to match your behavior towhat you want. Your life will become more conscious, and you will spend yourenergy on goals that are important to you.I separate the areas of relationships, work, and self in order to encourage amore balanced approach to life. Burnout occurs when our lives become unbalancedand we overextend ourselves in one area while ignoring another. For example, inmy practice I see that a common cause of divorce is that one person works somuch that little energy is left over for his or her spouse.EXAMPLEJohn is a sixty-two-year-old married college professor who has three adultchildren and two grandchildren.Let your brain help you design and implement your life goals. Work towardachieving goals that are important to you. Many other people or corporations arehappy to decide what you should do with your life. Use the One-Page Miracle tohelp you be the one who has the say.Your brain receives and creates reality. Give it some direction to help makeyour life what you want it to be.JOHN’S ONE-PAGE MIRACLEWhat Do I Want?

The night beforeBreanne had told me that she and a group of her friends were going to Oakland totry to get great seats for the concert. It was well known at my house that shewas in teenage love with JC, one of the group’s lead singers. I didn’t evenconsider allowing her to go alone. But rather than disappoint her with my firstimpulse—“There is no way in hell you are going to Oakland at three A.M. with agroup of your girlfriends”—I decided to go along. When we got to the parkinglot, even in the dark we could see a very long line of teenage girls waitinganxiously to purchase tickets. As we got in line, the box office staff handedout lottery tickets. Breanne got the number four, which meant she was fourth inline, among hundreds. As we bought the tickets, I heard her squeal with joy asshe got front row center seats. All the way to and from the Coliseum, Breanneand her friends sang ’N Sync songs. I had literally never seen her so happy. Thenight of the concert Breanne was enraptured by seeing her teen idol performright in front of her. In fact, she said later that JC’s sweat dropped on her ashe performed and that she would never shower again. (Thankfully she gave up thatidea.) She was so happy. I, of course, couldn’t hear for a week. I sat up in therafters with my younger daughter. The sound of fifteen thousand teenage girlsscreaming ruined any potential enjoyment from the concert. The pitch of femaleteenage voices still frightens me to this day.Why does music move us? Why is it such an important part of our lives? Does thebrain have a role in music? Can music be healing? Does it have any dangers,besides blasting out one’s eardrums? This chapter will explore these questionsand provide some suggestions for using music to help make a good brain great.HOW THE BRAIN LISTENSBabies come into the world wired for music. In the mother’s womb, they respondto songs in the environment. At about four months old they begin to fuss whenthey hear music they do not like and coo along with melodies that please them.Music is in our genes. At an early age our musical capacity is shaped by theculture in which we live. Our background affects how our instruments are made,how we hear sounds when others sing, and even how we hear music. I have aLebanese heritage but was born in the United States. Since I was never exposedto Arabic music at a young age, I often find it grating and uncomfortable. Butfriends and colleagues who were born in the Middle East love it. Through thebrain, music interacts with our environment to create our likes and irritations.Certain types of music can enhance brain function, memory, and emotion, whileother forms of music can cause us problems. Music is powerful.As we have seen, the human brain is divided into two hemispheres. Typically, theright hemisphere has been identified as the seat of music, but there is not justone area in the brain responsible for music. In making and listening to music weuse both sides; music is an interplay of many functions. It is exactly for thisreason that music is healing and has the ability to enhance brain function.Music integrates the whole brain.Some cerebral circuits respond to certain types of music; these circuits mayalso be involved in processing other forms of sound. The part of the brain thathears pitch is also involved in understanding speech. Sound enters the ears andgoes to the auditory cortex in the temporal lobes. The right temporal lobe isimportant for hearing pitch, melody, harmony, and rhythm. The left side of thebrain is usually better at hearing changes in frequency and intensity, both inmusic and in words. The left side analyzes incoming data. The right side helpsto put music together into a whole piece. Novices tend to listen to music as awhole, with the right side, while musicians tend to hear music with the lefthemisphere as they analyze the content of the musical form. The limbic brainprocesses the emotional aspects of music as well, triggering memories.Music triggers emotions and emotions trigger memories. Hearing “our song” at awedding anniversary can bring tears of joy and emotional connection; but hearing“our song” three years after a divorce can trigger tears of intense sadness andloss. Music has great power to move our emotions.SINGIt used to be easy to tell if I was in a good mood in the morning. I would startsinging when I rolled out of bed. When I was sad, anxious, or irritated, I wouldbe wrapped up in my own misery and little sound would come out. Once Irecognized the pattern, I started to sing no matter how I felt. Singing hashealing qualities (even if you are like me and are not very good at it). Itexpands the lungs and increases the flow of oxygen to the body and brain. Itwakes us up and stimulates the rhythms of life. Singing and music (not alwaysthe same thing) have been connected to intelligence, creativity, emotion, andmemory. When you put certain information to a tune, such as “The ABCs” (a Mozartpiece), you are more likely to remember it. Singing stimulates temporal lobefunction, an area of the brain heavily involved in memory. When you can sing newinformation, put it to a tune, you are more likely to remember it.Preschool and kindergarten teachers use singing to enhance learning. So why dowe stop singing in the second or third grade? Perhaps we should continue thesinging into later grades. When I was a basic trainee in the military, we oftensang when we marched. I still have those songs in my head. When we sang as agroup, morale and energy went up, and the tasks that we were doing didn’t seemquite as bad (like twenty-mile road marches). Sing whenever and wherever youcan. You may have to sing softly if your voice is like mine, so as not toirritate others. Sing loudly if your voice is beautiful.In a similar way, humming can also make a positive difference in mood andmemory. Mozart hummed as he composed. Children hum when they are happy. Adultsoften hum tunes that go through their minds, lifting their spirits and tuningtheir mind. Consciously focus on humming during the day. As the sound activatesyour brain, you will feel more alive and your brain will feel more tuned in tothe moment.MUSIC, MEDITATION, AND SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCEWith the sponsorship of the Alzheimer’s Prevention Foundation, my colleagues andI teamed up with Dr. Dharma Singh Khalsa and Dr. Nisha Money to study the impactof meditation on the brain. We chose a simple twelve-minute form of meditation,Kritan Kriya, that is easy for busy people to practice. It is based on fiveprimal sounds: saa, taa, naa, maa, and aa. Meditators chant each sound as theyconsecutively touch their thumb to fingers two, three, four, and five. Thesounds and fingering are repeated for two minutes out loud, two minuteswhispering, four minutes silently, two minutes whispering, and two minutes outloud. We performed SPECT scans on the participants when they were at rest oneday, and then after meditation the next day. We saw marked decreases in the leftparietal lobes (which showed a decreasing awareness of time and space) andsignificant increases in the prefrontal cortex (which showed that meditationhelped to tune people in, not out). We also observed increased activity in theright temporal lobe, an area that has been associated with spirituality. Ourmeditators found that finding amusing. “Of course,” one said, “that is why wemeditate.”The fact that music enhances spiritual experience should come as nosurprise—nearly all major religions have music as part of the worship service.Brain science gives us some clues as to why. Music is processed in the righttemporal lobe, the same area that is now referred to as the God spot in thebrain. Neuroscience researchers have found that stimulating the outside of theright temporal lobe also stimulates religious and spiritual experience. Inaddition, insight (or the “aha” experience) also activates the right temporallobe. Music has the potential to stimulate both spiritual experience andinsight. When you are faced with a difficult problem, it may be a good idea toplay some music and allow your brain to work on the puzzle while it listens.Music helped Thomas Jefferson write the Declaration of Independence. When hecould not figure out the right wording for a certain part, he would play hisviolin. The music helped him get the words from his brain onto the paper.LEARN A MUSICAL INSTRUMENTIf you always wanted to learn a musical instrument, now is the time. Learning toplay a musical instrument enhances brain function. It teaches the brain newpatterns and stimulates wide areas of the cortex. Music has the capacity toenhance how we think, reason, and create. The data is impressive. Experimentsusing Mozart’s Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major (K448) produced short-termenhancement of the right hemisphere, which helps us see images inthree-dimensional pictures (visual spatial reasoning). Additionally, preschoolchildren who received piano keyboard lessons for six months improved theirperformance dramatically on a visual spatial reasoning task, with the effectlasting for days, whereas control groups (including a computer control group)did not improve. In a follow-up study by researchers at the University ofCalifornia at Irvine, thirty-four preschoolers were given piano keyboardtraining. After six months all the children could play basic melodies fromMozart and Beethoven. They exhibited significant increases in visual spatialskill (up to 36 percent improvement) compared with other preschoolers whoreceived computer lessons or other types of stimulation. The College EntranceExamination Board in 1996 reported that students with experience in musicalperformance scored 51 points higher on the verbal part of the SAT and 39 pointshigher on the math section than the national average. In a study ofapproximately 7,500 students at a university, music majors had the highestreading scores of any students on campus. Learning a musical instrument, at anyage, can be helpful in developing and activating temporal lobe neurons. As thetemporal lobes are activated in an effective way, they are more likely to haveimproved function overall.Many other studies have highlighted the need to keep music an important part ofour educational process. A study from the University of Sarasota and East TexasState University found that middle school and high school students whoparticipated in instrumental music scored significantly higher in standardizedtests than their nonband peers. University studies conducted in Georgia andTexas found significant correlations between the number of years of instrumentalmusic instruction and academic achievement in math, science, and language arts.In another study, students who were exposed to a type of music-based lessonsscored a full 100 percent higher on fractions tests than those who learned inthe conventional manner. (These second- and third-grade students were taughtfractions in an untraditional manner—using basic music rhythm notation: theywere taught about eighth, quarter, half, and whole notes. Their peers receivedtraditional fraction instruction.) In a study that premedical students will findfascinating, music majors were the most likely group of college grads to beadmitted to medical school. Lewis Thomas studied the undergraduate majors ofmedical school applicants. He found that 66 percent of music majors who appliedto medical school were admitted—the highest percentage of any group. Forcomparison, 44 percent of biochemistry majors were admitted.College-age musicians are emotionally healthier than their nonmusiciancounterparts. A study conducted at the University of Texas looked at 362students who were in their first semester of college. They were given threetests, measuring performance anxiety, emotional concerns, and alcohol-relatedproblems. In addition to having fewer battles with the bottle, researchers alsonoted that the college-aged music students seemed to have surer footing whenfacing tests. A ten-year study, tracking more than 25,000 students, shows thatmusic-making improves test scores. Regardless of socioeconomic background,music-making students get higher marks in standardized tests than those who haveno music involvement. The test scores studied were not only from standardizedtests, such as the SAT, but also from reading proficiency exams.The world’s top academic countries place a high value on music education.Hungary, the Netherlands, and Japan stand atop worldwide science achievement andhave a strong commitment to music education. All three countries have requiredmusic training at the elementary and middle school levels, both instrumental andvocal, for several decades. The centrality of music education to learning in thetop-ranked countries seems to contradict the United States’ focus on math,science, vocabulary, and technology.MOVE WITH THE MUSICMusic is sensory, emotional, and motor—we feel the music, and it literally movesus. Music is as much about action as it is about perception. When music engagesour brain—when performers play or listeners tap, dance, or sing along—theexperience of music is often coupled with action. Simple coupling might befoot-tapping to a beat, whereas more complex coupling would be dancing a waltz,singing a song, or playing a melody on a violin. Passionate coupling may bemaking love to music, such as Ravel’s Bolero.One example of the healing power of music comes from George I of England. KingGeorge had problems with memory loss and stress management. He read from theBible the story of King Saul, recognized that Saul had experienced the same typeof problems that he was experiencing, and realized that Saul overcame hisproblems by using special music. With this story in mind, King George askedGeorge Frederick Handel to write some special music for him that would help himwith his memory loss and stress in the same way that music helped Saul. Handelwrote his Water Music for this purpose.MOZART FOR FOCUSIn one controlled study, Mozart has been found helpful for ADD children. RosalieRebollo Pratt and colleagues studied nineteen children, ages seven to seventeen,with ADD while playing recordings of Mozart during three-times-a-week brain-wavebiofeedback sessions. One Hundred Masterpieces, volume three, Wolfgang AmadeusMozart was the music used. It included the selections from Piano Concerto no. 21in C, Flute Concerto no. 2 in D, The Marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni, and otherconcertos, sonatas, and operas. The group that listened to Mozart reduced theirtheta brain-wave activity (slow brain waves are often excessive in ADD) in exactrhythm to the underlying beat of the music, and they displayed better focus andmood control, diminished impulsivity, and improved social skill. Among thesubjects that improved, 70 percent maintained that improvement six months afterthe end of the study without further biofeedback training.CAN MUSIC HELP IN HEALING?Understanding the neuroscience of music will allow us to harness its healingpower. Studies have shown that following heart bypass surgery, patients inintensive care units where background music is played needed lower doses ofdrugs than patients in units where no music is played. Some hospitals play softbackground music in intensive care units for premature babies. Such music, aswell as a nurse’s or mother’s humming, helps the premature babies gain weightfaster and leave the unit earlier than those who don’t hear these sounds. At theother end of life, music has been used to calm Alzheimer’s patients. Mealtime innursing homes can be a struggle, but certain types of music have been shown toreduce confusion and irritability. In a University of Louisville Medical Schoolstudy of retired nuns in two nursing homes, researchers introduced the playingof recorders and other instruments as the only change in the environment. Theydiscovered significant improvements in memory; playing music, reading notes, andmoving fingers all worked to enhance memory.Researchers have also found that music lowers blood pressure in certainsituations and increases oxygen consumption by the heart. Researchers in Romeused music therapy as an additional treatment for severely brain-injuredpatients. The therapy consisted of musical improvisation between the patient andtherapist by singing or by playing different musical instruments, according totheir own unique abilities. Thirty-four patients were studied who had been in acoma for an average of fifty-two days. The results of the study showed thatpatients who had music therapy had a significant reduction of undesiredbehaviors such as inertia or agitation.THE MUSIC YOU LISTEN TO MATTERS!After she heard me lecture on music and the brain, my ’N Sync daughter, Breanne,did a study with twelve of her friends for a psychology class. She timed themplaying the game Memory while they listened to nothing, Mozart, rock, heavymetal, and rap music. She found that they did best at the game when theylistened to Mozart (even better than those listening to nothing at all), andworst when they listened to heavy metal and rap music.Below are some suggestions of music that I find personally healing.Don Campbell, Mozart as Healer: Classical Healing for the New MillenniumDon Campbell, Essence: The Ambient Music of Don Campbell———, Healing Powers of Tone and ChantMichael Hoppé, SolaceDavid Lanz, BelovedAndrew Weil, Self-Healing with Sound and MusicRalph Vaughan Williams, et al., Inner Peace for Busy People: Music to Relax andRenewThe following wonderful titles by Dean Evenson are available atwww.soundings.com [http://www.soundings.com]:Arctic RefugeAscension to TibetHealing DreamsHealing SanctuaryMusic for the Healing ArtsNative HealingPeace Through MusicOTHER FORMS OF ARTEven though this chapter has focused on music, other forms of art (visual art,photography, poetry, and prose) are also helpful for developing and enhancingbrain function.

Actually, stress is both good and bad.Stress is good because it causes us to pay attention to what is going on aroundus: in traffic, with our finances, at work, and in our relationships. Stress canmotivate us (to study for an exam or pay our bills on time); it can protect us(we buy alarm systems for our homes, businesses, or cars); and it can feed us(we go to work to put food on the table). When something is stressful to us, itusually means that we should be paying attention to it.But stress is bad when it overloads our resources. Too much stress can actuallykill you. Chronic stress has been implicated in anxiety and depressivedisorders, obesity, Alzheimer’s disease, heart disease, and a host of immunedisorders, including cancer. When stress hits, levels of adrenaline (leading toanxiety) and cortisol (leading to many ills discussed below) increase, whilelevels of the hormones DHEA and testosterone (leading to loss of muscle tissue,increased fat, and decreased libido) decrease. Both adrenaline and cortisol arereleased by the adrenal glands (located above the kidneys) in response to realor perceived stress. The human brain is so advanced that even imagining astressful event will cause the body to react to the perceived threat as if itwere actually happening. We can literally scare our body into a stress response.The brain is a powerful organ.Adrenaline and cortisol help us deal with acute stress by increasing energy whenwe face a threat. They are the primary chemicals of the fight-or-flightresponse. Whenever you confront an immediate perceived threat, such as arattlesnake in your front yard (which happened to me not too long ago), the bodyprepares either to run away or to fight the threat. The hypothalamus, located inthe deep emotional brain, releases a chemical called CRF(corticotropin-releasing factor), which in turn stimulates the pituitary glandto produce ACTH (adrenocorticotropin hormone), which in turn stimulates theadrenal glands to produce cortisol and adrenaline. Together these chemicalsprepare the body to fight or flee. Among other things, adrenaline dilates ourpupils (increasing visual acuity); shunts blood from our hands and gut to thelarge muscles of arms and legs (so we can fight or run); increases our breathingrate and heart rate (to increase oxygen to the body); and increases sweat glandactivity (to keep us cool). Cortisol stimulates the release of glucose, fats,and amino acids into the bloodstream for energy production.The problem with stress in our modern world is not these short bursts ofadrenaline and cortisol—we need those reactions to deal with our rattlesnakeencounters. The problem is that for many of us the stress reaction neverstops—traffic, bills, bosses, employees, unhappy in-laws, too little sleep,illnesses, and too much to do. Chronic exposure to adrenaline causes our systemsto be overstimulated and leads to anxiety and depression, obesity, and memoryproblems. Chronic exposure to cortisol can make us fat and stupid.In normal amounts, both of these chemicals are essential. Cortisol, for example,has an initial anti-inflammatory effect. (Doctors use cortisol-like medicationsto help with asthma, arthritis, and colitis and to relieve certain skindisorders.) It also calms immune response in organ transplantations. Inappropriate amounts, both chemicals help the body maintain internal balance. Lowlevels of cortisol are associated with Addison’s disease, an illness wherestress can cause a dangerous drop in blood pressure and even circulatorycollapse. President John F. Kennedy had Addison’s disease and had to takecortisol tablets when he was under great periods of stress, such as during theCuban missile crisis. High levels of cortisol are related to an illness calledCushing’s disease, where people have an accumulation of central body fat (makingthem look pear-shaped) and muscle wasting of the limbs (skinny arms and legs).Cushing’s disease can be associated with immune system problems, psychoticdepression, and many other health issues.Cortisol levels can be elevated by chronic stress, intense exercise, pregnancy,depression, anxiety, and the intake of stimulants such as ephedra and caffeine(as little as two or three cups a day). When Marine recruits are exposed to highlevels of stress (such as extreme sleep deprivation or intellectual or physicalstress), they have increased cortisol blood levels and decreased performance.Extreme-endurance athletes have increased cortisol levels as well as decreasedtestosterone levels, leading to reduced sperm counts and reduced libido. Excessin any form is stressful.Chronic exposure to high levels of cortisol has been associated with myriadproblems that make us unhappy, such as increased appetite, sugar and fatcravings, and abdominal obesity. Cortisol signals fat cells to hold on to theirfat stores, leading to a high waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), in which your waist sizeis large compared to your hip size, making you look like a pear. A person’s WHRis associated with perceived attractiveness. An optimal WHR is 0.8; anythingabove that puts a person at risk for illnesses (mentioned above) associated withhigher cortisol levels. A WHR ratio of 0.7 has been associated with the mostattractive women, in part because it is a sign of health and potentialfertility. As we age, our figure goes from being an hourglass to being a shotglass (especially if we are drinking too much alcohol or eating too much sugar).Long-term exposure to high levels of cortisol has also been associated with lowenergy, poor concentration, elevated cholesterol levels, heart disease andhypertension, increased risk for strokes, diabetes (reduced sensitivity toinsulin), muscle wasting, osteoporosis, anxiety, depression, irregular menstrualperiods, lowered libido, and decreased fertility. High cortisol levels decreaseimmune system function, shrinking the thymus gland and impairing white bloodcell function (by as much as 50 percent following a severe stress). Chronicstress dramatically increases the use of medical ser-vices and raises healthcare costs. Stress not only increases cortisol, it decreases key anabolichormones such as DHEA, growth hormone, and testosterone. This combination causesyou to store fat, lose muscle, slow your metabolic rate, and increase yourappetite.In the last decade we have become aware of a clear association between chronicstress, high cortisol levels, and memory problems, causing shrinkage of cells inthe hippocampus of the brain. In fact, people with Alzheimer’s disease havehigher cortisol levels than normal aging people.SOOTHING THE BRAINOkay, it makes sense that too much stress is bad for the brain. So what can youdo? Get even more stressed out from worrying about it? No, but it all startswith accepting that stress is a problem and with using your prefrontal cortex todo something about it. Unfortunately many people have to experience an emotionalthreat to life itself before they start taking their health seriously: a heartattack, cancer, stroke, or a bout with depression. Once we have been limbicallychallenged, our resources kick into gear and we start exercising and changingour lives. Hopefully you won’t need that jolt, but if you do, think about yourfamily surviving without you. Having grown up Roman Catholic, I am never aboveusing guilt—in fact, reasonable guilt can help keep one’s behavior in check.Your behavior provides a model for your children. If you are living a healthy,balanced life, your children are more likely to follow in your steps. If you areliving an extreme, out-of-control, stressed-out life, you are teaching them todo the same thing. Okay, now that we have guilt in the mix, let’s get down todestressing your life. Here’s an eleven-step plan.1. Recognize that too much stress can make you sick and hurt your brain. Theresearch is clear and compelling. No one can completely avoid stress, but it iscritical to take stress seriously.2. It is okay to say no and to renegotiate your commitments. Being too busyleaves no time for stress-reducing activities. Too often we agree to do thingswithout first asking ourselves if the request fits into our own lives. Manypeople say yes without first processing the request through their prefrontalcortex. When someone asks you to do something, a good first response might be,“Let me think about it.” Then process the request through your time, desires,and goals. In a typical week I get asked to do many, many things, more than Icould possibly do. Saying no used to stress me out. I did not want to disappointanyone. I somehow had the thought that I should be able to do everything peopleasked of me. Then one day, as I looked at an impossible mountain of work, Ifinally just said no. I asked myself whether I really wanted to do these things,if they fit the goals I had for my life, and if they were good for me. If theydid not meet my criteria, I started to say no. It was hard at first, until Irealized I was saving my own life. If you are doing too much, do the importantthings (which has to include taking care of your health and your brain) andrenegotiate the rest.3. Get enough sleep. Getting less than six and a half hours of sleep at nightdecreases our ability to fight stress. Research has shown that people whoconsistently get less sleep than others have overall decreased brain function.Inadequate sleep may promote insulin resistance: compared with those who sleepseven and a half to eight hours at night, those who get fewer than six and ahalf hours secrete 50 percent more insulin and are 40 percent less sensitive toinsulin. Lowered sleep has been associated with diabetes and obesity. In ourfast-paced society, we are often sleep deprived. In 1910 adults got an averageof nine hours of sleep each night; in 1975 it had decreased to seven and a half;and in 2000 it has decreased further, to seven hours. Here are some tips to getbetter sleep if you struggle with insomnia.• Eliminate watching television one or two hours before bedtime, especially anyprogram that may be overstimulating or anxiety provoking, such as the news.• Some people are successful reading themselves to sleep, but read boringbooks. If you read action-packed thrillers or horror stories, you are not likelyto drift off into peaceful never-never land. Sometimes I read the Book ofNumbers in the Old Testament or a biochemistry textbook.• A warm, quiet bath before bed is often helpful.• A bedtime backrub may be soothing. Starting from the neck and working down inslow rhythmic strokes can be very relaxing. Some children and teens say that afoot massage is particularly helpful (although it may be hard to find someone togive a teen a foot massage if they haven’t showered or taken a bath before bed).• Soft, slow music often helps people drift off to sleep. Instrumental music,as opposed to vocal, seems to be the most helpful.• Nature-sounds tapes (rain, thunder, ocean, rivers) can be very helpful.Others like the sound of fans.• A mixture of warm milk, a tablespoon of vanilla extract (not imitationvanilla, the real stuff), and a tablespoon of sugar can be very helpful. It willincrease serotonin to your brain and help you sleep.• Meditate or do self-hypnosis (see pages 172–173)• Use sleep control therapy. Many sleep experts give these tips to chronicinsomniacs to help them get to sleep on a regular basis.• Go to bed only when sleepy.• Use the bed and bedroom only for sleep.• When you are unable to fall asleep or return to sleep easily, get out of bedand go into another room, and return to bed only when sleepy.• Maintain a regular rise time in the morning regardless of sleep duration theprevious night.• Avoid daytime naps.• Sometimes medications are needed if getting to sleep is a chronic problem.There are pros and cons to using medication sleep aids. On the positive side,medications tend to work quickly and can help normalize a disturbed sleeppattern. On the negative side, they can have side effects (such as grogginess inthe morning) and you can become dependent on them if you take them for too long.It is best to think of medications for sleeping problems as a short-termsolution. Use the other ideas first.4. Regular exercise is one of the best stress-busters on the planet. See Chapter14.5. Use regular prayer and/or meditation. Maintaining a regular prayer life ormeditative practice creates many health benefits, mostly by calming the stressresponse. Physicians Larry Dossey (Healing Words), Dale Matthews (The FaithFactor), and others have written books outlining the scientific evidence for themedical benefits of prayer and other meditative states. Some of these benefitsare: reduced feelings of stress, lower cholesterol levels, improved sleep,reduced anxiety and depression, fewer headaches, more relaxed muscles, andlonger life span. People who pray or read the Bible every day are 40 percentless likely to suffer from hypertension than others. A 1998 Duke Universitystudy of 577 men and women hospitalized for physical illness showed that themore patients used positive spiritual coping strategies (seeking spiritualsupport from friends and religious leaders, having faith in God, praying), thelower their level of depressive symptoms and the higher their quality of life. A1996 survey of 269 family physicians found that 99 percent believed prayer,meditation, and other spiritual and religious practices can be helpful inmedical treatment; more than half said they currently incorporate relaxation ormeditation techniques into the treatment of patients.Using brain SPECT imaging, Andrew Newberg and his colleagues at the Universityof Pennsylvania investigated the neurobiology of meditation, in part because itis a spiritual state easily duplicated in the laboratory. They scanned nineBuddhist monks both before and during prolonged meditation. The scan revealeddistinctive changes in brain activity as the mind went into a meditative state.Specifically, activity decreased in the parts of the brain involved ingenerating a sense of three-dimensional orientation in space. Losing one’s senseof physical place could account for the spiritual feeling of transcendence,being beyond space and time. They also found increased activity in theprefrontal cortex, which is associated with attention span and thoughtfulness.Meditation seemed to tune people in, not out. A functional brain-imaging studyof transcendental meditation (TM) showed calming in the anterior cingulate gyrusand basal ganglia, diminishing anxiety and worries and fostering relaxation.6. Practice self-hypnosis to calm the brain. Like meditation, self-hypnosis is apowerful tool to help balance brain function and decrease stress. I becamefascinated with hypnosis during medical school and took a one-month elective init my senior year. It was a pivotal decision in my life because it taught me toappreciate other forms of self-healing. Hypnosis and meditation have similareffects on the body. Imaging studies have found that hypnosis helps balancebrain function. Studies from Belgium and Canada have shown that hypnosisincreases the attention areas of the brain and the left hemisphere; it alsodecreases the perception of pain and the areas of the brain that perceive pain.Self-hypnosis can be a powerful tool for many different reasons, including helpwith sleep. When I was a medical intern at the Walter Reed Army Medical Centerin Washington, D.C., many patients asked me for sleeping pills to help with theinsomnia that goes with being sick in a noisy hospital. Before I gave thempills, I would hypnotize them and make them a self-hypnosis tape. Eight timesout of ten they no longer needed the sleeping pills.Here are instructions on how to put yourself into a simple hypnotic trance. Donot try to do this while driving or operating heavy machinery.• Focus your eyes on a spot, and count slowly to twenty. Let your eyes feelheavy as you count, and close them as you get to twenty.• Take three or four very slow, deep breaths.• Tighten the muscles in your arms and legs, then let them relax.• Imagine yourself walking down a staircase while you count backward from ten.(This will give you the feeling of “going down” or becoming sleepy.)• With all of your senses (sight, touch, hearing, taste, smell) imagineyourself in a very sleepy scene, such as lying by a fire in a mountain cabin orin a sleeping bag at the beach.• After spending ten to fifteen minutes in your special place, allow yourselfto come back to full consciousness. If you fall asleep, it means that likely youare not getting enough sleep.Try it. I still use this technique when I am stressed.7. Become your own biofeedback machine. Biofeedback uses instruments to measurephysiological processes in the body that are related to stress and teachespeople how to self-induce calming states. Biofeedback teaches people to warmtheir hands, relax their muscles, dry their skin, slow and deepen breathingpatterns, calm excessive brain-wave activity, and increase heart ratevariability. All of these responses counteract the fight-or-flight response. AsI mentioned, under stress our bodies produce more adrenaline, which triggers thefight-or-flight response. Our hands become cold, to shunt blood to the largemuscles of the arms and legs so we can fight or run; our hands sweat to cool offour bodies; our breathing becomes fast and shallow; our heart beats faster andis less variable to try to meet our body’s increased demand for oxygen; ourmuscles tighten to get us ready to fight or run; and our brain waves heighten toincrease our alertness. Learning how to self-regulate these functions throughmental exercises gives us a sense of being in control, which improves ourability to deal with stress. There are many biofeedback therapists across theUnited States. A wonderful website to learn more about biofeedback and to findpractitioners in your area is www.aapb.org [http://www.aapb.org].It is beyond the scope of this book to tell you how to do biofeedback, but Iwant to tell you about a very cool biofeedback video game you (and your kids)can do at home. I am generally opposed to video games because I do not thinkthey help the brain develop properly. But this particular game is very cool. Itis the ultimate video game in that you play it exclusively with your mind. It iscalled Experience the Journey into the Wild Divine (www.wilddivine.com[http://www.wilddivine.com]). It is not very expensive (about $160) and comeswith everything you need, including sensors to measure hand sweat-gland activityand heart rate variability. The graphics of the game beautifully instructplayers how to relax their minds and get into a healthful physiological state.When your body goes into the relaxed state, you can blow pinwheels with yourmind, juggle balls in the air with your brain power, and fly a balloon.8. Avoid substances that stress the brain. It should be obvious, but many peopleare not aware that excessive amounts of caffeine and nicotine can cause damageto the brain. These substances both constrict blood flow to the brain and cancause premature aging. In addition, substances that people use as uppers—such asephedra, synephrine, yohimbine, and guarana—cause increased brain stress.9. Consider stress-busting supplements. Some supplements may be helpful incounteracting stress. B vitamins are especially effective. During heightenedperiods of stress people may also benefit from St. John’s wort, 5-HTP, SAMe,L-theanine, or valerian. Take these under the supervision of your health careprofessional. Just because something is natural does not mean it is completelyinnocuous.10. See a psychotherapist. If you are chronically stressed, it may be a goodidea to see a psychotherapist to talk about your problems and learn betterskills in dealing with stress. Many people have a negative attitude aboutpsychotherapists, but I think of them as life consultants. When a great businesshas troubles, it is likely to deal with the problems head-on and find the bestconsultants to help. We should behave the same way in our personal lives. Indealing with stress I often refer people to biofeedback therapists,hypnotherapists, and therapists in EMDR (see Chapter 8), which helps them dealwith anxiety, past traumas, and performance enhancement.11. Get more laughter into your life. A growing body of scientific literaturesuggests that laughter counteracts stress and is good for the immune system.According to University of California at Irvine’s Lee Berk, “If we took what weknow about the medical benefits of laughter and bottled it up, it would requireFDA approval.” Laughter can lower blood pressure, trigger a flood of endorphins(the brain chemicals that can bring on euphoria and decrease pain), and enhanceour immune systems. Gamma-interferon, a disease-fighting protein, rises withlaughter. So do B-cells, which produce disease-destroying antibodies, andT-cells, which orchestrate the body’s immune response. Laughter lowers the flowof dangerous stress hormones that suppress the immune system, raise bloodpressure, and increase the number of platelets, which cause clots andpotentially fatal coronary artery blockages. The average child laughs hundredsof times a day. The average adult laughs only a dozen times a day. If only wecould collect those lost laughs and use them to our advantage.One person was able to do this quite effectively. In Norman Cousins’s classicbook Anatomy of an Illness, he describes how he used laughter to treat adebilitating immune disorder called ankylosing spondylitis. The illness causehim pain, fatigue, and a great deal of anxiety. He believed that he became sickbecause he was overtired from travel and work and his body was in a state ofadrenal exhaustion. He went from doctor to doctor, took medicine after medicine,and was not getting better. One specialist estimated his chances of recovery atone in five hundred. In partnership with his physician, he gradually stoppedtaking all of his medications, added large doses of intravenous vitamin C, andbegan a program of laughter. Allen Funt, famed producer of the television seriesCandid Camera, sent him films of the TV series, along with a projector for hislaughter therapy. Cousins also watched Marx Brothers and Laurel and Hardy films.He discovered that ten minutes of a genuine belly laugh had a pain-relievingeffect and would give him restful sleep for two hours. He laughed and laughed.After a period of time his illness started to improve, and eventually it wentaway.Put laughter in your life every day. Watch comedies (a helpful form of TV), goto comedy clubs, read joke books (my favorite is The Far Side by Gary Larson,which is pretty sick, but I am a psychiatrist after all), and swap jokes withyour friends. Abraham Lincoln suffered from serious periods of depression. Heused laughter and telling jokes as one form of medicine. Here are three of myfavorite humorous Lincoln sayings.• Common-looking people are the best in the world: that is the reason the Lordmakes so many of them.• If I were two-faced, would I be wearing this one?• It is said that an Eastern monarch once charged his wise men to invent him asentence to be ever in view, and that should be true and appropriate in alltimes and situations. They presented him with the words: “And this, too, shallpass away.”"},{"pageContent":"19KEEPING THE BRAIN YOUNGPREVENTING PROBLEMS OF AGINGThe lights in the brain dim with age, unless we actively work to keep ithealthy. The Amen Clinics’ database of more than thirty thousand scans of peoplefrom three to one hundred years old make it clear that the normal brain hasfewer and fewer resources with age (see Table 19.1). There is less blood flow tobring oxygen and glucose to the neurons and take away waste products, and thereare fewer antioxidants to protect it against free radical formation and to lowerhormone levels to keep it young. This is the fate of the typical brain. But yourbrain does not have to succumb to age at the same rate as others. There aresimple things you can do today to prevent disease and keep your brain healthyfor as long as possible. This chapter will teach you how to recognize and reduceyour risk for the diseases of aging that affect the brain.image [images/Amen_9780307338136_epub_019_r1.jpg]In order to stay healthy, the brain has to repair itself on a constant basis.It’s not like a car that you can take into a garage for a tune-up or to have apart replaced. Your brain has mechanisms to repair damage as a result of thenormal wear and tear of life. The hardware of the brain—neurons, dendrites,axons, synapses, and others—must be cared for. The brain has to maintain itshundred billion neurons if they are to consistently function well. If the numberof neurons in any cortical circuit decreases by more than one-third—as is thecase in Alzheimer’s disease—the circuit can no longer compensate for the loss,and symptoms appear.Many people still believe that we are born with all of the nerve cells we willever have and that human brains simply cannot replace dead neurons. Scientistsonce considered brain damage irreversible and neurological disease in theelderly unstoppable. In stunning new research, however, investigatorsdemonstrated that adult human brains generate new cells after all. Since thenscientists have been furiously studying the implications, and research in thisarea has accelerated.Neurogenesis means “birth,” but this birth cycle is begun by death. Let’s sayyou go to a New Year’s Eve party and have a little too much champagne. You comehome and sleep it off. By the time you awaken, several hundred thousand neuronshave died from alcohol toxicity. Somehow the number of neurons in your brain hasto be brought back up to normal to reach a steady state. Neurogenesis is theprocess that develops and maintains the functional capacity of the circuits byreplacing neurons that are killed or damaged. The very act of the neurons dyingtriggers certain growth factors in the brain to stimulate the formation of newneurons.Neurogenesis doesn’t know when to stop; left on its own it will continuecreating new neurons until the brain explodes. The brain has to regulate itselfso that just the right numbers of neurons are maintained. When the numbergenerated reaches a certain level, cell death is triggered, which miraculouslybrings the number back down. Yet once again this death mechanism does not knowwhen to stop killing, and thus new neuron formation is triggered again. Thisprocess allows the brain cell growth to stay within a certain range, so that thecircuits can always function well—at least under normal conditions.This brain repair process is called synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, and celldeath. You can think of it simply as the brain’s governor, whose main job is togovern the population. It must maintain the right homeostasis, or all hell willbreak loose. Not only do the numbers of cells have to be regulated, but so dothe one thousand trillion synapses that connect them. Maintaining synaptichealth is essential for brain function.Diseases of aging in the brain typically cause the following problems:• They reduce the number of brain cells, as in Alzheimer’s disease.• They reduce the number of connections between cells, which happens when thereis depression or a lack of mental or physical exercise.• They impair the generation of electrical activity, which can happen if oneconsumes three or more alcoholic drinks at a time.• They disrupt cell machinery to produce energy, which happens in Parkinson’sdisease and diabetes, and in chemotherapy and radiation therapy for cancer.• They damage axons to slow the speed of signals in the brain, as inhypertension, heart disease, stroke, and head trauma.KNOW AND REDUCE YOUR RISK FOR THE DISEASES OF BRAIN AGINGThe following list contains the risk factors for diseases of brain aging. Thenumber in parentheses indicates how significant the risk factor is. For example,2.0 means that there is twice the risk of having a problem; 4.0 means that therisk is quadrupled. Check the ones that apply to you.1.  (3.5) One family member withAlzheimer’s disease or other cause of dementia2.  (7.5) More than one familymember with Alzheimer’s disease or other dementia3.  (2.0) A single head injurywith loss of consciousness for more than a few minutes4.  (2.0) Several head injurieswithout loss of consciousness5.  (4.4) Alcohol dependence ordrug dependence in past or present6.  (2.0) Major depressiondiagnosed by a physician in past or present7.  (10) Stroke8.  (2.5) Heart (coronary artery)disease or heart attack (myocardial infarction or MI)9.  (2.1) High cholesterol(hyperlipidemia)10.  (2.3) High blood pressure(hypertension)11.  (3.4) Diabetes12.  (3.0) History of cancer orcancer treatment13.  (1.5) Seizures in past orpresent14.  (2.0) Limited exercise (lessthan twice a week or less than thirty minutes per session)15.  (2.0) Less than a high schooleducation16.  (2.0) Jobs that do notrequire periodically learning new information17.  (2.3) Smoking cigarettes forten years or longer18.  (2.5) One apolipoprotein E4gene (if known)19.  (5.0) Two apolipoprotein E4genes (if known)   Total Score (Add up thenumbers in parentheses for all items checked.)INTERPRETATIONIf your score is 0, 1, or 2, then you have low risk factors for developing thebrain diseases of aging.If your score is 3, 4, 5, or 6, then you have a moderate risk for developing thediseases of aging and should take prevention seriously.If your score is greater than 6, then prevention strategies should be part ofyour everyday life.GENETIC RISK FACTORSA family history that includes memory problems is a cause for concern andpreventive action. This is especially true for people who have a first-degreerelative (mother, father, brother, or sister) with Alzheimer’s disease, strokes,or Parkinson’s disease. Several genes are associated with Alzheimer’s diseaseand other causes of memory problems, especially the E4 version of theapolipoprotein E (apoE) gene on chromosome 19. Everyone has two apoE genes, andif one of them—or worse, two of them—are apoE4, that person’s chances of gettingmemory problems is quite high. Of course, apoE genes alone are not dangerous; weneed them to function, but the E4 type increases our risk of age-relatedproblems. There are three versions of the apoE gene: E2, E3, and E4, and it isthe last one that is the culprit. As with all genes, we inherit one copy fromeach parent, and any one person could have the following combination:E2/E2, E2/E3, E2/E4,E3/E3, E3/E4, orE/4, E/4.If a person has two E4 genes, it means he received one from each parent. Forabout 15 percent of the general population, at least one of the two apoE genesis the E4 gene. People who have no apoE4 gene at all have only a 5 to 10 percentchance of developing Alzheimer’s disease after age sixty-five, whereas peoplewith one apoE4 gene have about a 25 percent chance. Given the increased risk ofproblems with this gene, it would be wise to know your apoE genotype. To findout what it is, you can ask your doctor to order a simple blood test. As I’vementioned, this should be done under the strictest confidence so that insurancecompanies or others cannot obtain the information and potentially use it againstyou. It would be best to pay for the test on your own and keep it in yourpersonal records; do not allow it to be included in your medical records.ALCOHOL AND DRUG ABUSEAlcohol is a double-edged sword. It can increase the risk of stroke, heartdisease, and possibly Alzheimer’s. Five percent of all strokes in the UnitedStates are alcohol-related. Four or more drinks a day increase the risks forstroke and heart disease, while one drink every few days actually reduces theserisks (presumably by increasing HDL cholesterol, which clears other types ofcholesterol that cause hardening of the arteries).Clearly, drug abuse damages the brain. More than a hundred brain imaging studiesdemonstrate that drug abuse—including cocaine, methamphe-tamines, marijuana,heroin, and other opiates—diminishes brain function and damages neurons. One ofthe first things I learned from doing brain imaging on a wide variety ofpsychiatric patients was that drug abuse damages the function seen on SPECTscans. I have made several posters that hang in more than twenty thousandschools, prisons, and drug abuse treatment centers nationwide on the effects ofdrugs on brain function. Recently, it was found that cocaine inhibits a part ofcells involved in energy production, which has also been linked to Parkinson’sdisease.Reducing the risk of aging from alcohol and drug abuse is simple—stop using thethings that harm brain function. If drinking is a problem, I recommend stoppingaltogether and seeking treatment if needed. If it is not a problem, limityourself to no more than one or two normal-size drinks a week.CANCER AND CANCER TREATMENTIn addition to cancers that invade the brain and can cause dementia, sometreatments for cancer get into the brain and can also cause dementia. But thereare few studies on this issue. One of the studies done examined the effect ofchemotherapy in a hundred women with breast cancer. Dr. E. S. van Dam found thatwomen who received chemotherapy plus tamoxifen were four to eight times morelikely to develop cognitive impairment than early-stage breast cancer women whohad not received chemotherapy. A review of children who are long-term survivorsof cancer, particularly brain cancer and leukemia, showed that the two mostcommon long-term effects of radiation therapy and chemotherapy are cognitive andhormonal impairment. Surprisingly, they found that the cognitive impairment isprogressive and not static. Anything you do to decrease the risk of cancer—suchas exercise, eating more fruits and vegetables, decreasing stress, and stoppingsmoking—will also help your brain stay healthy.CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASEAll forms of cardiovascular disease increase brain aging. The heart andblood-vessel system delivers blood and nutrients to the brain. Whatever is goodfor the heart is good for the brain; whatever is bad for the heart andblood-vessel system is bad for the brain. Forms of cardiovascular diseaseinclude atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, congestive heart disease,heart rhythm problems, high cholesterol, and hypertension.The most effective way to prevent cardiovascular problems is to prevent thediseases that produce them. Exercise and diet are both important factors thatyou have some control over. You can also investigate your family history. If itincludes heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or high cholesterol, then you shouldconsult your physician and ask her to screen for these conditions at theappropriate age of risk or after the age of forty in general. An annualscreening after the age of fifty is extremely wise. Regular cardiovascularexercise for thirty minutes or more goes a long way to improve lipid metabolismto reduce lipid deposits in blood vessel walls. The main focus of your dietshould be to reduce saturated fats, which are high in the bad cholesterols andcontribute to the fatty deposits in the blood vessels that causeatherosclerosis. Foods high in saturated fats include butter, cheese, cookies,doughnuts, pastries, ice cream, fatty meat, and so on. (See Chapter 11 for moreinformation on a brain-healthy diet.)CEREBRAL VASCULAR DISEASE (BRAIN BLOOD-VESSEL DISEASE)The risk of developing serious brain problems in a person who has a stroke issix to ten times greater than in the general population. Even a stroke smallerthan a pencil-head eraser increases the risk for dementia four- to twelvefold.A stroke is a single damaging attack, but the risk factors that lead to astroke, such as high blood pressure, smoking, heart disease, and diabetes,develop over a long time. You can reduce your stroke risk by taking thefollowing simple steps:• Keep blood pressure under control. Check your blood pressure often, and if itis high, follow your doctor’s advice on how to lower it. Treating high bloodpressure reduces the risk for both stroke and heart disease.• Stop smoking. Cigarette smoking is linked to increased risk for stroke andheart disease. The risk of stroke for people who have quit smoking for two tofive years is lower than for people who still smoke.• Exercise regularly. Exercise makes the heart stronger and improvescirculation. It also helps control weight. Being overweight increases the chanceof high blood pressure, atherosclerosis, heart disease, and adult-onset (type 2)diabetes. Physical activities like walking, bicycling, swimming, and tennislower the risk of both stroke and heart disease. Talk with your doctor beforestarting a vigorous exercise program.• Eat a healthy, balanced diet and control diabetes. If untreated, diabetes candamage the blood vessels throughout the body and lead to atherosclerosis.The warning signs for stroke are: sudden numbness or weakness in the face, arm,or leg, especially on one side of the body; sudden confusion, trouble speakingor understanding; sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes; sudden troublewalking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination; sudden severe headache withno known cause. If you suspect that either you or someone you know is having astroke, call 911 immediately, even if the symptoms seem to have gone away.Sometimes the warning signs last for only a few minutes and then disappear, butthat does not mean the problem is resolved. You could have had a transientstroke, called a transient ischemic attack (TIA), and although it doesn’t lastlong, it is a symptom of a greater medical problem. Don’t ignore a TIA—see yourdoctor right away.DEPRESSIONDepression has been associated with increased risk for dementia. A prior historyof medically treated depression can be associated with a threefold increase inthis risk. In an impressive study, Drs. Kristine Yaffe and Terri Blackwell fromthe University of California at San Francisco studied the association betweendepression and cognitive decline. As part of an ongoing prospective study, theyevaluated 5,781 elderly women. They studied them at baseline and again fouryears later, using tests for depression, memory, and concentration. At baseline,211 (3.6 percent) of the women had six or more depressive symptoms. Only 16 (7.6percent) of these women were receiving treatment, which meant 93.4 percent ofdepressed woman in the study were not being treated. Increasing symptoms ofdepression were associated with worse performance at baseline and follow-up onall tests. Women with three to five symptoms of depression were at 1.6 greaterodds for cognitive deterioration, while women with six or more symptoms ofdepression were at 2.3 greater odds for problems, more than double the risk.They concluded that depression in older women is associated with both poorcognitive function and subsequent cognitive decline. It is critical to note thatmost psychiatric diseases in general are, in effect, brain diseases.Schizophrenia, for example, has been shown to affect the frontal and temporallobes, and depression has been associated with decreased activity in the frontallobes. These illnesses are also exacerbated by chronic stress; increased stresshormones have been shown to kill cells in the hippocampus.Early treatment is essential to stave off the ravages of psychiatric illnesses.Our work with SPECT teaches us that with appropriate treatment, the brainbecomes more balanced and works in a much more efficient way. Treatment caninvolve medication, psychotherapy, supplements, or a combination of all three.Medication and supplements work by altering certain neurotransmitters in thebrain—for example, antidepressants, which work by enhancing serotonin,norepinephrine, or dopamine. Psychotherapy has also been shown recently toaffect neurotransmitter systems and enhance activity seen on SPECT and PETscans.DIABETESDiabetes damages almost every organ, including the brain, by making bloodvessels hard and brittle. This increases the likelihood of stroke, heartdisease, and hypertension, all of which increase aging problems for the brain.In diabetes there is a failure to keep blood sugar (glucose) at appropriatelevels, which impairs memory and other cognitive functions. Sometimes thetreatment of diabetes lowers blood glucose too much (hypoglycemia), which canalso impair memory and other cognitive functions.People with a family history of diabetes should have a fasting blood glucosetest once a year after the age of forty. Also, if symptoms of increasedurination, increased thirst, or increased appetite develop, then fasting bloodglucose should be checked for diabetes. One of the most effective preventionsagainst diabetes is exercise, which improves insulin’s ability to regulate bloodglucose. Although there are many reasons why daily exercise is better thanexercise every three days, the available data suggest that exercising at leastevery three days helps protect against diabetes and a number of other illnesses.A diet high in refined sugars increases the risk of diabetes. A balanced diet,such as the one recommended in The Zone, is a good approach to eating that helpsstabilize blood sugar. Consulting with a nutritionist or dietitian is also agood idea.LACK OF EDUCATIONA number of studies that attempted to identify risk factors for dementia havenoted an inverse relationship between education and dementia—the more education,the less dementia. This is a controversial risk factor because educationalbackground and achievement can introduce a number of other factors thatgenerally affect health and opportunity. Despite the controversy, significantevidence supports the idea that education (and increased mental activity)produces a functional reserve in the brain, which can provide protection againstdeveloping dementia. The philosophy of “use it or lose it” is very much at playin the brain. The more it is challenged and stimulated (without overdoingit—which leads to the harmful effects of stress), the more ability it will haveas we age. No one that I am aware of has studied whether learning disabilitiesand other conditions, such as ADD, that often lead to school failure areassociated with dementia. My strong suspicion is that there is a connection. Anycondition that negatively impacts brain function can put the brain at risk forother problems later on. I believe we should aggressively treat children andteens with school problems so that they will stay in school and hopefully growto love learning and be the lifelong learners they need to be to help protecttheir brains.Keeping your mind active—by reading, doing crossword puzzles, traveling, takingclasses, and otherwise acquiring knowledge outside your typical or usualexperience—helps to reduce the risk of aging problems.HIGH HOMOCYSTEINE LEVELSHomocysteine is an amino acid regulated by folic acid in red blood cells. Iflevels are elevated, homocysteine increases risks for coronary artery disease,stroke, and dementia. The risk is largely eliminated for homocysteine levels of10 or below. High homocysteine levels in the blood increase LDL cholesterol,which narrows the coronary blood vessels. A study of persons who requiredcoronary angioplasty (to open up their coronary arteries) showed thathomocysteine levels higher than 11 could be treated with folic acid (1 mg),vitamin B12 (400 mcg), and pyridoxine (10 mg) to reduce the level to about 7.This homocysteine reduction helped prevent renarrowing of the coronary arteriesafter the angioplasty and halved the chance that these blood vessels would closeup again and require another angioplasty. High homocysteine levels can also makeblood clot more easily than it should, increasing the risk of blood vesselblockages and stroke or heart attack.Homocysteine is normally changed into other amino acids for use by the body. Ifyour homocysteine level is too high, you may not have enough B vitamins to helpthis process. Most people with a high homocysteine level don’t get enough folate(also called folic acid), vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), or vitamin B12 in their diet.Replacing these vitamins helps return homocysteine levels to normal. Otherpossible causes of a high homocysteine level include low levels of thyroidhormone, kidney disease, psoriasis, some medicines, or inherited deficiencies inthe enzymes used to process homocysteine in the body.HORMONESESTROGEN DEFICIENCY INDUCED BY MENOPAUSESix of ten studies showed that women who took estrogen had a lower risk forAlzheimer’s disease. The best of these studies was the Baltimore LongitudinalStudy of Aging, in which 472 women who were going through menopause or hadcompleted it were followed for up to sixteen years. Women who never usedestrogen during the study were twice as likely to develop dementia.This study and others showing beneficial effects of estrogen have recently beencontradicted by reports from the Women’s Health Initiative, which found thatwomen who used Premarin (an estrogen made from horse ovaries) were twice aslikely to develop Alzheimer’s as nonestrogen users. But the Women’s HealthInitiative study did not examine the risk of AD using forms of estrogen made bythe human ovary, such as estradiol. Evidence suggesting that these more naturalforms of estrogen for women may still reduce AD risk and provide other benefitscomes from the largest study ever done on the severest form of estrogendeficiency—hysterectomy with removal of the ovaries. This study of a hundredthousand women who participated in the 1986 National Mortality Followback Surveyfound that women with a hysterectomy were twice as likely to develop dementia.What one can conclude from this complex maze of seemingly contradictory researchfindings is that women should avoid Premarin and other forms of estrogen thatare not made by the human ovary. But severe reductions in female estrogenhormones are equally harmful and should be treated. A large body of basicscientific research demonstrates sound reasons why estrogen, in the rightamount, protects the brain, the blood vessels, and the bones. Human forms ofestrogen, taken in the smallest amounts needed to keep blood estradiol levelsfrom falling too low after menopause, are reasonably safe and have not, to date,been demonstrated by the Women’s Health Initiative or any other study to beharmful.If you are a woman with a family history of dementia, then you should have ablood estradiol test after menopause to determine if you have estrogendeficiency. You can then evaluate with your doctor whether low-dose estradiol orother natural estrogens would be worth taking. The situation is more complex inwomen with a family history of both AD and breast or uterine cancer, becauseestrogen use increases the risk of these two cancers. Whether low-dose estradiolsignificantly increases the risk of heart disease or stroke in women withoutsymptoms is more controversial. The relative benefits of taking low-doseestradiol after menopause (reduced risk of AD and osteoporosis) may be greaterthan the relative risks (increased risk of endometrial cancer, breast cancer,and maybe stroke and heart disease), but the decision regarding treatmentdepends on your personal history and risk factors for each of these diseases.Although not all studies agree, estrogen use after menopause appears tosignificantly reduce AD risk. Estrogen use in estrogen-deficient women can alsoimprove verbal fluency and possibly verbal short-term memory. Evista is a formof estrogen that is safer for women with increased risk of breast or uterinecancer.TESTOSTERONE DEFICIENCY IN MALESTestosterone levels normally start to decline after age fifty. By age eighty,testosterone levels are 20 to 50 percent of their former adult levels. Lowtestosterone levels may increase dementia risk. A case-control study involving83 AD patients and 103 normal volunteers of similar age showed significantlyreduced total testosterone levels in AD males. But until a well-designed groupstudy is done, it is not certain whether testosterone deficiency is a riskfactor for AD.Men who have or have had prostate cancer treatment, or men fifty and older, maydevelop cognitive impairment due to testosterone deficiency, which can bechecked by a blood test. Symptoms including difficulty with vision not due toeye problems, difficulty remembering locations or faces or other objects ofinterest, breast enlargement, or a change in the distribution of body hairshould alert one to check for testosterone deficiency.PARKINSON’S DISEASEParkinson’s disease (PD) is caused by the loss of dopamine-producing cells.There is a significant connection between PD and AD. There is no known cure forPD, but with early detection there are medications that help with the symptoms.It has also been suggested that coenzyme Q10, a powerful antioxidant, along withhigh doses of vitamins C and E, may be helpful in delaying the need for strongerand stronger medications. Vitamin B6 increases the production of dopamine andmay be helpful early in the disease process. The natural hormone melatonin,which regulates sleep, has been found to reduce tremors and protect against freeradical damage on dopamine neurons. Fish oils and flaxseeds contain omega-3fatty acids that have nerve-nourishing effects that can boost dopamine.SEIZURES AND SEIZURE MEDICATIONAbout 125,000 Americans develop epilepsy every year. Thousands more experienceisolated seizures that may or may not happen again in the future, but onlyrecurring seizures are defined as epilepsy. Treatment of epilepsy has improveddramatically in recent years. Seizures can often be controlled, and the chancesof long-term remission are improving all the time. But seizures and certainantiseizure medications can have a negative effect on brain function and beassociated with dementia. During seizures there is dramatically increased brainactivity, and then in the in-between period there is significant decreasedactivity. Antiseizure medications work by increasing inhibition in the brain. Ifthis is done too enthusiastically, as with the older antiseizure medication likeDilantin and phenobarbital, the drug can cause overall decreased activity anddamage the healthy cells around the seizure-promoting ones.Obviously, seizure disorders must be vigorously treated. Once a person is twoyears seizure free, however, many neurologists start to taper off theantiseizure medications to see how much is needed. Also, newer antiseizuremedications, such as Trileptal, are less likely to cause too much overallinhibition of brain function. If you are taking an antiseizure medication andnotice memory problems, that is a symptom that the temporal lobes may be calmedtoo much. The most common cause of seizures in someone with epilepsy is nottaking seizure medication as prescribed. For some people whose seizures cannotbe controlled with medication, there is the option of surgery to remove thedamaged tissue. Sometimes it is possible to identify a certain action or eventthat will always produce seizures in sensitive people. Seizure “triggers”include flickering lights, breathing very quickly and deeply, drinking anexcessive amount of fluid, and even, in very rare cases, reading or listening toa certain piece of music. Sleep deprivation (like staying up all night studying)may produce seizures; so may excessive use of alcohol or withdrawal from certaindrugs. Avoiding seizure triggers may require no more than a slight readjustmentof activities.SLEEP APNEAObstructive sleep apnea—a condition associated with loud snoring, stoppingbreathing entirely for brief periods many times during the night, and chronictiredness—can cause cognitive impairment. The only brain SPECT study ofobstructive sleep apnea examined fourteen moderate to severely affectedpatients, who stopped breathing more than thirty times per hour. Their brainSPECT scans showed significantly reduced activity in the left parietal lobe.Reduced left parietal lobe activity can impair comprehension, making itdifficult to understand conversations or read books. Treatment of the sleepapnea with nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP, a machine thatpushes air at a high pressure through the nasal passageways) completely reversedthe impaired brain activity in these patients. Sleep apnea should be evaluatedand treated as early as possible.SMOKINGCigarette smoking accounts for 12 percent of all the strokes in the UnitedStates and is therefore a major risk factor for dementia. Smoking is also a riskfor lung, stomach, and bladder cancer; hypertension; and heart disease. Nicotineconstricts small blood vessels in all the organs of the body, including thebrain, and prematurely ages everything.Obviously, stop smoking. I know this is often much more easily said than done.Over the years I have helped many people stop smoking, and I have found that noone program works for everyone. Hypnosis is effective for some, the use ofnicotine patches or gum works for others, the medication Wellbutrin(buproprion), a dopamine-enhancing antidepressant, is helpful for others, andsome respond to group therapy. In my experience it is usually a combination oftreatments that are needed.In order to keep your brain young, you need to keep your mind and body young aswell. As you can see, the strategies are simple—stop polluting your body, eatgood food, exercise your mind and body, and treat disease early. The followingchapter will discuss rational supplementation as the next part of the programfor keeping your brain young and making your good brain great."},{"pageContent":"20SUPERCHARGING NEURONSBRAIN-SPECIFIC SUPPLEMENTSMost medical students are taught that people do not need vitamins andsupplements. If you eat a balanced diet, they are told, you get all thenutrients needed. I was told this in medical school, and the mantra is stillbeing disseminated twenty-seven years later. The one problem with this advice isthat no one I know has a balanced diet. In the age of fast everything—food,information, communication—three nutritious meals a day are long gone. Inaddition, several antiaging supplements have been found to be helpful even ifyour diet is pretty good.Having reviewed the medical research on prevention and supplementation, I takehigh-potency multiple vitamins every day, along with extra vitamins C and E,ginkgo biloba, alpha-lipoic acid, phosphatidal serine, acetyl-l-carnitine,CoQ10, and fish oil. Despite being a very busy physician, I also do my best toexercise daily for thirty minutes or more and try to eat right, including fish,fruit, and vegetables. These preventive actions are a part of my life becauseenough research supports the use of each of these strategies to have the bestbrain and body possible. Furthermore, these preventive strategies are safe ifyou are being monitored by your physician on a regular basis. People who havebleeding problems or take blood thinners need to exert caution with theserecommendations and check with their doctor, especially with the recommendationsfor ginkgo and vitamin E. One of the keys to a great brain is to use preventionand supplementation strategies as early and wisely as possible.Before discussing each of the supplements, it is important to discuss the prosand cons of using them. There are significant advantages to using proper brainsupplementation, as well as a few downsides or controversies you need to knowabout.The most significant benefit to using natural supplements is that they aregeared to prevent illness rather than just treat it. Preventing problems isdramatically more cost effective than treating them after they have occurred.Engaging in supplement strategies helps build an attitude of prevention andhopefully leads to a healthier lifestyle overall. Waiting until you have anillness, such as a stroke or Alzheimer’s disease, is always more expensive thanspending time, effort, and money to prevent it. In addition, supplements areoften very effective for mild to moderate problems, with fewer side effects thanmost pharmaceuticals. Compliance tends to be higher for these products, whichmeans that people are more likely to take them over the long run. Generally,supplement strategies are less expensive than pharmaceutical alternatives. Inaddition, you never have to tell an insurance company that you have taken them.As awful as it sounds, taking prescription medication for brain problems, oreven to enhance brain health, can affect a person’s insurability. This is truefor medications that treat anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, ADD, and manyother problems. I know many patients, colleagues, and friends who have beendenied health or life insurance because of the medications they were taking. Ifthere are natural alternatives, they are worth considering.The supplement picture is not all rosy, and some of the disadvantages have to beconsidered. Even though supplements are generally less expensive thanmedications, they may be more expensive for you precisely because they are notcovered by insurance. In addition, many people are unaware that naturalsupplements can have side effects. Just because a substance is natural does notmean it is innocuous. For example, St. John’s wort, one of my favorite naturalantidepressants that works like a mild form of Prozac in the brain, can causesun sensitivity and can deactivate the effectiveness of other medications, suchas birth control pills and antivirals.One of the major issues of concern regarding natural products is the lack ofstandardization and quality control. Rigid quality control is not required forthese products, and the manufacturing process has many variables. There arevariables with the plant part used for herbs, such as age, ripeness whenharvested, growing environment, and storage conditions. The therapeutic andtoxic components of the supplement may vary considerably. There also may beissues with contamination. Different components of each herb can exhibitdifferent pharmacological effects. It is critical to get brands you trust thathave been tested and shown to be reliable. Another disadvantage is that peopleget a lot of their advice about supplements from the clerk at the grocery store,who may not have the most up-to-date information. I often send patients towww.consumerlabs.com [http://www.consumerlabs.com], an independent laboratorythat posts the results of quality control tests.Even given the cons, supplements, to my mind, are worth serious consideration.We can be targeted and thoughtful in our choices, and we can find dedicatedcompanies that produce high-quality products. It amazes me how many physicianshave a knee-jerk negative reaction to supplements despite the large amounts ofresearch on them. I teach the course on supplements to the psychiatric residentsat the University of California at Irvine. Many of the residents start thecourse with a negative attitude about them; invariably one will say there is notenough research on them and that they do not really contain the ingredients onthe labels. At the end of the course, when they have learned about the extensiveresearch and good-quality companies, many of the young psychiatrists are excitedabout the possibility of using supplements to help their patients, and many evenstart to take the ones I discuss below. I have had enough personal experiencewith the side effects of pharmaceuticals to believe that patients deserve toknow about natural alternatives.The rest of the chapter explores some of my favorite brain supplementationstrategies. You do not need to take all of them. Evaluate each product for yourown personal situation and risk factors. Unless you have a reason not to, Ibelieve everyone should engage in regular mental and physical exercise and takea multiple vitamin, vitamin C, and fish oil every day. After age forty, whencellular energy production and antioxidant levels in the body naturally arelower, most people will also benefit from acetyl-L-carnitine, alpha-lipoic acid,and CoQ10.ACETYL-L-CARNITINEAcetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) has been reported to improve mental focus, enhanceenergy, and slow aging. Research has shown that ALC increases levels ofneurotransmitters needed for memory, focus, and learning, and repairs the damagedone to brain cells caused by stress and poor nutrition. About 95 percent ofenergy production in your cells occurs in the mitochondria. Many diseases ofaging are increasingly being referred to as “mitochondrial disorders.” ALC hasbeen shown to help increase energy production in the mitochondria.Some people report feeling an increase in mental energy and focus within twentyminutes of taking ALC, so you should not take it late in the day, as it may giveyou insomnia. Even though ALC is not a stimulant, it seems to naturally increaseenergy in the brain. Over thirty studies show that ALC slows or preventsage-related decline in mental function. In one study 1.5 g of ALC given to 236older adults each day for forty-five days significantly increased theeffectiveness of performance on all the measures of cognitive functioning,memory, and constructional thinking. Twenty adults given 1.5 g of ALCexperienced a reversal of many of the signs of brain aging. Alcoholics withcognitive impairment have also benefited from ALC. Acetyl-L-carnitine ispotentially valuable in helping depression. One hundred sixty patients who hadsuffered from a stroke a year or more ago were given 1.5 g of ALC a day foreight weeks. This led to increased speed of recovery, as well as improved moodand attention span. A total of more than six hundred patients with Alzheimer’shave been studied in over twenty years of research, demonstrating that ALCbenefits patients with dementia.Because of a lack of long-term safety studies, ALC is not advised for pregnantwomen or nursing mothers. Mild gastrointestinal symptoms may occur in thosetaking ALC, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea.Increased agitation has been reported in some with Alzheimer’s disease whentaking oral ALC. In people with seizure disorders, an increase in seizurefrequency has been reported after taking ALC.You should consider ALC if you suffer from tiredness, mental fatigue, memoryloss, or attentional problems. The typical dose is 500 to 1,500 mg a day.ALPHA-LIPOIC ACIDAlpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is an antioxidant that increases the potency of manyother antioxidants, including vitamins C and E and, most importantly,glutathione. Glutathione is the most powerful antioxidant in cells and acts toregulate the cells’ ability to absorb free radicals and prevent damage, whichhas been demonstrated in studies in blood, skeletal muscle, and liver cells. ALAis a small molecule that readily enters the brain to protect it from freeradical damage. ALA helps to prevent some of the diseases that put the brain atrisk for problems ranging from cancer to AIDS. It has shown significant benefitswith varying levels of scientific support. In one study ALA reduced the size ofstrokes by as much as 50 percent. There is evidence that it may help prevent orslow the development of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries). Remember,whatever is good for the heart is good for the brain. Researchers demonstratedin a sixteen-week trial that ALA in oral doses of 600 mg daily for eight weekssignificantly improved levels of LDL-cholesterol in healthy human subjects. ALAappears to slow aging of the brain through its potent antioxidant properties.Because of lack of long-term safety data, alpha-lipoic acid should be avoided bypregnant women and nursing mothers. Those with diabetes and problems withglucose intolerance are cautioned that ALA may lower blood glucose levels. Bloodglucose should be monitored and antidiabetic drug doses adjusted, if necessary,to avoid possible low blood sugar states. In doses up to 600 mg a day no sideeffects have been noted.You should consider taking ALA if you are over forty and are at risk fordementia or other memory problems, cancer, or stroke. The typical dose is 100 to200 mg a day.COENZYME Q10 (COQ10)Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), also known as ubiquinone, is a powerful antioxidantdiscovered by researchers at the University of Wisconsin in 1957. The name ofthis supplement comes from the word ubiquitous, which means “found everywhere.”Indeed, CoQ10 is found in every cell in the body. CoQ10 is an enzyme that livesinside the mitochondria of your cells and helps convert oxygen into usableenergy. Organs that use a lot of oxygen are the heart, muscles, kidneys,pancreas, and brain. If the mitochondria of these oxygen-demanding organs do notproperly convert oxygen into energy, they can be damaged. Japanese scientistsfirst discovered the therapeutic properties of CoQ10 in the 1960s. Today it iswidely prescribed in Europe, Israel, and Japan for heart conditions. CoQ10appears to assist the heart during times of stress on the heart muscle, perhapsby helping it use energy more efficiently.Certain cholesterol-lowering drugs, known as statins, significantly lower levelsof CoQ10. This may be particularly hazardous for patients with heart disease,suggesting a possible indication for CoQ10 in many, if not all, individualsusing these cholesterol-lowering drugs. There is also some evidence that CoQ10might boost energy and speed recovery of exercise-related muscle exhaustion anddamage.Recently, it was discovered that mutations in a gene on chromosome 4 produceParkinson’s disease (PD), a movement disorder that affects about one percent ofall people over fifty years old. This gene helps regulate the activity of CoQ10in the mitochondria. In people with PD, CoQ10 activity is reduced in the basalganglia, therefore causing problems with movement. Furthermore, reduced CoQ10blood levels are found in people with Lewy Body dementia, a more widespread formof PD. A recent multicenter trial of eighty people with early-stage untreated PDexamined the effect of a placebo versus 300, 600, or 1,200 mg of CoQ10 per dayfor eighteen months. CoQ10 delayed the progression of PD symptoms by 44 percent,and 1,200 mg per day slowed the decline in movement better than lower doses.CoQ10 may be a safe and effective way to delay the severely debilitatingmovement disorder PD. People with PD or Lewy Body disease, or a positive familyhistory of these disorders, should consider taking CoQ10. If symptoms arealready present, then 1,200 mg per day is an effective dose. In people withoutsymptoms, lower doses are probably effective, but the exact dose is notestablished.There has been one report of CoQ10 decreasing the effectiveness of themedication warfarin. Those taking it should be aware of this possibility.Because of lack of long-term safety studies, pregnant women and nursing mothersshould avoid CoQ10 supplements. Clinical reports suggest that CoQ10 may lowerblood sugar levels in diabetics, so they should be made aware of thispossibility and monitored as needed. Mild intestinal symptoms such as nausea anddiarrhea have been reported, particularly with higher doses (200 mg or moredaily).CoQ10 is available in different formulations: oil-based capsules, powder-filledcapsules, and tablets and solubilized softgels (microemulsions and others). Thesolubilized softgels are claimed to give higher absorption. CoQ10 is best takenwith food. The typical dosage is 30 to 200 mg per day.OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDSFish oils, also known as marine oils, are fats found in fish, particularlycold-water fish, and other marine life such as phytoplankton and krill. Theseoils are rich sources of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, also calledomega-3 fatty acids. The two most studied fish oils are eicosapentaenoic acid(EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). DHA is a vital component of cellmembranes, especially those in the brain and retina. Supplemental fish oils havebeen shown to have many positive effects on the body. They lower triglyceridelevels and have anti-inflammatory, antiarrhythmic, immune-enhancing, andnerve-cell-stabilizing properties. In addition, they help to maintain normalblood flow as they lower the body’s ability to form clots. DHA is vital fornormal brain development for the fetus and infant and for the maintenance ofnormal brain function throughout life. DHA appears to be a major factor in thefluidity and flexibility of brain cell membranes. It could play a major role inmaintaining how we think and feel. Fish oils appear to have mood-stabilizingproperties when used in the treatment of bipolar disorder. On SPECT scansbipolar disorder shows overall increased activity in the brain, and EPA and DHAtend to calm or dampen these overactive brain signals.A four-month double-blind, placebo-controlled study of thirty subjects withbipolar disorder compared the effects of fish oil supplements with a placebo.Fourteen subjects received 9.6 g daily of fish oil, consisting of 6.2 g of EPAand 3.4 grams of DHA, and sixteen subjects received olive oil as a placebo. Thisstudy showed improvement in the short-term course of the disorder with fish oilsupplementation. Among those taking fish oil, longer periods of remission wereobserved in nearly every outcome category, and the results were statisticallysignificant. Mild gastrointestinal side effects were reported in the fish oilgroup.In a landmark study published in the journal Lancet, researchers examined theeffect of dietary fish oil and vitamin E supplementation on death and disease inmore than eleven thousand subjects who had suffered a heart attack within threemonths of entering the trial. The trial lasted for forty-two months. The mostsignificant result was the reduction in risk for overall and sudden cardiacdeath, which it is believed was due to the antiarrythmic effect of the fish oil.The study suggests that up to twenty lives per thousand post–heart attackpatients could be saved by consuming daily doses of less than 1 g of EPA andDHA.An analysis of seventeen studies with fish oil indicates that supplementationwith 3 or more g of fish oil daily can lead to clinically relevant bloodpressure reductions in individuals with untreated hypertension, although it didnot lower blood pressure in those who were normal. An analysis of another groupof studies on the effect of fish oil following coronary angioplasty indicatesthat subjects who had undergone successful angioplasty had a significantly lowerrate (13.9 percent) of recurrent problems when given 4 to 5 g daily of mixturesof EPA and DHA for three months to one year following the angioplasty. What’sgood for your heart is also good for your brain.Fish oil supplements have many other physical benefits. Daily use of fish oil ofat least 3 g of EPA and DHA mixtures for a period of twelve weeks or longer hasbeen found to reduce the number of tender joints and the amount of morningstiffness in people with rheumatoid arthritis, to the extent that they werereported to have lowered or discontinued use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatorydrugs or other antirheumatic drugs. The supplements appeared to be welltolerated in these individuals, and no serious side effects were reported.Because of the possible anticlotting effect of fish oil supplements,hemophiliacs and those taking warfarin (Coumadin) should exercise caution intheir use. Fish oil supplements should be stopped before any surgical procedure.Diabetics who take fish oil supplements should be monitored by their physicians.There have been no reports of serious adverse events in those taking fish oilsupplements, even up to 15 g daily for prolonged periods of time. The sideeffects that have been reported include mild gastrointestinal upsets such asnausea and diarrhea, halitosis, burping and “fishy”-smelling breath, skin, andeven urine. The blood-thinning effects can cause occasional nosebleeds and easybruising.I have several favorite sources of fish oil supplementation. One is a supplementcalled Coromega, made by European Reference Botanical Laboratories; seewww.coromega.com [http://www.coromega.com] for information. Coromega is ahigh-quality supplement that gives the right ratio of EPA to DHA, and it tastesgreat. Often fish oil supplements leave a fishy taste, but Coromega tastes likeorange pudding, and we can even get children to take it without a fuss. Also,Dr. René Thomas has made a spearmint-flavored fish oil, as well as a healthy icecream called Nature’s Might Bites (www.kidsneedusnow.org[http://www.kidsneedusnow.org]) that contains high doses of omega-3 fatty acids.The wonderful thing is that the ice cream also contains high levels ofhigh-quality protein and is not filled with empty calories. Life is good whenyou can get your fish oil supplement in orange pudding or ice cream. Inaddition, Dr. Sears (www.drsears.com [http://www.drsears.com]) makes ahigh-quality fish oil product, as do Nordic Naturals and Omega Brite.The typical dosage of fish oil is 1 to 2 g a day for prevention and 4 to 6 g aday to treat illness. High-quality fish oil can be taken by pregnant women andhas been shown to help their moods when prone to bipolar disorder. But make sureit is high quality and does not contain any contaminants.GINKGO BILOBAThe prettiest brains I have seen are those on ginkgo. Ginkgo biloba, from theChinese ginkgo tree, is a powerful antioxidant that is best known for itsability to enhance circulation, memory, and concentration. The best-studied formof ginkgo biloba is a special extract called EBg 761, which has been studied inblood vessel disease, clotting disorders, depression, and Alzheimer’s disease. Acomparison in 2000 of all the published placebo-controlled studies longer thansix months for ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 versus Cognex, Aricept, and Exelonshowed they all had similar benefits for mild to moderate AD patients.The most widely publicized U.S. study of ginkgo biloba was done by Dr. P. L. LeBars and colleagues from the New York Institute for Medical Research, whichappeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1997. EGb 761 wasused to assess the efficacy and safety in treating Alzheimer’s disease andvascular dementia. It was a fifty-two-week multicenter study with patients whohad mild to severe symptoms. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment withEGb 761 (120 mg/d) or a placebo. Progress was monitored at 12, 26, and 52 weeks,and 202 patients finished the study. At the end of the study the authorsconcluded that EGb was safe and that it appeared capable of stabilizing and, ina substantial number of cases, improving the cognitive performance and socialfunctioning of demented patients for six months to one year. Although modest,the changes induced by EGb were objectively measured and were of sufficientmagnitude to be recognized by the caregivers.Consider taking ginkgo if you are at risk for memory problems or stroke orsuffer from low energy or decreased concentration. There are many differentforms of ginkgo, making dosing confusing. In the U.S., Ginkoba and Ginkgold(Nature’s Way) are brands that have been compounded to reflect EGb 761. Theusual effective dose is 60 to 120 mg twice a day. There is a small risk ofbleeding in the body, and the dosages of other blood-thinning agents being takenmay sometimes have to be reduced.PHOSPHATIDYLSERINEPhosphatidylserine (PS) is a naturally occurring nutrient that is found in foodssuch as fish, green leafy vegetables, soy products, and rice. It is a componentof cell membranes. There are reports of the potential of PS to help improveage-related declines in memory, learning, verbal skills, and concentration. PETstudies of patients who have taken PS show that it produces a general increasein metabolic activity in the brain. In the largest multicenter study to date ofphosphatidylserine and Alzheimer’s disease, 142 subjects aged forty to eightywere given 200 mg of phosphatidylserine per day or a placebo over a three-monthperiod. Those treated with phosphatidylserine exhibited improvement on severalitems on the scales normally used to assess Alzheimer’s status. The differencesbetween the placebo and experimental groups were small but statisticallysignificant. Effective doses of PS have been reported to be 300 mg per day. Thetypes of symptoms that have improved in placebo-controlled studies of cognitiveimpairment or dementia include loss of interest, reduced activities, socialisolation, anxiety, memory, concentration, and recall. Milder stages ofimpairment tend to respond to PS better than more severe stages. With regard todepression in elderly individuals, Dr. M. Maggioni and his colleagues studiedthe effects of oral PS (300 mg per day) versus a placebo and noted significantimprovements in mood, memory, and motivation after thirty days of PS treatment.The typical dose of PS is 100 to 300 mg a day.L-THEANINEL-theanine is an amino acid mainly found naturally in the green tea plant.L-theanine is the predominant amino acid in green tea and makes up 50 percent ofthe total free amino acids in the plant. L-theanine is considered the maincomponent responsible for the taste of green tea. It is marketed in Japan as anutritional supplement for mood modulation. L-theanine may also have activity inmodulating the metabolism of cancer chemotherapeutic agents and amelioratingtheir side effects.L-theanine has been shown to penetrate the brain and produce significantincreases in concentrations of the neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine.These findings led to recent studies investigating the possibility thatL-theanine might enhance learning ability, induce relaxation, and relieveemotional stress. Memory and learning ability were said to be improved in youngmale Wistar rats given 180 mg of L-theanine daily for four months. Humanperformance was assessed using a test for learning ability and passive andactive avoidance tests for memory. The mental effects of L-theanine were testedin a small group of volunteers divided into two groups, defined as“high-anxiety” and “low-anxiety” groups. The volunteers were females agedeighteen to twenty-two. Their level of anxiety was assessed by a manifestanxiety scale. Subjects received water, 50 mg of L-theanine, or 200 mg ofL-theanine solution once a week. Brain waves were measured 60 minutes afteradministration. The 200 mg dose (dissolved in 100 ml of water) resulted insignificantly greater production of alpha waves than was observed in subjectsreceiving water. The effect was dose-dependent. The researchers regarded thesignificantly increased production of alpha-brain-wave activity as an index ofincreased relaxation.Pregnant women and nursing mothers should avoid L-theanine supplements. Use ofL-theanine supplements concomitantly with cancer chemo-therapeutic agents mustbe done under medical supervision. There are no known adverse reactions.L-theanine supplements are available for the promotion of relaxation and themodulation of mood. Doses used are between 50 and 200 mg, as necessary.L-theanine is available in some green tea preparations. The amino acidconstitutes between 1 and 2 percent of the dry weight of green tea leaves.VINPOCETINEVinpocetine is not for everyone, but it does seem to help people at risk forheart disease or stroke. It also helps lower high homocysteine levels, which aredangerous to your heart and brain. Vinpocetine is derived from an extract of thecommon periwinkle plant (Vinca minor) and is used in Europe, Japan, and Mexicoas a pharmaceutical agent for the treatment of blood vessel disease in the brainand cognitive disorders. In the United States, it is available as a dietarysupplement. It is sometimes called a nootropic (meaning “cognition enhancer,”from the Greek noos, “mind”). Vinpocetine selectively widens arteries andcapillaries, increasing blood flow to the brain. It also combats theaccumulation of platelets in the blood, improving circulation. Because of theseproperties, vinpocetine was first used in the treatment of cerebrovasculardisorders and acute memory loss due to late-life dementia. But it also has abeneficial effect on memory problems associated with normal aging.Vinpocetine may be useful for a wide variety of brain problems. A 1976 studyfound that vinpocetine immediately increased circulation in fifty people withabnormal blood flow. After one month of taking moderate doses of vinpocetine,patients showed improvement on memorization tests. After a prolonged period ofvinpocetine treatment, cognitive impairment diminished significantly ordisappeared altogether in many of the patients. A 1987 study of elderly patientswith chronic cerebral dysfunction found that patients who took vinpocetineperformed better on psychological evaluations after the ninety-day trial periodthan did those who received a placebo. More recent studies have shown thatvinpocetine reduces neural damage and protects against oxidative damage fromharmful beta-amyloid buildup. In a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlledstudy lasting sixteen weeks, 203 patients described as having mild-to-moderatememory problems, including primary dementia, were treated with varying doses ofvinpocetine or a placebo. Significant improvement was achieved in thevinpocetine-treated group as measured by “global improvement” and cognitiveperformance scales. Three 10 mg doses daily were as effective as or moreeffective than three 20 mg doses daily. Similarly good results were found inanother double-blind clinical trial testing vinpocetine versus a placebo inelderly patients with blood vessel and central nervous system degenerativedisorders. Some preliminary research suggests that vinpocetine may also haveprotective effects on both sight and hearing.Reported adverse reactions include nausea, dizziness, insomnia, drowsiness, drymouth, transient hypotension, transient fast heart rate, pressure headaches, andfacial flushing. Slight reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressurewith prolonged use of vinpocetine have been reported, as well as slightreductions in blood sugar levels.The usual dosage is 10 mg a day.MULTIPLE VITAMINSDue to our poor diets, I recommend that all of my patients take a high-quality100 percent multiple vitamin every day. Over the last twenty years, ourunderstanding of the benefits of vitamins has rapidly advanced, and it nowappears that people who get enough vitamins may be able to help prevent suchcommon chronic illnesses as cancer, heart disease, dementia, and osteoporosis,according to Drs. Robert Fletcher and Kathleen Fairfield of Harvard University,who wrote the guidelines for vitamins published in the Journal of the AmericanMedical Association (JAMA) in 2002. The last time JAMA made a comprehensivereview of vitamins, about twenty years before, it concluded that people ofnormal health shouldn’t take multi-vitamins because they were a waste of timeand money. People can get all the nutrients they need from their diet, JAMAadvised, adding that only pregnant women and chronically sick people might needcertain vitamins. That was at a time when knowledge about vitamins was justbeginning to expand. The role that low levels of folate, or folic acid, play inneural tube defects, for instance, was unknown, as was its role as a major riskfactor for heart disease. Almost 80 percent of Americans do not eat at leastfive helpings of fruits and vegetables a day, the recommended minimum amountbelieved to provide sufficient essential nutrients. Humans do not make their ownvitamins, except for some vitamin D, so they must get them from an outsidesource to prevent problems.B VITAMINSB vitamins play an integral role in the functioning of the nervous system, andthey help the brain synthesize neurotransmitters that affect mood and thinking.A balanced complex of the B vitamins is essential for energy and for balancinghormone levels. Folate and B12 deficiencies are well-known causes of cognitiveimpairment or dementia as well as coronary heart disease. They can also elevatehomocysteine levels, which increase risks for stroke, heart disease, andAlzheimer’s disease. Patients deficient in folate can show significantimprovements in memory and attention when treated with folic acid for as few assixty days. In addition to having a direct effect, B vitamins indirectly impactmental function by altering the levels of harmful or beneficial substances inthe body. For instance, elevated homocysteine (an amino acid) levels have beenlinked to heart disease and poorer cognitive function. A combination therapywith B vitamins—folate and vitamins B12 and B6—is an effective means to reduceelevated homocysteine levels. To maintain low plasma homocysteine concentration,people should be advised to increase their consumption of eggs, green leafyvegetables, and fruits, which are all rich in B vitamins.Another study showed that less-than-optimal levels of vitamin B6, B12, and folicacid lead to a deficiency of S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe). SAMe deficiency cancause depression, dementia, or a degeneration of the nerves. The typicalAmerican diet does not always provide these essential vitamins, at least in highdoses. Because B vitamins are water soluble and are excreted from the bodydaily, they must be replenished on a regular basis. Older people are at greaterrisk for vitamin deficiency because they tend to eat less of a variety of foods,and their requirements for certain vitamins such as B6 are actually higher.Older people may also have problems with efficient nutrient absorption fromfood. Even healthy older people often exhibit deficiencies in vitamin B6,vitamin B12, and folate.B6 supplementation has been found to be helpful for memory function. Dr. J. B.Deijen and colleagues from Holland found in a study of seventy-six elderly malesthat giving vitamin B6 versus a placebo improved memory function.Take 100 percent of the B vitamins every day. Make sure you take at least 400mcg of folate and 500 mcg of B12 a day.VITAMIN CUnlike most mammals, humans do not have the ability to make their own vitamin C(ascorbic acid). Therefore we must obtain it through our diet orsupplementation. Vitamin C is required for the synthesis of collagen, animportant structural component of blood vessels, tendons, ligaments, and bone.Vitamin C also plays an important role in the synthesis of the neurotransmitternorepinephrine. Neurotransmitters are critical to brain function and are knownto affect mood. In addition, vitamin C is required for the synthesis ofcarnitine, a small molecule that is essential for the transport of fat tocellular organelles called mitochondria, for conversion to energy. Vitamin C isalso a highly effective antioxidant. Even in small amounts, vitamin C canprotect proteins, fats, carbohydrates, and DNA from damage by free radicals.Vitamin C also helps to recycle other antioxidants, such as vitamin E.Low or deficient intake of vitamin C is associated with an increased risk ofcardiovascular diseases, and modest dietary intakes of about 100 mg per day insome studies were sufficient for reduction of cardiovascular disease risk amongnonsmoking men and women. With respect to vitamin C and strokes, a prospectivestudy that followed more than two thousand residents of a rural Japanesecommunity for twenty years found that the risk of stroke in those with thehighest serum levels of vitamin C was 29 percent lower than in those with thelowest serum levels of vitamin C. Additionally, the risk of stroke in those whoconsumed vegetables six to seven days a week was 54 percent lower than in thosewho consumed vegetables zero to two days a week. In this population, serumlevels of vitamin C were highly correlated with fruit and vegetable intakes. Anumber of studies have also investigated the role of vitamin C in cancerprevention. Most have shown that higher intakes of vitamin C are associated withdecreased incidence of cancers of the mouth, throat and vocal cords, esophagus,stomach, colon-rectum, and lung. A ten-year Rotterdam study of 5,395 individualsfifty-five years and older showed that high dietary intake of vitamins C and E(fruits and vegetables) reduces the risk of Alzheimer’s disease by about 20percent.As shown in the following table, different fruits and vegetables vary in theirvitamin C content, but five servings should average out to at least 200 mg ofvitamin C.FoodServingVitamin C (mg) Orange juice3⁄4 cup (6 ounces)75 Grapefruit juice3⁄4cup (6 ounces)60 Orange1 medium70 Grapefruit1⁄2 medium44 Strawberries1 cup,whole82 Tomato1 medium23 Sweet red pepper1⁄2 cup, raw chopped141 Broccoli1⁄2cup, cooked58 Potato1 medium, baked26Side effects are rare but can occasionally include urinary tract infections dueto acidification. Vitamin C is available in many forms, but there is littlescientific evidence that any one form is better absorbed or more effective thananother. I recommend a vitamin C intake of 250 mg twice a day for adults.Consuming at least five servings of fruits and vegetables daily may provideabout 200 mg of vitamin C. Most multivitamin supplements provide 60 mg ofvitamin C.VITAMIN EVitamin E is an oil-soluble vitamin that is found in oils, nuts, and seeds. Itis considered to be an antioxidant vitamin. Large doses will act as ananticoagulant or blood thinner. The Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) forvitamin E is about 20 I.U. per day. There are different forms of vitamin E,including gamma-tocopherol and the better-known alpha-tocopherol. The RDA wasset for alpha-tocopherol. Artificial dl-alpha-tocopherol is considered to beonly half as active as natural vitamin E. The gamma-tocopherol form of vitamin Emay have even more potent physiological benefits.Vitamin E has seen controversy in recent years. It has been reported to be apossible protective factor in dementia. In very high doses of 1,000 I.U. twice aday in people who already have symptoms of AD, it has been shown to delay AD’sprogression by one year. With regard to prevention in normal aging individuals,a recent three-year longitudinal study of 2,889 community residents 65 to 102years old examined the influence of dietary and supplemental intake of vitaminsC, E, and beta-carotene on the course of a variety of mental skills. Theresearchers tested working memory, short-term memory, overall mental ability,and complex task performance. They found that vitamin E, in doses of 400 I.U.per day or higher, resulted in a 36 percent reduction in the rate of cognitivedecline, compared to subjects taking the lowest amount of vitamin E. Vitamin Cand beta-carotene taken separately showed no effect. This is the first clinicaltrial evidence that vitamin E delays the onset of decline in mental skills innormal aging individuals. After an average follow-up of six years, 197participants developed dementia, of which 146 had Alzheimer’s. When adjustmentswere made for age, sex, alcohol intake, education, smoking habits, presence ofcarotid plaques, and use of antioxidative supplements, high intake of vitamin Cand vitamin E was associated with a 20 percent lower risk of AD. Among currentsmokers, this relationship was most pronounced. The associations did not vary byeducation or by apolipoprotein E genotype.A recent study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine stated that highdoses of vitamin E are dangerous and should be avoided. This study considereddoses of vitamin E in excess of 400 I.U. per day to be high and those less than400 I.U. per day to be low. A recent study by Dr. E. Miller is an analysis ofdeath rates in study populations gleaned from nineteen different researchprojects that included vitamin E use. The studies included vitamin E as apotential treatment for, or means of prevention of, various diseases, such asheart disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and cataracts. In order for the researchpopulations to be included in this study, each project had to have patients takevitamin E for at least one year, and each study had to have at least ten deathsduring or after the time of the study.The results, according to Dr. Miller, show that lower doses of vitamin E may beslightly protective for death, but that higher doses may slightly increase apatient’s risk of death. He concluded that vitamin E used in high doses isdangerous. But there were a number of potential problems with the study. Itanalyzed several studies involving the use of vitamin E for various diseases,but it did not include some studies that have shown a correlation betweenvitamin E use and a reduced risk of coronary disease. Other potential problemsthat could confound the results of this study include the following:• Vitamin E was often used in combination with pharmaceutical drugs beingstudied; the effects of these combinations were not discussed in the research.• The populations being studied mostly consisted of elderly people with chronicdiseases. The study recognizes this as a possible confounder, because elderly,sick people are more likely to be taking high doses of vitamin E. It would notbe possible to generalize the findings to a young and healthy population.• The study looked at different types of research studies that used differentprotocols and procedures, such as different doses of vitamin E taken fordifferent lengths of time.• The original studies didn’t necessarily differentiate between natural andsynthetic vitamin E.• Some of the results of the original studies have been questioned.Given the myriad positive studies with vitamin E, I still recommend it. Untilfurther studies are performed, I recommend taking lower doses, in theneighborhood of 200 I.U. a day.The kind of vitamin E you take matters. Mixed tocopherols, including alpha andgamma, seem to be more effective than alpha-tocopherol alone. Alpha-tocopherolis the most common form sold in stores. Because of the relatively short durationof action of the tocopherols (two to four hours), taking them twice a day givesbetter cellular protection to your brain and body.Major sources of vitamin E in the American diet include vegetable oils (olive,sunflower, and safflower), nuts, whole grains, and green leafy vegetables.

It is known that antioxidantmechanisms decline with aging, so supplementation may be protective.Furthermore, taking vitamin C, such as 250 to 500 mg, with each dose of vitaminE improves the absorption of E into the brain. Although not yet tested inclinical trials, this probably improves the effect of vitamin E on delayingdecline in mental skills.Vitamin E side effects are rare. But vitamin E may affect anticoagulation levelsfor people on Coumadin and may affect cholesterol levels. People who take bothvitamin E and Coumadin should have regular laboratory studies to check for anybleeding problems. People who take vitamin E and also have high cholesterolshould have their fasting lipid panel monitored about every three to six monthsto determine the effect of vitamin E on cholesterol.image [images/Amen_9780307338136_epub_020_r1.jpg]image [images/Amen_9780307338136_epub_021_r1.jpg]image [images/Amen_9780307338136_epub_022_r1.jpg]STRESSDuring times of stress other supplements or herbs might also be useful. Here aresome I commonly recommend.GABAGamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an amino acid that also functions as aneurotransmitter in the brain. GABA is reported in the herbal literature to workin much the same way as the antianxiety drugs and the anticonvulsants. It helpsstabilize nerve cells by decreasing their tendency to fire erratically orexcessively. This means it has a calming effect for people who struggle withtemper, irritability, and anxiety, whether these symptoms relate to anxiety orto temporal lobe disturbance. GABA can be taken as a supplement in doses rangingfrom 250 to 1,500 mg daily for adults and from 125 to 750 mg daily for children.For best effect, GABA should be taken in two or three divided doses.S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE (SAME)SAMe is involved with the production of several neurotransmitters. The brainnormally manufactures all the SAMe it needs from the amino acid methionine. Whena person is depressed, the synthesis of SAMe from methio-nine is impaired. SAMeis one of the best natural antidepressants, and in a number of recent studies,it has performed as well as conventional antidepressant medications. SAMe hasbeen found to increase the neurotransmitters that are low when people havedepression. I frequently recommend SAMe to people who suffer from fibromyalgia,a chronic muscle pain disorder. Fibromyalgia is very commonly complicated byanxiety and depression. People who have bipolar disorder or manic-depressiveillness should not take SAMe. There have been a number of reported cases of SAMecausing manic or hypomanic episodes (excessively up or happy moods, extremeimpulsivity in sexuality or spending money, pressured speech, and decreased needfor sleep). SAMe should be taken in doses of 200 to 400 mg two to four times aday, and children should take half this amount. One of the problems with SAMe isits cost. Because many insurance companies do not cover herbal or supplementaltreatments, SAMe is more expensive than prescription medication for some people.As it becomes a more popular intervention, the cost of SAMe may decrease.ST. JOHN’S WORTI have seen dramatic improvement for many of my patients on St. John’s wort, andI have SPECT scan studies of patients before and after treatment with St. John’swort that document its effectiveness. This flowering herb is named after SaintJohn the Baptist because it blooms around June 24, his feast day, and becausethe red ring around the crushed flowers is a reminder of the blood of thebeheaded saint. St. John’s wort may be the most potent of all the supplements atincreasing serotonin availability in the brain. The starting dosage is 300 mg aday for children, 300 mg twice a day for teens, and 600 mg in the morning and300 mg at night for adults. Sometimes the dose may be slowly increased to 1,800mg for adults. It is extremely important that the preparation of St. John’s wortcontain 0.3 percent hypericin, which is believed to be the active ingredient.St. John’s wort decreases anterior cingulate gyrus hyperactivity for manypatients and decreases moodiness. An unfortunate side effect is that it can alsodecrease prefrontal cortex activity. One of the women in the study said, “I’mhappier, but I’m dingier.” St. John’s wort may make people more vulnerable tosunburn, and so extra sun protection is needed by anyone using this compound. Wealso don’t start people with temporal lobe symptoms (anger, epilepsy, memoryproblems, hallucinations, and so on) on St. John’s wort without firststabilizing the temporal lobes with anticonvulsant medication. An important noteis that St. John’s wort has been found to decrease the effectiveness of otherdrugs, including birth control pills.5-HTPL-tryptophan and 5-HTP are amino acid building blocks for serotonin, and usingthese supplements is another way to increase cerebral serotonin. L-tryptophan isa naturally occurring amino acid found in milk, meat, and eggs. It is veryhelpful for some patients in improving sleep, decreasing aggressiveness, andstabilizing mood. High doses of L-tryptophan in turkey are often cited as thereason we get sleepy after the Thanksgiving meal. L-tryptophan was taken off themarket a number of years ago because one contaminated batch, from onemanufacturer, caused a rare blood disease and a number of deaths. L-tryptophanitself actually had nothing to do with these deaths. L-tryptophan was recentlyreapproved by the Food and Drug Administration and is now available byprescription. One of the problems with dietary L-tryptophan is that asignificant portion of it does not enter the brain but is used to make proteinsand vitamin B3. This necessitates taking large amounts of tryptophan.Recommended dosage is 1,000 to 3,000 mg taken at bedtime.5-HTP is a step closer in the serotonin-production pathway. It is also morewidely available than L-tryptophan and is more easily taken up in the brain.Seventy percent is taken up into the brain, as opposed to only three percent ofL-tryptophan, and 5-HTP is about five to ten times more powerful thanL-tryptophan. A number of double-blind studies have shown 5-HTP to be aneffective antidepressant medication that is relatively free of the side effectscaused by conventional medications. Decreased serotonin levels in the brain havebeen correlated with depression, aggressive feelings, and violence. 5-HTP boostsserotonin levels in the brain and helps to calm anterior cingulate gyrushyperactivity. This is analogous to greasing (increasing serotonin to) thebrain’s gear shifter (the anterior cingulate gyrus) so that attention, focus,and concentration can be locked into place and yet also smoothly and efficientlyshift onto the next item when necessary. Adults should take 5-HTP in doses of 50to 100 mg two or three times daily with or without food, and children shouldtake half the adult dose. Many alternative medicine doctors believe patients whoare taking 5-HTP should also take 50 mg of vitamin B6 once daily because thisvitamin is essential for converting amino acids into serotonin. The most commonside effect of 5-HTP is an upset stomach, although this is usually a mildcomplaint. Upset stomach can be improved by starting 5-HTP slowly and increasingthe dose as you get used to the supplement and by taking it with food. Because5-HTP increases serotonin, you should not take other medications that alsoincrease serotonin, such as St. John’s wort, L-tryptophan, or a prescribedantidepressant, unless you are closely supervised by your physician.INOSITOLInositol is a natural biochemical found normally in the human brain. Somescientists think it is a member of the B vitamin family. It is reported to helpneurons more efficiently use the neurotransmitter serotonin. In a well-designedstudy of thirteen patients who suffered from obsessive-compulsive disorder, 18 gof inositol compared to a placebo significantly reduced symptoms. Spinal fluidinositol has been reported to be low in depression. Another well-designed studyof 12 g of inositol in twenty-eight depressed patients showed impressiveimprovement when compared to sugar pills. Since many antidepressants areeffective in patients with panic disorder, twenty-one patients with this severeanxiety disorder were given 12 g of inositol per day for four weeks. Compared toa placebo, inositol was more effective, with minimal side effects. Studies oninositol were not effective for all conditions. For example, it did not helpschizophrenia, ADD, or Alzheimer’s disease. By its actions and the conditions ithelps, inositol seems to act like mild Prozac but with fewer of the sideeffects. Think of trying it if you are a worrier, have trouble letting go ofnegative thoughts, tend to be rigid or inflexible, or hold grudges. The dose isup to 18 g a day.VALERIANMany patients find valerian to be remarkably helpful as a sleeping aid. Valerianis a well-recognized herb with antianxiety properties that is used as a mildtranquilizer, sedative, and muscle relaxant. About 150 species of valerian arewidely distributed in temperate regions of the world. The active ingredientoccurs in a foul-smelling oil produced in the root of the plant. The Romanphysician Galen wrote about the virtues of valerian; it has been associated withthe term All Heal in medical literature of the Middle Ages; and it is also usedin Chinese and Indian medicine. It was used in the United States prior to thedevelopment of modern pharmaceuticals. This centuries-old treatment for insomniahas also been helpful for symptoms of nervousness, stress, increased emotionalreactivity, pain, and agitation; it can help decrease seizure frequency forepileptic patients. Valerian appears to work by enhancing the activity of thecalming neurotransmitter GABA. Studies have shown valerian to be helpful formany types of anxiety disorders and for people with performance anxiety andthose who get stressed in daily situations like traffic. Valerian is availablein capsules, tablets, liquids, tinctures, extracts, and teas. Most extracts arestandardized to 0.8 percent valeric acids. Unlike prescription tranquilizers,valerian has a much lower potential for addiction and has been used to helppeople who are trying to decrease their use of prescription tranquilizers orsleeping pills. (Anyone using prescription sleeping pills or tranquilizersshould decrease or stop their use only under the supervision of a physician.)Sometimes valerian can cause nervousness or drowsiness, so make sure you knowhow your body reacts to it before you drive or do other activities that requiresustained attention. Do not take valerian with alcohol, barbiturates, orbenzodiazepines. Valerian is not recommended for use during pregnancy orbreastfeeding. The recommended dose of valerian is 150 to 450 mg in capsules orteas."},{"pageContent":"21GETTING MORE HELPKNOWING WHEN AND HOW TO DO ITEven after doing all of the brain-healthy strategies in this book, some peoplewill still need to seek professional help. Some will need psychotherapy; somewill need medication; others will need more directed guidance with supplementsor other alternative treatments. This chapter will help you decide if and whenyou need to seek professional help. In lecturing around the world, I amfrequently asked: when is it time to see a professional about my brain? Whatshould I do when a loved one is in denial about needing help? How do I go aboutfinding a competent professional? In this chapter I will answer these questionsas well as give a brief overview of several brain problems that interfere withdaily living.WHEN IS IT TIME TO SEE A PROFESSIONAL ABOUT MY BRAIN?This question is relatively easy to answer. People should seek professional helpfor themselves or a family member when their behaviors, feelings, thoughts, ormemories (all brain functions) interfere with their ability to reach theirpotential in their relationships, at work, or at school. If you are experiencingpersistent relationship struggles (parent-child, sibling, friends, romantic),it’s time to get help. If you have ongoing school or work problems related toyour memory, moods, actions, or thoughts, it is time to get professional help.If your impulsive behavior, poor choices, or anxiety are causing consistentmonetary problems, it’s time to get help. Many people think they cannot affordto get professional help. I think it is usually much more costly to live withbrain problems than it is to get appropriate help.Pride and denial can get in the way of seeking proper help. People want to bestrong and rely on themselves, but I am constantly reminded of the strength ittakes to make the decision to get help. Also, getting help should be looked atas a way to get your brain operating at its full capacity.Marian, whom I discussed in the Introduction, came to see me for mood swings.Even though she was very competent, her behavior at work often caused problemswith her co-workers. When her boss suggested she see me, she resisted. There wasnothing wrong with her, she thought—it was everyone else. One day afterexploding at a co-worker, she realized it was, at least partly, her fault andagreed to come for help. She resisted because she did not want to be seen asweak or defective. The brain SPECT scan helped her to see that her brain neededto be balanced. With the appropriate help, she got better and didn’t have tosuffer from mood swings. She and her co-workers all suffered less stress as aresult of her better-balanced brain.WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN A LOVED ONE IS IN DENIAL ABOUT NEEDING HELP?Unfortunately, the stigma associated with “psychiatric illness” prevents manypeople from getting help. People do not want to be seen as crazy, stupid, ordefective, and they do not seek help until they (or their loved one) can nolonger tolerate the pain (at work, in their relationships, or withinthemselves). Most people do not see psychiatric problems as brain problems butrather as weak character problems. Men are especially affected by denial.Many men, when faced with obvious troubles in their marriages, with theirchildren, or even in themselves, are often unable to really see problems. Theirlack of awareness and strong tendency toward denial prevent them from seekinghelp until more damage than necessary has been done. Many men have to bethreatened with divorce before they seek help. Some people may say it is unfairto pick on men, and indeed some men see problems long before some women.Overall, however, mothers see problems in children before fathers and are morewilling to seek help, and many more wives call for marital counseling than dohusbands. What is it in our society that causes men to overlook obviousproblems, or to deny problems until it is too late to deal with them effectivelyor until more damage is done than necessary? Some of the answers may be found inhow we raise boys, in the societal expectations we place on men, in theoverwhelming pace of many men’s daily lives, and in the brain.Boys most often engage in active play (sports, war games, video games, and thelike) that involve little dialogue or discussion. The games often involvedominance and submissiveness, emphasize winning and losing, and require littleinterpersonal communication. Force, strength, or skill handles problems. Girls,on the other hand, often engage in more interpersonal or communicative types ofplay, such as dolls and storytelling. Fathers often take their sons out to throwa ball around or shoot hoops rather than to go for a walk and talk.Many men retain childhood notions of competition and the idea that one must bebetter than others to be any good at all. To admit to a problem is to be lessthan other men. As a result, many men wait to seek help until their problem hasbecome obvious to the whole world. Other men feel responsible for all thathappens in their families, so admitting to a problem is the same as admittingthat they have in some way failed.Clearly, the pace of life prevents many people, particularly men, from takingthe time to look clearly at the important people in their lives and theirrelationships with them. When counselors spend time with fathers and husbandsand help them slow down enough to see what is really important to them, moreoften than not they begin to see the problems and work toward more helpfulsolutions. The issue is generally not one of being uncaring or uninterested butof failing to see what is there. Men are wired differently from women. Men tendto be more left-brained, which gives them better access to logical,detail-oriented thought patterns. Women tend to have greater access to bothsides of their brains, with the right side being involved in understanding thegestalt or big picture of a situation. The right side of the brain also seems tobe involved in being able to admit to a problem. Many men just don’t seeproblems associated with anxiety or depression, even though the symptoms may bevery clear to others.Here are several suggestions to help someone who is unaware of a problem orunwilling to get the help they need. Try the straightforward approach first (butwith a new brain twist). Clearly tell the person what behaviors concern you, andexplain to them that the problems may be due to underlying brain patterns thatcan be easily tuned up. Tell them help may be available—help not to cure adefect but rather to optimize how their brain functions. Tell them you know theyare trying to do their best, but their behavior, thoughts, or feelings may begetting in the way of their success (at work, in relationships, or withinthemselves). Emphasize better function, not defect.Give them information. Books, videos, and articles on the subjects you areconcerned about can be of tremendous help. Many people come to the Amen Clinicsbecause they read a book, saw a video, or read an article. Good information canbe very persuasive, especially if it is presented in a positive, life-enhancingway.If the person remains resistant to help, even after you have beenstraightforward and given them good information, plant seeds. Plant ideas aboutgetting help, then water them regularly. Drop an idea, article, or other sourceof information about the topic from time to time. If you talk too much aboutgetting help, people become resentful and will refuse to get help to spite you,especially the overfocused types. Be careful not to go overboard.Protect your relationship with the other person. People are more receptive topeople they trust than to people who nag and belittle them. Work on gaining theperson’s trust over the long run. It will make them more receptive to yoursuggestions. Do not make getting help the only thing you talk about. Make sureyou are interested in their whole lives, not just in their potential medicalappointments.Give them new hope. Many people with these problems have tried to get help, andit did not work or even made them worse. Educate them on new brain technologythat helps professionals be more focused and more effective in their treatmentefforts.There comes a time when you have to say, enough is enough. If, over time, theother person refuses to get help, and his or her behavior has a negative impacton your life, you may have to separate yourself. Staying in a toxic relationshipis harmful to your health, and it often enables the other person to remain sickas well. Actually, I have seen that the threat or act of leaving motivatespeople to change, whether it is about drinking, drug use, or treating ADD.Threatening to leave is not the first approach I would take, but after time itmay be the best approach. Realize that you cannot force a person into treatmentunless they are dangerous to themselves, dangerous to others, or unable to carefor themselves. You can only do what you can do. Fortunately, we can do a lotmore today than we could even ten years ago.FINDING A COMPETENT PROFESSIONAL WHO USES THIS NEW BRAIN SCIENCE THINKINGThe Amen Clinics get many calls, faxes, and e-mails each week from people allover the world looking for competent professionals in their area who think insimilar ways to the principles outlined in this book. Because this approach ison the edge of what is new in brain science, other professionals who know andpractice this information may be hard to find. But finding the rightprofessional for evaluation and treatment is critical to the healing process.The right professional can have a very positive impact on your life; the wrongprofessional can make things worse.There are a number of steps you can take to find the best person to assist you.Get the best person you can find. Saving money up front by choosing someone lessexpensive but also less able may cost you in the long run. The right help is notonly cost effective but saves unnecessary pain and suffering, so don’t rely on aperson simply because they are on your managed care plan. That person may or maynot be a good fit for you. Search for the best. If he or she is on yourinsurance plan, great, but don’t let that be the primary criterion. Once you getthe names of competent professionals, check their credentials. Very few patientsever check a professional’s background. Board certification is a positivecredential. To become board certified, physicians must pass additional writtenand verbal tests. They have to discipline themselves to gain the levels of skilland knowledge that are acceptable to their colleagues. Don’t give too muchweight to the medical school or graduate school the professional attended. Ihave worked with doctors who went to Yale and Harvard who did not have a clue asto how to appropriately treat patients, while other doctors from lessprestigious schools were outstanding, forward thinking, and caring. Set up aninterview with the professional to see whether you want to work with him or her.Generally you have to pay for their time, but it is worth spending the money toget to know the people you will rely on for help.Many professionals write articles or books or speak at meetings or local groups.Read the professional’s work or hear him or her speak, if possible. By doing soyou may be able to get a feel for the kind of person they are and their abilityto help you. Look for a person who is open-minded, up-to-date, and willing totry new things. Look for a person who treats you with respect, who listens toyour questions and responds to your needs. Look for a relationship that iscollaborative and respectful. I know it is hard to find a professional who meetsall of these criteria who also has the right training in brain physiology, butthese people can be found. Be persistent. The caregiver is essential to healing.A QUICK VIEW OF COMMON BRAIN PROBLEMS NEEDING HELPI once got a phone call from a very close friend whom I hadn’t heard from inyears. He sounded different. When we lived close together, he had beenenergetic, positive, outgoing, funny, and fascinated by the world around him. AsI listened to him that day on the phone, however, his voice was flat, and histhoughts were very negative. He told me his life had no meaning and that hewould much rather “see heaven” than struggle through any more days. My friendwas sleeping a lot, had problems concentrating, and had even lost interest insex, which was a real change for him. He was suffering from a clinicaldepression. He was the last person in the world with whom I expected to behaving that kind of conversation. But brain illnesses affecting emotions,behaviors, and learning are very common. A study sponsored by the NationalInstitute of Mental Health reported that 49 percent of the population willsuffer from a mental illness (really a brain illness) during some point in theirlife. Mood problems, anxiety disorders, alcohol or drug abuse, and attentiondeficit disorders are the most common problems. Mental illnesses strike the richand the poor, the successful and the not so successful. They devastateindividuals and families, and they often go untreated because of the stigma oursociety attaches to them.My friend had postponed calling me for over nine months. Not until his wifethreatened to divorce him did he call me. Many uninformed people have theerroneous idea that people with emotional illnesses are strange, scary, or wayout there. True, some people with mental illnesses have delusions or areviolent, but the vast majority of those who suffer from anxiety, depression, ordrug use are more like you and me than they are different; left untreated, theseproblems seriously undermine people’s ability to be their best self.What follows is a brief synopsis of mood disorders, anxiety problems, substanceabuse, and attention deficit disorder. Whenever I evaluate a new patient, I takea bio/psycho/social approach. That means I look at the biological,psychological, and social causes that may be underlying the problem. Inaddition, I also look at brain scans to subtype brain illnesses. For example, Ihave seen seven different types of anxiety and depression and six differenttypes of ADD. We work to target treatment to enhance the underlying brainsystems that may be involved in the problem. See my books Healing Anxiety andDepression and Healing ADD for a full discussion of subtyping these illnesses.MOOD DISORDERSDEPRESSIONJanet, a forty-two-year-old lawyer, wife, and mother of three, was referred tome because she was tired all the time. Her family physician ruled out thephysical causes of fatigue and thought she was overstressed. Additionally, shehad trouble concentrating at work and experienced difficulty sleeping. Her sexdrive was gone, her appetite was poor, and she had no interest in doing thingswith her family. She would start to cry for no apparent reason, and she evenbegan to entertain desperate suicidal thoughts. Janet had a serious depressiveillness.Depression is a very common mental illness. Studies reveal that at any point intime, 3 to 6 percent of the population has a significant depression. Only 20 to25 percent of these people ever seek help. This is unfortunate becausedepression is a very treatable problem.The following is a list of symptoms commonly associated with depression:• sad, blue, or gloomy mood• low energy, frequent fatigue• lack of ability to feel pleasure in usually pleasurable activities• irritability• poor concentration, distractibility, poor memory• suicidal thoughts, feelings of meaninglessness• feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, guilt, and worthlessness• changes in sleep, either poor sleep with frequent awakenings or increasedsleep• changes in appetite, either markedly decreased or increased• social withdrawal• low self-esteemHere is an example of the bio/psycho/social approach to understandingdepression. There are several important biological factors to look for indepression.• Family history. Depression often has a genetic link, and it often runs infamilies where there has been alcohol abuse.• Medical evaluation. A number of illnesses can cause depression, includingthyroid disease, infectious illnesses, cancer, and certain forms of anemia. Aheart attack, stroke, or brain trauma can also leave a person vulnerable todepression.• Dramatic hormonal shifts (postpartum or menopausal). Such shifts oftenprecipitate problems with depression.• Medications. Certain medications can cause depression, most notably birthcontrol pills, certain blood pressure or cardiac medications, steroids, andchronic pain control medicines.• Alcohol and drug abuse history. Chronic alcohol or marijuana use often causesdepression, while amphetamine or cocaine withdrawal is often accompanied byserious suicidal thoughts.The psychological factors to look for in depression include:• A major loss. The death of a loved one, the breakup of a romanticrelationship, the loss of a job, of self-esteem, status, health, or purpose—allcan cause depression.• Multiple childhood traumas, such as physical or sexual abuse. These too cancause depression.• Negative thinking. Negative thoughts erode self-esteem and drive mood down.• Learned helplessness, the belief that no matter what you do things won’tchange. This comes from being exposed to environments where you are continuallyfrustrated in reaching your goals.The social factors or current life stresses to evaluate in depression include:• Marital problems• Family dysfunction• Financial difficulties• Work-related problemsIn Janet’s case, her physical examination was normal, but her father had hadperiods of depression, and she had an uncle who killed himself. Psychologically,she had a very critical mother, and subsequently she was extremelyself-critical. Socially, her marriage had been difficult for the past severalyears, and she was often fighting with her teenage son.The best results in treating any emotional illness occur with abio/psycho/social approach. Janet was placed on antidepressant medication andlearned to be significantly less critical of herself. We also spent time workingon her marriage and her relationship with her teenage son. In ten weeks she feltmore energetic and was able to concentrate. Her mood was good. She slept welland her appetite returned. She also got along better at home with her husbandand son.Depression is a very treatable illness. Early detection and treatment from abio/psycho/social perspective is important to a full and complete recovery. Froma biological standpoint, we think of medication or supplements and proper dietand exercise. Exercise has been found in some studies to be as effective asmedication, but cheaper and with fewer side effects. (Most of the side effectsof exercise are positive.) Psychotherapy has also been found to be helpful intreating depression. The two best-studied forms of psychotherapy for depressionare cognitive therapy, which teaches patients to counteract the negativethoughts that invariably surface with depression, and interpersonalpsychotherapy, which teaches patients to have more effective relationships.BIPOLAR DISORDERAnother type of mood disorder is bipolar disorder, in which people cycle betweentwo poles. Periods of depression may alternate with periods of high, manic,irritable, or elated moods. Mania is categorized as a state distinct from one’snormal self, where one has greater energy, racing thoughts, more impulsivity, adecreased need for sleep, and a sense of grandiosity. It is often associatedwith periods of hypersexuality, hyperreligiosity, and spending sprees. Sometimesit is also associated with hallucinations or delusions. In treating thedepressive part of the cycle, both pharmaceutical and supplement antidepressantshave been known to stimulate manic episodes. It is important to vigorously treatthis disorder, as it has been associated with marital problems, substance abuse,and suicide.Here is a list of symptoms often associated with bipolar disorder.• Periods of abnormally elevated, depressed, or anxious mood• Periods of decreased need for sleep, feeling energetic on dramatically lesssleep than usual• Periods of grandiose notions, ideas, or plans• Periods of increased talking or pressured speech• Periods of too many thoughts racing through the mind• Periods of markedly increased energy• Periods of poor judgment that leads to risk-taking behavior (separate fromusual behavior)• Periods of inappropriate social behavior• Periods of irritability or aggression• Periods of delusional or psychotic thinkingThe classic form of this disorder is known as Bipolar I, which used to be calledmanic-depressive illness. In recent years, a milder form of the disorder calledBipolar II has been associated with depressive episodes and milder “hypomanic”issues.The treatment for bipolar disorder, both I and II, is usually medication, suchas lithium or anticonvulsants such as Depakote. In recent years literaturesuggests that high doses of omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish and flaxseedoils, can also be helpful.ANXIETY DISORDERSThere are four common types of anxiety disorders that can affect people in anegative way: panic disorder, agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, andpost-traumatic stress disorder. I’ll briefly discuss each of these and theirtreatments.PANIC DISORDERAll of a sudden your heart starts to pound. You get this feeling of incredibledread. Your breathing rate goes faster. You start to sweat. Your muscles gettight, and your hands feel like ice. Your mind starts to race about everyterrible thing that could possibly happen, and you feel as though you’re goingto lose your mind if you don’t get out of the current situation. You’ve just hada panic attack. Panic attacks are one of the most common brain disorders. It isestimated that 6 to 7 percent of adults will at some point in their lives sufferfrom recurrent panic attacks. They often begin in late adolescence or earlyadulthood but may spontaneously occur later in life. If a person has threeattacks in a three-week period, doctors make a diagnosis of a panic disorder.In a typical panic attack, a person has at least four of the following twelvesymptoms: shortness of breath, heart pounding, chest pain, choking or smotheringfeelings, dizziness, tingling of hands or feet, feeling unreal, hot or coldflashes, sweating, faintness, trembling or shaking, and a fear of dying or goingcrazy. When a panic attack first starts, many people end up in the emergencyroom because they think they’re having a heart attack. Some people even end upbeing admitted to the hospital.Anticipation anxiety is one of the most difficult symptoms for people who have apanic disorder. These people are often extremely skilled at predicting the worstin a situation. In fact, it is often the anticipation of a bad event that bringson a panic attack. For example, you are in the grocery store and worry thatyou’re going to have an anxiety attack and pass out on the floor. Then, youpredict, everyone in the store will look at you and laugh. Pretty quickly thesymptoms begin. Sometimes a panic disorder can become so severe that a personbegins to avoid almost any situation outside of their house, a condition calledagoraphobia.Panic attacks can occur for a variety of different reasons. Sometimes they arecaused by a medical illness, such as hyperthyroidism, which is why it’s alwaysimportant to have a physical examination and screening blood work. Sometimesthey can be brought on by excessive caffeine intake or alcohol withdrawal.Hormonal changes also seem to play a role. Panic attacks in women are seen morefrequently at the end of their menstrual cycle, after having a baby, and duringmenopause. Traumatic events from the past that somehow get unconsciouslytriggered can also precipitate a series of attacks. Commonly there is a familyhistory of panic attacks, alcohol abuse, or other mental illnesses.On SPECT scans we often see hyperactivity in the basal ganglia or sometimes inthe temporal lobe. Psychotherapy is my preferred treatment for this disorder,and in some studies it has been shown to calm basal ganglia activity. Sometimessupplements or medications can be helpful. Unfortunately the most helpfulmedications are also addictive, so care is needed.AGORAPHOBIAThe name agoraphobia comes from a Greek word that means “fear of themarketplace.” In behavioral terms it means fear of being alone in public places.The person’s underlying worry is that they will lose control or becomeincapacitated and no one will be there to help. People afflicted with thisphobia avoid being in crowds, in stores, or on busy streets. They’re oftenafraid of being in tunnels, on bridges, in elevators, or on publictransportation. They usually insist that a family member or a friend accompanythem when they leave home. If the fear establishes a foothold in the person, itmay affect his or her whole life. Normal activities become increasinglyrestricted as the fears and avoidance behaviors dominate their life.Agoraphobic symptoms often begin in the late teen years or early twenties, butI’ve seen them start in people in their fifties and sixties. Often, withoutknowing what is wrong, agoraphobic people will try to medicate themselves withexcessive amounts of alcohol or drugs. This illness occurs more frequently inwomen, and many of those who have it experienced significant separation anxietyas children. Additionally, there may be a history of excessive anxiety, panicattacks, depression, or alcohol abuse in relatives.Agoraphobia often evolves out of panic attacks that seem to occur “out of theblue,” for no apparent reason. These attacks are so frightening that the personbegins to avoid any situation that may be in any way associated with the fear. Ithink these initial panic attacks are often triggered by an unconscious memoryof an event or by an anxiety from the past. For example, I once treated apatient who had been raped as a teenager in a park late at night. When she wastwenty-eight, she had her first panic attack while walking late at night in apark with her husband. She associated the park setting late at night with beingraped, which triggered the panic attack.Agoraphobia is a very frightening illness both to the patient and to his or herfamily. With effective, early intervention, however, there is significant hopefor recovery. The scan findings and treatment are similar to those for peoplewith panic disorder. The one difference is that people with agoraphobia oftenhave increased anterior cingulate gyrus activity and get stuck in their fear ofhaving more panic attacks. Getting stuck in the fear often prevents them fromleaving home. Using medications, such as Prozac and Lexapro, or supplements,such as 5-HTP and St. John’s wort, to increase serotonin and calm this part ofthe brain is often helpful.OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDERThe hallmarks of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are recurrent thoughts thatseem outside a person’s control, or compulsive behaviors that a person knowsmake no sense but that he or she feels compelled to do anyway. The obsessivethoughts may involve violence (such as killing one’s child), contamination (suchas becoming infected by shaking hands), or doubt (such as the worry of havinghurt someone in a traffic accident, even though no such accident occurred). Manyefforts are made to suppress or resist these thoughts, but the more a persontries to control them, the more powerful they can become.The most common compulsions involve hand-washing, counting, checking, andtouching. These behaviors are often performed according to certain rules in avery strict or rigid manner. For example, people with a counting compulsion mayfeel the need to count every crack on the pavement on their way to work orschool. What would be a five-minute walk for most people could turn into athree- or four-hour trip for the person with OCD. They have an urgent sense of“I have to do it” inside. A part of the individual generally recognizes thesenselessness of the behavior and doesn’t get pleasure from carrying it out,although doing it often provides a release of tension. Over the years I’vetreated many people with OCD, the youngest of whom was five years old. He had achecking compulsion and had to check the house locks at night as many as twentyto thirty times before he could fall asleep. The oldest person I treated withthis disorder was eighty-three. She had obsessive sexual thoughts that made herfeel dirty inside. It got to the point where she would lock all her doors, drawall the window shades, turn off the lights, take the phone off the hook, and sitin the middle of a dark room trying to catch the abhorrent sexual thoughts asthey came into her mind.On SPECT studies of people with OCD, we often see excessive activity in thebasal ganglia and anterior cingulate gyrus. Behavior therapy can be helpful andhas been shown to improve brain function. Using medications, such as Prozac andLexapro, or supplements, such as 5-HTP and St. John’s wort, to increaseserotonin and calm these parts of the brain is often helpful.POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDERJoanne, a thirty-four-year-old travel agent, was held up in her office atgunpoint by two men. Four or five times during the robbery, one of the men helda gun to her head and said he was going to kill her. She graphically imaginedher brain being splattered with blood against the wall. Near the end of thisfifteen-minute ordeal they made her take off all her clothes. She picturedherself being brutally raped by them. They left without touching her, locked ina closet.Since that time her life had been thrown into turmoil. She felt tense and wasplagued with flashbacks and nightmares of the robbery. Her stomach was in knots,and she had a constant headache. Whenever she went out, she felt panicky. Shewas frustrated that she could not calm her body: her heart raced, she was shortof breath, and her hands were constantly cold and sweaty. She hated how shefelt, and she was angry about how her nice life had turned into a nightmare.What was most upsetting to her were the ways the robbery affected her marriageand her child. Her baby picked up the tension and was very fussy. Every time shetried to make love with her husband, she began to cry and get images of the menraping her.Joanne had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a brain reaction to a severetraumatic event such as a robbery, rape, car accident, earthquake, tornado, oreven a volcanic eruption. Her symptoms were classic for PTSD, especially theflashbacks and nightmares of the event.Perhaps the worst symptoms, however, came from the horrible thoughts about whathad never happened, such as seeing her brain splattered against the wall andbeing raped. These thoughts were registered in her subconscious as fact, anduntil she entered treatment she was not able to recognize how much damage theyhad been doing to her. For example, when she imagined that she was being raped,a part of her began to believe that she actually was raped. The first time shehad her period after the robbery, she began to cry because she was relieved shewas not pregnant by the robbers, even though they never touched her. A part ofher even believed she was dead because she had so vividly pictured her owndeath. A significant portion of her treatment was geared to counteract theseerroneous subconscious conclusions.Without treatment, PTSD can literally ruin a person’s life. The most effectivetreatment is usually psychotherapy. One type of psychotherapy that I think worksespecially well for PTSD is Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing(EMDR). You can learn more about this technique in my book Healing Anxiety andDepression or by visiting www.emdria.org [http://www.emdria.org]. Depending onthe severity of PTSD, certain types of medications and supplements can also behelpful.DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSEMany people use alcohol or drugs to medicate underlying brain systems that aremisfiring. Downers, such as alcohol, marijuana, sedatives, and pain-killers, areused to calm hyperactive brain systems; uppers, such as cocaine andmethamphetamine, are used to stimulate underactive areas of the brain. Theproblem is that most of these substances are addictive and cause brain damage.Sometimes the damage is permanent. In addition, substance abuse has a seriousnegative impact on relationships, work, and health. In relationships, manypeople complain that their partner who is abusing these substances is emotional,erratic, selfish, and unpredictable. Alcohol and drug abuse are common causes ofrelationship breakups. The list of health problems caused by alcohol and drugsfills volumes of books. The most common workplace problems include erratic jobperformance, absenteeism, tardiness, work accidents, and decreased jobperformance. Denial is frequently strong in substance abusers. The person withthe problem is usually the last one to recognize that a problem is present.Alcohol- and drug-related problems are similar in many ways. I have chosen tolump these two groups together for simplicity.Note: Alcohol means any beverage or medication that contains any alcohol, frombeer or wine to hard liquor, and even some cough preparations. Drug means anymind-altering substance that produces a stimulant, depressant, or euphoriceffect—amphetamines, barbiturates, marijuana, cocaine, heroin, PCP, and so on.Go through the following list of symptoms of excessive alcohol or drug use, andcheck off those that apply to you. This will give you an idea if this area is aproblem for you or someone you know.1. Increasing consumption of alcohol or drugs, whether on a regular or asporadic basis, with frequent and perhaps unintended episodes of intoxication2. Use of drugs or alcohol as a means of handling problems3. Obvious preoccupation with alcohol or drugs and the expressed need to havethem4. Gulping of drinks or using large quantities of drugs5. Need for increasing quantities of alcohol or the drug to obtain the same“buzz”6. Tendency to make alibis and weak excuses for drinking or drug use7. Need to have others cover for you, either at work or at home8. Refusal to concede what is obviously excessive consumption and expressingannoyance when the subject is mentioned9. Frequent absenteeism from the job, especially if it occurs in a pattern,such as following weekends and holidays (Monday morning “flu”)10. Repeated changes in jobs, particularly to successively lower levels, oremployment in a capacity beneath one’s ability, education, and background11. Shabby appearance, poor hygiene, and behavior and social adjustmentinconsistent with previous levels or expectations12. Persistent vague body complaints without apparent cause, particularlytrouble sleeping, abdominal problems, headaches, or loss of appetite13. Multiple contacts with the health care system14. Persistent marital problems; perhaps multiple marriages15. History of arrests for intoxicated driving or disorderly conduct16. Unusual anxiety or obvious moodiness17. Withdrawal symptoms on stopping (tremors, feeling extremely anxious,craving drugs or alcohol, vomiting, and so on); an alcoholic or drug abuser hasusually tried to stop many times but is unable to withstand the symptoms ofwithdrawal18. Hearing voices or seeing things that aren’t there19. Blackouts (times you cannot remember)20. Memory impairment21. Drinking or using drugs alone; early-morning use; secretive use22. Denial in the face of an obvious problemMy favorite definition of an alcoholic or drug addict is anyone who has gotteninto trouble (legal, relational, or work-related) while drinking or using thedrug, then continues to use it. They did not learn from the previous experience.A rational person would realize that he or she has trouble handling the alcoholor drug and would stay away from it. Unfortunately, many people with theseproblems have to experience repeated failures because of the substance use andthus hit “rock bottom” before treatment is sought.A very helpful trend in medicine over the last ten years has been to classifyalcoholism and excessive drug use as illnesses instead of morally weak behavior.The American Medical Association, the World Health Organization, and many otherprofessional groups regard these as specific disease entities.Untreated, these diseases progress to serious physical complications that oftenlead to death. Here are some important facts you need to know about alcohol anddrug abuse.1. These addictions often run in families. The more relatives a person has whoare alcoholics or addicts, the more likely they are or will become dependent onthese chemicals. A rule of thumb: one parent = 25 percent chance; two parents orone parent and one sibling = 50 percent chance; three or more family members =75-plus percent chance.2. Alcoholism or drug addiction shortens life expectancy by an estimated ten tofifteen years.3. Alcoholism and drug addictions occur in about fifteen million Americans. Ifthis problem applies to you, you are not alone.4. There is no typical person with alcoholism or a drug addiction. Thesediseases affect people in all socioeconomic classes.5. Drunken driving or driving under the influence of drugs is responsible forwell over 50 percent of all highway traffic fatalities.6. Alcoholism and drug addiction are treatable. Treatment for alcohol or drugabusers and their families is widely available today in all parts of thecountry.In treating substance abuse, it is important to recognize and treat anyunderlying cause of the problem, such as unrecognized depression, bipolardisorder, anxiety disorders, or ADD. New medications have been developed thathave been found helpful in alleviating withdrawal symptoms and decreasingcravings for the substances. Psychotherapy and support groups are often helpfulas well.ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDERDo you often feel restless? Have trouble concentrating? Have trouble withimpulsiveness, either doing or saying things you wish you hadn’t? Do you fail tofinish many projects you start? Are you easily bored or quick to anger? If theanswer to most of these questions is yes, you may have attention deficitdisorder (ADD).ADD is the most common brain problem in children, affecting 5 to 10 percent ofthem in the United States, and one of the most common problems in adults. Themain symptoms of ADD are a short attention span, distractibility,disorganization, procrastination, and poor internal supervision. It is often,but not always, associated with impulsive behavior and hyperactivity orrestlessness. Until recently most people thought children outgrew this disorderduring their teenage years. For many, this is false. While it is true that thehyperactivity lessens over time, the other symptoms of impulsivity,distractibility, and a short attention span remain for most sufferers intoadulthood. Current research shows that 60 to 80 percent of ADD children neverfully outgrow this disorder. Over the years I have seen thousands of childrenwho had ADD. When I meet with their parents and take a good family history, Ifind that there is about an 80 percent chance that at least one of the parentsalso had symptoms of ADD as a child and may, in fact, still be showing symptomsas an adult. Many of the parents were never diagnosed. Not infrequently I learnof ADD in adults when parents tell me that they tried their child’s medication(not something I recommend) and found it very helpful. They report it helpedthem concentrate for longer periods of time and that they become more organizedand less impulsive.Common symptoms of the adult form of ADD include poor organization and planning,procrastination, trouble listening carefully to directions, and excessivetraffic violations. Additionally, people with adult ADD are often late forappointments, frequently misplace things, may be quick to anger, and have poorfollow-through. There may also be frequent, impulsive job changes and poorfinancial management. Substance abuse, especially of alcohol or amphetamines andcocaine, and low self-esteem are also common.Many people do not recognize the seriousness of this disorder and just passthese kids and adults off as lazy, defiant, or willful. But ADD is a seriousdisorder. Left untreated, it affects a person’s self-esteem, socialrelationships, and ability to learn and work. Several studies have shown thatADD children use twice as many medical services as non-ADD kids. Up to 35percent of untreated ADD teens never finish high school, 52 percent of untreatedadults abuse substances, teens and adults with ADD have more traffic accidents,and adults with ADD move four times more than others.Many adults tell me that when they were children they were in trouble all thetime and had a real sense that there was something very different about them.Even though many of the adults I treat with ADD are very bright, they arefrequently frustrated by not living up to their potential.Our research with SPECT scans makes it clear that ADD is a brain disorder, butnot one simple disorder. I have described six different types of ADD. The mostcommon feature of ADD is decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex with aconcentration task. This means that the harder a person tries, the less brainactivity they have to work with. Many people with ADD self-medicate withstimulants—such as caffeine, nicotine, cocaine, or methamphetamine—to increaseactivity in the PFC. They also tend to self-medicate with conflict-seekingbehavior. If they can get someone upset, it helps to stimulate their brain. Ofcourse, they have no idea they do this behavior. I call it unconscious,brain-driven behavior. But if you are around ADD people long enough, you willsee and feel the conflict-seeking behavior.The best treatment for ADD depends on the type of ADD a person has. See my bookHealing ADD for a complete description of types and treatments. In general,intense exercise helps, as does a higher-protein, lower-carbohydrate diet.Sometimes medications or supplements are helpful, but they can make things worseif they are not right. When correctly targeted, ADD is a highly treatabledisorder in both children and adults.Do not let pride get in the way of getting the help you need. In order to make agood brain great, you have to admit when you need help. Remember Principle 9, weall need a little help."},{"pageContent":"22FIFTEEN DAYS TO A BETTER BRAINGive your brain one hour a day for fifteen days, and you will be on your way tomaking your good brain great. Of course, you will need to keep up the programover time, but you will notice a dramatic difference in just two weeks and oneday, and you’ll be on the road to the best brain possible. Here are six steps toputting the program together.STEP ONEBuy or make a journal.STEP TWOOn page one write out your “One-Page Miracle” (see Chapter 16). Spend a goodpart of day one completing it. It will be your road map to success.STEP THREEOn the next page, compose a poem or letter to your brain. As silly as it sounds,it is important to do some bonding exercises with your brain. Love and emotionhelp motivate us into action. Here’s an example—I call it “A Love Letter to MyBrain.”A LOVE LETTER TO MY BRAINTo My Beloved Brain:You are involved in everything I do. When you work right, I work right; when youare troubled or in a bad way, I tend struggle with life. You are extraordinary,wondrous, complicated, and sometimes hard to understand. You are also veryfragile, soft, and in need of protection from harm. Since you are 85 percentwater, I know you need lots of fresh water every day. You are multitalented . .. certain parts of you do certain things really well and help me in many areasof life. I know that sometimes you also can have trouble. I am sorry when youhurt or don’t function at your best. We need to become more intimate and get toknow each other better. If you need help, I am here for you. If needed, we willlook under the hood. I will not allow people to guess at what you need withoutlooking at you. Using emotion (from the limbic system) and directed effort (fromthe prefrontal cortex) we can change; we can make each other better and happier,starting today. I will not expect you to be perfect, because we all need alittle help.STEP FOURNext, write down the promises that you are willing to make to your brain. Hereare some examples.In a sincere effort to keep you healthy so that we can have a long, happy,productive life together, I am willing to make you the following promises. Ipromise that I will:• Think about you every day, so you can think properly• Care for you, so you will allow me to take good care of myself and those Ilove• Accept the fact their neither you nor I are perfect, but we can be better• Protect you from injury, toxins, and too much stress• Give you enough sleep• Feed you nutritious food, but not too much• Teach you new things so you continue to be excellent at learning• Exercise our heart and body to keep great blood supply flowing to you• Keep you coordinated so we can think and act faster• Keep you physically and emotionally connected to others• Play beautiful music for you so that your firing patterns will stay healthy• Actively seek to prevent diseases of aging so we can stay young together• Give you the supplements you need to help keep you healthy• Get you help when neededSTEP FIVENext, label the journal pages one to ten. On each page write all the followingheadings:• Exercise. Write the time and level of exercise you did that day. Strivetoward at least thirty minutes a day where you get your heart rate up abovenormal.• Supplements. Write down each supplement that you take each day; I recommendthe following cocktail for most adults (see Chapter 20 for more details): • Acetyl-L-carnitine—500 mg once a day • Alpha-lipoic acid—100 mg once a day • Fish oil—1,000 mg twice a day • Phosphatidylserine—100 mg twice a day • Super multiple vitamin with high-dose B vitamins • Vitamin E (mixed tocopherols)—100 mg twice a day • Vitamin C—250 mg twice a day• Meditation. Write down the time you spent meditating or doing relaxationexercises. Strive for twelve minutes a day for mental clarity and stressmanagement. I recommend an active form of yoga meditation called Kriya Kirtan.It is based on the five primal sounds saa, taa, naa, maa, and aa. Repeat eachsound as you consecutively touch your thumb to fingers two, three, four, andfive. Repeat the sounds and fingering for two minutes out loud, two minuteswhispering, four minutes silently, two minutes whispering, and two minutes outloud. It is okay to make a tape or set a quiet alarm to keep the timingaccurate.• New learning. Spend at least fifteen minutes a day learning something new,and write down what you learned in your journal.• What I ate today. Include the food and drinks you consume each day, includingsnacks. For the first two weeks give a general idea of the calories you consume.If you don’t know, start to measure and count. Remember, calorie restriction isa brain longevity strategy.STEP SIXLet’s get started!!DAY 1: FIRST THINGS FIRSTComplete your own One-Page Miracle (see Chapter 16 for directions)• Exercise   (percent of targeted thirty-minute exercise accomplished)• Supplements    (yes orno)• Meditation    (timespent; target twelve minutes a day)• New learning _______ (what new piece of information or new skill did youlearn today?)• What I ate today (list the food and approximate calories you ate today)BreakfastSnackLunchSnackDinnerDessertApproximate caloriesDAY 2: A LOVE LETTER TO MY BRAINWrite a poem or love letter to your brain.• Exercise   (percent of targeted thirty-minute exercise accomplished)• Supplements    (yes orno)• Meditation    (timespent; target twelve minutes a day)• New learning _______ (what new piece of information or new skill did youlearn today?)• What I ate today (list the food and approximate calories you ate today)BreakfastSnackLunchSnackDinnerDessertApproximate caloriesDAY 3: PROMISES TO MY BRAINWrite your promises to your brain.• Exercise   (percent of targeted thirty-minute exercise accomplished)• Supplements    (yes orno)• Meditation    (timespent; target twelve minutes a day)• New learning _______ (what new piece of information or new skill did youlearn today?)• What I ate today (list the food and approximate calories you ate today)BreakfastSnackLunchSnackDinnerDessertApproximate caloriesDAY 4: WORKING THE BRAINNew learning takes priority.

Why are psychiatrists the only physicians who rarely look atthe organ they treat?It is time to change this situation. Amen Clinics, Inc. (ACI) has providedleadership and understanding on the clinical use of brain imaging in psychiatry.Over the past fifteen years ACI has built the world’s largest database of brainscans related to emotional, learning, and behavioral problems. The study we dois called brain SPECT imaging. SPECT stands for “single photon emission computedtomography.” It is a nuclear medicine procedure widely used to study heart,liver, thyroid, bone, and brain problems. Brain SPECT imaging is a proven,reliable measure of cerebral blood flow. Because brain activity is directlyrelated to blood flow, SPECT effectively shows us the patterns of activity inthe brain. SPECT allows physicians to look deep inside the brain to observethree things: areas of the brain that work well, areas that work too hard, andareas that do not work hard enough. ACI has performed more than thirty thousandscans on patients from age ten months to 101 years and has also scanned manynormal, “healthy brain” individuals as well.The procedure guidelines of the Society of Nuclear Medicine list the evaluationof suspected brain trauma, evaluation of patients with suspected dementia,presurgical location of seizures, and the detection and evaluation of cerebralvascular disease as common indications for brain SPECT. The guidelines also saythat many additional indications appear promising. At ACI, because of ourexperience, we have added the indications of violence, substance abuse, thesubtypes of ADD, anxiety and depression, and complex or resistant psychiatricproblems for brain SPECT imaging.An important question for today’s mental health clinicians is, When and whywould I order a SPECT study for my patients or get one for myself or loved one?My purpose in this appendix is to answer this question and to point out some ofthe benefits and caveats for using this powerful tool.BENEFITS OF BRAIN SPECT IMAGINGA SPECT scan can provide distinct benefits to clinicians, to the patient, and tohis or her family.FIRST, THE BENEFITS FOR PHYSICIANS AND CLINICIANS:1. A SPECT scan can show:a. Areas of the brain implicated in specific problems, such as the prefrontalcortex with executive function and the medial temporal lobes with long-termmemory storage.b. Unexpected findings that may be contributing to the presenting problem(s),such as toxicity, potential areas of seizure activity, or past brain trauma.c. Potential seizure activity, in many cases more accurately seen by SPECT thanby standard EEG, especially in the areas of the medial temporal lobe. There aremore than forty-one studies with more than thirteen hundred patients on SPECTand epilepsy. See www.amenclinic.com [http://www.Amenclinic.com] for references.d. Targeted areas for treatment, such as overactive basal ganglia or anteriorcingulate gyrus (seen on anxiety and OCD spectrum disorders), or underactivetemporal lobe (seen in seizure disorders and trauma).e. Specific effects of medication on the brain to help guide us in adjustingdosages or augmenting treatment. Often patients report that SSRIs are helpfulbut also cause decreased motivation or memory problems, seen as decreasedprefrontal or temporal lobe activity on SPECT.f. Changes in brain function with treatment, improved or worsened. You canreview many before-and-after scans at www.amenclinic.com[http://www.Amenclinic.com].2. The image occurs at the time of injection and outside the imaging camera,which gives SPECT several significant advantages. Most notably, we are able tosedate people after they have been injected so that they can lie still for thescan, which is often difficult for hyperactive or autistic children or dementedadults. (Motion artifact ruins the scan in all of these imaging techniques.)3. A SPECT scan can provide explanations for refractory symptoms and helpclinicians ask better and more targeted questions (such as about toxic exposure,brain injuries, anoxia, inflammation, or infections that patients may havedenied or forgotten).4. A SPECT scan can help us to avoid prescribing treatments that make theproblem worse, such as unnecessarily stimulating an already overactive brain orcalming an underactive one.5. A SPECT scan can help to evaluate risk for dementia—the brain starts tochange long before people show symptoms. There is usually a loss of 30 percentof hippocampal tissue before symptoms occur. Using autopsy data in fifty-fourpatients, F. J. Bonte reported that brain SPECT had a positive predictive valuefor Alzheimer’s disease of 92 percent.6. A SPECT scan can also help to differentiate among types of dementia. Earlyin the disease, Alzheimer’s, frontal temporal lobe dementia, Lewy Body dementia,multi-infarct dementia each have their own patterns. There are over eighty-threestudies with more than 4,500 patients on this subject. See for references.7. A SPECT scan helps clinicians understand the rationale for using certainmedications (such as anticonvulsants to stabilize temporal lobe function or calmfocal areas of marked hyperactivity; or stimulants to enhance decreasedprefrontal perfusion; or SSRIs to calm basal ganglia and anterior cingulatehyperactivity).8. A SPECT scan can identify specific areas of the brain affected by trauma,better target treatment, and help deal with insurance, legal, and rehabilitationissues. There are more than thirty-eight studies on brain trauma with more thanthirteen hundred patients. See www.amenclinic.com [http://www.Amenclinic.com]for references.9. A SPECT scan can often identify specific factors contributing to relapse inrecovering alcoholics, substance abusers, eating disordered people, or sexualaddicts. For example, the patient may have suffered an injury to the prefrontalcortex or temporal lobes or have overactivity in the anterior cingulate gyrus,basal ganglia, limbic system, or prefrontal cortex, each of which could indicatea comorbid disorder that could contribute to the relapsing behavior and wouldrequire treatment.10. A SPECT scan is also useful in determining if further adjustment ofmedication is needed. Scans of patients on medication will reveal areas of thebrain still overactive or underactive.BENEFITS OF SPECT BRAIN IMAGING FOR PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES:1. A SPECT scan helps develop a deeper understanding of the problem, resultingin reduced shame, guilt, stigma, and self-loathing. This understanding canpromote self-forgiveness, often the first step in healing. Patients can see thattheir problems are, at least in part, medical and physical.2. A SPECT scan allows patients to see a physical representation of theirproblems that is accurate and reliable, and that helps to increasecompliance—pictures are powerful. It can influence a patient’s willingness andability to accept and adhere to the treatment program. They can betterunderstand that not taking medication for anxiety, depression, rage, or ADD issimilar to not wearing the “correct” prescription glasses.3. A SPECT scan helps families understand that permanent brain damage from aninjury will not get better, so that they can better accept the condition andprovide accordingly.4. A SPECT scan shows substance abusers the damage they have done to their ownbrain, thus helping to decrease denial, provide motivation for treatment, andsupport perseverance in sobriety.5. A SPECT scan shows patients how treatments have impacted (improved orworsened) their brain function.6. A SPECT scan helps motivate abusive spouses to follow medication protocolsby showing them that there is a physical abnormality contributing to theirproblems.7. A SPECT scan is useful for cancer patients suffering from a “chemotherapytoxic brain.” It gives them insight into their cognitive struggles and alsohelps their doctors see the neurophysiological and emotional effects of cancerand its treatment.8. A SPECT scan can help take modern psychopharmacology from mystery andunknown consequences to reality and more predictable outcomes.9. A SPECT scan allows patients to understand why specific treatments areindicated, which medications are likely to be most helpful, and what otherinterventions may be indicated.WHAT A SPECT SCAN CANNOT PROVIDEDespite the many benefits that might be derived from a SPECT scan, there areclearly some things that it cannot provide. For example, a SPECT scan cannot:1. Give a diagnosis in the absence of clinical information2. Give the date of a head injury, infection, or toxic exposure3. Assess or evaluate IQ4. Assess or evaluate the guilt, innocence, motivation, or sanity of a criminaldefendant5. Guarantee a perfect diagnosis, or a cureHOW SPECT DIFFERS FROM MRIA SPECT scan is similar to an MRI study in that both can show three-dimensionalimages and “slices” of the brain. But whereas MRI shows the physical anatomy ofthe brain, SPECT shows brain functional activity. That is, SPECT yields imagesshowing where the brain is functioning well, where it is working too hard, andwhere it is not working hard enough. A newer version of MRI, functional MRI or“fMRI,” is also capable of showing brain activity and is used extensively inscientific research on brain function. fMRI shows instantaneous neural activityso you can see, for example, how the brain responds to a specific stimulusevent. With SPECT we see brain activity averaged over a few minutes so it isbetter at showing the brain doing everyday activities such as concentrating,meditating, reading, and the like. PET, another nuclear imaging technique, isvery similar to SPECT but is slower and more costly.ENSURING HIGH-QUALITY SPECT IMAGESAlthough a SPECT scan is simple from the patient’s perspective, it takesconsiderable skill and experience to dependably generate accurate brain SPECTimages suitable for psychiatric applications. Equally important is the need fortotal consistency in imaging techniques among patients so that results arequantifiable, repeatable, and consistent.Here are some of the factors that need to be considered in SPECT scans.VARIABILITY OF TECHNIQUE ISSUESProcessing protocols need to be standardized and optimized. Motion can ruin ascan, so it is important that there be no motion on the scan. It’s necessary toknow how to identify and deal with image artifacts and other sophisticatedtechnical issues.VARIABILITY OF CAMERASMultiheaded cameras are clearly superior, as they can scan much faster. It takesan hour to do a scan on a single-headed camera, thirty minutes on a dual-headedcamera, and fifteen minutes on a triple-headed camera.EXPERIENCE OF READERSAt the Amen Clinics, we have developed a standardized reading technique forwhich we have documented high inter- and intra-rater reliability.IMAGE DISPLAYScans must be clear, understandable, easily illustrative of brain function, andavailable to the patient on a timely basis. We believe our 3D rendering softwaremakes the scans easy for professionals, patients, and families to understand.DRUGSScans can be affected by a number of substances that need to be controlled for,such as medications, street drugs, and caffeine.All of the above issues have been addressed at the Amen Clinics by carefullystandardized procedures for all our SPECT scans.COMMON CONCERNSConcern: Because of its low resolution, a SPECT scan is commonly said to be a“poor man’s PET study.”Response: With multiheaded cameras, SPECT has the same resolution as PET withconsiderably lower cost, better insurance coverage, greater availability, andfewer image artifacts. Also, it is an easier procedure to do. SPECT providesmore than adequate resolution for our applications.Concern: What about radiation exposure, especially in children?Response: The average radiation exposure for one SPECT scan is 0.7 rem (similarto a nuclear bone scan or brain CAT scan) and is a safe procedure, according tothe guidelines established by the American Academy of Neurology. These otherprocedures are routinely ordered for many common medical conditions (such asbone fractures or head trauma), further suggesting that the levels of radiationexposure are generally acceptable in medical practice. Ineffective treatment ofpsychiatric illness has many more risks than the low levels of radiationassociated with a SPECT scan.Concern: What is normal?Response: In the SPECT literature over the past twenty years, more thanforty-three studies have looked at “normal” issues in over 2,450 patients,including 150 children from birth on. (See www.amenclinic.com[http://www.Amenclinic.com] for references.) These do not include the thousandsof control subjects used in studies of specific neurological and psychiatricconditions. C. Chiron, et al., reported that at birth, cortical regionalcerebral blood flow (rCBF) was lower than for adults. After birth, it increasedby five or six years of age to values 50 to 85 percent higher than those foradults, thereafter decreasing to reach adult levels between fifteen and nineteenyears. At the age of three, however, children had the same relative blood flowpatterns as adults. Other common findings in normal studies suggest that womenhave generally higher perfusion than men and that age, drug abuse, and smokinghave a negative effect on rCBF.Concern: Some physicians say, “I don’t need a scan for diagnosis. I can tellclinically.”Response: Often well-trained physicians can tell clinically. But they order aSPECT scan when they are confused, the patient hasn’t responded to their besttreatment, or the patient’s situation is complicated.Concern: What about the lack of reproducibility?Response: A paper by Javier Villanueva-Meyer, M.D., et al., elegantly answersthis question, showing that there is less than 3 percent variability in SPECTscans over time for the same activity. Our own clinical experience, scanningpeople sequentially and sometimes twelve years apart, is that SPECT patterns arethe same unless you do something to change the brain. SPECT is a reproducibleand reliable method for sequential evaluation.CONCLUSIONAt the Amen Clinics we feel that our experience with more than thirty thousandbrain SPECT scans over fifteen years guides us in being the best in the worldfor brain SPECT imaging.COMMON QUESTIONS ABOUT BRAIN SPECT IMAGINGHere are several common questions and answers about brain SPECT imaging.Will the SPECT study give me an accurate diagnosis? No. A SPECT study by itselfwill not give a diagnosis. SPECT studies help clinicians understand more aboutthe specific function of your brain. Each person’s brain is unique, which maylead to unique responses to medicine or therapy. Diagnoses about specificconditions are made through a combination of clinical history, a personalinterview, information from families, diagnostic checklists, SPECT studies, andother neuropsychological tests. No study is “a doctor in a box” that can giveaccurate diagnoses on individual patients.Why are SPECT studies ordered? Some of the common reasons include:1. Evaluating memory problems and dementia and distinguishing among differenttypes of dementia and pseudodementia (depression that looks like dementia)2. Evaluating seizure activity3. Evaluating blood vessel diseases, such as stroke4. Evaluating the effects of mild, moderate, and severe head trauma5. Suspicion of underlying organic brain condition, such as seizure activitycontributing to behavioral disturbance, prenatal trauma, or exposure to toxins6. Evaluating atypical or unresponsive aggressive behavior7. Determining extent of brain impairment caused by the drug or alcohol abuse8. Typing anxiety, depression, and attention deficit disorders when clinicalpresentation is not clear9. Evaluating people who are atypical or resistant to treatmentDo I need to be off medication before the study? This question must be answeredindividually between you and your doctor. In general, it is better to be offmedications until they are out of your system, but this is not always practicalor advisable. If the study is done while you are on medication, let thetechnician know so that when the physician reads the study, he will include thatinformation in the interpretation of the scan. In general, we recommend thatpatients try to be off stimulants at least four days before the first scan andremain off of them until after the second scan if one is ordered. It isgenerally not practical to stop medications such as Prozac because they last inthe body for four to six weeks. Check with your specific doctor forrecommendations.What should I do the day of the scan? On the day of the scan decrease oreliminate your caffeine intake and try not to take cold medication or aspirin.(If you do, please write it down on the intake form.) Eat as you normally would.Are there any side effects or risks to the study? The study does not involve adye, and people do not have allergic reactions to it. The possibility exists,although in a very small percentage of patients, of a mild rash, facial rednessand edema, fever, and a transient increase in blood pressure. The amount ofradiation exposure from one brain SPECT study is approximately the same as fromone abdominal X-ray.How is the SPECT procedure done? The patient is placed in a quiet room and asmall intravenous line is started. The patient remains quiet for approximatelyten minutes with his or her eyes open to allow their mental state to equilibrateto the environment. The imaging agent is then injected through the IV. Afteranother short period of time, the patient lies on a table, and the SPECT camerarotates around his or her head. (The patient does not go into a tube.) The timeon the table is approximately fifteen minutes. If a concentration study isordered, the patient returns on another day.Are there alternatives to having a SPECT study? In our opinion, SPECT is themost clinically useful study of brain function. There are other studies, such aselectroencephalograms (EEGs), positron emission tomography (PET), and functionalMRIs (fMRI). PET studies and fMRI are considerably more costly and are performedmostly in the research setting. EEGs, in our opinion, do not provide enoughinformation about the deep structures of the brain to be as helpful as SPECTstudies.Does insurance cover the cost of SPECT studies? Reimbursement by insurancecompanies varies according to your plan. It is often a good idea to check withthe insurance company ahead of time to see if it is a covered benefit.Is the use of brain SPECT imaging accepted in the medical community? Brain SPECTstudies are widely recognized as an effective tool for evaluating brain functionin seizures, strokes, dementia, and head trauma. There are literally hundreds ofresearch articles on these topics. In our clinic, based on our experience forover a decade, we have developed this technology further to evaluate aggressionand nonresponsive psychiatric conditions. Unfortunately, many physicians do notfully understand the application of SPECT imaging and may tell you that thetechnology is experimental, but more than one thousand physicians and mentalhealth professionals in the United States have referred patients to us forscans."},{"pageContent":"GLOSSARYAcetylcholine (ACh) a neurotransmitter involved in memoryformation, mostly excitatory; it has been implicated in problems with muscles,Alzheimer’s disease, and learningAcetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) an amino acid involved in thetransport of fatty acids into the cells’ mitochondria for the purpose ofproducing energy; may be helpful in preventing strokes and heart attacksAlpha-lipoic acid (ALA) a powerful antioxidant that increasesthe potency of many other antioxidantsAlzheimer’s disease (AD) the most common form of dementia;results from beta-amyloid production and neurofibrillary tanglesAntioxidant a substance that helps prevent damage from freeradical formationApolipoprotein E (apoE) gene a gene involved in thedevelopment, maturation, and repair of cell membranes of neurons; helps regulatethe amount of cholesterol and triglycerides in nerve cell membranes.
