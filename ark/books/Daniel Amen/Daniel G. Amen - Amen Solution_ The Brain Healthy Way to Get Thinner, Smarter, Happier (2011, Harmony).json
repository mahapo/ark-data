In it, I revealed that based on our brain imagingwork at the Amen Clinics with tens of thousands of patients from eightydifferent countries over the last twenty years, we have discovered two of themajor secrets why most diets don’t work. And contrary to what you might think,they have nothing to do with your lack of desire to lose weight or yourwillpower. In fact, for some people the harder they try to lose weight, theworse it gets.The first secret is that most weight problems occur between your ears. Sostapling your stomach may, in fact, be working on the wrong organ. Not tomention that ten years after gastric banding surgery, the success rate is adisappointing 31 percent. It is your brain that pushes you away from the tabletelling you that you’ve had enough, and it is your brain that gives youpermission to have that second bowl of ice cream, making you look and feel likea blob. If you want a better body, the first place to always start is by havinga better brain.The second secret, based on our brain imaging work, is that there is not justone brain pattern associated with being overweight; there are at least fivedifferent patterns. Giving everyone the same diet plan will make some peoplebetter and a lot of people worse. Knowing about your own specific brain willmake losing weight and keeping it off a whole lot easier.The response to these revelations has been amazing, and the book vaulted ontothe New York Times bestseller list and stayed there for months. I knew peoplewould respond to the message that their brain and weight are intricatelyconnected and that if you boost your brain you can have a better body. What Iwasn’t prepared for, though, was the deluge of desperate requests from readersasking for more specific help on how to use their brains to lose their bellies.Ever since Change Your Brain, Change Your Body hit cyberspace and store shelves,people have been calling and e-mailing our clinics; posting comments on my blog;and talking to me at book signings, speaking engagements, and other events. Whatthe overwhelming majority of them were begging for was a simple step-by-stepbrain-based program for weight loss.The Amen Solution: The Brain Healthy Way to Lose Weight andKeep It Off is that program.I like to call it weight loss for thoughtful people. This is definitely notweight loss for dummies. As you know, there are a lot of dumb ways to try tolose weight. You may have even tried some of them. You know the kinds of methodsI am talking about—the cookie diet, mustard diet, eat anything you want for anhour a day diet, cabbage soup diet, part-time diet (one day on, one day off),grapefruit diet, baby food diet, liquid diet, juice detox diet, coconut oildiet, ice cube diet, ice cream diet, grape diet, eat only one kind of food permeal diet, caveman diet, red wine diet, pizza diet, one-day diet, three-daydiet, seven-day diet, peanut butter diet, and even the tapeworm diet (yes, somepeople are actually willing to swallow a tapeworm to try to lose weight). Thesetypes of gimmicky diets promise fast results—“Lose 10 pounds in seven days!”—butare more likely to set you up for failure in the long run.My favorite story about dumb ways to lose weight came from one of my publictelevision appearances. When I got to one of the stations for a live on-airappearance, a colleague I will call Jim, with whom I had worked before, lookedthinner. I asked Jim what he was doing. He told me he was on the hCG diet. Humanchorionic gonadotropin is a pregnancy hormone that, in conjunction with a500-calorie-a-day diet (yikes!), has been reported to help people with rapidweight loss. The placebo-controlled studies with hCG have been less thanimpressive. Nonetheless, my friend did very well on the diet, losing 20 pounds.It is a diet you can only do for twenty-six days at a time because people seemto become immune to its effects. On the last day of the diet, as a way tocelebrate his weight loss, Jim told me he called his favorite deep-dish pizzarestaurant in Chicago and ordered two large deep-dish pizzas that he planned togorge on over the weekend.When he told me this story, I looked at him like he was the dumbest person onthe planet. “You’re kidding me, right?” I asked as I looked into his eyes.“No, why?” he replied defensively.“You are acting like an alcoholic who just got out of rehab, and as a way tocelebrate, you are going to get drunk!” Not exactly a sign of intelligent life.When I saw him several months later, he had put back on all the weight he hadlost.THE AMEN SOLUTION FOR ANXIETY AND DEPRESSIONALSO HELPS YOUR WEIGHTThe seeds for this book came from two projects at the Amen Clinics. First, a fewyears ago I wrote a twelve-week home study course for conquering anxiety anddepression, using principles I had been teaching for years at the Amen Clinics.There is good scientific evidence that many people can improve their mood anddecrease their level of anxiety by implementing specific strategies at home.When I was on the follow-up calls with our ninety participants, the majority ofpeople told me they felt less anxious and less depressed, which I had expected,but what I didn’t expect was that some people told me that they had also lost10, 20, and even 30 pounds in the twelve weeks and found that their memory andfocus were better as well. In listening to those calls I had an “aha” moment andrealized that with a better brain you also get a better body and a better mind.Science backs up this discovery. Research presented at the annual meeting of theSociety of Ingestive Behavior in 2009 found that depressed patients who followeda six-month behavioral weight-loss program not only lost weight but alsoreported a significant drop in their symptoms of depression. Lose weight, gethappier.AMEN CLINIC NFL BRAIN IMAGING / REHABILITATION PROGRAMHELPS PLAYERS LOSE WEIGHT AND GET SMARTERThe second project that’s helped seed this book is my work in performing theworld’s largest brain imaging / brain rehabilitation study on active and retiredprofessional football players. We have evaluated and treated more than onehundred players. For many years, the NFL has said that it didn’t know if playingprofessional football caused long-term brain damage. After a number of playerscame to see me with dementia, depression, and obesity, I decided to study theirbrains and answer once and for all the question “Does playing football damagethe brain?” The answer, which did not surprise anyone except perhaps some in theNFL, was of course playing professional football causes long-term brain damage.You cannot get hit by guys like Minnesota Viking Ron Yary (6′5″ and 255 pounds)thirty to fifty times a game and not expect to have some trouble.[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_001_r1.jpg]Dr. Amen and Ron YaryBut the exciting news is that when we put our players on our brain healthyprogram, many of them not only lost weight (one of our players lost over 100pounds), they also got smarter and happier at the same time. Plus, theircognitive scores improved, sometimes by 200, 300, or even 400 percent.Here is an example: Big Ed White, age sixty-two, a four-time Pro Bowl offensiveguard for the Minnesota Vikings and later for the San Diego Chargers, playedseventeen seasons in the National Football League. When I first met Ed heweighed 365 pounds and scored very poorly on his cognitive testing profile. Allof our players take a test called the Microcog, which measures intellectualfunctioning in nine different areas, including overall general cognitivefunctioning, information processing speed, attention, reasoning, and memory. Hescored very poorly. After six months on our brain healthy / weight-loss program,he had lost 40 pounds, and his test scores increased dramatically (see below).[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_002_r1.jpg]Dr. Amen and Big Ed White[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_003_r1.gif]Our research with the NFL players also demonstrated what other researchers hadfound: As your weight goes up, your brainpower goes down. Below is a graph ofwhat happens to our players’ reasoning scores as their weight—measured by bodymass index (BMI)—goes up. It should make anyone be concerned about their weight.Research has clearly shown that obesity increases your risk for Alzheimer’sdisease and other forms of dementia. Plus, Cyrus Raji’s group at the Universityof Pittsburgh found that the brains of overweight people—people with a BMIbetween 25 and 30—had 4 percent less volume than the brains of people with lowerBMIs, and their brains looked eight years older than healthy people’s. Peoplewho were obese—people with a BMI over 30 (Ed White’s BMI when he first came tosee us was 45) had 8 percent less brain volume, and their brains looked sixteenyears older than healthy people’s.[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_004_r1.gif]THE PROMISE AND THE PROGRAMIn this book I will give you the basic steps to boost your brain to becomethinner, smarter, and happier at the same time. I will give you a ten-weekprogram to get started. This is the same program we use at the Amen Clinics, andthe same program we use with our NFL players. Take note that we started ourweight-loss pilot program on December 1, and everybody told us we were crazy toconduct a weight-loss study over the holidays when most people tend to gainweight. But we wanted to make sure our program could stand up to real-lifechallenges, like holiday feasts and treats. It did. Our group actually lost onaverage 2.8 pounds during the week of Christmas! On average, our participantslose 10 pounds in ten weeks. (Note that individual results may vary.) Many ofour participants have lost much, much more. * Eileen, fifty-five, lost 15 pounds in ten weeks, but after three ten-week cycles she lost 39 pounds, and she reported that she felt happier and smarter. “It made a big change in my whole life.” * Dan lost 39 pounds in ten weeks, 50 pounds after his second ten-week cycle, and a total of 69 pounds after his third ten-week program and reports he is happier and in much more control of his whole life. He told us, “This diet was so much easier than the ones in the past because the cravings were actually gone.” * John lost 35 pounds in ten weeks and says he is a happier, more fun person to be around. * Amy lost four pant sizes and said it was much easier than she suspected it would be. She tells her friends that healthy food is medicine. * Betty lost 16 pounds and says when she goes out to eat with her husband they get one plate and split it, and when she walks out of the restaurant she no longer feels stuffed and stupid. * Rhona was already at a healthy weight to start and took the course just to support a friend, but she ended up losing 5½ pounds after ten weeks and then another 4 pounds after the following ten-week program. She said, “This has changed my life. I thought when I took the course I might learn something and lose a pound or two, but I never thought it would change my life. And personally for me, when I am shopping, I now think, does this feed my brain? That was something I had never thought of before.”Throughout the pages of this book, you will learn much more about these and manyother participants in our weight-loss program, including several of our NFLplayers. In “The Amen Solution All-Stars” profiles, these real-life people willshare their personal journeys to a slimmer shape, greater happiness, andimproved brain function. I hope their stories will inspire and motivate you.You will also find “Get Smart to Get Thinner” boxes with thoughtful tips,strategies, insights, and success stories from the everyday people who have beensuccessfully losing weight with this program. These quotes come from ourweight-loss program participants as well as people who have posted comments onmy blog or posted online reviews of my book Change Your Brain, Change Your Body.I have changed their names to protect their privacy and have edited some of thequotes for space and clarity.Why ten weeks to start? You need at least seventy days to change bad habits andto start solidifying good ones. However, this is not a ten-week program. This isa program to get control of your brain and your body for the rest of your life.Ten weeks is just a start. If you act like hCG, Chicago deep-dish pizza Jim inthe story relayed earlier, you will never get it right.

That reallyirked me. I would think to myself, “Hey, give me a summary! Make this easy forme. I want to get started today.” So here is the Amen Solution, in as simplelanguage as possible to help you get started today. The Amen Solution is abrain-centered weight-loss program designed to help you get thinner, smarter,and happier at the same time. The rest of the book explains everything you needto know to make this happen in more detail. 1. Know your important numbers. 2. Know your motivation to get healthy. 3. Eat right to think right and keep track of what you eat. 4. Know your brain type. 5. Take brain healthy supplements. 6. Learn nine secrets to conquering your cravings. 7. Rev your metabolism. 8. Kill the ANTs. 9. Practice directed focus. 10. Bust your barriers.1. KNOW YOUR IMPORTANT NUMBERSWhen it comes to the health of your brain and body, there are some numbers thatare critical to know. When some of these numbers are out of whack, it canprevent you from losing weight, keep you in the dumps, and reduce brainfunction. Optimizing these numbers can be one of the keys to helping you achieveyour weight-loss goals, feel happier, and boost your brainpower. The AmenSolution will help you optimize these numbers throughout the first ten weeks onthe program and beyond. Here are some important numbers you need to know tomaintain a healthy brain and body.As you begin your journey, it is a good idea to take stock of your numbers. Thenat the end of the ten weeks, check these numbers again to see how much progressyou have made. You can track your numbers in our Change Your Brain, Change YourBody Daily Journal or online on our website.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“It works! Optimize your brain … and willpower, priorities, and focus are yours!I’ve lost 35 pounds and I’m looking at losing another 25, and I know I can doit!”—AllieBODY MASS INDEXThis number tells you the health of your weight based on your height. A normalBMI score is between 18.5 and 24.9; between 25 and 29.9 is overweight; between30 and 39.9 is obese; and over 40 is morbidly obese. As I mentioned in theintroduction, Dr. Cyrus Raji and colleagues from the University of Pittsburghfound that people who were overweight, who had a BMI between 25 and 30, had 4percent less brain tissue and their brains looked eight years older thanhealthy-weight people! People who were obese, who had a BMI over 30, had 8percent less brain tissue, and their brains looked sixteen years older thanhealthy-weight people!To be healthy, happy and smart, you have to get your BMI under control. For afree BMI calculator, go to www.amenclinic.com [http://www.amenclinic.com].One of the reasons why I want my patients to know their BMI is that it stopsthem from lying to themselves about their weight. I was sitting at dinnerrecently with a friend who seemed totally indifferent about his weight, eventhough he was injecting himself with insulin for his diabetes at the table. Aswe were talking, I calculated his BMI for him. Trust me, I can be a veryirritating friend if I think you are not taking care of yourself. His BMI wasjust over 30, in the obese range. That really got his attention, and since thenhe has lost 20 pounds and is more committed to getting healthy. The truth willset you free. Know your BMI.WAIST-TO-HEIGHT RATIOAnother way to measure the health of your weight is called your waist-to-heightratio (WHtR). Some researchers believe this number is even more accurate thanyour BMI. BMI does not take into account an individual’s frame, gender, or theamount of muscle mass versus fat mass. For example, two people can have the sameBMI, even if one is much more muscular and carrying far less abdominal fat thanthe other; this is because BMI does not account for differences in fatdistribution.The WHtR is calculated by dividing waist size by height and takes gender intoaccount. As an example, a male with a 32-inch waist who is 5’10″ (70 inches)would divide 32 by 70, to get a WHtR of 45.7 percent. The WHtR is thought togive a more accurate assessment of health since the most dangerous place tocarry weight is in the abdomen. Fat in the abdomen, which is associated with alarger waist, is metabolically active and produces various hormones that cancause harmful effects, such as diabetes, elevated blood pressure, and alteredlipid (blood fat) levels.Many athletes, both male and female, who often have a higher percentage ofmuscle and a lower percentage of body fat, have relatively high BMIs, but theirWHtRs are within a healthy range. This also holds true for women who have a“pear” rather than an “apple” shape.The following chart helps you determine if your WHtR falls in a healthy range(these ratios are percentages):WOMEN * Ratio less than 35: Abnormally slim to underweight * Ratio 35 to 41.9: Extremely slim * Ratio 42 to 48.9: Healthy * Ratio 49 to 53.9: Overweight * Ratio 54 to 57.9: Seriously overweight * Ratio over 58: Highly obeseMEN * Ratio less than 35: Abnormally slim to underweight * Ratio 35 to 42.9: Extremely slim * Ratio 43 to 52.9: Healthy * Ratio 53 to 57.9: Overweight * Ratio 58 to 62.9: Seriously overweight * Ratio over 63: Highly ObeseGET SMART TO GET THINNER“I started out in a 2X then went down to a 1X to an XL to an L. Now I’m wearingthe same pants size I was in high school.”—LisaKNOW YOUR DAILY CALORIC NEEDS TO MAINTAIN CURRENT BODY WEIGHTI think of calories like money. Wise caloric spending is a critical component togetting healthy. Don’t let anyone tell you that calories don’t count. Theyabsolutely do. The people who say calories don’t matter are just foolingthemselves. You need to know how many calories you need to eat a day to maintainyour current weight. The average fifty-year-old woman needs about 1,800calories, and the average fifty-year-old man needs about 2,200 calories a day.This number can go up or down based on exercise level and height. You can find afree personalized “caloric need” calculator at www.amenclinics.com[http://www.amenclinics.com].DESIRED WEIGHTSet a realistic goal for your desired weight and match your behavior to reachit. If you wish to lose a pound a week, you typically need to eat 500 calories aday less than you burn. I am not a fan of rapid weight loss. It does not teachyou how to live for the long term. One of my patients went on the hCG diet Itold you about in the introduction and lost 40 pounds in three twenty-six daycycles, but it was at a pretty high cost. Within the next six months, she putall the weight back on plus 10 more pounds. Slow and steady teaches you newhabits. At the Amen Clinics our average weight loss in our groups is 10 poundsin ten weeks, but individual results may vary. That helps people be moreconsistent for the long term.KNOW THE DAILY CALORIES YOU CONSUME (STOMP OUT CALORIE AMNESIA!)For the next ten weeks keep a food log and count every calorie that goes intoyour body. This is just like keeping a budget. If you keep this log, togetherwith the other parts of the program, it will be a major step forward in gettingcontrol of your brain and body for the rest of your life. If you don’t know thecalories of something, don’t eat it. Why are you going to let someone elsesabotage your health? Ignorance is not bliss. It increases your chances for anearly death.You need to learn to weigh and measure food and really look at the food labelsfor portion size. What the cereal companies think is a portion size may not beanywhere near what your eyes think. When you actually do this, I can promise youit will be a rude awakening. I know it was for me. Upon keeping track of hiscalories, one of our NFL players wrote, “I had no idea of the self-abuse I wasdoing to my body!”KNOW THE NUMBER OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES A DAY YOU EAT—COUNT THEMEat more vegetables than fruits and try to get that number to between five andten servings to enhance your brain and lower your risk for cancer.KNOW THE NUMBER OF HOURS YOU SLEEP AT NIGHTDon’t fool yourself into thinking you only need a few hours of sleep. I used tothink that I was “special” because I could get by on four or five hours of sleepat night, until I actually read the research. Then I realized I was just dumb.Getting fewer than seven hours of sleep at night is associated with loweroverall blood flow to the brain, more cravings, and more fat on your body. Nowonder I had trouble losing the extra 20 pounds. Even worse, having chronicinsomnia triples your risk of death from all causes. Strive to get seven or,even better, eight hours of sleep every night. Teenagers need to get at leastnine hours a night.GET SCREENING LABORATORY TESTS AND YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE TESTED TO OPTIMIZE YOURBRAIN AND BODYHere are tests I order at the Amen Clinics for our weight-loss groups. Ask yourhealth care provider to order these as part of a healthy brain/body program. * Complete blood count This will check the health of your blood. People with low blood count can feel anxious and tired, and they may overeat as a way to medicate themselves. People with alcohol problems may have large red blood cells. * General metabolic panel This will check the health of your liver, kidneys, fasting blood sugar, and cholesterol. * Vitamin D level Low levels of vitamin D have been associated with obesity, depression, cognitive impairment, heart disease, reduced immunity, cancer, psychosis, and all causes of mortality. Have your physician check your 25-hydroxy vitamin D level, and if it is low get more sunshine and/or take a vitamin D3 supplement. I have to take 10,000 IUs (international units) of Vitamin D3 a day to keep my levels near high normal.Low: < 30Optimal: 50–90High: > 100 * Thyroid An overactive thyroid can mimic symptoms of anxiety that make you want to eat as a way to calm down. Having low thyroid levels decreases overall brain activity, which can impair your thinking, judgment, and self-control and make it very hard for you to lose weight. Have your doctor check your free T3 and TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) levels to check for hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism and treat as necessary to normalize. * C-reactive protein This is a measure of inflammation that your doctor can check with a simple blood test. Elevated inflammation is associated with a number of diseases and conditions and should prompt you to eliminate bad brain habits and get thin. Fats cells produce chemicals called cytokines that increase inflammation in your body. * HgA1C This test shows your average blood sugar levels over the past two to three months and is used to diagnose diabetes and prediabetes. Normal results for a nondiabetic person are in the range of 4 to 5.6 percent. Prediabetes is indicated by levels in the 5.7 to 6.4 percent range. Numbers higher than that may indicate diabetes. * DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) and free and total serum testosterone level Low levels of the hormones DHEA and testosterone, for men or women, have been associated with low energy, cardiovascular disease, obesity, low libido, depression, and Alzheimer’s disease. * Blood pressure Have your doctor check your blood pressure at your yearly physical or more often if it is high. High blood pressure is associated with lower overall brain function, which means more bad decisions.KNOW HOW MANY OF THE TWELVE MOST IMPORTANT MODIFIABLE HEALTH RISK FACTORS YOUHAVE, AND THEN WORK TO DECREASE THEMHere is a list from researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health. Circlethe ones that apply to you. * Smoking * High blood pressure * BMI indicating overweight or obese * Physical inactivity * High fasting blood glucose * High LDL cholesterol * Alcohol abuse * Low omega-3 fatty acids * High dietary saturated fat intake * Low polyunsaturated fat intake * High dietary salt * Low intake of fruits and vegetables2. KNOW YOUR MOTIVATION TO GET HEALTHYIn chapter 2 [Amen_9780307463623_epub_c02_r1.htm] we will spend time workingspecifically on motivation. For now, know that in order for you to consistentlymake the right decisions, you must have a burning desire to be healthy. Why doyou care?For me, I have an amazing wife, four wonderful children, and a new grandson,Elias. My grandfather was one of the most important people in my whole life. Iwas named after him and he was my best friend growing up. I know how importantgrandparents can be. The day Elias was born I thought about my grandfather allday long. I want to be healthy to be able to love Elias like my grandfatherloved me. When I really think about what’s important to me, no amount ofcheeseburgers, sodas, or double-fudge chocolate chip brownies is worth the priceof damaging my health and stealing the time I have with my family.You have to focus on your motivation, or food will control you. Brain imagingstudies have shown that many foods that are filled with fat, sugar, and saltactually work on the morphine or heroin centers of our brain and can be totallyaddictive. An animal study from a team of French scientists found that sugar wasactually more addictive than cocaine. Many of my overweight patients act justlike addicts and spend their days either thinking about food, trying not tothink about food, or eating. Many food companies are highly skilled in givingyou that momentary burst of pleasure, but like with any drug, it is an illusionand if you are not careful, you will get hooked. Bet you can’t eat just one!Many people are going bankrupt because they are living in the moment without anythought toward the future. They aren’t using their prefrontal cortex, the areaof the brain involved in planning, judgment, and follow-through, to think aboutthe consequences of their actions. The Power of Now can kill you early. Nooffense to Eckhart Tolle, whom I admire and respect very much, but you need tobe thinking about how your thoughts and behaviors today impact your brain andbody half an hour, a day, a year, ten years, and thirty years from now.Throughout the program, we will work on what motivates you. Is it health, or isit fear? Some people, me included, require fear. I finally lost the extra 20pounds because I kept reading studies like the one I mentioned from theUniversity of Pittsburgh. Given that your brain controls everything you do,including how much love you have in your life and how much money you make, youdo not want a smaller brain!GET SMART TO GET THINNER“After just three weeks, I’m already seeing noticeable improvements. I’m losingweight, sleeping better, and my memory is better.”—LeslieRemember the graph from the introduction, which showed that as your weight goesup your reasoning goes down?The fat on your body is not just a storage place for excess calories. Itpromotes inflammation, which can lead to heart disease, diabetes, andAlzheimer’s disease. Plus, fat stores toxic materials, which can directly damageyour brain. But again, the exciting news is that if you work to get healthy, youcan reverse the brain damage. But the sooner the better!So, you have to ask yourself, “What is my specific motivation to get healthy?”Write it down and put it where you can see it every day. Be positive: I want tolive long, have great energy, look great, be smart. If your motivation is likemine and it involves the people you love, put up their pictures where you cansee them every day. My screensaver is a photo of me with my grandson Elias.Focus on the reasons why you must be healthy every day, or the doughnuts willalways win. And doughnuts don’t make you sexy! Research suggests that getting asugar burst can lower your testosterone levels, for men or for women, by up to25 percent, which decreases your interest in sex. Oh, great! This means thatsharing the cheesecake at the restaurant may mean that no one will get dessertwhen they get home.[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_005_r1.jpg]My screensaver3. EAT RIGHT TO THINK RIGHT AND KEEP TRACK OF WHAT YOU EATFood is medicine and can help you be trim, vibrant, happy, and focused, or itcan make you plump, sluggish, sad, and stupid. It can also help keep you healthyor increase your risk for disease. Did you know that diet accounts for 30 to 35percent of all environmentally caused cancers? According to William Li, M.D.,head of the Angiogenesis Foundation, obesity and cancer are both promoted bysomething called angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is a natural process in which thebody regulates the growth of blood vessels. When this process gets out ofcontrol and too many blood vessels grow, myriad diseases can result, includingcancer, obesity, and Alzheimer’s disease.Stopping the growth of blood vessels could be useful in the treatment of canceror obesity, according to Li. A host of antiangiogenic drugs are already on themarket, but Li and researchers at the Angiogenesis Foundation have alsoidentified numerous foods that are natural angiogenesis inhibitors. Consumingthese foods could play an important role in fighting obesity as well as cancer.Many of the brain healthy foods I write about in this book are alsoantiangiogenic. Some of them include: * Apples * Blackberries * Blueberries * Cherries * Dark chocolate * Garlic * Grapefruit * Green tea * Lemons * Nutmeg * Olive oil * Oranges * Raspberries * Red grapes * Soybeans * Strawberries * Tomatoes * Tuna * TurmericOverall, you want great value for the calories you consume. In chapter 3[Amen_9780307463623_epub_c03_r1.htm] I will go into detail about a brain healthydiet. For now, here are the Amen Clinics Seven Rules for Brain Healthy Eating.RULE 1. THINK HIGH-QUALITY CALORIES IN VERSUS HIGH-QUALITY ENERGY OUT.Don’t let anyone tell you that calories don’t count. They absolutely do. But itis not as simple as calories in versus calories out. I want you to think abouteating mostly “high-quality calories.” One cinnamon roll can cost you 720calories and will drain your brain, whereas a 400-calorie salad made of spinach,salmon, blueberries, apples, walnuts, and red bell peppers will supercharge yourenergy and make you smarter.“High-quality energy out” means you need to rev up your metabolism in a healthyway. Exercise, new learning, and green tea help. Diet pills, sugary caffeinatedenergy drinks, excessive coffee (green tea has half the caffeine as coffee),caffeinated sodas, and smoking are low-quality energy boosters.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I thought I knew all there was to know about dieting and eating right, but Iwas wrong. I lost 3 pounds in one week after making some minor changes that wererecommended in the first few steps of your program. I feel better than ever.”—JeriRULE 2. DRINK PLENTY OF WATER AND NOT TOO MANY OF YOUR CALORIES.Your brain is 80 percent water. Anything that dehydrates it, such as too muchcaffeine or too much alcohol, decreases your thinking and impairs your judgment.Make sure you get plenty of water every day. On a trip to New York City recentlyI saw a poster that read, ARE YOU POURING ON THE POUNDS? DON’T DRINK YOURSELFFAT. I thought it was brilliant. A recent study found that on average Americansdrink 450 calories a day, twice as many as we did thirty years ago. Just addingthe extra 225 calories a day will put 23 pounds of fat a year on your body, andmost people tend to not count the calories they drink.RULE 3. EAT HIGH-QUALITY LEAN PROTEIN EARLIER IN THE DAY.It helps balance your blood sugar, boosts concentration, and provides thenecessary building blocks for brain health. Great sources of protein includefish, skinless turkey or chicken, beans, raw nuts, low-fat or nonfat dairy, andhigh-protein vegetables, such as broccoli and spinach. Did you know that spinachis nearly 50 percent protein? I use it instead of lettuce on my sandwiches for ahuge nutrition boost.RULE 4. EAT LOW-GLYCEMIC, HIGH-FIBER CARBOHYDRATES.This means eating carbohydrates that do not spike your blood sugar and are alsohigh in fiber, such as those found in whole grains, vegetables, and fruits, suchas blueberries and apples. Carbohydrates are not the enemy. They are essentialto your life. Bad carbohydrates are the enemy. These are carbohydrates that havebeen robbed of any nutritional value, such as simple sugars and refinedcarbohydrates. If you want to live without cravings, eliminate these completelyfrom your diet. I like the old saying “The whiter the bread, the faster you aredead.”GET SMART TO GET THINNER“You have to become an expert in reading nutrition labels!”—JohnSugar is not your friend. Sugar increases inflammation in your body, increaseserratic brain-cell firing, and has been recently implicated in aggression. In anew study, children who were given sugar every day had a significantly higherrisk for violence later in life. I don’t agree with the people who say“Everything in moderation.” Consuming cocaine or arsenic in moderation is not agood idea. The less sugar in your life, the better your life will be.RULE 5. FOCUS YOUR DIET ON HEALTHY FATS.Eliminate bad fats, such as all trans fats and most animal fat. Did you knowthat fat stores toxic materials? So when you eat animal fat, you are also eatinganything toxic the animal ate. Yuck. Did you know that certain fats that arefound in pizza, ice cream, and cheeseburgers fool the brain into ignoring thesignals that you should be full? No wonder I used to always eat two bowls of icecream and eight slices of pizza!Focus your diet on healthy fats, especially those that contain omega-3 fattyacids, found in foods like salmon, avocados, walnuts, and green leafyvegetables. High cholesterol levels are not good for your brain. A new studyreports that people who had high cholesterol levels in their forties had ahigher risk of getting Alzheimer’s disease in their sixties and seventies. Butdon’t let your cholesterol levels go too low either. Did you know that lowcholesterol levels have been associated with both homicide and suicide? If I amat a party and someone is bragging to me about their low cholesterol levels, Iam always very nice to that person.RULE 6. EAT FROM THE RAINBOW.This means putting natural foods in your diet of many different colors, such asblueberries, pomegranates, yellow squash, and red bell peppers. This will boostthe antioxidant levels in your body and help keep your brain young. Of course,this does not mean Skittles or jelly beans.RULE 7. COOK WITH BRAIN HEALTHY HERBS AND SPICES TO BOOST YOUR BRAINPOWER.Here is a little food for thought, literally. * Turmeric, found in curry, contains a chemical that has been shown to decrease the plaques in the brain thought to be responsible for Alzheimer’s disease. * In four studies a saffron extract was found to be as effective as antidepressant medication in treating people with major depression. * There is very good scientific evidence that sage helps to boost memory. * Cinnamon has been shown to help attention. It has also been found to help regulate blood sugar levels, which improves brain function and decision making. Research also shows that cinnamon extract can inhibit the aggregation of tau proteins in the brain, which is associated with Alzheimer’s disease. Plus, cinnamon is a natural aphrodisiac for men, not that most men need much help. My wife makes an amazing sweet potato soup with slivered almonds, cranberries, cinnamon, and sage. It makes me smarter and more affectionate at the same time.Journaling is a critical part of our program. Keeping a food journal helps youavoid calorie amnesia. Writing down everything that goes into your body for tenweeks makes you conscious, aware, and more likely to do the right things. It iseasier than ever to do this by using our available journal or an onlinecalorie-counting program. I think journaling what you eat is like keeping acheckbook. It holds you accountable. If you don’t know how much money you arespending, you are much more likely to become bankrupt. If you eat or drink morecalories than you burn, your body will become fat and nutritionally bankrupt.4. KNOW YOUR BRAIN TYPEWhen I first started to do our brain imaging work at the Amen Clinics in 1991 Iwas looking for the one pattern that was associated with depression, attentiondeficit disorder (ADD), or bipolar disorder. But as I soon discovered there wasclearly not one brain pattern associated with any of these illnesses. They allhad multiple types. Of course, I then realized there will never be just onepattern for depression, because not all depressed people are the same. Some arewithdrawn, others are angry, and still others are anxious or obsessive. Thescans helped me understand the type of depression, or ADD, or bipolar disorder aperson had so that I could better target their treatment. This one idea led to adramatic breakthrough in my own personal effectiveness with patients and itopened up a new world of understanding and hope for the tens of thousands ofpeople who have come to the Amen Clinics and the millions of people who haveread my books.As we looked at the brains of our overweight patients, we discovered that againthere was not one brain pattern associated with being overweight; there were atleast five patterns. We saw patterns associated with brains that tended to becompulsive, some were impulsive, others were sad, and still others anxious, invarious combinations. This is exactly the reason why most diets don’t work. Theytake a one-size-fits-all approach, which, based on our brain imaging work, makesabsolutely no sense at all.Take the test questionnaire in appendix A [Amen_9780307463623_epub_app1_r1.htm]of the book to see whether or not you fit into a type or types. If you do, readchapter 4 [Amen_9780307463623_epub_c04_r1.htm] to learn more about your type andwhat you can do about it. Here is a brief summary of each type. Most people willnever need a brain scan to know their type.BRAIN TYPE 1 IS “THE COMPULSIVE OVEREATER”People who are this type tend to get stuck on the thought of food and feelcompulsively driven to eat. They often say that they have no control over foodand tend to be nighttime eaters because they worry and have trouble sleeping.Compulsive overeaters generally have too much activity in the front part oftheir brains, usually due to low levels of a chemical called serotonin, so theyoverfocus and can get stuck on the same thought, such as the ice cream in thefreezer that is calling their name.Caffeine and diet pills usually make people with this type anxious, becausetheir brains do not need more stimulation, and they often feel as though theyneed a glass of wine at night, or two or three, to calm their worries.Compulsive overeaters do best when we find natural ways to increase serotonin.Serotonin is calming to the brain. Physical exercise boosts serotonin as doesusing certain supplements, such as 5-HTP, saffron, inositol, L-tryptophan, orSt. John’s Wort. There is good scientific evidence that 5-HTP(5-hydroxytryptophan) can be helpful for weight loss, and in my experience, Ihave found it to be especially helpful for this type.BRAIN TYPE 2 IS “THE IMPULSIVE OVEREATER”People with this type have poor impulse control, get distracted easily, and justreach for food without thinking. Their brain scans show low activity in thefront part of the brain in an area called the prefrontal cortex. Think of theprefrontal cortex like the brain’s brake. It stops us from saying stupid thingsor making bad decisions. It is the little voice in your head that helps youdecide between the banana and the banana split.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I have taken your test, and it has been revealed that I am probably animpulsive overeater. Tears came to my eyes because my prayers have been answeredjust to know that the reason I am having difficulty reaching my goal weight isbecause I have been using the wrong approach.”—LanaImpulsive overeating is common among people who have attention deficit disorder(ADD), which has been associated with low dopamine levels in the brain. Peoplewith ADD struggle with a short attention span, distractibility, disorganization,and impulsivity. Research suggests that having untreated ADD nearly doubles therisk for being overweight. And, without proper treatment, it is nearlyimpossible for these people to be consistent with any nutrition plan. Overweightsmokers and heavy coffee drinkers also tend to fit this type.We help impulsive overeaters by boosting dopamine levels in the brain andstrengthening the prefrontal cortex. Higher-protein, lower-carbohydrate dietstend to help, as does exercise and certain stimulating medications orsupplements, such as green tea or L-tyrosine. Any supplement or medicine thatcalms the brain, such as 5-HTP, typically makes this type worse because it canlower both your worries and your impulse control.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I found out that the supplements I had been taking for years might not be thebest for my brain type. So I switched and am doing much better.”—KarenBRAIN TYPE 3 IS A COMBINATION OF TYPES 1 AND 2 AND IS CALLED “THEIMPULSIVE-COMPULSIVE OVEREATER”On the surface, it seems almost contradictory. How can you be both impulsive andcompulsive at the same time? Think of compulsive gamblers. These are people whoare compulsively driven to gamble and yet have very little control over theirimpulses. It is the same with these overeaters. Our scans tend to show too muchactivity in the brain’s gear shifter, so people overthink and get stuck onnegative thoughts, but they also have too little activity in the prefrontalcortex so they have trouble supervising their own behavior. People with thistype benefit from treatments that increase both serotonin and dopamine, such asexercise with a combination of supplements like 5-HTP and green tea.BRAIN TYPE 4 IS “THE SAD OR EMOTIONAL OVEREATER”People with this type overeat to medicate their feelings of sadness and to calmthe emotional storms in their brains. They often struggle with depression, lowenergy, low self-esteem, and pain symptoms, and they tend to gain weight inwinter. Their brain scans tend to show too much activity in the limbic oremotional part of the brain. For this type, exercise, fish oil, optimizing theirvitamin D level, and certain supplements, such as SAMe (S-adenosylmethionine)can be very helpful to balance the brain, improve your mood, help with energy,and decrease pain.BRAIN TYPE 5 IS “THE ANXIOUS OVEREATER”People with this type medicate their feelings of anxiety or nervousness withfood. They often complain of waiting for something bad to happen and frequentlysuffer from headaches and stomach problems. Their brain scans often show toomuch activity in an area called the basal ganglia. This part of the brain isinvolved in setting a person’s anxiety level. When there is too much activityhere, because of low levels of a chemical called GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid),people often have anxiety and a lot of physical tension. The best treatment forthis type is to soothe the brain with meditation and hypnosis, plus using acombination of vitamin B6, magnesium, and GABA.It is common to have more than one brain type. If that is true for you, work onthe most bothersome brain type first and then go on to the others. I willaddress this issue later in the book.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I immediately started taking supplements based on my brain type. I feel 100percent better about myself. I’ve lost 6 pounds in two weeks and am better ableto stay focused.”—Selita5. TAKE BRAIN HEALTHY SUPPLEMENTSAccording to recent studies, more than half of Americans do not eat at leastfive servings of fruits and vegetables a day, the minimum required to get thenutrition you need. I recommend that all of my patients take a good multiplevitamin/mineral supplement every day plus omega-3 fatty acids. When weight is anissue, I recommend supplements that can help with cravings (more on this in abit) and ones that may benefit your specific type of brain. The thoughtful useof supplements is an essential part of a healthy brain plan.For example, according to researchers at the Harvard School of Public Healthmentioned above, having low levels of omega-3 fatty acids is one of the leadingpreventable causes of death and has been associated with heart disease, strokes,depression, suicidal behavior, ADD, dementia, and obesity. Taking fish oil, agood source of omega-3s, has been found to be good for your heart, your skin,your eyes, your joints, your hair, and your brain. In a recent study, takingomega-3s has also been found to decrease your appetite and your cravings. Myrecommendation for most adults is to take between 1–2 g (grams) of high-qualityfish oil a day. When we put our retired football players on our fish oilsupplements, many of them were able to decrease or completely eliminate theirpain medications.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“It’s been about three weeks since I watched your public television special, andI have started making some simple changes in my life. I’ve started taking somesupplements (a multivitamin, vitamin D, calcium, and fish oil) and making sure Ieat breakfast every day. Now I’m feeling that being genuinely happy isattainable.”—SandyAnother critical supplement is vitamin D. Low levels of vitamin D have beenassociated with depression, Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, heartdisease, diabetes, cancer, and obesity. When you don’t have enough vitamin D,you feel hungry all the time, no matter how much you eat. Typically, we get avitamin D boost from the sun, but because we are wearing more sunscreen andspending more time inside in front of our computers, our levels are falling andour health is at greater risk. And it is an easy fix. Have your doctor order atest called 25-hydroxy vitamin D, and take vitamin D3 if your levels are low. Ofcourse, supplements will never work by themselves if you eat too much or do notexercise. To be smart, you have to do the whole program, including knowing yourbrain type. There is much more on the thoughtful use of supplements later in thebook.6. LEARN NINE SECRETS TO CONQUERING YOUR CRAVINGSAs already mentioned, fish oil and vitamin D can help decrease your cravings.Here are some of the nine ways brain science can help.KEEP YOUR BLOOD SUGAR BALANCEDLow blood sugar levels are associated with lower overall brain activity. Lowbrain activity means more cravings and more bad decisions. The supplementsalpha-lipoic acid and chromium have very good scientific evidence that they helpbalance blood sugar levels and can help with cravings. In addition: * Eat a healthy breakfast. People who maintain weight loss eat a nutritious breakfast. * Have smaller meals throughout the day. * Stay away from simple sugars and refined carbohydrates, such as candy, sodas, cookies, crackers, white rice, and white bread.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“You have changed my life forever! Just a year ago, I weighed in excess of 550pounds. Within six months, I am down to under 400 pounds and am still goingstrong.”—RichardKILL THE SUGAR OR IT WILL KILL YOUHigh-sugar, high-fat foods work on the addiction centers of your brain. When Ifinally got this idea through my own thick skull it made a huge difference forme. I love living without cravings. But for years I fought the idea of giving upsweets, like candy or Rocky Road ice cream. I thought it was simply aboutcalories in versus calories out. If I stayed within a certain calorie range, Iwould be fine. The problem was that eating the sugar activated my cravings andmade it very hard to stay away from things that were bad for me.Sweets are mood foods for me. My grandfather was a candy maker and my bestmemories growing up were standing at the stove next to him making fudge orpralines. But my grandfather was also overweight and had two heart attacks thattook him away from me way too early. I know that kicking the sugar habit isn’teasy for many people. It is like kicking a drug, and it certainly wasn’t easyfor me. But I found that when I substituted brain healthy fruit likeblueberries, bananas, and apples, the cravings completely went away. Have youever known someone to eat too many bananas? For most people, it takes about twoweeks of completely avoiding sugar for your cravings to go away.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I have begun making permanent changes in my life and am already noticing adramatic difference! My moods have improved and I’ve already noticed an increasein my energy level.”—CarolineDECREASE THE ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS IN YOUR DIETWe think of these sweeteners as free, because they have no calories, but becausethey are up to six hundred times sweeter than sugar they may activate theappetite centers of the brain, making you crave even more food. Diet sodas arenot the answer. The one natural no-calorie sweetener I like is called stevia,but it should still be used sparingly.DAILY STRESS-MANAGEMENT PROGRAMAnything stressful can trigger certain hormones that activate your cravings,making you believe that you need that cinnamon roll. Meditation and hypnosis arewonderful stress-management practices that can help boost your brain anddecrease your stress and your weight. More on these shortly.OUTSMART THOSE SNEAKY FOOD TRIGGERS THAT TRY TO SABOTAGE YOU NEARLY EVERYWHEREYOU GOIf you go to the mall, the airport, or the ball game, you will see store afterstore and vendor after vendor selling things that will make you fat and unhappy.For example, whenever I went to the movies, I used to immediately think aboutgetting a big tub of popcorn with lots of butter along with red licorice until Iactually thought about the saturated fat, salt, sugar, and artificial dye thatwould be flooding my brain. To control your cravings, you have to control yourtriggers. Know your vulnerable times and plan ahead. I take a snack with me whenI go to the movies so that I am not tempted by the popcorn and candy.HIDDEN FOOD ALLERGIES CAN ALSO TRIGGER CRAVINGS AND MAKE YOU FATFor example, did you know that wheat gluten and milk allergies can decreaseblood flow to the brain and decrease your judgment? In chapter 6[Amen_9780307463623_epub_c06_r1.htm], I will show you how to use a simpleelimination diet to know what foods you may or may not be sensitive to.7. REV YOUR METABOLISMPhysical and mental exercise are two critical components of our plan and will beexplored in detail later. For now, walk at least four times a week forforty-five minutes and try to learn something new every day.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“When you eat healthy brain food, get rid of the ANTs, and meditate, thenexercise and hunger control become easy.”—Stephen8. KILL THE ANTSBeing overweight or being unhappy are “thinking disorders,” not just eating ormood disorders. ANTs stands for “automatic negative thoughts,” the thoughts thatcome into your mind automatically and ruin your day. I think of these negativethoughts like ANTs that infest your psyche and ruin your body. You need todevelop an internal ANTeater to patrol the streets of your mind. Most peopledon’t know that their thoughts can lie. For most of us, they typically lie alot. And it is your uninvestigated thoughts that will kill you early.Many of our retired NFL players are obese when they first enter our study. Oneof my favorite players, Big Ed White from the Minnesota Vikings, weighed 365pounds when I first met him. When I asked him about his weight, he told me thathe had no control over his eating. That was his automatic response: “I have nocontrol.” “Is that true?” I asked. “You really have no control over youreating?”He paused and said, “No. That really isn’t true … I do have some control.”“But just by thinking that you have no control,” I said, “you have just givenyourself permission to eat anything you want at any time you want.”Another obese player told me that he just didn’t like any of the foods that werehealthy for him. “Is it really true,” I countered, “that you don’t like any ofthem?” I then showed him a list of our fifty best brain healthy foods, and infact, he liked about 60 percent of them.Another player told me that everyone in his family was overweight. It was justhis genetics. “Is that true?” I pressed. “Are you saying that this reallydoesn’t have anything to do with how much you eat? My genes say I am supposed tobe fat too. Your genes are not your destiny.” He then looked at me and said,“That’s a pretty lame excuse, isn’t it?”It is the little lies that you tell yourself, like “I have no control” or “It ismy genetics,” that make you fat and steal your health and happiness. One of themost important steps in winning the battle of the bulge is to get control ofyour mind. In chapter 8 [Amen_9780307463623_epub_c08_r1.htm] we will go intoANT-killing techniques in great detail. For now, whenever you feel anxious, sad,obsessive, or out of control, write down the automatic thoughts that are goingthrough your mind. The act of writing them down helps to get them out of yourhead. Then ask yourself if the thoughts make sense, if they are really true. Forexample, if you hear yourself thinking, “I have no control,” write that down.Then ask yourself, “Is it true? If someone held a gun to my head, would I stillreally have to eat that piece of French apple pie?”You do not have to believe every stupid thought that goes through your brain.This method of challenging your thoughts to help your weight is backed by strongscientific evidence. Researchers from Sweden found that the people who weretrained to talk back to their negative thoughts lost 17 pounds in ten weeks andcontinued to lose weight over eighteen months, proving this technique works overthe long term.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“By following the steps in this program, I am consistently losing weight, and Ifeel so much better!”—Jason9. PRACTICE DIRECTED FOCUSThere is very good scientific evidence that when you add hypnosis or meditationto a healthy weight-loss program, you can improve the outcome. For those of youwith a busy mind, like mine, both hypnosis and meditation can calm your thoughtsand increase self-control. In one study that we performed at the Amen Clinicssponsored by the Alzheimer’s Research & Prevention Foundation, we found that avery simple twelve-minute meditation boosted blood flow to the front part of thebrain, which enhances judgment and decision making.Likewise, I have found few things as immediately helpful as hypnosis to changebehavior and help understand the emotional reasons for overeating. If you haveexperienced emotional trauma, then hypnosis, meditation, and psychotherapy canbe very helpful. A set of hypnosis CDs and meditation exercises can be found atwww.amenclinics.com [http://www.amenclinics.com].10. BUST YOUR BARRIERSTo be successful at boosting weight loss, happiness, and IQ, it is critical toovercome the barriers that derail success. In chapter 10[Amen_9780307463623_epub_c10_r1.htm] I will show you how to prevent relapse andnot allow others to make you fat and stupid. I will also give you a plan on whatdo to after you get to your ideal weight. For now do not let yourself get: * Too hungry (keep a balanced blood sugar) * Too angry (losing control of your emotions will often trigger overeating) * Too lonely (humans do better when they have the company and support of others) * Too tired (good sleep is essential to getting control of your appetite, cravings, and brain health)GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I have been struggling with weight loss for the past eight years. I have triedeverything from diet pills to hypnosis. With this program though, I went from251 pounds to 228 pounds in eight weeks.”—PetraNow that you have the general outline of the program, meet Dan, one of the AmenSolution All-Stars, to show you how he puts it all together.THE AMEN SOLUTION ALL-STARS: DAN[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_006_r1.jpg]Dan, fifty-five, used to think about food all day long! That’s very common amongType 1 Compulsive Overeaters like him. Before the program, he really had no cluehow many calories a day he ate and suffered from intense cravings for thingslike bread, potatoes, New York steak, and chili. “Just driving down the road,McDonald’s would call out to me,” he admitted.He tried diet after diet, but nothing ever worked, and he couldn’t curb hiscravings. Now he understands why. “Some of the diet programs were really goodrah-rah fun, but they sold so many products with ingredients like enrichedflour, sugar, and artificial sweeteners. Through this program, I’ve learned thateating those things actually increases cravings,” he said. Dan was so frustratedby his inability to lose weight he was actually considering getting LAP-BANDsurgery. Then he heard about our weight-loss group.When he joined the Amen Solution program, he weighed 274 pounds and hisshort-term goal was just to “keep from putting on more weight during theholidays.” He did far more than that! He lost 50 pounds in just two ten-weekcycles and a total of 69 pounds after three ten-week cycles, bringing him downto 205 pounds.He accomplished this, in part, by knowing his important numbers, including hisBMI, which was 38 when he started. As I write this book, his BMI is down to 28.For Dan, discovering his brain type and understanding underlying problems wereother big steps in solving his weight struggle. With the tools in this program,he said he has “learned to combat the compulsion, anxiety, and mood swings thathave caused my overeating.” And for the first time in his life, he said, “Therefrigerator has stopped calling me.”Dan really got the message of “high-quality calories in versus high-qualityenergy out.” He counts his calories in the Daily Journal and weighs his food. Hefocuses on healthy foods that add great value to his body. He has cut out simplesugars and artificial sweeteners and uses the natural sweetener stevia instead.He stopped drinking caffeine and alcohol and is now exercising on a regularbasis. He takes a multiple vitamin, fish oil, vitamin D, and our Craving Controlformula, which he says “takes the edge off dieting.” He also loves our Focus &Energy Optimizer supplement as a replacement for caffeine.He also started eating breakfast every day. “I used to get up and have coffee,but I wouldn’t eat anything. It wouldn’t faze me until I was starving to deathand then would pound down a huge lunch,” he said. “Now I make sure to eatsomething every morning—a banana, an apple, a little oatmeal, just something. Iend up eating less throughout the day.”Dan has also discovered how to modify his old favorite fat-filled recipes tomake them more brain healthy. “I love chili, but now I make it with organictomatoes, pinto beans, and portobello mushrooms instead of ground beef. Iactually like it better than the way I used to make it,” he said.Weight loss isn’t the only thing Dan gained from his new brain healthy habits.He said he now feels healthier and more alert, and his memory has improved. Hesaid he has even gotten his temper under control. “I’ve noticed that the roadrage I used to feel while driving has gone way down.”"},{"pageContent":"[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_L04_r1.jpg]“I don’t have time.”“I don’t have the energy to exercise.”“I don’t like any of the foods that are healthy for me.”“I feel bad when I eat right. I just want the ice cream, pizza, andcheeseburgers too much.”“I’ll start tomorrow, or Monday, or next week, or next month … if I ever reallyget sick.”“I can’t keep a food journal.”“I have no control over what I eat.”“My family won’t support me.”Sound familiar? Most of us are experts at coming up with excuses why we can’tchange our behavior. Change is hard. At first, any change is challenging, whichis why most people do not do it. Our brains resist change. When we do the “sameold things” our brains can basically cruise on autopilot without much effort.Our brains get comfortable with our daily habits and routines, even if they areunhealthy for us. For us to change our habits, the brain has to be rewired anddevelop a whole new system, and it fights that process. That’s why even thoughyou know that you should stop gorging on the French fries, you don’t do it.But change is not as hard as you think. For me, I found that when I did thiswhole program, the change actually came easily and gradually. I lost 20 poundsover about twenty weeks. I like the idea of slow weight loss (even for theimpatient among us), because if you do it slowly, then it is becoming part of alifestyle change that you can maintain. The quick-weight-loss programs cause youto deprive yourself and suffer for a few weeks or months, and then it is back tothe bad habits.You have to follow all ten steps to make this work. Weight will not come off bywishful thinking. You will not be happier by willing yourself so, and youcertainly will not be smarter by just taking a supplement. Getting healthyrequires good planning and focused energy.To make lasting progress, you must know what’s motivating you to be healthy. Whydo you care? For you to break free from the habits that have been keeping youfat, unhappy, and not functioning at your intellectual potential, you must knowyour motivation. Is it to: * Prevent disease? * Live longer? * Be a better role model for your children? * Have greater self-esteem? * Be more confident in bed? * Look younger? * Look better in jeans? * Be able to participate in sports and other activities you used to enjoy? * Have a better relationship with your spouse? * Reverse diabetes, heart disease, or other health risks? * Decrease your risk for Alzheimer’s disease? * Stop beating yourself up about your weight? * Have the confidence to apply for the job you really want? * Impact your emotional and spiritual health?What is your specific motivation to change? Write it down and put it where youcan see it every day. Be positive or use negative reasons, whatever works foryou.Positive reasons might include:“I want to live longer.”“I want to have more energy.”“I want to look great.”“I want to feel better.”“I want to have better relationships.”“I want to be happier and smarter for the long run.”On the negative side, reasons might include:“I want to avoid getting diabetes and having my legs amputated like my dad did.”“I don’t want the kids pointing at me ever again, saying I’m fat.”“I never want to feel like I don’t fit in.”“I want to avoid being embarrassed taking my clothes off in front of myhusband.”If your motivation involves the loved ones in your life, put their pictures upwhere you can see them. Use the “My Motivation” page here or create a personalpage on our website to create your own daily motivation reminder.MY MOTIVATION[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_L16_r1.jpg]PHOTOS[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_007_r1.gif]GET SMART TO GET THINNER“Every day I write down three or four things that motivate me.”—SylviaTHE FIRST STEP TO CHANGE IS PAIN“The day I was diagnosed with diabetes, it scared me so much I stopped eatingsugar.”“When I found out I was pregnant, I was terrified my daughter would grow up tobe miserable and fat like me.”“After I had a heart attack, my doctor told me I had to change my diet.”“My mother died at age fifty-four from a stroke, and I didn’t want to be next.”“When the airline made me buy two seats for my size, I couldn’t take thehumiliation.”“The depression overwhelms me. I have to change.”“My memory is awful and I am afraid it is going to get worse.”For many overweight people, it takes something drastic, like a heart attack or adiagnosis of diabetes, to inspire change. Typically, it is only when yourunhealthy habits cause enough pain in your life that you finally make thedecision to change.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“A huge motivation for me was my brother’s wedding. I knew those family photoswould be forever, and I didn’t want to look like this.”—NikkiYou know how powerful pain can be. On a day when you feel fine, there is no wayyou would spend eight dollars for a bottle of one hundred aspirin, but if youhave a killer headache, you would gladly fork over twenty dollars for a singleone. It is the same with being overweight. Until you are consumed with pain, youwill continue to let the doughnuts or the French fries control you, unless yourbrain works right and you are able to stay focused on what’s motivating you toget healthy.The pain and consequences that inspire change are different for each person. Inyour case, your weight problem may be causing health conditions, self-loathing,relationship troubles, or career roadblocks. In addition, everybody’s thresholdfor pain is different. For example, one person who is 20 pounds overweight mighthear a single unkind comment about their size or a warning from their doctor anddecide to take action. Another individual may balloon up to more than 500 poundsand have endured years of insults and serious health problems before taking thatfirst step to weight loss.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“My knee was causing me problems, and I realized that if I didn’t get rid of theextra weight, it would make my knee worse.”—CurtFor you to change, you need to understand why you are uncomfortable. Only thencan you make the decision to change your brain so you can break free from yourunhealthy behavior.How has being overweight or unhealthy caused you pain? Write it down here or usea separate sheet of paper. Don’t leave anything out no matter how trivial youmay believe it to be. When you have your list, mark the things that have beenthe most hurtful, that brought you the most shame, or that you want to make sureyou never experience again.THE PAIN I HAVE FELT FROM BEING OVERWEIGHT[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_L16_r1.jpg]HOPE IS HEALINGHope is what makes you believe that you can change and that your weight, andyour life, will be better if you succeed in giving up your bad habits. Withoutit, you will never take that first step to change or be able to follow a programlong enough to create lasting weight loss.How do you find that hope? Sometimes it can be generated by someone yourespect—a teacher, a pastor, a doctor, or an author. My hope is that this bookand the many success stories it contains will infuse you with hope so you willstick with the Amen Solution and boost your brain to be thinner, smarter, andhappier. I have seen this program work for so many people, and I know it canwork for you too.What are the things that fill you with hope? Create a list of people, books,songs, and anything else that makes you feel hopeful about your ability tochange your ways.MY HOPE LIST[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_L16_r1.jpg]FIND SOMETHING YOU LOVE MORE THAN FOOD—STARTING WITH YOUR BRAINFinding the motivation to take that first step is one thing. Staying motivatedthroughout your weight-loss journey is another. One of the keys to stayingmotivated is finding something you can be passionate about that keeps youfeeling energized and excited. Of course, this does not mean a passion fordouble-bacon cheeseburgers. Many people mistake an addiction to food forpassion. You have to be careful not to get too much pleasure from your passions,or your brain’s reward system could hijack your brain (more on this in chapter 6[Amen_9780307463623_epub_c06_r1.htm]).You need to fall in love with something other than the foods that are making youfat and unhappy, something that serves you. For me, falling in love with mybrain was a critical step. Over the years I have personally had ten brain SPECT,or single photon emission computed tomography, scans to check on the health ofmy own brain. SPECT is one of the main brain imaging studies we do at the AmenClinics. It is a nuclear medicine study that looks at blood flow and activitypatterns in the brain.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“The Amen Solution starts with the brain! No other weight-loss program I’vetried talks about the brain! I wish I would have learned this years ago.”—JacksonLooking back, my earliest scan, taken when I was thirty-seven, showed a toxic,bumpy appearance that was definitely not consistent with great brain function.See the scans below. All my life I have been someone who rarely drank alcohol,never smoked, and never used an illegal drug. Then why did my brain look so bad?Before I understood about brain health, I had many bad brain habits. I ate lotsof fast food, lived on diet sodas, would often get by on four or five hours ofsleep at night. In addition, I worked like a nut, didn’t exercise much, andcarried an extra 20–30 pounds that I had trouble losing.My last scan, at age fifty-two, looks healthier and much younger than my firstscan, even though brains typically become less active with age. Why? Seeingother people’s scans, I developed “brain envy” and wanted mine to be better. AsI learned about brain health, I put into practice what I am teaching you andpreached to my patients. Loving your brain is the first step toward creating abrain healthy life and getting to the weight you want.[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_008_r1.jpg]SPECT is a nuclear medicine study that looks at blood flow and activitypatterns. The scan at the top left is looking at the undersurface of the brain.The scan at the bottom right is looking down from the top. The other two viewslook at the brain from the sides. These are called surface scans because theyare looking at the outside surface of the brain. Here we are looking at the top45 percent of brain activity. Anything below that level shows up as a hole or adent, which means low areas of activity. Notice that my brain scan at agefifty-two looks fuller and less wrinkled. It looks healthier, even though brainsusually look less active with age.Like me, you need to fall in love with your own brain. Practically, this meanshaving the desire to take great care of it, protecting it, nourishing it, andfocusing on its health. Here are four reasons why you need to love your brain.THE BRAIN IS INVOLVED IN EVERYTHING YOU DO.At every moment of every day of your life, your brain heavily influences how youthink, feel, act, and interact with others. It is your brain that pushes youaway from the table telling you that you have had enough, and it is your brainthat gives you permission to have the second piece of cake, making you look andfeel like a blob.WHEN YOUR BRAIN WORKS RIGHT, YOU WORK RIGHT.When your brain is healthy, it makes it much easier to make the right decisionswhen it comes to eating, drinking, and exercising. A healthy brain gets you tobed at a reasonable time so that you can get the rest you need and manages thestress in your life so you don’t feel the need to turn to food for solace.WHEN YOUR BRAIN IS TROUBLED, YOU HAVE TROUBLE IN YOUR LIFE.When your brain is troubled, it creates trouble in every aspect of your life. Itis harder to follow a healthy diet and exercise program and makes you morelikely to fall into bad habits like drinking, smoking, and binge eating.YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR BRAIN AND ENHANCE YOUR LIFE!The best thing about your brain is that it can change. Even if you haven’t beentreating your brain with TLC, you can make it better! By avoiding bad brainhabits and adopting as many good brain habits as possible, you can improve brainfunction and reduce your weight.To stay motivated, find other passions too. What are the things that interestyou in life? Cars? Sports (without head injury risk, of course)? Writing?Reading? Animals? Your kids? Get a piece of paper and write down all the thingsyou love or that make you happy. If you don’t zero in on something right away,don’t get discouraged. Give yourself some time. You may not discover your truepassion until your brain is optimized.NON-FOOD THINGS I LOVE[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_L16_r1.jpg]THE AMEN SOLUTION ALL-STARS: RAY AND NANCYRay White came to see us as part of our NFL study. He played linebacker for theSan Diego Chargers in the early 1970s. One of Ray’s motivations forparticipating in our study was that his wife, Nancy, had been recently diagnosedwith frontal temporal lobe dementia. When we evaluated Ray, he showed evidenceof brain trauma (as did almost all of our retired players), plus he wasoverweight. Nancy’s scans were a disaster. She had severe decreased activity inthe front part of her brain, consistent with the diagnosis of frontal temporallobe dementia.The feedback session, in which I showed them their scans, was very emotional forRay and Nancy—and for me too. We had experience already that showed we couldhelp Ray. But there is no known effective treatment for frontal temporal lobedementia. My bias with cases like Nancy’s is to do everything we can to try toslow or reverse the dementia process. Certainly, it does not always work. Inthis case, I told Ray and Nancy that it was critical to immediately get on abrain healthy program, eat right, stop drinking alcohol, take their supplements,exercise, and I recommended hyperbaric oxygen treatment and neurofeedback forNancy. I also told Ray he needed to start losing weight. His BMI was 31.Ten weeks later I saw them back for their first follow-up visit. This visit wasalso emotional but in a much more positive way. Nancy had followed through onthe recommendations for eating right, taking her supplements, eliminatingalcohol, and she had forty hyperbaric oxygen sessions and sixteen neurofeedbacksessions. She had significantly improved. Her memory and cognitive function werebetter, her personal grooming had improved, and she was doing better taking careof their home. Ray joked that we had to slow down, because soon enough she wouldbe smarter than him. Nancy’s follow up SPECT study showed dramatic improvement(see below). In addition, Ray had lost 30 pounds! He said his motivation was tohelp his wife. If he did everything we suggested, then she would too. They woulddo it as a couple. Sometimes motivation is about love. Ray loved Nancy.Nancy: Frontal Temporal Lobe Dementia[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_009_r1.jpg]Brain SPECT study showing blood flow and activity patterns. This view is lookingdown from the top, where the front part of the brain is at the top of the scanand the back part of the brain is at the bottom. The holes are areas of lowactivity. Notice the dramatic improvement in the front part of her brain.GET IN TOUCH WITH YOUR SPIRITUAL SIDEThis may seem like an odd recommendation to some of you. What does spiritualityhave to do with motivating yourself to stop overeating? You may be surprised todiscover that it can play a very important role in changing your behavior.First, let me explain that when I talk about spirituality here, I am notnecessarily talking about organized religion, although that can be very helpfulfor some people. Think of spirituality in the broader sense of feeling connectedto something greater than yourself, feeling connected to a higher power, feelingconnected to the earth, feeling connected to past generations, feeling connectedto future generations, feeling connected to your community, or feeling connectedto a weight-loss support group.Having a sense of belonging can be an important step in your journey to gethealthy. Many people believe that their weight problems affect no one butthemselves. Wrong! Being overweight or obese can impact your family, yourfriends, your community, and even your place of employment. Being overweight andmiserable can take a terrible toll on your marriage. You are more likely to diean early death—remember, obesity is the third most common preventable cause ofdeath—and leave your spouse alone. Your children may follow in your overeatingfootsteps and develop type 2 diabetes or other health problems. One of mychildhood friends is very overweight. His oldest son is as well. It is clearthat the son adopted his dad’s bad eating habits, which has made it very hardfor him to change, which in turn will affect his own children, and so on. Also,you may get sick and have to go on work disability, adding extra costs for youremployer and our society.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“Writing in this fantastic Daily Journal is holding me very accountable for myfeelings, thoughts, intentions, and food choices.”—VictoriaFeeling connected, rather than alone and isolated, instills a sense ofaccountability. When you feel accountable to a higher power, to your society, toyour family, or to the others in your group, your actions matter, and it becomesimportant to get healthy not only for your own good but also for theirs. Thepeople in our weight-loss groups have said that belonging to the group made themfeel a greater sense of accountability. “I knew they were all counting on me,”said one participant. “I didn’t want to let them down.”There are three specific brain-based reasons why our in-person and online groupprograms are so successful. It is because it provides the three Fs: frontallobes, family and friends (limbic bonding), and fear.FRONTAL LOBES (RULES)The front part of your brain, the prefrontal cortex, is involved with executivefunctions, such as rule-oriented behavior and internal supervision. It is thelittle voice in your head that helps you decide between right and wrong, betweenthe apple and the apple pie. The Amen Solution gives you a very clear set ofguidelines and rules. It gives you structure. I often say it gives people anextra frontal lobe to help supervise their lives.FAMILY AND FRIENDS (LIMBIC BONDING)People who are struggling with weight gain often do not feel a strong connectionto anything or anyone. You may not be fully engaged in your life, and you maythink you must lose the weight before you can really start living your life. Youmay be familiar with these kinds of thoughts: “I want to lose 20 pounds before Istart dating again” or “I don’t fit in with any of the girls at work—they’re allskinny.” But the human brain needs bonding in order to achieve optimalfunctioning. Our in-person and online weight loss groups take on the role of afamily-and-friends support group. This feeds the limbic area of the brain, whichis involved in motivation and mood control.FEAR (WHAT YOU DO HAS CONSEQUENCES)Some people, me included, need fear to spur action. In this program, I introduceyou to the fact that being overweight or obese is not only bad for your physicalhealth, but it is also bad for your brain! (See the section Being Fat Is Bad forYour Brain, which follows.) And I have the brain scans to show you just howdamaging the consequences of obesity can be. Brain imaging is very powerful andcan strike fear in even the most complacent or stubborn people. I have seen ithappen thousands of times. I am hoping that the many brain scans in this bookwill induce some anxiety in you about your weight. A little anxiety can be agreat motivator! Anxiety mixed with frontal lobe help and limbic bonding is theperfect combination for people who want to lose weight.BEING FAT IS BAD FOR YOUR BRAINIf you need more compelling evidence to motivate you to change, consider that in2010 an expert panel declared, “The obesity epidemic is the single biggestthreat to public health in this century.” I would add that obesity is one of thebiggest threats to brain health. Being overweight or obese is terrible for brainfunction. That, at least, is the gloomy conclusion of several recent studies,including the one I mentioned in the introduction from the University ofPittsburgh showing that people who are overweight or obese have smaller brainsthat look older than they really are. * One long-term study of more than sixty-five hundred people in northern California found that those who were fat around the middle at age forty were more likely to succumb to dementia in their seventies. * A 2010 study in the Annals of Neurology found that among healthy middle-aged people, the higher your BMI, and specifically the more belly fat you have, the less total brain volume you have. * A long-term study in Sweden found that compared with thinner people, those who were overweight in their forties experienced a more rapid and more pronounced decline in brain function over the next several decades. * A 2010 study analyzing data from 8,745 postmenopausal women found that the fatter a woman is, the worse her cognitive function and the more likely she is to have memory loss.Consistent with this, the brains of obese people often show signs of damage. Onestudy of sixty healthy young adults (in their twenties and thirties) found thatthe fatter members of the group had significantly lower gray-matter densities inseveral brain regions, including those involved in the perception of taste andthe regulation of eating behavior. A study of 114 middle-aged people (agedbetween forty and sixty-six) found that the obese tended to have smaller, moreatrophied brains than thinner people; other studies have found similar results.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I attended a weight-loss lecture from another diet program, and I almostlaughed out loud. It was like visiting a prekindergarten school afterexperiencing and attending the graduate school of the Amen Solution.”—PaulBrains usually atrophy with age, but being obese appears to accelerate theprocess. This is bad news—pronounced brain atrophy is a feature of dementia. Whybeing overweight should affect the brain in this way is not clear, although ahost of culprits have been suggested. A paper published in Proceedings of theNational Academy of Sciences has identified a gene that seems to be involved.FTO, as the gene is known, appears to play a role in both body weight and brainfunction. This gene comes in different versions; one version—let’s call it“troublesome”—appears to predispose people to obesity. Individuals with twocopies of the troublesome version tend to be fatter than those with only onecopy of it, who in turn tend to be fatter than those with two copies of the“regular” version. Now the troublesome form has been linked to atrophy inseveral regions of the brain, including the frontal lobes, though how and why ithas this effect remains unknown.Yet your genes are not your destiny. I took a test from a genetic testingcompany that reported I had a 65 percent chance of being overweight. My genessay I am supposed to be fat and indeed I have many overweight family members.But genes are not the whole story. It also has to do with how much you eat andother habits.Obesity exacerbates problems like sleep apnea, which can result in the brainbeing starved of oxygen; this can lead to brain damage. Obesity often goes alongwith high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes, all of which are bad forthe brain in their own right. Indeed, one study has shown that if, in middleage, you are obese and have high blood pressure, the two problems gang up onyou, increasing the chances of your getting dementia in old age more than eitherone would do on its own.Fat tissue itself is a problem. Fat cells secrete substances called cytokinesthat cause inflammation. Chronic inflammation of the brain, which is often foundin the obese, impairs learning and memory and is a feature of depression andAlzheimer’s. Diet also plays a role. Studies in mice have shown that eating avery high-fat diet increases brain inflammation and disrupts brain function. Andthe onset of brain decay may itself play a part. Since the regions of the brainmost affected by obesity appear to be those involved in self-control and theregulation of appetite, erosion of these abilities may lead to greater obesity,which may lead to more rapid brain erosion, in a downward spiral.Whatever the causes, the implications are grave. In the United States today,about one-third of adults are obese. At the same time, dementia is already oneof the most costly and devastating health problems of old age. The possibilitythat obesity today will lead to higher rates of dementia in the future is,therefore, deeply alarming.The obvious question is: can obesity-associated brain damage be reversed? I amconvinced that it can, and have seen enhanced brain function in my practice fortwenty years. Science has already shown that brain shrinkage can be reversed. A2010 study from a research team at the Columbia University for Eating Disordersshowed that women with anorexia have less gray-matter volume than healthy-weightwomen. The longer the women had been in the clutches of the illness, the greaterthe shrinkage. The researchers found that after the women increased theirweight, brain volume was restored. If brain volume can be enhanced when theseverely underweight reach a healthy weight, it makes sense that obese peoplewho achieve a healthy weight can also reverse brain shrinkage.But now would be the time to start. Those two old friends, a healthful diet andplenty of exercise, have repeatedly been shown to protect the brain. Foods likeoily fishes and organic blueberries have been shown to stimulate the growth ofnew neurons, for example. Moreover, one study found that dieting reversed someof the changes to brain structure found among the obese. Whether you are fat orthin, young or old, the best hope you have of guarding your brain is to eat welland exercise. Has anyone seen my running shoes?STAY FOCUSED BY USING YOUR FRONTAL LOBESTo stay focused on losing the love handles, you have to strengthen your frontallobes. The front half of the frontal lobes is called the prefrontal cortex,which is involved with attention, planning, judgment, impulse control, andfollow-through. These are all critical components for weight-loss success, soyou can do the following. * Pay attention to what you eat (no mindless eating!). * Plan meals and snacks so you don’t get stuck without any brain healthy options, and plan how you are going to squeeze physical activity into your day. * Make the best decisions throughout the day. * Say no when the server brings the dessert tray to your table and asks if you saved room for the mocha mud pie. * Follow through on your plans rather than just thinking about them.One of the best ways to boost your prefrontal cortex power is to set goals. Irecommend you set SMART goals. Setting the right kind of goals can help youachieve those goals and reduce the risk of failure. SMART goals are: * Specific * Measurable * Attainable * Realistic * TimelySPECIFICYou have a better chance of achieving a specific goal rather than a vague goal.For example, “Eat oatmeal with organic blueberries for breakfast instead of fastfood” is a better goal than “Eat better.”MEASURABLEWhen you can measure your goals, it is easier to know if you are on the rightpath to achieving them, and measuring lets you know when you have reached yourgoal. For example, “Go to the gym four times a week for thirty minutes eachsession” is a better goal than “Get in shape.”ATTAINABLESet short-term goals that you are capable of achieving. These short-term goalswill help keep you motivated toward your long-term goals. Setting goals that aretoo lofty or long-term can be demotivating. For example, “Lose 100 pounds in oneyear” sounds impossible. “Lose 2 pounds a week” doesn’t sound so hard, but itwill get you to that bigger goal. When you give yourself attainable short-termgoals, it makes it easier for you to believe in your ability to change. Toeffect change, you must believe in your ability to make it happen. If you don’tbelieve, you’ll never do it.REALISTICGoals that are unrealistic set you up to feel like a failure. For example, “Runa marathon next month” may be completely unrealistic if you have never run asingle mile in your life. A realistic goal is one that you are both willing andable to achieve. If you really do want to participate in a race, your goal mightbe “Walk or run a 5K in three months.” This gives you time to practice so youwon’t injure yourself and improves your chances of successfully completing theevent.TIMELYGoals that have no timeframe lack urgency. Set a specific timeframe, such as “byMarch 15” or “starting today” to force you into action.ONE-PAGE MIRACLEOne of the most powerful yet simple exercises I have designed is called theOne-Page Miracle. It will help guide nearly all of your thoughts, words, andactions. It is a “miracle” because I’ve seen this exercise quickly focus andchange many people’s lives. It is particularly effective for people who want tolose weight because it makes you focus on what is truly important to you andforces you to think about long-term goals rather than just the immediategratification that comes from mindless eating or bingeing.As you will see, this exercise asks you to include your hopes and dreams forfour specific areas—biological, psychological, social, and spiritual. That isbecause being overweight isn’t simply an eating problem. There can be biologicalfactors, psychological reasons, social issues, and spiritual troublescontributing to your weight problem, and you need to address all four areas ifyou are going to break free from the chains that are keeping you fat.DIRECTIONSMake copies of “My One-Page Miracle” on this page use the One-Page Miracle makeron our website, or use a sheet of paper and clearly write out a rough draft ofyour major goals for the four pillars of weight loss: biological, psychological,social, and spiritual. If you are using a piece of paper, include thesubcategories “Brain Health,” “Physical Health,” “Eating,” “Weight,” and“Exercise” under the heading “Biological.” Under the heading “Psychological,”write “Emotional Health” and “Thinking Patterns.” Under the heading “Social,”include “Relationships,” “Children,” “Support,” and “Work/Money.” Under theheading “Spiritual,” write “Spirituality,” “Passions,” and “Meaning.”Next to each subheading succinctly write out what’s important to you in thatarea; write what you want, not what you don’t want. Be positive and use thefirst person. Write what you want with confidence and the expectation that youwill make it happen. Remember to make your goals SMART (specific, measurable,attainable, realistic, and timely). Keep the paper with you so that you can workon it over several days or weeks.After you finish with the initial draft (you’ll want to update it frequently),place this piece of paper where you can see it every day, such as on yourrefrigerator, by your bedside, or on the bathroom mirror. In that way, every dayyou focus your eyes on what’s important to you. This makes it easier to matchyour behavior to what you want. Your life becomes more conscious and you spendyour energy on goals that are important to you.Here is an example I did with one of my obese patients who was suffering fromdepression. Zoe, thirty-one, started binge eating in high school when herboyfriend dumped her. That started a pattern of bingeing whenever she felt sador stressed, like when she didn’t get chosen by the sorority she had pledged andwhen she got passed over for a promotion at work. Even though she had gainedmore than 60 pounds since high school and couldn’t look at herself in themirror, she couldn’t stop her secret bingeing. She avoided dating because shedidn’t see how any man could find her attractive, and she was so depressed abouther weight that she had stopped participating in activities she used to enjoy,like playing the piano.Zoe’s brain SPECT scans showed too much activity in the deep limbic system,which is involved with mood, motivation, and appetite. They also revealed anoveractive anterior cingulate gyrus, which is common in people who get stuck onthoughts, such as thoughts about food. It is also common in people with bingeeating disorders.After you look at the example, fill out the One-Page Miracle for yourself. Ifyou have prefrontal cortex challenges, which are common in people with foodaddictions and overeating, this exercise will be very helpful for you. After youcomplete this exercise, put it up where you can see and read it every day. It isa great idea to start the day off each day by reading your One-Page Miracle toget focused on what really matters to you. Then before you do or say something,ask yourself if your potential behavior fits your goals.ZOE’S ONE-PAGE MIRACLEBIOLOGICAL—to be the healthiest I can beBrain health: To love my brain starting today, and before I do anything I willthink about how it will affect the health of my brain.Physical health: To make an appointment with my doctor next week to check myimportant health numbers and to optimize anything that is out of whack.Eating: To throw out all the junk food in my kitchen today and start followingthe Amen Clinics Seven Rules for Brain Healthy Eating.Weight: To lose 1 pound per week for the next twenty weeks, then maintain it byfollowing the steps in this program.Exercise: To do thirty minutes of fast walking four times a week.PSYCHOLOGICAL—to love myself, respect myself, and be forgiving of myselfEmotional health: To exercise, take fish oil, and SAMe to help deal with mydepression and, if I still need help, to see a mental health professional, plusto practice healthier ways to deal with stress.Thinking patterns: To kill the ANTs (automatic negative thoughts), to focus nthe positive, to believe in myself, and to be grateful every day.SOCIAL—to be connected to those I love and to develop a strong support groupRelationships: To open myself up to dating, and maybe spend some time online atreputable dating sites.Children: No children now, but when I do have kids, I want to be a great rolemodel.Support: To join an online weight-loss community this week.Work/Money: To feel more confident about myself so I can apply for the outsidesales job at work.SPIRITUAL—To feel connected to a higher power and othersSpirituality: To meditate dailyPassions: To start playing the piano again by taking piano lessons once a weekMeaning: To make a difference in someone else’s life todayMY ONE-PAGE MIRACLEWhat Do I Want?

A Ferrari?A Bentley? A Corvette? An Aston Martin? Usually, Ferrari leads the list.Whichever one is your dream car, I continue, I want you to imagine it with allof your senses. See the color, maybe bright red? See the leather seats, maybeblack or camel color? Smell the fresh leather. See the car in your garage, newand perfect.Now imagine someone coming into your garage and putting salt into the gas tank.How would you feel? What would you think? What would you do to that person? Manypeople, more guys than girls, get angry and say that they would hurt the personwho ruined their special car.Why? I ask them. Isn’t that exactly what you to do yourself whenever you eatsomething that is bad for you, with excessive sugar, bad fat, or too much salt?Your body and brain are much more precious than any car could ever be! But youtreat yourself with such disrespect; soon your body may break down like the carwith salt in the gas tank. That’s exactly the point of this chapter.Just like a great car needs high-octane gasoline to keep its engine running atits best, your brain and body need premium fuel for optimal function. It’s thefuel that you eat and drink that drives your brain and body to be thinner,smarter, and happier or fatter, dumber, and depressed. Nutrition makes adramatic difference in brain and body health.If you fuel your brain and body with brain healthy foods, it will help you betrim, vibrant, happy, and focused. Fuel up on junk food, and it can make youplump, sluggish, sad, and stupid. The choice seems obvious. And logically everyone of us would choose the premium fuel. But our society and eating habits havechanged so drastically that many of us no longer recognize which foods are goodfor us and which ones are disasters. When you pull up to any modern-daybrain-body fueling station—grocery stores, restaurants, delis, sporting eventvendors, convenience stores, and so on—you don’t get to choose between just“premium” and “regular.” You have thousands of choices, many of which might seemhealthy but actually aren’t.To help you navigate your way to the best options that will help you slim down,boost your cognitive function, and lift your mood, I have come up with the AmenClinics Seven Rules for Brain Healthy Eating. These rules apply to everybody,regardless of your brain type. You will learn more about specific eating plansbased on brain type in chapter 4 [Amen_9780307463623_epub_c04_r1.htm].RULE 1. THINK HIGH-QUALITY CALORIES IN VERSUS HIGH-QUALITY ENERGY OUT.Don’t let anyone tell you that calories don’t count. They absolutely do. But itis not as simple as calories in versus calories out. I admit that I used tothink that as long as I stayed within a certain calorie range, my weight wouldbe fine. But I was wrong.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“For the first time in my life, I am aware of the food I eat—both quality andquantity.”—GinaYou have to focus on eating “high-quality calories.” That means eating the appleinstead of the apple pie à la mode, the almonds instead of the Almond Roca, andthe steel-cut organic oatmeal instead of the oatmeal cookie.The research about calories is very clear. If you eat more calories than youneed, you will be fatter, sicker, and less productive. In a famous studyinvolving rhesus monkeys, researchers followed a large group of monkeys fortwenty years. One group ate all the food they wanted; the other group ate 30percent less. The monkeys who ate anything they wanted were three times morelikely to suffer from cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. Plus, researchers sawsignificant shrinkage in the important decision-making areas of their brains.Over the two decades of the study half of the all-you-can-eat monkeys died whileonly 20 percent of the restricted-calorie monkeys died.Many diet programs today have discarded the traditional concept of caloriereduction. Instead, they insist that you need to eat a specific ratio ofprotein, carbohydrates, and fats in order to lose weight. Not so, according to arecent study in the New England Journal of Medicine conducted at the HarvardSchool of Public Health and Brigham and Women’s Hospital. This study found thatcalorie reduction—regardless of the percentage of fats, carbohydrates, orproteins in a diet—is what leads to weight loss. For this study, the researchersenlisted 811 overweight individuals and assigned them to one of the followingfour diets: * 20 percent fat, 15 percent protein, 65 percent carbohydrates * 20 percent fat, 25 percent protein, 55 percent carbohydrates * 40 percent fat, 15 percent protein, 45 percent carbohydrates * 40 percent fat, 25 percent protein, 35 percent carbohydratesAt the conclusion of the two-year study, all four groups had achieved a similarweight loss of an average of nearly nine pounds.Restricting calories does not mean starving yourself. Crash dieting isn’t doingyour brain or body any favors. Extremely low calorie intake is associated with alack of nutrients, which can deprive your brain and body of the fuel needed foroptimal performance. Plus, this way of eating is not sustainable in the longrun. It doesn’t teach you how to eat right to maintain a healthy weight, soafter you drop the pounds, you go back to your old bad habits and regain theweight. I’ll bet many of you have been there, done that.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I’m figuring out ways to get the flavors of the things I really like withoutall the calories. I loved banana bread. Now I eat a banana with a few walnutsand it’s kind of like banana nut bread. I have stevia and cinnamon on apples andit’s kind of like apple pie. It’s so easy! But a year ago, if you had told me todo that I would have said you’re crazy.”—IreneBe a value spender. Think of calories like money. You only have a certain amountof calories you can spend each day in order to reach your goal weight, so youwant to spend very wisely, or you will bankrupt your brain and body.My wife says I am not a cheap person but rather a value spender. I hate wastingmoney. Once, I had a firm do work for our clinics, and even though their workwas acceptable, I felt that they had overbilled me for the effort, so I avoidedthem in the future. I have this same attitude toward food. I hate wastingcalories on foods that will drain my brain, make me fat, and leave me feelingsluggish.If you are like me and you like to get a lot of bang for your buck, choose foodsthat offer the most nutritional value rather than wasting your precious calorieson foods that cause brain fog and keep you fat. For example, one slice ofstrawberry cheesecake can cost you 730 calories, drain your brain, put you on anemotional roller coaster, and increase your appetite and cravings. On the otherhand, a 400-calorie salad made of spinach, salmon, blueberries, apples, walnuts,and red bell peppers will supercharge your energy and make you smarter.You have to realize that when I talk about being a value spender, I am nottalking about those so-called value meals the fast-food restaurants offer. Mostof them are actually robbing you of brain healthy nutrients and costing you farmore in terms of your health and well-being. Cheap food may be the mostexpensive in terms of our long-term health. A 2010 study in the FASEB Journalshows that you need to kill the junk food—or it will kill you early. This studyfound that when mice consumed high levels of phosphates, found in soft drinksand many processed foods, it sped up the aging process and led to early death.Where’s the value in that? Be a value spender when it comes to calories, or youwill bankrupt your brain and body.Know the calorie counts of the foods and beverages you are eating! U.S. healthcare reform legislation passed in 2010 requires large chain restaurants to postcalorie counts on menus. Many eateries also make nutritional informationavailable on their websites. Make it a practice to look up menus online beforeyou go out so you know which menu items will give you the most nutritional valuefor the calorie cost. You can also find out how many calories are in hundreds offoods in appendix C or using the nutrition tools on our website.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“If I’m going to splurge on something, I figure out how to make it work withinmy calorie budget.”—PamelaA colleague of mine was recently invited to a chain restaurant that is famousfor its pizza. She knew it might be difficult to find something on the menu thatwas light on calories but high in brain healthy nutrients, so she spent a fewminutes analyzing the nutritional information online. She found a salad (a halforder) that was loaded with grilled vegetables and salmon, packed with proteinand fiber, and low in saturated fat for about 600 calories. If she hadn’t doneher homework, she could have ended up ordering a salad that sounded healthy butweighed in at more than 1,500 calories.A lot of my patients ask me if it is possible to eat fast food while watchingtheir calorie intake. The answer is yes. Many fast-food restaurants are addinghealthier, low-calorie fare to their menu options. To help you make betterchoices at fast-food restaurants, here is a chart of an entire day’s meals(breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack, dinner, and dessert) with calorie busters toavoid and lighter options that get the green light.[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_010_r1.gif][images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_011_r1.gif]If calorie counts are not listed on the menu, ask! Use your brain, be smart, anddo not let other people make you fat and unhappy. Take control of your eatingrather than letting a restaurant or ballpark vendor dictate how many caloriesyou eat.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“Measuring my food opened up a whole new world of self-abuse. I had no idea howmuch I was eating.”—ReggieAt the grocery store, read the nutrition labels! Many products that are marketedas “healthy” are in reality high-calorie, low-nutrient losers. Be sure to checkthe serving size on the labels. If you are like most Americans, your idea of aserving size is probably very different from the one listed. You might look at abox of bran cereal that says 100 calories per serving and think that’s a greatvalue. But how much of it are you really eating? I was shocked when I actuallymeasured out the suggested serving size of a cup of cereal. I had been eating atleast twice that much but thinking I was only eating 100 calories.This is why it is absolutely critical that you get a food scale, measuring cups,and measuring spoons and measure and weigh everything you eat. This takes theguesswork out of counting calories and makes you be honest with yourself abouthow much you are eating. I can tell you that among our weight-loss groupparticipants, the ones who buy a food scale and measure their food are typicallythe most successful.Know how many calories a day you need to eat to either maintain your weight orlose weight. The average active fifty-year-old man needs about 2,200 calories aday to maintain his weight, and the average fifty-year-old woman needs about1,800 calories. You can find calorie calculators on our website to help youdetermine your individual calorie needs.Here is an example from Sherri, one of our weight-loss group participants. Sheused our online calorie calculator to determine how many calories she needed tomaintain her current weight (at the debut of the program). * Height: 5′5″ * Weight: 168 pounds * Gender: female * Age: 40 * Activity lifestyle: sedentary * Result: She needed a total of 1,804 calories to maintain her current weight.With this information, Sherri was then able to figure out how many calories sheneeds to eat in order to lose 1 pound per week. To lose one pound per week, youneed to reduce your daily intake by 500 calories below your requirements. Thatis based on the fact that 1 pound of fat contains approximately 3,500 calories,so to lose 1 pound a week, you need to consume approximately 3,500 fewercalories per week. Divide 3,500 by seven days, and you get 500 calories per day.I recommend you use a combination of diet and exercise to reduce your intake by500 calories. For example, eat 200 fewer calories and burn an additional 300calories through exercise. So for Sherri, she needs to reduce her calorie intaketo 1,604 calories a day, with 300 calories of exercise, in order to lose 1 poundper week. Without exercise she needs to eat 1,304 calories a day.Knowing your daily calorie allowance is only part of the weight-loss equation.You also need to know how many calories a day you actually put in your body.Keep a daily food journal (more on journaling later in this chapter) just likeyou keep a checkbook. Start the day with the number of calories you can spend,and write down everything you eat and drink throughout the day. That includesthe handful of M&M’s you grabbed from the receptionist’s desk and the sweetenediced tea you had with lunch. This one strategy made a huge difference for me.When I actually wrote down everything I ate for a month, it caused me to stoplying to myself about my calories.One of our NFL players wrote that when he started counting his calories, itopened up a new world of self-abuse that he was completely unaware of.“High-quality energy out” means you need to expend energy and rev up yourmetabolism in healthy ways. Exercise, new learning, and green tea help. You willlearn much more about workouts for your brain and body in chapter 7[Amen_9780307463623_epub_c07_r1.htm]. As for green tea, numerous studies havefound that the catechins found in green tea, such as epigallocatechin gallate,have a positive effect on metabolism, BMI, weight loss, waist circumference, andweight management.When you are desperate to lose the love handles or the muffin top, you may betempted to try unhealthy methods to expend more energy. Energy boosters to avoidinclude diet pills, sugary caffeinated energy drinks, too much coffee (green teahas half the caffeine as coffee), caffeinated sodas, smoking, and excessiveexercise.RULE 2. DRINK PLENTY OF WATER AND NOT TOO MANY OF YOUR CALORIES.Did you know that your brain is 80 percent water? Anything that dehydrates it,such as too much caffeine or much alcohol, decreases your thinking and impairsyour judgment. Proper hydration is one of the keys to weight loss! Since thehunger and thirst centers sit right next to each other in the brain, many timeswhen we think we are hungry, we are really just dehydrated. So we mistake thethirst signal for a food signal!To be properly hydrated, drink at least half your body weight in ounces. If youweigh 200 pounds, then you need to drink about 100 ounces of water a day. Thatis about three quarts. Go to the store and buy a quart (32 ounces) bottle ofwater and fill it up three times a day. Start drinking it in the morning andbring your bottle with you throughout the day. In no time, you will figure outhow to fit three quarts of water into your daily routine.You are what you drink. Guzzling sugar-filled, fat-filled sodas, coffee treats,cocktails, sports drinks, fruit juices, and whole milk throughout the day canmake you fat and sabotage your efforts to slim down. Just look at theapproximate calorie counts for some of America’s favorite beverages. The countsare for 12 ounces of each beverage so you can compare which ones are the mostcaloric. It may surprise you.BEVERAGE CALORIE COUNTS12 ounces ginger ale 120 calories 12 ounces orange juice 135 calories 12 ouncesgrapefruit juice 140 calories 12 ounces cola 150 calories 12 ounces Red Bull 165calories 12 ounces cranberry juice 200 calories 12 ounces whole milk 215caloriesDON’T DRINK THESE CALORIE HOGSStarbucks Venti Peppermint White Chocolate Mocha with whole milk and whippedcream 700 calories Long Island iced tea 780 calories Margarita740 calories McDonald’s Chocolate McCafé Shake (15.8 ounces) 880 caloriesSmoothie King’s The Hulk Strawberry (40 ounces) 2,070 caloriesThe first step to limiting liquid calories is becoming aware of exactly how manyyou are drinking. On your daily food journal, be sure to include everything youdrink throughout the day, including those free refills of soda and coffee withcream and sugar—the calories still count even if they are consumed in the samecup at the same sitting.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I stopped drinking wine with dinner every night and lost 23 pounds and have somuch more energy. But then I went on vacation and split a bottle of wine eachnight with my wife. I felt poisoned and had no energy. When I returned home, Icut out the wine again and felt so much better.”—ThomasA growing body of evidence shows a strong connection between sugar-ladenbeverages and weight gain. Take the Harvard Nurses’ Health Study, for example,which tracked more than fifty thousand women over an eight-year period. In thislarge-scale study, researchers found that women who increased their consumptionof sugar-sweetened beverages during the eight years packed on a significantamount of weight while women who reduced their consumption experienced lessweight gain.Liquid calories are especially troublesome when you are trying to lose weightbecause they don’t trigger the hormones in the brain that tell us we feel full.For example, researchers have found that the high-fructose corn syrup found inmany sodas does not stimulate these hormones. Even highly caloric drinks likeprotein shakes don’t satisfy hunger the way solid food does. This means thatdrinking all those extra liquid calories doesn’t make you eat less food; itsimply increases the total number of calories you consume.Two studies testing the effects of beverage consumption on food intake: In onesix-week study, researchers examined eighteen female and fifteen male volunteersand their lunch-eating habits in relation to beverage consumption. The foodsthey ate were the same each day, but meals were accompanied by a rotation ofsoda, diet soda, or water in two portion sizes: 12 ounces and 18 ounces. Theresearchers found that regardless of the size or beverage consumed, people atethe same amount of solid food. This translated into a bump in calories on thedays sugary soda was served. In the other study, the researchers trackedforty-four women as they ate lunch accompanied by one of five beverages: water,diet soda, soda, orange juice, or 1% milk. Again, the amount of food caloriesconsumed remained constant no matter which beverage was served.More evidence comes from a study appearing in the Journal of the AmericanDietetic Association. In this trial, researchers gave twenty lean and twentyobese individuals one of the following—an apple, applesauce, or applejuice—either with a meal or as a snack. The results showed that drinking applejuice either with a meal or as a snack reduced hunger the least while eating anapple reduced hunger the most. These results were the same for both the lean andobese groups.A study in the International Journal of Obesity showed that liquid caloriescontribute to more weight gain than eating jelly beans! In this trial,volunteers who ate the candy decreased the amount of other food calories theyconsumed while those who drank caloric beverages did not reduce their foodintake.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I was drinking wine with dinner every day. Just cutting that out cut a lot ofcalories.”—MelissaThe bottom line here is clear. Stop drinking beverages loaded with calories!Fortunately, reducing or eliminating liquid calories from your diet is one ofthe easiest and most effective ways to cut calories and shed extra pounds.Curbing your intake of liquid calories results in greater weight loss thancutting out food calories, according to a recent study that appeared in theAmerican Journal of Clinical Nutrition. The study, which tracked the weight of810 men and women, found that those who cut 100 liquid calories per day lostmore weight than those who reduced their food intake by 100 calories. As you cansee from the Beverage Calorie Counts list above, 100 calories is less than asingle can of soda.Learning to substitute brain healthy beverages—water, herbal teas, andunsweetened almond milk—for high-calorie drinks can put you on the fast track toweight loss. My favorite drink is water mixed with a little lemon juice and alittle bit of the natural sweetener stevia. It tastes like lemonade, so I feellike I’m spoiling myself, and it has virtually no calories. Other drinks I likeinclude: sparkling water with just a splash of cranberry juice, sparkling waterwith root-beer-flavored stevia, cinnamon tea with cinnamon-flavored stevia.RULE 3. EAT HIGH-QUALITY LEAN PROTEIN THROUGHOUT THE DAY.Protein helps balance your blood sugar and provides the necessary buildingblocks for brain health. Eating protein is important for anyone trying to loseweight, but it is especially critical for certain brain types. You will learnabout these brain types in chapter 4 [Amen_9780307463623_epub_c04_r1.htm].Protein contains L-tyrosine, an amino acid that is important in the synthesis ofbrain neurotransmitters. Found in foods like meat, poultry, fish, and tofu, itis the precursor to dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine, which arecritical for balancing mood and energy. It is also helpful in the process ofproducing thyroid hormones, which are important in metabolism and energyproduction. Tyrosine supplementation has been shown to improve cognitiveperformance under periods of stress and fatigue. Stress tends to deplete theneurotransmitter norepinephrine, and tyrosine is the amino acid building blockto replenish it.Also found in protein is L-tryptophan, an amino acid building block forserotonin. L-tryptophan is found in meat, eggs, and milk. Increasing intake ofL-tryptophan is very helpful for some people in stabilizing mood, improvingmental clarity and sleep, and decreasing aggressiveness. Scientific evidencealso shows that supplementation with L-tryptophan can help people lose weight.Eating protein-rich foods like fish, chicken, and beef also provides the aminoacid glutamine, which serves as the precursor to the neurotransmitter GABA. GABAis reported in the herbal literature to work in much the same way as antianxietydrugs and anticonvulsants. It helps stabilize nerve cells by decreasing theirtendency to fire erratically or excessively. This means it has a calming effectfor people who struggle with temper, irritability, and anxiety.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“Now I make sure to have a little protein with every meal and it helps balancemy blood sugar and keep me from getting hungry.”—JennaGreat sources of lean protein include fish, skinless turkey or chicken, beans,raw nuts, high-protein grains, and high-protein vegetables, such as broccoli andspinach. Quinoa (pronounced keen-wa) contains more protein than any other grainwith 9 g per 1 cup of cooked quinoa. My wife, Tana, who is a nurse and theauthor of the Change Your Brain, Change Your Body Cookbook, often uses quinoa insoups, salads, and side dishes instead of rice, potatoes, or other grains to geta good protein boost.It is especially important to eat protein at breakfast because it increasesattention and focus, which we need for work or school. Eating carbohydratesboosts serotonin in the brain, which induces relaxation, and that makes you wantto sleep through your morning meetings. In the United States, we have itbackward. We tend to eat high-carbohydrate cereal, pancakes, or bagels forbreakfast and a big steak for dinner. Doing the opposite may be a smarter movefor your brain. I love the idea of using food to fuel your ability to focus orrelax. If I need to work at night I will increase my protein. If it has been astressful day I am more likely to eat pasta to calm my brain.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I am seventy-one years old, and it is only recently that I realized I amaddicted to sugar. I no longer eat sugar, and the cravings stopped. I eathealthy foods and have lost weight. I wish more doctors would talk to theirpatients about sugar addiction.”—JenRULE 4. EAT LOW-GLYCEMIC, HIGH-FIBER CARBOHYDRATES.This means eat carbohydrates that do not spike your blood sugar and that arealso high in fiber, such as whole grains, vegetables, and fruits likeblueberries and apples. Carbohydrates are not the enemy. They are essential toyour life. Bad carbohydrates are the enemy. These are carbohydrates that havebeen robbed of any nutritional value, such as simple sugars and refinedcarbohydrates.Get to know the glycemic index. The glycemic index (GI) rates carbohydratesaccording to their effects on blood sugar. It is ranked on a scale from 1 to100-plus. Low-glycemic foods have a low number (which means they do not spikeyour blood sugar, so they are generally healthier for you) and high-glycemicfoods have a high number (which means they quickly elevate your blood sugar, sothey are generally not as healthy for you).Eating a diet that is filled with low-glycemic foods will lower your bloodglucose levels, decrease cravings, and help with weight loss. The importantconcept to remember is that high blood sugar is bad for your brain andultimately your waistline.Be careful when going by GI to choose your foods. Some foods that are lowglycemic aren’t really healthy for you. For example, in the following list, youmight notice that peanut M&M’s have a GI of 33 whereas steel-cut oatmeal has aGI of about 52. Does this mean that it’s better for you to eat peanut M&M’s? No!Peanut M&M’s are loaded with saturated fat, artificial food coloring, and otherthings that are not brain healthy. Steel-cut oatmeal is a high-fiber food thathelps regulate your blood sugar for hours. Use your brain when choosing yourfood.In general, vegetables, fruits, legumes, and nuts are the best low-GI options. Adiet rich in low-GI foods not only helps you lose weight, it has also been foundto help control diabetes, according to a 2010 review of the scientificliterature in the British Journal of Nutrition. Be aware, however, that somefoods that sound healthy actually have a high GI. For example, some fruits, likewatermelon, have a high ranking. It is wise to consume more fruits on the lowend of the spectrum. Similarly, some vegetables like potatoes and somehigh-fiber products like whole wheat bread are on the high end of the list.Eating smaller portions of these foods and combining them with lean proteins andhealthy fats can reduce their impact on blood sugar levels.The following list of foods and their GI is culled from numerous sources,including a 2008 review of nearly 2,500 individual food items by researchers atthe Institute of Obesity, Nutrition and Exercise in Sydney, Australia.

Less bread. Less wine. More walking.”—MarcusChoose high-fiber carbohydrates. High-fiber foods are one of your bestweight-loss weapons. Years of research have found that the more fiber you eat,the better for your weight. How does dietary fiber fight fat?First, it helps regulate the appetite hormone ghrelin, which tells you that youare hungry. Ghrelin levels are often out of whack in people with a high BMI sothey always feel hungry no matter how much they eat. New research shows thathigh ghrelin levels not only make you feel hungrier, they also increase thedesire for high-calorie foods compared with low-calorie fare, so it’s a doublewhammy. But fiber can help. A 2009 study showed that eating a diet high in fiberhelped balance ghrelin levels in overweight and obese people. This can turn offthe constant hunger and reduce the appeal of high-calorie foods.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I have been eating the Life-Enhancing Lentil Soup from your cookbook for lunch,and it keeps me feeling full. I don’t get hungry two hours later like I usedto.”—FionaSecond, no matter how much you weigh, eating fiber helps you feel full longer soyou don’t get the munchies an hour after you eat.Third, fiber slows the absorption of food into the bloodstream, which helpsbalance your blood sugar. This can help you make better food choices and fightcravings later in the day (see chapter 6 [Amen_9780307463623_epub_c06_r1.htm]for more on this). In fact, fiber takes so long to be digested by your body, aperson eating 20 to 35 grams of fiber a day will burn an extra 150 calories aday or lose 16 extra pounds a year.These three things alone can go a long way in helping you avoid extra calories.Fiber-friendly foods boast a number of other health benefits as well, including: * Reducing cholesterol * Keeping your digestive tract moving * Reducing high blood pressure * Reducing the risk of cancerExperts recommend eating 25–35 g of fiber a day, but research shows that mostadults fall far short of that. So how can you boost your fiber intake? Eat morehigh-fiber brain healthy foods like fruits, vegetables, legumes, and wholegrains. Here are the fiber contents of some brain healthy foods. Try to includesome of the foods on this list at every meal or snack.Food Grams of Fiber Kidney beans (1 cup canned) 16.4 Split peas (1 cup cooked)16.4 Lentils (1 cup cooked) 15.6 Black beans (1 cup canned) 15.0 Garbanzo beans(1 cup canned) 10.6 Peas (1 cup frozen and cooked) 8.8 Raspberries (1 cup) 8.0Blackberries (1 cup) 7.6 Spinach (1 cup cooked) 7.0 (1 cup raw) 0.7 Brusselssprouts (1 cup cooked) 6.4 Broccoli (1 cup cooked) 5.6 Pear (1 medium with skin)5.1 Sweet potato (1 medium baked) 4.8 Carrots (1 cup cooked) 4.6 (1 medium raw)2.0 Blueberries (1 cup) 3.5 Strawberries (1 cup) 3.3 Apple (1 medium with skin)3.3 Banana (1 medium) 3.1 Orange (1 medium) 3.1 Asparagus (1 cup cooked) 3.0Grapefruit (½ medium) 2.0 Avocado (1 ounce) 1.9 Whole wheat bread (1 slice) 1.9Walnuts (7 whole) 1.9 Plums (2 medium) 1.8 Peach (1 medium with skin) 1.5 Tomato(½ cup fresh) 1.5 Cherries (10 large) 1.4 Oatmeal (¾ cup cooked) 0.8 Almonds (6whole) 0.8 Source: Adapted from U.S. Department of Agriculture, AgriculturalResearch Service, USDA Nutritional Nutrient Database for Standard Reference,Release 17, 2004.Steer clear of bad carbohydrates. Bad carbohydrates are those that have beenrobbed of any nutritional value, such as simple sugars and refined carbohydratesfound in muffins, scones, cakes, cookies, and other baked goods. If you want tolive without cravings, eliminate these completely from your diet.Sugar is not your friend. We have often heard of sugar being called emptycalories. In fact, it is so damaging to your brain and body that I call itanti-nutrition or toxic calories. Sugar increases inflammation in your body,increases erratic brain cell firing, and sends your blood sugar levels on aroller-coaster ride. Plus, new research shows that sugar is addictive and caneven be more addictive than cocaine.That helps explain why we eat so much of it. Americans consume an average of22.2 teaspoons of sugar a day, which adds up to 355 calories a day. That’s anincrease of 19 percent since 1970.NAMES FOR SUGAR USED ON FOOD LABELSInvert sugar Lactose Maltodextrin Honey Maltose Glucose Malt syrup GalactoseMolasses Fruit juice concentrate Sorbitol Fruit juice Turbinado sugar FructoseAgave Dextrose Dehydrated cane juice Corn syrup High-fructose corn syrup Canejuice crystals, extract Cane sugar Sucanat Barley maltTable sugar isn’t the only culprit making you fat. Research shows thathigh-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), which is found in many sodas and accounts foras much as 40 percent of the caloric sweeteners used in the United States, iseven more fattening than table sugar.HFCS and sugar went head to head in a 2010 study from researchers at PrincetonUniversity. Compared with rats that drank water sweetened with table sugar, ratsthat drank water sweetened with HFCS gained significantly more body weight,including more fat around the belly, even though they consumed the same numberof calories. Every single one of the rats drinking the HFCS became obese. Aftersix months, the rats guzzling the HFCS showed signs of a dangerous conditionknown in humans as the metabolic syndrome, including weight gain, abdominal fat,and high triglycerides.Put down the sodas and HFCS now!A lot of people ask me, “Isn’t it okay to have sweets in moderation?”Personally, I don’t agree with the people who say “Everything in moderation.”Sugar in moderation triggers cravings. The less sugar in your life the betteryour life will be. Reach for a banana or an apple instead.Cutting down on the sweet stuff is a good start, but sugar lurks in a lot ofother processed foods as well like ketchup, barbecue sauce, and salad dressing.Start reading food labels. At first, you might feel like you’re reading aforeign language. Sorbitol, maltose, maltidextrose, galactose—these are justsome of the many names for sugar used on food labels.RULE 5. FOCUS YOUR DIET ON HEALTHY FATS.Healthy fats are important to a good diet because the solid weight of the brainis 60 percent fat! The one hundred billion nerve cells in your brain needessential fatty acids to function. Focus your diet on healthy fats, especiallythose that contain omega-3 fatty acids, found in foods like salmon, tuna,mackerel, avocados, walnuts, and green leafy vegetables.How omega-3 fatty acids help you get thinner, smarter, and happier. The two moststudied omega-3 fatty acids are eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoicacid (DHA). DHA makes up a large portion of the gray matter of the brain. Thefat in your brain forms cell membranes and plays a vital role in how our cellsfunction. Neurons are also rich in omega-3 fatty acids. EPA improves blood flow,which boosts overall brain function.Low levels of omega-3 fatty acids have been associated with depression, anxiety,obesity, ADD, suicide, and an increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease anddementia. There is also scientific evidence that low levels of omega-3 fattyacids play a role in substance abuse, and I would argue that overeating is aform of substance abuse.Boosting omega-3 fatty acids in your diet is one of the best things you can dofor your weight, mood, and brainpower. In fact, if you want to lose fat, youshould eat more fat—of the omega-3 variety. Increasing omega-3 intake has beenfound to decrease appetite and cravings and reduce body fat. In a fascinating2009 study in the British Journal of Nutrition, Australian researchers analyzedblood samples from 124 adults (twenty-one healthy weight, forty overweight, andsixty-three obese), calculated their BMI, and measured their waist and hipcircumference. They found that obese individuals had significantly lower levelsof EPA and DHA compared with healthy-weight people. Subjects with higher levelswere more likely to have a healthy BMI and waist and hip measurements.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I never liked walnuts before. Now I love them!”—AnnaResearch in the last few years has revealed that diets rich in omega-3 fattyacids may help promote a healthy emotional balance and positive mood in lateryears, possibly because DHA is a main component of the brain’s synapses. Agrowing body of scientific evidence indicates that fish oil helps ease symptomsof depression. One twenty-year study involving 3,317 men and women found thatpeople with the highest consumption of EPA and DHA were less likely to havesymptoms of depression.There is a tremendous amount of scientific evidence pointing to a connectionbetween the consumption of fish that is rich in omega-3 fatty acids andcognitive function. A Danish team of researchers compared the diets of 5,386healthy older individuals and found that the more fish in a person’s diet, thelonger the person was able to maintain their memory and reduce the risk ofdementia. Dr. J. A. Conquer and colleagues from the University of Guelph inOntario, Canada, studied the blood fatty acid content in the early and laterstages of dementia and noted low levels when compared with healthy people.Eating fish also benefits cognitive performance. In a study from Swedishresearchers, results showed that surveyed nearly five thousand fifteen-year-oldboys and found that those who ate fish more than once a week scored higher onstandard intelligence tests than teens who ate no fish. A follow-up study foundthat teens eating fish more than once a week also had better grades at schoolthan students with lower fish consumption. Other benefits of omega-3 fatty acidsinclude improving attention in people with ADD and reducing the risk forpsychosis.FOODS HIGH IN OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS * Anchovies * Broccoli * Brussels sprouts * Cabbage * Cauliflower * Cod * Flaxseeds * Halibut * Mackerel * Salmon, wild * Sardines * Scallops * Shrimp * Snapper * Soybeans * Spinach * Tofu * Trout * Tuna * WalnutsEat more fat, lose more fat. It sounds contradictory, but science shows thatit’s true. In 2000 researchers in Boston analyzed two groups of people—one groupon a low-fat diet (20 percent of calories from fat) and the other group on amoderate-fat diet (35 percent of calories from fat). After eighteen months,people eating moderate amounts of fat lost a mean of 9 pounds and trimmed 2.7inches from their waistlines. The low-fat group, however, gained a mean of 6.4pounds and added 1 inch around the middle.What I find intriguing about this study is that more than half of themoderate-fat dieters were able to stick with the program for the entire eighteenmonths. Compare that with 80 percent of the low-fat dieters who found it toohard to stick with the program and dropped out. I would venture to guess thatthe people eating moderate amounts of fat didn’t feel like they were “dieting”because healthy fats help with satiety. The key to boosting fat consumption forweight loss is eating healthy fats.Eliminate bad fats. While healthy fats enhance brainpower and help you loseweight, bad fats drain your brain and boost your belly. The U.S. Institute ofMedicine recommends no more than 20 g saturated fat a day. Eating too manysaturated fats or trans fats (also known as “Frankenfats”) contributes toobesity and cognitive decline. Trans fats are used to help foods have a longershelf life and are found in margarine, cakes, crackers, cookies, and potatochips. They decrease your shelf life!Get rid of most animal fat from your diet. Diets high in saturated fats havelong been associated with long-term health risks, such as heart disease. Arecent animal study from British researchers has found that high-fat diets alsocause more-immediate problems. After eating a fatty diet for just ten days, ratsshowed short-term memory loss and less energy to exercise—in other words, theybecame more stupid and lazy.The researchers compared the performance of the rats on a high-fat diet (55percent of calories as fat) with rats on a low-fat diet (7.5 percent of caloriesas fat). Rats with the high-fat diet had muscles that worked less efficiently,which lowered their energy levels, caused their hearts to work harder duringexercise, and caused their hearts to increase in size. The rats eating high-fatfoods also took longer to make their way through a maze and made more mistakesthan the rats eating low-fat foods. This is one of the first studies to showthat it doesn’t take long for a high-fat diet to make your brain and body moresluggish.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“My secret to success has been reducing my intake of sugar, flour, bread, andred meat, and eating good fats, such as avocados and walnuts.”—PeteScientific evidence also shows that consuming high-fat foods actually altersbrain chemistry in ways that compel you to overeat. One animal study thatappeared in the Journal of Clinical Investigation found that eating high-fatfoods, such as milkshakes or burgers, caused the brain to release messages tothe body telling it to ignore the feelings of fullness that typically make youstop eating. In this particular study, the brain switched off the fullnesssignal for up to three days, which led to overeating.A similar trial found that high-fat, high-sugar diets alter brain receptors inan area of the brain that regulates food intake. Overconsumption of fat-laden,sugar-filled foods increased the levels of opioid receptors, which are linked tofeelings of pleasure and euphoria. The researchers suggest that this could be afactor in binge eating disorders.What you eat doesn’t just affect your own health. What you eat can affect yourchildren … and their children. Research presented at the American Associationfor Cancer Research showed that the female offspring of pregnant rats that ate adiet high in omega-6 fats were more likely to get breast cancer. Omega-6 fatsare found in vegetable oils, baked goods, and cereals. Even more disturbing isthe finding that even if the daughters ate healthy diets, their female offspringwere at a 30 percent higher risk for breast cancer.This suggests that eating junk food could threaten not only your own health andwell-being but that of your grandchildren. Other studies have shown that dietshigh in omega-6 compared with omega-3 fats raise the risk for depression anddisease.So after reading this, if you still want to grab that big Double-Double burgerat In-N-Out, think about these facts: * High-glycemic index of the white bun = 71 * Fat found in the 2 beef patties and 2 slices of cheese = 41 g * Saturated fat = 18 g * Trans fat = 1 g * Calories = 670 * High-sodium content = 1,440 mg (milligrams)*It makes you think twice about eating that burger, doesn’t it? Knowledge ispower. Know what you are putting in your mouth and how it will affect your brainand your belly.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I started a vegetable garden at home and now I use the veggies in all kinds ofthings.”—JulieRULE 6. EAT FROM THE RAINBOW.This means put natural foods in your diet of many different colors. Eat bluefoods (blueberries), red foods (pomegranates, strawberries, raspberries,cherries, red bell peppers, and tomatoes), yellow foods (squash, yellow bellpeppers, bananas, and peaches), orange foods (oranges, tangerines, and yams),green foods (spinach, broccoli, and peas), purple foods (plums), and so on.This will boost the antioxidant levels in your body and help keep your brainyoung. Several studies have found that eating foods rich in antioxidants, whichinclude many fruits and vegetables, significantly reduces the risk of developingcognitive impairment.Blueberries are very high in antioxidants, which has earned them the nickname“brain berries” among neuroscientists. In laboratory studies, rats that ateblueberries showed a better ability to learn new motor skills and gainedprotection against strokes. That is not all. In one study, rats that ate a dietrich in blueberries lost abdominal fat, lowered cholesterol, and improvedglucose levels. Similar studies showed that rats that consumed strawberries andspinach also gained significant protection.Eating fruits and vegetables from the rainbow, along with fish, legumes, andnuts is part of what is known as the Mediterranean diet. Research has found thateating a Mediterranean diet can make you not only happier but smarter too. Aseries of studies from Spanish researchers revealed that adherence to this typeof eating plan helps prevent depression. A team of scientists in Bordeaux,France, concluded that a Mediterranean diet slows cognitive decline and reducesthe risk for dementia.FRUITS AND VEGETABLES WITH HIGH ANTIOXIDANT LEVELS * Acai berries * Avocados * Beets * Blueberries * Blackberries * Oranges * Plums * Pomegranates * Raspberries * Broccoli * Brussels sprouts * Cherries * Cranberries * Kiwis * Red bell peppers * Red grapes * Strawberries * SpinachRULE 7. COOK WITH BRAIN HEALTHY HERBS AND SPICES TO BOOST YOUR BRAINPOWER.If you want to get thinner, smarter, and happier, then reach for the spicecupboard. Using spices rather than heavy cream sauces or butter cuts calories soyou can lose weight. Research shows that they can also boost your brain and yourmood. * Turmeric Found in curry, turmeric contains a chemical that has been shown to decrease the plaques in the brain thought to be responsible for Alzheimer’s disease. * Saffron In three studies, a saffron extract was found to be as effective as antidepressant medication in treating people with mild to moderate depression. * Sage Scientific evidence shows that this fragrant spice helps to boost memory. * Thyme Studies show that thyme increases the amount of DHA in the brain, which protects against age-related degeneration. * Rosemary A 2006 study reported that rosemary diminishes cognitive decline in people with dementia. * Cinnamon One of my favorite spices, cinnamon, has been shown to help boost attention. Plus, cinnamon is a natural aphrodisiac for men—not that most men need much help.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“Get creative with meal prep. I substitute healthier options for moretraditional ingredients, like a vegetarian Reuben sandwich with raw zucchini,sprouts, and Vegenaise.”—EddieOther spices that boost or protect brainpower include garlic, oregano, andbasil.BRAIN HEALTHY FOODS THAT MAKE YOU THINNER, SMARTER, AND HAPPIERChoosing brain healthy foods that will help you lose weight can also help you besmarter and happier. As you have noticed in this chapter, many of the foodsmentioned have been found to improve cognitive function, reduce the risk ofAlzheimer’s disease and dementia, boost focus and attention, and more. There isno doubt in my mind that eating the right foods makes you smarter.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I no longer buy foods that are bad for me. Period.”—DamonIn addition, you have probably noticed how the foods you eat affect your moodand energy level. That is because food is a drug. Food can make you feel worse.If you chow down on three doughnuts for breakfast, about half an hour later youare going to feel foggy, spacey, and stupid. Food can make you sleepy. Have youever noticed that after wolfing down a huge lunch you feel like you need a nap?For some people, foods can trigger mood, temper control, attentional, or otheremotional problems. This may be due to hidden food allergies or sensitivities.In a 2008 study from Holland, researchers found that putting children on arestricted elimination diet reduced ADD symptoms by more than 50 percent in 73percent of children—basically the same effectiveness of stimulant medication butwithout any of the side effects. The researchers also found that the children’smoods and oppositional behaviors were also improved.Elimination diets are not easy to do. For this study, the children could eatonly rice, turkey, lamb, vegetables, fruits, margarine, vegetable oil, tea, pearjuice, and water. But the results were stunning. An elimination diet may be agood place for you to start if you suspect food sensitivities. If you notice areduction in your symptoms while on the elimination diet, then there is a goodchance they are food-related. Adding foods back into your diet one by one willallow you to see which items may be causing the problem behaviors. Working witha nutritionist can make a big difference.Food can also make you feel great. Eating brain healthy foods can lift yourmood, improve focus and attention, and give you good energy that lasts all daylong. For example, if you are feeling anxious or down in the dumps, snifflemons. Research shows that the scent of lemons has antianxiety andantidepressant properties. In addition, foods that boost levels of the feel-goodneurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine stabilize moods and rev up your energy.Healthy fare that pumps up the neurotransmitter GABA calms anxiety, which alsomakes you happier. For a real happiness boost, look for foods high in omega-3fatty acids and vitamin B12. Having low levels of omega-3s is associated withdepression and obesity, and vitamin B12 deficiencies put you at higher risk fordepression.FIFTY BEST BRAIN HEALTHY FOODSAlmond milk, unsweetenedAlmonds, rawApplesAsparagusAvocadosBananasBarleyBeansBeetsBell peppersBlackberriesBlueberriesBok choyBroccoliBrussels sproutsCherriesChicken, skinlessCoconutCoconut oilEgg whites, DHA enrichedGoji berriesGrapefruitGreen teaHerringKiwiLemonsLentilsLimesOatsOlive oilOrangesPeachesPearsPeasPlumsPomegranatesQuinoaRaspberriesRed grapesSalmon, wildSoybeansSpinachStrawberriesTomatoesTunaTurkey, skinlessWalnutsWaterYams/sweet potatoesYogurt, low fat, sugar- and artificial-sweetener-freeGET SMART FOODS(BRAIN HEALTHY FOODS THAT MAKE YOUTHINNER AND SMARTER)Acai berriesApplesArugulaAvocadosBarley (pearled)BeansBeetsBlueberriesBlackberriesBroccoliBrussels sproutsCauliflowerCherriesChicken (skinless)CinnamonCranberriesEggsFlaxseedsGrape leavesGreen teaKiwisLean beefLentilsMackerelMilk (skim)OatsOrangesPecansPine nutsPlumsPomegranatesRaspberriesRed bell peppersRed grapesRosemarySaffronSageSalmonSardinesStrawberriesSpinachThymeTomatoesTunaTurkey (skinless)TurmericWalnutsWaterWhole grainsGOOD MOOD FOODS(BRAIN HEALTHY FOODS THAT MAKE YOU THINNER AND HAPPIER)AsparagusBananasBeansBroccoliCheese (low fat)ChickenChickpeasCottage cheese (low fat)Dark chocolate (not too much!)EggsLean meatsLemonsMackerelMilk (skim)NutsOatsProteinPumpkin seedsSaffronSalmonSardinesSeafoodSpinachSunflower seedsTofuTunaUsing the lists in this chapter, create a list of your favorite brain healthyfoods, good mood foods, and get smart foods.

You don’t have to spend a bundle to eat right. I recently wrote a blogon brain healthy eating for the poor. In writing the blog, I asked for some helpfrom my esteemed friend Dr. Jeff Fortuna, the author of Nutrition for theFocused Brain and Food, Brain Chemistry and Behavior. Dr. Fortuna is a facultymember in the Department of Health Science at California State University,Fullerton, and the clinical nutritionist for Newport Academy, a residentialtreatment program for teens suffering from drug abuse and co-occurringdisorders. Together, we came up with the following ten tips to help people whoare strapped for cash eat healthier without spending a fortune.GO FOR SATISFYING GRAINS.When it comes to grains, you can’t beat old-fashioned oatmeal or pearled barley,which cost about ten cents or less per serving. These bargain whole grains offera huge nutritional bang for your buck, moderate blood sugar for hours, and keepyou feeling full longer.BUY VITAMIN-RICH VEGETABLES FROZEN AND SAVE.Stock up on frozen vegetables like broccoli, spinach, and carrots whenever yougo to a warehouse store like Costco. It’s cheaper than buying fresh and can costyou as little as eleven cents a serving.BOOST ANTIOXIDANTS WITH APPLES, ORANGES, AND BANANAS.Affordable apples and oranges (less than fifty cents each) and bananas (lessthan twenty cents each) are full of vitamins and antioxidants that promotehealth and boost brain performance.SAY CHEESE—LOW-FAT COTTAGE CHEESE, THAT IS.Cottage cheese is packed with protein, calcium, and vitamins A and D. With asingle serving of cottage cheese, you get 13 g protein for about seventy-fivecents. Just make sure you are one of the lucky ones who process dairy. Beinglactose intolerant can drop blood flow to the brain and make you more impulsive.PUMP UP PROTEIN WITH AFFORDABLE EGGS.Getting adequate amounts of protein doesn’t have to involve eating expensivemeat. At less than twenty cents apiece, protein-rich eggs are an affordableoption for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.FILL UP ON HIGH-FIBER, LOW-COST BEANS.Loaded with fiber and high in protein, beans should be a staple in any householdthat is struggling financially. For example, a 1-pound bag of black beans costsless than two dollars, and gives you twelve servings for less than sixteen centseach.STOCK UP ON CANNED TUNA.Eating fish like tuna is a great source of omega-3 fatty acids. You can get athree-pack of tuna for about $2.50, which means for about $.83 a can you get 22grams of protein and a good amount of healthy omega-3 fatty acids. Be carefulnot to overdo the tuna as it may contain some mercury.DRINK TO YOUR BRAIN HEALTH WITH SKIM MILK AND WATER.Low in fat and high in protein and calcium, skim milk is fortified with vitaminsA and D and will only set you back about twenty-five cents for one serving. Youdon’t need to buy pricey bottled water. With a fifteen- to twenty-dollar waterfilter that fits on your kitchen faucet, you can drink from the tap and gethealthy, filtered water that will keep your brain and body hydrated for optimalperformance.SPICE UP YOUR MEALS.With just a few spices in your cupboard, you can enhance the flavor of any dishwithout using a lot of unhealthy butter, cream, or salt. You can find spices fora few dollars each—they’re even cheaper if you can buy them loose where youscoop the spices into bags rather than buying them in a bottle.BECOME A SAVVY SHOPPER.You can save a bundle if you buy items that have a long shelf life—like cannedtuna, beans, oatmeal, barley, and frozen vegetables—in bulk. Look for sales andspecials, use coupons, and buy generic brands when possible. You can even shoponline for many food items or look for coupons online from local stores to findthe best deals.PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHEREating in a brain healthy way is about abundance, not deprivation. It is aboutgreat taste and wise spending. Your attitude here is critical. If you think ofit as a loss of lasagna, you will not stick with it. But when you think ofeating right as a gain in energy, a gain in happiness, and a gain in brainpower,you are much more likely to stay on track. The only thing you will lose isweight.So how do you put this all together? Let me tell you what I do.DR. AMEN’S TYPICAL BRAIN HEALTHY MEALS * I have a protein powder and fruit shake for breakfast. * I bring fresh-cut veggies with a little guacamole to work as a morning snack. * I usually have a 350-calorie chicken, veggie, and avocado sandwich on nine-grain whole wheat bread with green tea for lunch. * I have a piece of fruit and a few raw nuts as an afternoon snack. * For dinner, I will often have a large salad or soup, plenty of veggies, and some form of protein like ahi tuna, wild salmon, or turkey if I need to focus in the evening. For the salad, I always put the dressing on the side. Why? I want to control the calories that go into my body. * And I always have dessert—usually frozen blueberries with Greek yogurt.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“Track your calories in the Daily Journal. It really works!”—AmyWith these brain healthy meals, I usually get eight or nine servings of fruitsand veggies a day. It adds up to about 1,700 calories, which is slightly lessthan the 2,000 calories necessary to maintain my weight. Remember those rhesusmonkeys? I want to be in the group with the better brain, so I choose to eatfewer calories. Plus, I have no cravings, which I truly love, and I feel happyand energetic.To help you put it all together, here are my picks for the top fifteen brainhealthy choices for breakfast, lunch, dinner, desserts, and snacks.

You know, the handful ofnuts you grabbed from the receptionist’s desk, the 200-calorie sports drink youdowned after your workout, the glass of wine you drank while preparing dinner.Since they weren’t part of your “meals,” you may not remember that you consumedthese calories. Then when you aren’t losing weight, you wonder why. “I only atea total of 1,800 calories for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. What’s the problem?”The problem is calorie amnesia. Keeping a food diary is the answer.Tracking your calories in a food journal also doubles your weight loss,according to a 2008 study from Kaiser Permanente’s Center for Health Research.Writing down everything that goes into your body for ten weeks makes youconscious, aware, and more likely to do the right things. It holds youaccountable.A food journal also helps you track your progress. You can flip through it andsee how much better you are doing—how many brain healthy fruits and vegetablesyou are eating, how you have replaced trans fats with healthy fats, how you havelowered your overall calorie intake. Seeing your progress is a tremendousmotivator that will keep you going in the right direction.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“In the Daily Journal there’s a list of ‘weight boosters.’ I had almosteverything on that list—low thyroid, low blood sugar, imbalanced hormones,trouble sleeping, negative thinking. No wonder I wasn’t losing weight before.”—CarrieThe compelling evidence about the effectiveness of keeping a food diary is partof what inspired me to create The Amen Solution Daily Journal. It helps you keeptrack of your calories, and a lot more. After working with thousands ofpatients, I have discovered that tracking not just your calories, but also yourphysical activity, energy levels, sleep, and ANTs can help keep you motivatedand improve your success. I have also found that daily reminders significantlyincrease the likelihood that you will follow through with your new brain healthyhabits.For example, in our Daily Journal, there is a checklist with reminders aboutwhat you need to do on a daily basis to improve your brain health. This listincludes: * Review your One-Page Miracle so you can stay focused on what is important to you * Take your brain healthy supplements, including a multivitamin and fish oil * Do a daily meditation to calm your mind and increase your focus * Drink your daily water requirement, which is half your weight in ouncesThe journal I created is designed to make you more successful in your efforts tolose weight, be happier, and boost your brain. It should take no more than fiveminutes to complete the daily entry and will give you a complete snapshot ofyour journey to better brain health and a better body. At the end of thischapter are sample pages from The Amen Solution Daily Journal to help get youstarted.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I interacted with my Daily Journal. If it said to take a multivitamin, I wrote‘okie-dokie’ next to that. If it said to eat healthy fats like avocado, I wrote‘yummy’ in the margin. It was an interactive experience for me.”—ColleenMany of our weight-loss participants say the journal is the most important toolin our entire program. Sharon is one of them, and she says the time it requiresto fill out each day is well worth the effort. She says that if the number onher scale starts going in the wrong direction, she can review her journal,figure out where she went wrong, and get back on track. So many people thinkthey are doing the right things and don’t understand why the number on the scaleis creeping up, but when you write down your daily behaviors and food intake, itoften becomes glaringly clear where you can make improvements.Sharon also found that recording her daily energy levels in the journal helpedher identify a regularly occurring energy lull in the afternoons. She says shenever would have noticed it if she hadn’t been keeping track. She brought up theissue in our weight-loss group, made a few recommended tweaks to her program,and boosted her afternoon energy level.Log on for long-term weight loss. Keeping a daily journal online can be just ashelpful as using a pen-and-paper variety. In 2010 the researchers at KaiserPermanente found that patients who logged on to an online weight-loss supportgroup and tracked their efforts maintained the greatest weight loss. It wasfindings like these that inspired me to create interactive tools on our websiteso you can fill out the Daily Journal online to keep track of your progress. Thesite also offers calorie counters, brain healthy meal planners, and much more tosupport you in your efforts.So whether you are more comfortable with a pen-and-paper journal you can totewith you in your briefcase or handbag, or an online interactive trackingprogram, the bottom line is, use it every day for greater weight loss.THE AMEN SOLUTION ALL-STARS: RHONA[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_012_r1.jpg]Left: Start, 141 pounds Right: After two ten-week cycles, lost 9 poundsSixty-seven-year-old Rhona didn’t have much weight to lose when she joined ourweight loss group. At 5′1″ and 141 pounds, her BMI was 27, which put her in theoverweight category but not far off from a healthy BMI. Rhona had spent alifetime losing weight and gaining it back. When she was younger, she could drop10 pounds in a couple of weeks, but as she got older, it got harder to shed theextra baggage. She was hoping the Amen Solution would be the answer.Rhona’s answers on the questionnaire didn’t reveal a specific brain type, so shefollowed a general brain healthy program that included the Amen Clinics SevenRules for Brain Healthy Eating, exercising for thirty minutes five to six timesa week, taking fish oil and vitamin D, and using the Daily Journal.For Rhona, journaling proved to be the secret to success. “The best part of theprogram was the journal,” she said. “The journal is the most important tool.That book is so thorough. I got so into it and never missed one day. It kept meaware, motivated, inspired, and on track. I would write what I was feeling, whatsabotaged me yesterday, and how I was going to fix it tomorrow. There are amillion journals out there but none of them are even close to being as thoroughas this one. It isn’t just a tool for the program; it’s a lifetime tool.”With the help of the Daily Journal, Rhona lost 5 pounds after ten weeks anddropped another 4 pounds over the following ten weeks for a total weight loss of9 pounds. But the weight loss isn’t the only thing she gained from the program.“I never expected to learn so much. After learning about how to feed my brain, Iwill never be the same,” she said. “Now I think twice before I put anything inmy mouth and ask myself, ‘Does this feed my brain or dehydrate it?’ ” Some ofher favorite brain healthy foods? Blueberries, red and orange bell peppers, andnuts—things she never had in her kitchen before.Going through the program has also boosted her happiness quotient. Writing inthe journal (which includes a daily gratitude exercise) every morning gets herday off on the right foot. “Now when I wake up, it is in gratitude. That’s how Istart my day. I celebrate my successes and celebrate what I am eating because Iknow it is good for my brain.”SAMPLE PAGES FROMTHE AMEN SOLUTION DAILY JOURNAL[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_013_r1.gif]My Brain Healthy RemindersTip of the day: Love Your BrainToday’s Weight: –––– Hours Slept Last Night: ––––[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_L13_r1.jpg] Review One-Page Miracle[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_L13_r1.jpg] Take brain healthy supplements[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_L13_r1.jpg] Stay within calorie budget[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_L13_r1.jpg] Drink water requirement[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_L13_r1.jpg] Kill the ANTs[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_L13_r1.jpg] Do daily meditation[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_L13_r1.jpg] Eat brain healthy foods[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_L13_r1.jpg] Learn something new[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_L13_r1.jpg] Get 30 minutes of exerciseWORKOUT[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_014_r1.jpg]WRITE 5 THINGS THAT I AM GRATEFUL FOR TODAY: 1.

But as I soon discovered there was clearly not one brainpattern associated with any of these illnesses. They all had multiple types.As we looked at the brains of our overweight patients, we again discovered thatagain there was not one brain pattern associated with being overweight; therewere at least five different types. We saw patterns associated with brains thattended to be compulsive, some that were impulsive, some that were sad, andothers that were anxious—in various combinations.This is exactly the reason why most diets don’t work. They take aone-size-fits-all approach, which from our brain imaging work makes absolutelyno sense at all.A RADICAL NEW LOOKHave you ever gone on a diet with a friend only to see her successfully droppound after pound while you struggle to lose a single ounce? And she feelsenergized and focused while you end up feeling irritated and emotional all thetime? You probably beat yourself up about it, thinking you were doing somethingwrong or weren’t trying hard enough, even though you did exactly what wasrecommended. Your diet buddy might have even accused you of cheating to explainwhy you didn’t lose any weight. After all, the diet plan was working for her, sowhy shouldn’t it work for you?I can explain why it might have worked for your friend but not for you. Thewhole notion that one weight-loss program, diet plan, treatment, or method canwork for everyone is ridiculous. Giving everyone the same diet plan will makesome people better, but it will also make a lot of people worse. So the diet youand your friend tried was probably right for her brain but wrong for your brain.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I read your book and started making some of the changes suggested for the‘problems’ that I have related to my brain. I have introduced what I havelearned so far, and I have lost 7 pounds in the last ten days. I feel so muchbetter! I would like to lose another 15–18 pounds. This would put me at thelower end of normal for my BMI—a place I have not been in many years.”—ClaudiaOther scientists are finally beginning to wake up to the radical idea thatweight-loss plans need to be individualized. A 2010 study on fruit fliesappearing in the journal Genetics reported that rather than diet alone, it wasthe way genes interacted with various diets that had the greatest influence onbody weight. Another team of researchers from Stanford University found thatsome people have a genetic predisposition to respond better to a low-carb dietwhile others benefit more from a low-fat diet. In this 2010 trial involving 133overweight women, women who ate a diet that matched their genetic predispositionlost 5.3 percent of their body weight compared with 2.3 percent for women eatinga diet that conflicted with their genetic predisposition. These two studies backup the concept that when it comes to weight loss, one size does not fit all.Knowing about your own specific brain is the key to losing weight and keeping itoff. It can make it so much easier for you to follow a healthy eating plan. Inthis chapter you will learn about each of the five types of overeaters,including types of diets that could be sabotaging your weight-loss efforts andeating plans that that will help you shed the pounds. In addition, I willintroduce you to behavioral interventions, natural supplements, and whennecessary, medications targeted for each brain type to help you stay on track.Before I describe the five types, I’m going to give you a crash course in Brain101 so you can understand the brain systems that play a major role in yourbehavior. All of these systems can either help or hurt your ability to loseweight and keep it off.[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_016_r1.jpg]PREFRONTAL CORTEX (PFC)Think of the PFC as the CEO of your brain. Situated at the front third of yourbrain, it supervises your life. It is involved with forethought, judgment,impulse control, planning, attention, follow-through, organization, empathy, andlearning from the mistakes you make. The PFC is like the brain’s brakes. Itstops us from saying stupid things or making bad decisions. It is the littlevoice in your head that helps you decide between the peach and the peachcobbler.[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_017_r1.jpg]When the PFC works well, it helps you say no to double cheeseburgers andchocolate pie. When there is low activity in the PFC, it is linked to a lack ofclear goals, procrastination, a short attention span, bad judgment, impulsivity,and not learning from the mistakes you make, which makes you more likely toengage in habits that make you overweight, unhappier, and less intelligent.Alcohol lowers activity in the PFC, which is why people do such stupid thingswhen they get drunk.One of my patients with bulimia tells me that when she goes out to drink withher friends, she often eats more than she wants and subsequently makes herselfthrow up when she gets home. Avoid those things that lower PFC function(alcohol, lack of sleep, brain injuries, etc.).ANTERIOR CINGULATE GYRUS (ACG)I call the ACG the brain’s gear shifter. It runs lengthwise through the deepparts of the frontal lobes and allows us to shift our attention and be flexibleand adaptable and to change when needed. When there is too much activity in thispart of the brain, people tend to become stuck on negative thoughts or negativebehaviors, they tend to worry, hold grudges, and be oppositional orargumentative. It also may make them more vulnerable to being obsessive orstruggle with compulsive behaviors, and it has been linked to eating disorders,such as anorexia. The ACG is also involved in error detection and lets you knowwhen something is wrong or out of place. If it works too hard you tend to seetoo many problems. For example, when some women are premenstrual, serotoninlevels go low, which increases ACG activity and makes them overfocused on whatmakes them unhappy.One of my friends has a very active ACG. She sees way too many errors in herhusband and children. Until we are able to calm this part of her brain, nothingwill help her be happy.DEEP LIMBIC SYSTEMLying near the center of the brain, the deep limbic system is involved insetting a person’s emotional tone. When this area is less active, people tend tobe more positive and hopeful. When it is overactive, negativity can take overand lower motivation and drive, decrease self-esteem, and increase feelings ofguilt and helplessness. Abnormalities in the limbic brain have been associatedwith mood disorders.BASAL GANGLIASurrounding the deep limbic system, the basal ganglia are involved withintegrating thoughts, feelings, and movements. This part of the brain is alsoinvolved in setting a person’s anxiety level. When there is too much activity inthe basal ganglia, people tend to struggle with anxiety and physical stresssymptoms, such as headaches, stomachaches, and muscle tension. High anxietyoften sets the stage for overeating, especially sugary, high-carbohydrate foodsthat have a calming effect. People may overeat to settle their fears or torelieve tension. This area is also involved with feelings of pleasure andecstasy.Cocaine works in this part of the brain to release the pleasure chemicaldopamine. Cookies, cakes, and other sugar-laden, fat-filled treats also activatethis area. Some trials suggest that sugar is actually more addictive thancocaine. For example, a 2007 study conducted by a team of French researchersfound that when rats were allowed to choose between cocaine and water sweetenedwith either saccharin or sucrose, the vast majority of them (94 percent) chosethe sweetened beverages over the cocaine. Not even increases in the doses ofcocaine could lure the rats away from the sweet stuff.TEMPORAL LOBESThe temporal lobes, located underneath your temples and behind your eyes, areinvolved with language, short-term memory, mood stability, and temper issues.They are part of the brain’s “what pathway,” because they help you recognize andname “what” things are. Normal activity in this area generally results in stablemoods and an even keel. Trouble in the temporal lobes often leads to memoryproblems, mood instability, and temper problems.PARIETAL LOBESThe parietal lobes toward the top back part of the brain are involved withsensory processing and direction sense. They are called the “where pathway” inthe brain, because they help you know where things are in space, such asnavigating your way to the kitchen at night in the dark. The parietal lobes areone of the first areas damaged by Alzheimer’s disease, which is why people withthis condition tend to get lost. They have also been implicated in eatingdisorders and self-body distortion syndromes, such as with anorexics who thinkthey are fat.OCCIPITAL LOBESLocated at the back of the brain, the occipital lobes are involved with visionand visual processing.CEREBELLUMLocated at the back bottom part of the brain, the cerebellum is involved withphysical coordination, thought coordination, and processing speed. There arelarge connections between the PFC and the cerebellum, which is why manyscientists think that the cerebellum is also associated with judgment andimpulse control. When there are problems in the cerebellum, people tend tostruggle with physical coordination, slow processing, and have trouble learning.Alcohol is directly toxic to this part of the brain, which is why drunk peopleusually fail sobriety tests that involve balance and coordination moves likebalancing on one leg or touching their fingertip to their nose. Improving thecerebellum through coordination exercises can improve your prefrontal cortex andalso help your judgment and your body.BRIEF BRAIN SYSTEM SUMMARY * Prefrontal cortex—judgment, forethought, planning, and impulse control * Anterior cingulate gyrus—shifting attention and error detection * Deep limbic system—sets emotional tone, involved with mood and bonding * Basal ganglia—integrates thoughts, feelings, and movements, involved with pleasure * Temporal lobes—memory, mood stability, and temper issues, “what pathway” * Parietal lobes—sensory processing and direction sense, “where pathway” * Occipital lobes—vision and visual processing * Cerebellum—motor coordination, thought coordination, processing speed, and judgmentSUMMARY OF THE AMEN CLINICS FIVE TYPES OF OVEREATERSTake the questionnaire in appendix A to see if you fit into a specific type orif you have more than one type, which is common. Based on your answers, you willbe better able to tailor this program for your individual needs so you canfinally get thinner, smarter, and happier.TYPE 1. COMPULSIVE OVEREATERSPeople with this type tend to get stuck on thoughts of food. They hear the icecream in the freezer calling their name—over and over and over again. They getso focused on the French fries they are going to order for lunch that theyforget to join their 11 a.m. conference call. They often feel compulsivelydriven to eat and often say they have no control over food. They also tend to benighttime eaters because they worry and have trouble sleeping.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“No matter what, I just couldn’t stop thinking about food.”—HannahThe basic mechanism of this type is that they tend to get stuck on thoughts orlocked into one course of action. In addition to getting stuck on thoughts aboutfood, they may also get stuck on their worries. They tend to be rigid,inflexible, have trouble seeing options, and feel like they must have thingstheir way, or they get upset.This type is also associated with holding grudges and having problems withoppositional or argumentative behavior. This means that no matter what you askthem, their first response is almost always automatically no. Even if you askthem something that you know they will like, such as if they want to go to theirfavorite restaurant for dinner, they will probably say no.BRAIN SPECT FINDINGS FOR COMPULSIVE OVEREATERSSPECT scans show that compulsive overeaters generally have too much activity inthe front part of their brains, especially in the ACG. When there is too muchactivity in this area, people tend to become stuck on negative thoughts oractions. Overactivity in this part of the brain is most commonly caused by lowlevels of the neurotransmitter serotonin.Healthy Scan Compulsive Overeater[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_018_r1.jpg]This view is called our active scan, looking at areas of increased activity.Gray indicates average activity, whereas white indicates the top 15 percent. Inthis view we are looking up from the bottom, where the top is the front part ofthe brain and the bottom is the back part of the brain. In a healthy scan inadults, the back part of the brain (cerebellum) is usually the most active. Incompulsive overeaters generally there is too much activity in the front part oftheir brains so they have trouble overthinking.WHAT MAKES COMPULSIVE OVEREATERS WORSEThe following types of diets, beverages, supplements, and medications can makethis type worse and make it almost impossible to stick to a weight-loss plan. * High-protein diets, which tend to be concentration diets and help people focus. On diets like the Atkins diet, compulsive overeaters focus more on the things that upset them. This doesn’t mean you should avoid protein completely, just focus more on healthy carbohydrates. I was on The Rachael Ray Show in 2010 talking about different brain types. When I mentioned that certain diets can make people worse, Rachael became very animated and said, “I tried that no-carb, low-carb diet for three days and I was the most angry, irritable person. I am lucky my husband didn’t leave me.” * Caffeinated beverages or caffeine pills * Diet pills, such as phentermine * Stimulants, such as Ritalin or AdderallWHAT WORKS FOR COMPULSIVE OVEREATERSCompulsive overeaters do best when we find natural ways to increase serotonin,which is calming to the brain. In addition, learning how to get unstuck fromthoughts about food and worries can be helpful. * Eat complex carbohydrates and other brain healthy foods that help the body produce more serotonin, such as these recommended by my friend and colleague Dr. Eric Braverman, author of Younger You: * Bananas * Beets * Brown rice * Cottage cheese (I recommend 1% or fat-free) * Herbal teas * Mackerel * Salmon * Sunflower seeds * Swiss cheese (I recommend low fat) * Turkey (I recommend skinless) * Get enough physical exercise, which boosts serotonin levels. (See chapter 7 [Amen_9780307463623_epub_c07_r1.htm] for more on which types of exercise are best for this type.) * Avoiding nighttime eating after dinner. New research suggests that people who eat late at night gain even more weight than people who eat the same number of calories during the day. It seems that eating late at night throws off your internal clock so that your body decides to store more fat. I know many people who say that the only time they feel hungry is at night, but that is usually because they have a lot of bad brain habits, like skipping breakfast or going too long in between meals. * If you get a thought in your head more than three times, do something to distract yourself. * Make a list of ten things you can do instead of eating so you can distract yourself. * People with this type always do better with choices, rather than edicts. Do not tell them where you are going to eat or what they are going to eat; give them choices. * Avoid automatically opposing others or saying no, even to yourself. * If you have trouble sleeping, try a glass of warm milk with a teaspoon of vanilla and a few drops of stevia. * Supplements, such as 5-HTP, the B vitamin inositol, and saffron, L-tryptophan, and St. John’s wort increase serotonin. In fact, there is good scientific evidence that indicates 5-HTP helps with weight loss, and in my experience, I have found that it works best for this type. (See chapter 5 [Amen_9780307463623_epub_c05_r1.htm] for more on how these supplements work.) * When other interventions do not work, serotonin-enhancing medications, such as Prozac, Zoloft, Celexa, or Lexapro can be helpful.MEET AMY, A COMPULSIVE OVEREATERAmy is an ICU nurse who fit this type perfectly. She felt as though she couldn’tstop herself from eating and thought about food constantly throughout the day.She likened her thoughts to a little mouse on an exercise wheel; even though themouse was exhausted, he couldn’t get off. Caffeine and diet pills made Amyanxious because her brain did not need more stimulation. She often felt asthough she needed a glass of wine at night—or two or three—to calm her worries.No diet would work for Amy long term until we calmed her brain. Using thestrategies listed above, Amy lost 45 pounds over a year.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“If I saw food, I ate it. Now I can look at it and say no.”—JohnTYPE 2. IMPULSIVE OVEREATERSPeople with this type struggle with impulsivity and have trouble controllingtheir behavior, even though they begin each day with good intentions to eatwell. People with this type don’t think about food constantly, but whenever theysee it, they can’t resist. If they drive past their favorite burger joint, theyare likely to stop even if they aren’t really hungry. They have a hard timesaying no when someone offers them a second—or third or fourth—slice of pizza,piece of cake, or helping of mashed potatoes.One of my best friends is a perfect example of this type. He is on a diet everysingle day of his life. He wakes up every morning committed to the idea ofeating right. He maintains that thought as he passes the first doughnut shop,but then he starts to sweat as he passes the second doughnut shop, and by thetime he passes the third one he has no willpower left. After completely givingup on his plans by noon, he utters the famous words of all impulsive overeaters:“I’ll start my diet … tomorrow.”SPECT FINDINGS FOR IMPULSIVE OVEREATERSThe most common brain SPECT finding in this type is decreased activity in thePFC, which is most commonly associated with low levels of the neurotransmitterdopamine. Impulsive overeating is common among people who have ADD, which hasalso been associated with low dopamine levels in the brain. People with ADDstruggle with a short attention span, distractibility, disorganization, andimpulsivity.Research suggests that having untreated ADD nearly doubles the risk for beingoverweight. Without proper treatment, it is nearly impossible for these peopleto be consistent with any nutrition plan. My research team and I have publishedseveral studies showing that when people with ADD try to concentrate theyactually get less activity in the PFC, which will cause them to have even lesscontrol over their own behavior. For these people, literally, the harder theytry to lose weight the worse it gets.Impulsive overeaters may also be the result of some form of toxic exposure, anear-drowning accident, a brain injury to the front part of the brain, or abrain infection, such as chronic fatigue syndrome. Overweight smokers and heavycoffee drinkers also tend to fit this type.WHAT MAKES IMPULSIVE OVEREATERS WORSEAnything that boosts serotonin in the brain will calm the brain and make thistype worse because it can lower both your worries and your impulse control,giving new meaning to the term fat and happy. Things that deplete dopaminelevels are also a problem. These include: * High-carbohydrate diets * Alcohol, caffeine, and sugar deplete dopamineImpulsive Overeater: The Harder You Try, the Worse It Gets[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_019_r1.jpg]Notice that with concentration there is overall decreased activity, especiallyin the prefrontal cortex at the top of the image. * Stress * Serotonin-enhancing supplements, such as 5-HTP * Serotonin-enhancing medications, such as Prozac, Zoloft, or LexaproWHAT WORKS FOR IMPULSIVE OVEREATERSWe help impulsive overeaters by boosting dopamine levels and strengthening theprefrontal cortex. * Eat brain healthy foods that are high in phenylalanine and tyrosine, the building blocks for creating dopamine. Dr. Braverman has identified the following brain healthy foods as dopamine boosters: * Chicken (I recommend skinless) * Cottage cheese (I recommend 1% or fat-free) * Eggs (I recommend DHA-enriched eggs or egg whites) * Granola * Oat flakes (I recommend old-fashioned or steel-cut oats) * Ricotta cheese (I recommend low-fat) * Turkey (I recommend skinless) * Yogurt (I recommend low-fat and unsweetened) * Higher-protein diets that are lower in simple carbohydrates (this means it’s okay to eat the zucchini but not the zucchini muffins; okay to eat the carrots but not the carrot cake) tend to help this type. * Exercise, especially doing an exercise you love, helps increase blood flow and dopamine in the brain. (See chapter 7 [Amen_9780307463623_epub_c07_r1.htm] for more on which types of exercise are best for this type.) * Focus by making a list of weight and health goals and put it where you can see it every day. * Line up some outside supervision. Have someone you trust check in with you on a regular basis to help you stay focused. * Avoid impulsively saying yes to offers for more food or drink and practice saying, “No, thank you, I’m full.” * From a supplement standpoint, green tea, rhodiola, and L-tyrosine are helpful. * Stimulant medications—such as Adderall or Ritalin, which are commonly used to treat ADD, or phentermine—can be effective.MEET GAYLE, AN IMPULSIVE OVEREATERI met Gayle when she volunteered to come up on stage and get scanned when Iappeared on The Huckabee Show with Governor Mike Huckabee. Gayle, thirty-nine,is 5′0″ (on a good day) and weighed 165 pounds. Before the show, she took ouronline questionnaire, which showed her to be an impulsive overeater. Before wewent on air, we performed a QEEG test on her to measure electrical activity inthe brain. Gayle’s QEEG showed excessive theta, or slow, brain wave activity inthe front part of her brain, confirming her brain pattern.When I asked her about herself, she gave me the classic history for havinglifetime ADD. She was distracted, off task, disorganized, and impulsive. Sheworked as a meeting planner and was constantly on the go. Years before, she hadher colon removed because she had ulcerative colitis. She also had low thyroid,sleep apnea, and was a survivor of ovarian cancer and six rounds ofchemotherapy. Certainly the low thyroid, sleep apnea, and chemotherapy could bethe cause of the low activity we found in her brain, but Gayle said the ADDsymptoms were present in childhood. She had even brought up the issue of ADDwith her therapist, who dismissed it as being part of a creative personality.[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_020_r1.jpg]Gayle, a Type 2 Impulsive Overeater, on The Huckabee Show wearing a QEEG capthat measures electrical activity in the brainThe problem is that if you have low activity in your PFC you cannot beconsistent with any nutritional plan or health program. You do not have themental horsepower. Note that this does not mean that you are not intelligentenough—it just means that you don’t have a PFC that is strong enough to put onthe brakes when necessary.Balancing her brain was critical to helping her be successful. The plan I gaveGayle included a diet higher in protein and lower in simple carbohydrates, whichshould help improve her focus. I also recommended that she write out cleargoals, exercise at least four or five times a week, and take green tea andrhodiola. I told her that if the supplement was not strong enough to help her,then she should get treated for ADD with either a stimulant medicine, such asAdderall, or the appetite-suppressant phentermine.TYPE 3. IMPULSIVE-COMPULSIVE OVEREATERSGET SMART TO GET THINNER“I found out I was a Type 3. Since I started balancing my brain, losing weighthas become fun and easy. It’s not a chore.”—GinaPeople with this type have a combination of both impulsive and compulsivefeatures. On the surface it seems almost contradictory. How can you be bothimpulsive and compulsive at the same time? Think of compulsive gambling. Theseare people who are compulsively driven to gamble and yet have very littlecontrol over their impulses. It is the same with these overeaters. Many peoplewith bulimia also have this type.These people often think about food all day long! For some, it can be 8:30 a.m.,and they are already daydreaming about the beef-and-cheese lasagna they aregoing to have for dinner that night. Then, as they drive home from work on theirway to that delectable meal, they pass by a fast-food restaurant and think,“Hey, some French fries would go really great with that lasagna. I’d betterstop.” The next thing they know, they have ordered not only a side of fries butalso a bacon cheeseburger and a vanilla shake, which they devour in the car onthe way home. Once they get home, they are no longer hungry but can’t resist thelure of that cheesy lasagna that is waiting in the fridge. About 3,000 calories,80 g saturated fat, and 100 g sugar later, they feel sick and disgusted withthemselves and vow to do better tomorrow.I have seen this type particularly common in children and grandchildren ofalcoholics or people who have a significant family history of alcoholism. In themid-1980s I noticed a connection between children and grandchildren ofalcoholics and the combination of both impulsivity and compulsivity. My firstwife grew up in an abusive alcoholic home. As a way to understand her better Istarted to research children of alcoholics. My work with brain SPECT helped meto understand this pattern further and we often saw increased ACG activity withlower PFC activity. Many of these patients did great on a combination ofmedications or supplements to raise both serotonin and dopamine.Cherrie had bulimia as a teenager, and at age fifty-two she still struggled withbingeing and purging whenever she was stressed. She was chronically 30 poundsoverweight and hated how she looked. She vacillated between being obsessiveabout her housework to being overwhelmed and disorganized. Many people in herfamily struggled with alcohol and other addictions. Cherrie had tried a numberof diets without any success, until the fen-phen craze of the 1990s. Rememberfen-phen? It was a combination of medications that increased both serotonin anddopamine. She did really well on it, losing 30 pounds, and felt more emotionallystable than at any time in her life. When fen-phen was pulled from the marketbecause it caused medical problems, Cherrie relapsed and went back on heremotional and weight roller coaster. Without a balanced brain, she could notbalance her weight.Finally, Cherrie came to see us for help. On treatment to raise both serotoninand dopamine levels, she felt much more emotionally balanced and consistentlylost weight.SPECT FINDINGS FOR IMPULSIVE-COMPULSIVE OVEREATERSOur scans tend to show too much activity in the ACG, so people overthink and getstuck on negative thoughts, but they also have too little activity in the PFC sothey have trouble putting on the brakes and saying no. The low activity in thePFC is likely due to low dopamine levels, and the high activity in the ACG isassociated with low serotonin levels.WHAT MAKES IMPULSIVE-COMPULSIVE OVEREATERS WORSEUsing serotonin or dopamine interventions by themselves usually makes theproblem worse. For example: * Using a serotonin medication or supplement helps to calm the compulsions but makes the impulsivity worse. * Using a dopamine medication or supplement helps to lessen the impulsivity but increases the compulsive behaviors.Impulsive-Compulsive Overeater[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_021_r1.jpg]WHAT WORKS FOR IMPULSIVE-COMPULSIVE OVEREATERSIn my experience, I have found that people with this type do best withtreatments that raise both serotonin and dopamine. People with this mixed typetend to have done very well emotionally and behaviorally on the fen-phencombination, which raised both dopamine and serotonin in the brain. Plus, it isimportant to strengthen the PFC and practice strategies to help you get unstuck. * Exercise. (See chapter 7 [Amen_9780307463623_epub_c07_r1.htm] for more on which types of exercise are best for this type.) * Set goals. * Avoid automatically opposing others or saying no, even to yourself. * Avoid impulsively saying yes. * Have options. * Distract yourself if you get a thought stuck in your head. * From a supplement standpoint, combining green tea (for dopamine) and 5-HTP (for serotonin) can be helpful. * When medications are necessary, combining phentermine (for dopamine) and Lexapro (for serotonin) may be effective.MEET SHANICE, AN IMPULSIVE-COMPULSIVE OVEREATERShanice, thirty-three, always had a sweet tooth. As a child, she would sprinklesugar on her Lucky Charms, put gummy bears and chocolate chips on top of her icecream, and dip her toast in maple syrup. As an adult, her taste buds didn’tchange. She still craved sweets and would nibble on cookies on the way to work,munch on candy bars after lunch, and eat at least three scoops of ice cream lateat night. Shanice was plagued by negative thoughts, and whenever she feltstressed she would turn to treats for comfort. The extra calories had added 40pounds to her body, and she hated the way she looked. In her twenties, shedeveloped bulimia in an effort to keep the weight off in spite of heroverindulgences. Shanice came to see us to deal with her emotions following thedeath of her father, who had been an alcoholic for most of his life.She had features of both impulsivity and compulsivity, and her SPECT scansshowed both an overactive ACG and an underactive PFC. On treatment to raise bothserotonin and dopamine, plus the behavioral strategies listed on this page,Shanice finally got control of her cravings for sweets. Combined withpsychotherapy, she was able to overcome her bulimia and finally lose weight andkeep it off.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“My problems with eating started very, very young. If I could find a piece ofbread, that’s what I would eat to make painful feelings inside go away.”—JeannieTYPE 4. SAD OR EMOTIONAL OVEREATERSPeople with this type tend to use food to medicate underlying feelings ofsadness and to calm the emotional storms in their brains. They often strugglewith feelings of boredom, loneliness, depression, low self-esteem, and painissues. Sad or emotional overeaters may also experience decreased libido,periods of crying, low energy levels, suicidal thoughts, and lack of interest inusually pleasurable activities, as well as feelings of guilt, helplessness,hopelessness, or worthlessness. For some people, these feelings come and go withthe seasons and tend to worsen in winter. Others experience mild feelings ofchronic sadness, called dysthymia. Still others suffer from more seriousdepressions. This type is more commonly seen in women.SPECT FINDINGS FOR SAD OR EMOTIONAL OVEREATERSThe SPECT findings that correlate with this type are markedly increased activityin the deep limbic areas of the brain and decreased PFC activity. Treating mooddisorders with behavioral interventions, natural supplements, and medicationwhen needed, can be the key to weight loss.When this type occurs in the winter, it is usually in more northern climates,where there is often a deficiency in sunlight and vitamin D levels. Having lowlevels of vitamin D, known as the “sunshine” vitamin, has been associated withdepression, memory problems, obesity, heart disease, and immune suppression.Vitamin D deficiencies are becoming more common in our society for two reasons:We are wearing more sunscreen and we are spending more time indoors.Some researchers believe nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population suffers from avitamin D deficiency. I screen all of my patients for it by ordering a 25hydroxy-vitamin D level. When we tested the vitamin D levels of more than thirtyparticipants in our first weight-loss group, I was shocked to discover thateverybody’s levels were low, and this study took place in sunny SouthernCalifornia!WHAT MAKES SAD OR EMOTIONAL OVEREATERS WORSECertain behaviors can keep you mired in sadness, including: * Letting yourself get stuck in negative thinking patterns * Isolating yourself from friends and family * Skimping on sleepWHAT WORKS FOR SAD OR EMOTIONAL OVEREATERSIf you are a sad or emotional overeater, focus on activities and interventionsthat energize you and lift your mood.[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_022_r1.jpg] * Exercise increases blood flow and multiple neurotransmitters in the brain and has been shown to be a mood booster. Several studies have found it to be as effective as antidepressant medication. (See chapter 7 [Amen_9780307463623_epub_c07_r1.htm] for more on which types of exercise are best for this type.) * Kill the ANTs (automatic negative thoughts) that steal your happiness (more on this later). * Write down five things you are grateful for every day. This has been shown to increase your level of happiness in just three weeks. * Volunteer to help others, which helps to get you outside of yourself and less focused on your own internal problems. * Surround yourself with great smells, such as lavender. This scent of lavender has been the subject of countless research studies, which show that it reduces cortisol levels and promotes relaxation and stress reduction. * Try melatonin to help you sleep. * Work to improve your relationships. Social bonding can help calm hyperactivity in the deep limbic system and enhance your mood. * Increase your intake of omega-3 fatty acids by eating more fish, walnuts, avocados, and green leafy vegetables and/or taking a fish oil supplement (such as my Omega-3 Power). Low levels of omega-3 fatty acids have been associated with depression and obesity. * Have your vitamin D levels checked and correct them if they are too low. Vitamin D supplements can help. Bright light therapy may also be helpful to correct vitamin D problems, help with mood states, and help people lose weight. There is evidence that bright light therapy might enhance the effectiveness of physical activity for weight loss. It significantly reduced the binge-eating episodes in people with bulimia and is an effective treatment for seasonal affective disorder (winter blues). It has even been shown to be more effective than Prozac for these patients. Using bright light therapy in the workplace was effective in improving mood, energy, alertness, and productivity. * Check your DHEA blood levels. DHEA is a master hormone that has been found to be low in many people with depression and obesity. Supplementing with DHEA has good scientific evidence that it is helpful for weight loss in certain patients. * Another helpful treatment for emotional overeaters is the natural supplement SAMe, in dosages of 400 to 1,600 mg. Be careful with SAMe if you have ever experienced a manic episode and take it early in the day as it has energizing properties and may interfere with sleep. * If medication is necessary, I like Wellbutrin for this type, which has been shown to have weight-reducing properties.MEET PAUL, A SAD OR EMOTIONAL OVEREATERPaul was a supervisor at Boeing, located near Seattle. Over time he noticed thatparticularly in the winter, his weight would go up and his mood would go down.He struggled with depression for many years. Paul’s problem wasn’t a lack ofwillpower; it was his brain. His SPECT scan showed too much activity in thelimbic or emotional part of his brain, which is commonly seen in mood disordersand in people who have had emotional trauma. Of note, Paul also had a very lowvitamin D level, which has recently been associated with weight problems. ForPaul, exercising and taking vitamin D, fish oil, and SAMe helped balance hisbrain, improve his mood, boost his energy, and keep the weight off in thewinter.TYPE 5. ANXIOUS OVEREATERSPeople with this type tend to medicate their feelings of anxiety, tension,nervousness, and fear with food. They tend to feel uncomfortable in their ownskin. They may be plagued by feelings of panic, fear, and self-doubt, and sufferphysical symptoms of anxiety, such as muscle tension, nail biting, headaches,abdominal pain, heart palpitations, shortness of breath, and sore muscles. It isas if they have an overload of tension and emotion. People with this type tendto predict the worst and often complain of waiting for something bad to happen.They may be excessively shy, easily startled, and freeze in emotionally chargedsituations.SPECT FINDINGS FOR ANXIOUS OVEREATERSThe brain scans of anxious overeaters often show increased activity in the basalganglia, which is commonly caused by low levels of the calming neurotransmitterGABA.WHAT MAKES ANXIOUS OVEREATERS WORSECertain behaviors and substances can exacerbate feelings of anxiety and make youmore likely to eat in an attempt to make those feelings go away. For example:[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_023_r1.jpg]GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I ate to comfort and soothe my high anxiety.”—Sean * Focusing on the negative * Believing every negative thought you have * For some anxious overeaters, consuming too much caffeine or other stimulating substances * Drinking alcoholWHAT WORKS FOR ANXIOUS OVEREATERSInterventions to boost GABA combined with relaxation techniques that calm thebrain are generally the most helpful. As with Type 4 Sad or EmotionalOvereaters, many of the people who followed my home study course on overcominganxiety and depression found that using the strategies to calm anxiety led tosignificant weight loss. * Eat brain healthy foods that are high in the amino acid glutamine, a precursor to GABA. Dr. Braverman has identified the following brain healthy foods as being rich in GABA. * Bananas * Broccoli * Brown rice * Citrus fruit * Halibut * Herbal teas * Lentils * Nuts * Oatmeal * Spinach * Whole grains * Exercise. (See chapter 7 [Amen_9780307463623_epub_c07_r1.htm] for more on which types of exercise are best for this type.) * Try relaxation techniques, such as: * Meditation * Prayer * Hypnosis * Deep diaphragmatic breathing exercises * Hand-warming techniques * Kill the anxious ANTs. * For sleep, try self-hypnosis, kava kava, or valerian root. * Vitamin B6, magnesium, lemon balm, and GABA boost GABA in the brain. * From a medication standpoint, the anticonvulsant Topamax has strong evidence it is helpful for weight loss, and in my experience, it is especially helpful for this type.MEET CONNIE, AN ANXIOUS OVEREATERConnie felt nervous most of the time. She was always waiting for something badto happen—anticipating that her husband might get in a car accident or that shemight get cancer. She frequently suffered from headaches and stomach problems.Marijuana helped relax her, but she hated doing something illegal. Food workedvery well to calm her down, but being 5′2″ and 165 pounds made her very unhappy.Connie’s SPECT study showed too much activity in the basal ganglia. For Connie,no diet would help her lose weight until her brain was better. By soothingConnie’s brain with meditation and hypnosis, plus using a combination of B6,magnesium, and GABA (found in GABA Calming Support), she felt more relaxed andstopped overeating. She lost 20 pounds over the next year without trying andnoticed a big boost in her energy.THE AMEN SOLUTION ALL-STARS: EILEEN[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_024_r1.jpg]Left: Before, 187 pounds Right: After three ten-week cycles, lost 39 poundsEileen was so excited about her weight loss after participating in our programthat she agreed to appear with me on The Rachael Ray Show to talk about hersuccess. When Eileen joined the group, she weighed 187 pounds. By the end of theten-week program, she had lost more than 15 pounds. She loved the program somuch she took it again … and again. After twenty weeks, she had lost 26 pounds,and by the end of her third weight-loss cycle, she had lost 39 pounds, bringingher to 148 pounds. Since starting the program, she has gone down a total of fivepant sizes.When she took our questionnaire, she discovered that she was a Type 5 AnxiousOvereater. She used food to comfort her and soothe her anxiety. Knowing thishelped her focus on reducing her anxiety so she could finally lose some weight.For Eileen, the most valuable part of the program was the Daily Journal. “Ifound the whole journal so helpful,” she said. “It helps me think about thethings I’m grateful for and helps me keep track of exercise. I can look at myday and say, ‘Oh, here I blew it, but I can do better tomorrow.’ Plus it hasmade me so much more thoughtful about what I choose to eat and more aware ofwhat I’m eating. I had no idea how often I was eating without even realizing itand without really enjoying it.”She found that the Daily Journal helped keep her honest about her food intake.Tracking her calories also revealed something unexpected. She discovered thatshe would go long stretches without eating, which resulted in low blood sugarlevels. As she learned in the weight-loss group, having low blood sugar canheighten feelings of anxiety and lower activity in the PFC, a combination thatcan lead to poor eating decisions. Eating more frequently throughout the day hashelped her make better choices, like when she recently went to one of those hugebuffets in Las Vegas. “I ate much healthier than I would have before,” she said.“I don’t even get tempted as much anymore by the things that aren’t brainhealthy.”Eileen used to reach for sweets when she felt anxious, but now she has so muchless stress that the cravings for cookies, ice cream, and pie aren’t reallythere anymore. Plus she has learned how to enjoy her favorite flavors in ahealthier way by making simple food swaps. Here’s how she does it: “I just put alittle cinnamon and stevia on apples and it tastes like apple pie. I putpowdered egg whites, stevia, frozen strawberries, and water in the blender andit tastes like a strawberry shake. I have pecans and a little unsweetenedcoconut and it tastes like pecan pie. Of course, I measure everything out tomake sure I’m staying within my calorie limit.”For Eileen, the journal also served as a daily reminder to practiceanxiety-reducing techniques, such as talking back to her ANTs. And like manyType 5 Anxious Overeaters, Eileen had a lot of ANTs. “I used to think I wasn’tgood enough,” she admitted. “But thanks to the daily reminders, I kill my ANTsevery day. It has become an automatic part of my day. My thinking has reallychanged. Having positive thoughts helps me get rid of my ANTs and reduce myanxiety.”DO YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE TYPE?Having more than one type is common. For example, Type 3 Impulsive-CompulsiveOvereaters is actually a combination of Type 1 Compulsive Overeaters and Type 2Impulsive Overeaters. When you have more than one type, it just means that youmay need a combination of interventions. With some combinations, you may onlyneed to use the dominant treatment rather than trying to treat both types.To help you understand which interventions are best if you have more than onetype, I have created the following matrix. Of course, it is always smart todiscuss these options with your health care provider. If he or she does not knowmuch about natural treatments, consult a naturopath or a physician trained inintegrative medicine or natural treatments.If you have: Use: Types 1, 4 Type 1 interventions Types 1, 5 Type 1interventions Types 1, 4, 5 Type 1 interventions Types 2, 4 Type 2 interventionsTypes 2, 5 Types 2 and 5 interventions Types 2, 4, 5 Types 2 and 5 interventionsTypes 3, 4 Type 3 interventions Types 3, 5 Type 3 interventions Types 3, 4, 5Type 3 interventions Types 4, 5 Types 4 and 5 interventionsSUMMARY TABLE OF THE FIVE TYPES OF OVEREATERS[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_025_r1.gif]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_L07_r1.jpg]If you are overweight, you have probably gazed longingly at those ads for“miracle drugs” that melt fat away. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, butthere is no pill that is going to do all the work for you. Supplements willnever work by themselves if you eat too much or do not exercise. What naturalsupplements can do, however, is help optimize your brain so it will be easierfor you to be able to follow a brain healthy program.Some supplements are so vital to brain health that I recommend them foreverybody regardless of brain type. Other supplements are best geared tospecific brain types to help balance those brains. Taking the right supplementsfor your brain type can jump-start your quest to be thinner, smarter, andhappier.Before I go into detail about each supplement, let me explain why I advocatetheir use. In treating people, one question I always ask myself is, what would Iprescribe if you were my mother, my wife, or my child? More and more, afternearly thirty years of being a psychiatrist, I find myself recommending naturaltreatments. I am not opposed to medications, and I have prescribed them for along time, but I want you to use all of the tools available, especially if theyare effective, less expensive, and have fewer side effects.One of the cases that got me interested specifically in natural treatmentsinvolved my own niece. When she was seven my sister brought her to see me forproblems with moodiness and her temper. I tried her on a number of medicationswithout any success. My sister was calling me, upset, three times a week. I keptusing stronger and stronger medicines. But medications are not without risks andside effects, and when my niece started to gain weight I stopped them anddecided to try her on a group of natural supplements that I had heard about froma colleague.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“It’s so amazing to finally discover that the reason you can’t lose weight isn’tbecause you aren’t trying hard enough, it’s because your brain needs a littlehelp.”—RobOne day about four months later I realized that I hadn’t heard anything from mysister in a long time. So I called her and said, “Hey, don’t you love meanymore? How’s my niece?”She said, “Danny, you cannot believe the difference in her. She is so muchbetter. She is calmer, more compliant, and she is getting straight As inschool.” The supplements have had long-term benefits for her without any sideeffects.PROS AND CONS OF SUPPLEMENTSOver time it made sense to start with natural supplements and then use medicinesif the supplements didn’t work. So, let’s talk about the pros and cons of usingnatural supplements to help the brain. To start, they are often effective. Theyusually have dramatically fewer side effects than most prescription medicationsand they are significantly less expensive. Plus, you never have to tell aninsurance company that you have taken them. As awful as it sounds, takingprescription medications can affect your insurability. I know many people whohave been denied or made to pay higher rates for insurance because they havetaken certain medications. If there are natural alternatives, they are worthconsidering.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I just took it for granted that my brain was okay. I had never really thoughtabout it before. But now I understand that I need to balance my brain.”—SherriYet natural supplements also have their own set of problems. Even though theytend to be less expensive than medications, they may be more expensive for youbecause they are usually not covered by insurance. Many people are unaware thatnatural supplements can have side effects and need to be thoughtfully used. Justbecause something is natural does not mean it is innocuous. Both arsenic andcyanide are natural, but that doesn’t mean they are good for you. For example,St. John’s Wort, one of my favorite natural antidepressants, can cause sunsensitivity and it can also decrease the effectiveness of a number ofmedications, including birth control pills. Oh, great! Get depressed, pick upsome St. John’s Wort from the grocery store, and now you’re accidentallypregnant. Not a good thing.One of the major concerns about natural supplements is the lack of qualitycontrol. There is variability and you need to find brands you trust. Anotherdisadvantage is that many people get their advice about supplements from theteenage clerk at the health food store who may not have the best information.But, even when looking at the problems, the benefits of natural supplements makethem worth considering, especially if you can get thoughtful, research-basedinformation.Every day I personally take a handful of supplements that I believe make asignificant difference in my life. They have helped to change the health of mybrain, my energy, and my lab values. Many physicians say that if you eat abalanced diet you do not need supplements. I love what Dr. Mark Hyman wrote inhis book The UltraMind Solution: Fix Your Broken Brain by Healing Your BodyFirst. He wrote that if people “eat wild, fresh, organic, local, non–geneticallymodified food grown in virgin mineral- and nutrient-rich soils that has not beentransported across vast distances and stored for months before being eaten … andwork and live outside, breathe only fresh unpolluted air, drink only pure, cleanwater, sleep nine hours a night, move their bodies every day, and are free fromchronic stressors and exposure to environmental toxins,” then it is possiblethat they might not need supplements. Because we live in a fast-paced societywhere we pick up food on the fly, skip meals, eat sugar-laden treats, buyprocessed foods, and eat foods that have been chemically treated, we could alluse a little help from a multiple vitamin and mineral supplements.AMEN CLINIC SUPPLEMENTSAt the Amen Clinics we make our own line of supplements that have taken over adecade to develop. The reason I developed this line was that I wanted mypatients and my own family to have access to the highest-quality research-basedsupplements available. After I started recommending supplements to my patientsthey would go to the supermarket, drugstore, or health food store and have somany choices that they did not know what or how to choose. Plus, there isvariability of quality in the supplements available.Another reason I developed my own line was that the Amen Clinics sees a highpopulation of people who have ADD. I realized if they did not get theirsupplements as they walked out the door, they would forget about it orprocrastinate and not have started them by their next appointment.Research shows the therapeutic benefit of using supplements in treating mild tomoderate depression, insomnia, and cognitive impairment. I strongly recommendthat when purchasing a supplement, you consult your health care practitioner todetermine which supplements and dosages may be most effective for you. Ourwebsite (www.amenclinics.com [http://www.amenclinics.com]) contains links to thescientific literature on many different supplements related to brain health, soyou, as a consumer, can be fully informed on the benefits and risks involved.Please remember supplements can have very powerful effects on the body andcaution should be used when combining them with prescription medications.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I started taking a high-quality multivitamin plus the fish oil and vitamin Dand reduced the amount of wine I was drinking. After just a few weeks, I’malready sleeping better and feeling more energetic.”—NoelleTHREE SUPPLEMENTS FOR EVERYBODYThere are three supplements I typically recommend to all of my patients becausethey are critical to optimal brain function: a multivitamin, fish oil, andvitamin D.MULTIVITAMINSAccording to recent studies, more than 50 percent of Americans do not eat atleast five servings of fruits and vegetables a day, the minimum required to getthe nutrition you need. I recommend that all of my patients take a high-qualitymultivitamin / mineral complex every day. In an editorial in the Journal of theAmerican Medical Association, researchers recommended a daily vitamin foreverybody because it helps prevent chronic illness. In addition, people withweight-management issues often are not eating healthy diets and have vitamin andnutrient deficiencies. Moreover, research suggests that people who take amultiple vitamin actually have younger-looking DNA.A 2010 study from Northumbria University tested their effects on 215 men betweenthe ages of thirty and fifty-five. For the double-blind, placebo-controlledstudy, the men were tested on mental performance and asked to rate themselves ongeneral mental health, stress, and mood. At the debut of the trial, there wereno significant differences between the multivitamin group and the placebo group.When the participants were restested a little over one month later, themultivitamin group reported improved moods and showed better mental performance,helping participants be happier and smarter! Not only that, but the multivitamingroup reported an improved sense of vigor, reduced stress, and less mentalfatigue after completing mental tasks.Another placebo-controlled study from Northumbria researchers tested the effectsof multivitamins on eighty-one healthy children aged eight to fourteen. Theyfound that the children who took multivitamins performed better on two out ofthree attention tasks. The researchers concluded that multivitamins have thepotential to improve brain function in healthy children.FISH OILFor years, I have been writing about the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids, whichare found in fish oil supplements. I personally take a fish oil supplement everyday and recommend that all of my patients do the same. When you look at themountain of scientific evidence, it is easy to understand why. Research hasfound that omega-3 fatty acids are essential for optimal brain and body health.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“Now that I have learned about omega-3 fatty acids, I tell all the people I workwith that it’s important for them to take their fish oil.”—LizFor example, according to researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health,having low levels of omega-3 fatty acids is one of the leading preventablecauses of death and has been associated with heart disease, strokes, depression,suicidal behavior, ADD, dementia, and obesity. Scientific evidence also pointsto a link between low levels of omega-3 fatty acids and substance abuse. In myexperience, I have found that overeating is a form of substance abuse.I can tell you that most people, unless they are focusing on eating fish ortaking fish oil supplements, have low omega-3 levels. I know this because at theAmen Clinics we perform a blood test on patients that measures their levels ofomega-3 fatty acids. Before I began offering the test to patients, I tested iton my employees, several family members, and of course, myself. When my testresults came back, I was very happy with the robust numbers. An omega-3 scoreabove 7 is good. Mine was nearly 11. But the results for nearly all of theemployees and family members I tested were not so good. In fact, I was horrifiedat how low their levels were, which put them at greater risk for both physicaland emotional problems. It is an easy fix. They just needed to eat more fish ortake fish oil supplements.Boosting your intake of omega-3 fatty acids is one of the best things you can dofor your brainpower, mood, and weight. The two most studied omega-3 fatty acidsare eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). DHA makes up alarge portion of the gray matter of the brain. The fat in your brain forms cellmembranes and plays a vital role in how our cells function. Neurons are alsorich in omega-3 fatty acids. EPA improves blood flow, which boosts overall brainfunction.How fish oil helps make you thinner. Increasing omega-3 intake has been found todecrease appetite and cravings and reduce body fat. In a fascinating 2009 studyin the British Journal of Nutrition, Australian researchers analyzed bloodsamples from 124 adults (twenty-one healthy weight, forty overweight, andsixty-three obese), calculated their BMI, and measured their waist and hipcircumference. They found that obese individuals had significantly lower levelsof EPA and DHA compared with healthy-weight people. Subjects with higher levelswere more likely to have a healthy BMI and waist and hip measurements.More evidence about the benefits of fish oil on weight loss comes from a 2007study from the University of South Australia. The research team found thattaking fish oil combined with moderate exercise, like walking for forty-fiveminutes three times a week, leads to a significant reduction in body fat afterjust twelve weeks. But taking fish oil without exercising, or exercising withoutfish oil, did not result in any reduction in body fat.One of the most intriguing studies I have found on fish oil and weight lossappeared in a 2007 issue of the International Journal of Obesity. In this study,researchers from Iceland investigated the effects of seafood and fish oils onweight loss in 324 young overweight adults with BMIs ranging from 27.5 to 32.5.The participants were placed in four groups that ate 1,600-calorie diets thatwere the same except that each group’s diet included only one of the following: * Control group (sunflower oil capsules, no seafood or fish oil) * Lean fish group (3 × 150 g portions of cod per week) * Fatty fish group (3 × 150 g of salmon per week) * Fish oil group (DHA/EPA capsules, no seafood)After four weeks, the average amount of weight loss among the men in each of thefour groups was as follows: * Control group: 7.8 pounds * Lean fish group: 9.6 pounds * Fatty fish group: 9.9 pounds * Fish oil group: 10.9 poundsThe researchers concluded that adding fish or fish oil to a nutritionallybalanced calorie-restricted diet could boost weight loss in men.How fish oil helps make you happier. Research in the last few years has alsorevealed that diets rich in omega-3 fatty acids help promote a healthy emotionalbalance and positive mood in later years, possibly because DHA is a maincomponent of the brain’s synapses. A growing body of scientific evidenceindicates that fish oil helps ease symptoms of depression. One twenty-year studyinvolving 3,317 men and women found that people with the highest consumption ofEPA and DHA were less likely to have symptoms of depression.How fish oil helps make you smarter. There is a tremendous amount of scientificevidence pointing to a connection between the consumption of fish that is richin omega-3 fatty acids and cognitive function. A Danish team of researcherscompared the diets of 5,386 healthy older individuals and found that the morefish in a person’s diet, the longer the person was able to maintain their memoryand reduce the risk of dementia. Dr. J. A. Conquer and colleagues from theUniversity of Guelph in Ontario, Canada, studied the blood fatty acid content inthe early and later stages of dementia and noted low levels when compared withhealthy people’s. In 2010 UCLA researchers analyzed the existing scientificliterature on DHA and fish oil and concluded that supplementation with DHA slowsthe progression of Alzheimer’s and may prevent age-related dementia.Omega-3 fatty acids benefit cognitive performance at every age. Scientists atthe University of Pittsburgh reported in 2010 that middle-aged people withhigher DHA levels performed better on a variety of tests, including nonverbalreasoning, mental flexibility, working memory, and vocabulary. In a study fromSwedish researchers, results showed that surveyed nearly five thousandfifteen-year-old boys and found that those who ate fish more than once a weekscored higher on standard intelligence tests than teens who ate no fish. Afollow-up study found that teens eating fish more than once a week also hadbetter grades at school than students with lower fish consumption.Additional benefits of omega-3 fatty acids include increased attention in peoplewith ADD, reduced stress, and a lower risk for psychosis. When we put ourretired football players on our fish oil supplements, many of them were able todecrease or completely eliminate their pain medications.My recommendation for most adults is to take 1–2 g high-quality fish oil a day.VITAMIN DVitamin D, also known as the “sunshine vitamin,” is best known for buildingbones and boosting the immune system. But it is also an essential vitamin forbrain health, mood, memory, and your weight. While classified as a vitamin, itis a steroid hormone vital to health. Low levels of vitamin D have beenassociated with depression, autism and psychosis, Alzheimer’s disease, multiplesclerosis, heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and obesity. Unfortunately, vitaminD deficiencies are becoming more and more common, in part because we arespending more time indoors and using more sunscreen when we’re outdoors.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“When I started taking vitamin D, the weight started coming off faster.”—DenieceHow vitamin D helps you get thinner. Did you know that when you don’t haveenough vitamin D, you feel hungry all the time, no matter how much you eat? Thatis because low levels of vitamin D interfere with the effectiveness of leptin,the appetite hormone that tells you when you are full. Research also shows thatvitamin D insufficiency is associated with increased body fat. A 2009 study outof Canada found that weight and body fat were significantly lower in women withnormal vitamin D levels than women with insufficient levels. It appears thatextra fat inhibits the absorption of vitamin D. The evidence shows that obesepeople need higher doses of vitamin D than lean people to achieve the samelevels.One of the most interesting studies I have seen on vitamin D comes fromresearchers at Stanford Hospital and Clinics. They detailed how a patient wasgiven a prescription for 50,000 IU weekly of vitamin D that was incorrectlyfilled for 50,000 IU daily instead of weekly. After six months, the patient’svitamin D level increased from 7, which is extremely low, to 100, which is atthe high end of normal.What I found really intriguing about this report was that the patient complainedof a few side effects from the very high dosage, namely decreased appetite andsignificant weight loss. Of course, I am not advocating that you take morevitamin D than you need. But I think it shows that optimal levels of vitamin Dmay play a role in appetite control and weight loss.This patient’s story shows why it is so important to get your vitamin D levelchecked before and after treatment. That way, you will know if you are takingthe right dosage, or if you need to adjust the dosage.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I was taking 4,000 IUs of vitamin D a day, and my level only went up to 38. Thedoctor said that was in the normal range and it was okay, but I want it to be inthe optimal range (50–90), so I am going to increase my daily dosage.”—EdHow vitamin D helps make you smarter. Did you know that vitamin D is soimportant to brain function that its receptors can be found throughout thebrain? Vitamin D plays a critical role in many of the most basic cognitivefunctions, including learning and making memories. These are just some of theareas where vitamin D affects how well your brain works, according to a 2008review that appeared in the FASEB Journal.The scientific community is waking up to the importance of vitamin D for optimalbrain function. In the past few years, I have come across a number of studieslinking a shortage of vitamin D with cognitive impairment in older men andwomen, as well as some suggesting that having optimal levels of the sunshinevitamin may play a role in protecting cognitive function. One such study in theJournal of Alzheimer’s Disease found that vitamin D3, the active form of vitaminD, may stimulate the immune system to rid the brain of beta amyloid, an abnormalprotein that is believed to be a major cause of Alzheimer’s disease. Vitamin Dactivates receptors on neurons in regions important in the regulation ofbehavior, and it protects the brain by acting in an antioxidant andanti-inflammatory capacity.Another study conducted in 2009 by a team at Tufts University in Boston lookedat vitamin D level in more than 1,000 elderly people over the age of sixty-fiveand its effect on cognitive function. Only 35 percent of the participants hadoptimal vitamin D levels; the rest fell in the insufficient or deficientcategories. The individuals with optimal levels of vitamin D—50 nmol/L (nanomoleper liter) or higher—performed better on tests of executive functions, such asreasoning, flexibility, and perceptual complexity. They also scored higher onattention and processing speed tests than their counterparts with supoptimallevels.How vitamin D helps make you happier. When it comes to being happy, thescientific evidence is clear. The lower your vitamin D levels, the more likelyyou are to feel blue rather than happy. Low levels of vitamin D have long beenassociated with a higher incidence of depression. In recent years, researchershave been asking if, given this association, vitamin D supplementation canimprove moods.One trial that attempted to answer that question followed 441 overweight andobese adults with similar levels of depression for one year. The individualstook either a placebo or one of two doses of vitamin D: 20,000 IU per week or40,000 IU per week. By year’s end, the two groups that had taken the vitamin Dshowed a significant reduction in symptoms while the group taking the placeboreported no improvements. Other trials have reported similar findings.The current recommended dose for vitamin D is 400 IU daily, but most expertsagree that this is well below the physiological needs of most individuals andinstead suggest 2,000 IU of vitamin D daily. I think it is very important totest your individual needs, especially if you are overweight or obese, sinceyour body may not absorb the vitamin D as efficiently if you are heavier.THE AMEN CLINICS ALL-STARS: SUSAN[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_026_r1.jpg]Left: Before, 243 pounds Right: After two ten-week cycles, lost 29 poundsSusan, fifty-nine, is just like so many of us. When she neared the age ofthirty, she started putting on a few pounds, which didn’t seem like much of aproblem at the time. But then she continued to gain an extra 3 pounds a year forthe next thirty years, bringing her to 243 pounds. Along the way, she trieddieting and would lose 20 pounds, but as soon as the diet was over, she’d gainit all back, and more. “They were all ‘diets,’ ” she explained. “They weren’thelping me understand my body.”When she learned about our brain-centered weight-loss program, she thought itmight help her. “The whole brain approach really made sense to me because noteverybody is the same. We’re all different,” she said. Learning about weightloss from a brain perspective was a completely new concept for her. “During theprogram, I kept having these ‘aha’ moments, like when Dr. Amen said, ‘Don’tdrink your calories.’ ”Susan used to have a glass of wine while preparing dinner, then another one ortwo with her meal and another one while she cleaned up. “Three or four glassesof wine—that’s about 400 calories right there,” she realized. Add to that theglasses of milk she liked to drink throughout the day, and she was easilydrinking 600–700 calories a day.Susan was very excited to figure out her brain type, but according to heranswers, she didn’t have one specific type. When this is the case, we typicallyrecommend having someone else who knows you well complete the questionnaire foryou. Many times, others are more honest and insightful about your behavior thanyou are. When that also reveals no specific type, we typically recommend thesupplements that are beneficial for everyone regardless of brain type: amultivitamin, fish oil, and vitamin D. Having her important health numberschecked had revealed that Susan’s vitamin D level was low, so supplementationwas important for her. The first week she started taking vitamin D, she lost 7pounds—in a single week. One thing that Susan’s questionnaire did reveal wassome trouble with her memory and “foggy thinking.” So she started taking ourBrain & Memory Power Boost and has noticed an improvement.After a few weeks of learning about the brain and how it affects eating habitsand weight, Susan started to reconsider some of her answers on the questionnaireand realized that perhaps she was more unfocused than she had originallyindicated. “I think if I went back and took the questionnaire again, I wouldanswer some of those questions differently. I feel like being unfocused was partof my problem,” she said. “I just couldn’t stay focused on doing the rightthing.” Because of this, she began taking our Focus & Energy Optimizer, whichshe says has helped her stay on track.Stay on track is exactly what she has done. By keeping her meals to fewer than500 calories each, preparing snacks whenever she goes out, and eliminating thosehigh-calorie beverages, she has gotten her calories under control. In addition,she is now swimming three times a week and doing a meditation while she swims.In ten weeks, she lost 21 pounds. And unlike all those “diets” she had triedbefore, she has continued to lose weight after our ten-week program came to anend. “I’ve lost another 8 pounds and am on my way to my goal of getting under200 pounds,” she said.SUPPLEMENTS THAT SUPPORT CRAVING CONTROLAnyone who has ever tried to lose weight knows that cravings can ruin yourefforts and send you racing to the nearest pizza parlor, burger joint, or icecream shop. Here, I will introduce you to natural supplements with scientificevidence showing that they can help take the edge off cravings. (See chapter 6[Amen_9780307463623_epub_c06_r1.htm] for more on this.)ALPHA-LIPOIC ACIDMade naturally in the body, alpha-lipoic acid may protect against cell damage ina variety of conditions. There is strong evidence that alpha-lipoic acidsupports stable blood sugar levels, which helps to decrease cravings andtendencies to overeat. Studies have shown that it improves insulin sensitivityand may be effective in treating type 2 diabetes. The typical recommended adultdose is 100 mg twice a day.CHROMIUMChromium picolinate is a nutritional supplement used to aid the body in theregulation of insulin, which enhances its ability to efficiently metabolizeglucose and fat. There is a strong link between depression, decreased insulinsensitivity, and diabetes. Supplementation with chromium picolinate has beenshown to effectively modulate carbohydrate cravings and appetite, which isbeneficial to managing both the diabetes and depression.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“When it comes to supplements, knowing your brain type is so important becauseif your brain needs serotonin to calm down and you take supplements that do theopposite, it makes it harder for you to succeed.”—JimmyI often recommend chromium picolinate to help with insulin regulation and tocontrol carb cravings. In a well-designed study, 600 mcg (micrograms) chromiumpicolinate was beneficial for patients with atypical depression (the type ofdepression where people gain weight, rather than lose weight), especially thosewith carbohydrate cravings. Scientists at Oxford University in Englanddemonstrated with animals that supplementing the diet with chromium enhances theactivity of neurochemicals associated with mood control within the brain.It is believed that chromium may help raise serotonin levels by facilitating thetransport of certain amino acids within the brain and central nervous system.This could explain why it is helpful in reducing cravings for refinedcarbohydrates, which also raise serotonin levels. The typical recommended adultdosage is 200 to 600 micrograms a day.DL-PHENYLALANINEThis is an essential amino acid (cannot be produced by the body) and thus mustbe obtained through the diet. Phenylalanine is used in different biochemicalprocesses to produce the neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine, andepinephrine. There is evidence that phenylalanine can increase mental alertness,release hormones affecting appetite, and reduce drug and alcohol cravings.There have been reports that DL-phenylalanine can promote high blood pressure inthose predisposed to hypertension. Monitoring in the first few months onphenylalanine can detect blood pressure increases in the minority of people whowill have this symptom. Phenylalanine can promote the cell division of existingmalignant melanoma cells. If you have melanoma, or any other form of cancer forthat matter, avoid phenylalanine. Persons who have phenylketonuria cannot usephenylalanine. This includes those born with a genetic deficiency that preventsthem from metabolizing phenylalanine. The typical recommended starting dosagefor adults is 500 mg a day. Then slowly work up to 1,500 mg a day.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“After starting on the supplements for my brain type, I lost 13 pounds in lessthan three weeks. It has been effortless. My cravings are gone, and myimpulsive-compulsive eating behavior is gone.”—BradL-GLUTAMINEL-glutamine is an amino acid that is important in the synthesis of theexcitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and the inhibitor neurotransmitter GABA.It is also a nutrient for the brain as it is used for energy if the brain doesnot have enough glucose to function. Supplemental glutamine has been shown todecrease carbohydrate cravings. The typical adult dose is 500 mg three to fourtimes a day.N-ACETYL-CYSTEINEN-acetyl-cysteine, or NAC, is an amino acid that is needed to produceglutathione, a very powerful antioxidant. NAC binds to and removes dangeroustoxic elements within the cells, making it a molecule critical to brain health.Recently, NAC has been studied as a treatment for drug addiction, as itfunctions to restore levels of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate in thereward center of the brain. A growing body of research has found that NAC canreduce cravings for cocaine, heroin, and cigarettes and decrease the risk forrelapse. Considering that some foods activate the same areas of the brain ascocaine, it may be that NAC can also be helpful in reducing food cravings.Other research concludes that NAC shows promise for the treatment of compulsivebehavior problems. This means it could be helpful for Type 1 CompulsiveOvereaters as well as those with impulsive-compulsive eating disorders, such asbulimia. The typical adult dose is 600–1,200 mg twice a day to curb cravings.SUPPLEMENTS RECOMMENDED FOR TYPE 1 COMPULSIVE OVEREATERS5-HTPThere is good scientific evidence that 5-HTP helps with weight loss, and in myexperience, I have found that it works best for this type. It is an amino acidbuilding block for serotonin, and using this supplement is another way toincrease cerebral serotonin, which may help control stress, improve sleep, andincrease mood. A number of double-blind studies have shown 5-HTP is as effectiveas antidepressant medication. In my experience, I have found it to be veryhelpful for some people as a sleep aid.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“For years I took vitamins on and off, but never felt better. Within one week oftaking 5-HTP, I could get up in the morning and feel happy and less stressed. Ican stop myself from worrying, and my junk food cravings are diminishing.”—TerriThis supplement helps to calm anterior cingulate gyrus hyperactivity (to helpshift attention). For people who can’t seem to turn off their brains at bedtime,or who have anxious thoughts that keep them awake, 5-HTP may help. The mostcommon side effect of 5-HTP is an upset stomach, although it is usually mild. Toavoid an upset stomach, start by taking small doses of 5-HTP and graduallyincrease the dosage as you get used to it. Taking it with food can also help.Because 5-HTP increases serotonin, you should not take it with other medicationsthat increase serotonin, such as St. John’s Wort, L-tryptophan, or prescribedantidepressants, unless you are closely supervised by your physician.The typical adult dose of 5-HTP is 50–100 mg two or three times daily with orwithout food.INOSITOLInositol is a sugar that is considered part of the B vitamin family. It is anatural chemical found in the brain that is reported to help neurons useserotonin more efficiently. It is important in the maintenance of cellmembranes, the breakdown of fat, hair growth, and the regulation of estrogen andinsulin. Studies demonstrate its efficacy in treating those withobsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and anxiety disorders. It alsofunctions to neutralize free-radical activity, thereby protecting neurons andpromoting brain health.Scientific studies have shown that 12–18 g inositol daily has beneficial effectsin the treatment of depression, anxiety, panic disorder, andobsessive-compulsive disorder.L-TRYPTOPHANScientific evidence shows that L-tryptophan can help people lose weight. Like5-HTP, L-tryptophan is an amino acid building block for serotonin, and takingL-tryptophan supplements increases cerebral serotonin. Serotonin is aneurotransmitter that plays an important role in mood stabilization and sleep,as well as a number of other functions. The high doses of L-tryptophan found inturkey may explain why we get sleepy after devouring a big Thanksgiving meal.L-tryptophan was taken off the market more than a decade ago because onecontaminated batch from one manufacturer caused a rare blood disease and anumber of deaths. L-tryptophan itself actually had nothing to do with thesedeaths. L-tryptophan was reapproved by the Food and Drug Administration severalyears ago and is currently available again. One of the problems with dietaryL-tryptophan is that a significant portion of it does not enter the brain, butrather is used to make proteins and vitamin B3. This necessitates taking largeamounts of L-tryptophan.The typical adult dose is 1,000–3,000 mg taken at bedtime.SAFFRONSaffron is grown in Iran, Greece, Spain, and Italy and traditionally has beenused to ease the digestion of spicy food, to soothe an irritated stomach, and totreat depression. The saffron extract called satiereal is a patented productthat has been shown to have antidepressant effects. The active ingredients ofsatiereal include safranal, picrocrocin, and crocin, which work synergisticallyto help with satiety and to help curb the compulsive desire to eat.Like SSRIs, satiereal is thought to work by preventing the reuptake ofserotonin, thereby improving mood and well-being. It differs in that a smallamount is potent, and it has been shown to be a successful weight loss aid byreducing appetite and sugar cravings. In clinical trials satiereal has beenshown to be well tolerated with few adverse side effects.The recommended dosage is 100 mg twice a day.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“All my life I have been large.

Nothingworked. But then I saw your public television special and read your book. Nowit’s no to fast food, no to soda pop, and yes to water aerobics twice a week. Istarted taking a multivitamin, vitamin D, fish oil, and 5-HTP. In less than sixmonths, I have lost 89 pounds.”—RandyST. JOHN’S WORTA plant located in the subtropical regions of North America, Europe, Asia,India, and China, St.-John’s-wort (Hypericum perforatum) has been used forcenturies in the treatment of mood disorders and depression. The biologicallyactive ingredient in St. John’s Wort is hypericin, which functions to inhibitthe reuptake of various neurotransmitters including serotonin, dopamine, GABA,and glutamate. The mechanism of action for St. John’s Wort is similar to thatfound in popular antidepressants, including Prozac, Paxil, and Zoloft. Thesedrugs and the herb work to maintain elevated levels of serotonin, which has amood-enhancing effect.Stress depletes the brain of serotonin. St. John’s Wort combats that and mayactually be the most potent of all the supplements at increasing serotoninavailability in the brain. I have seen dramatic improvement for many of mypatients on St. John’s Wort and have SPECT scan studies of patients before andafter treatment with St. John’s Wort that document its effectiveness. St. John’sWort decreases anterior cingulate gyrus hyperactivity (which can make you rigidand stressed out when things don’t go your way) for many patients and decreasesmoodiness.An unfortunate side effect is that it can also decrease prefrontal cortexactivity. One of the women in a study we conducted said, “I’m happier, but I’mdingier.” We also don’t start people with temporal lobe symptoms (anger,epilepsy, memory problem, hallucinations, and so on) on St. John’s Wort withoutfirst stabilizing the temporal lobes with anticonvulsant medication. Animportant note is that it has been found to decrease the effectiveness of otherdrugs, including birth control pills.The typical dose is 300 mg a day for children, 300 mg twice a day for teens, and600 mg in the morning and 300 mg at night for adults. Sometimes, the dose may beslowly increased to 1,800 mg for adults. It is important that the preparation ofSt. John’s Wort contain 0.3 percent hypericin, which is believed to be one ofthe active ingredients of St. John’s Wort.SUPPLEMENTS RECOMMENDED FOR TYPE 2 IMPULSIVE OVEREATERSGREEN TEA LEAF EXTRACTMade from the dried leaves of Camellia sinensis, green tea leaf extract is anevergreen shrub. It has been used as a remedy for many ailments, includinganxiety, cancer prevention, and cardiovascular health; for the prevention ofcold and flu; and for weight loss. The green tea component epigallocatechingallate, often referred to as EGCG, is a potent free-radical scavenger. Includedin the extract is L-theanine, which has been shown to enhance brain wave alphastates, and increase relaxation and focus. A 2009 study tested the effects ofgreen tea leaf extract on weight loss. One hundred men and women were placed ona calorie-restricted diet with half of them receiving a green tea leaf extractsupplement while the other half did not. After ninety days, the group taking thesupplement had lost an average of 31 pounds compared with 11 pounds for thediet-only group.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“With the Focus & Energy Optimizer, which contains green tea and rhodiola, Idon’t need coffee in the afternoon anymore.”—TyThe typical adult dose is 200–300 mg green tea leaf extract capsules daily forcancer prevention and possible effects on weight loss. Up to 3 cups a day ofgreen tea can be consumed for health benefits, but caution should be used withpregnant women as green tea does contain caffeine.L-TYROSINEThis amino acid is important in the synthesis of brain neurotransmitters. It isthe precursor to the brain neurotransmitters epinephrine, norepinephrine, anddopamine, which are critical for balancing mood and energy. It is also helpfulin the process of producing thyroid hormones, which are important in metabolismand energy production. A sluggish thyroid can have significant effects on brainhealth and can contribute to weight problems. The beneficial effect of tyrosinesupplementation is that an efficiently functioning thyroid will not only resultin a better-functioning brain but will also help in weight loss.Tyrosine supplementation has been shown to improve cognitive performance underperiods of stress and fatigue. Stress tends to deplete the neurotransmitternorepinephrine, and tyrosine is the amino acid building block to replenish it.Tyrosine should not be taken with MAO (monamine oxidase) inhibitors andtricyclic antidepressants, when a cancerous melanoma is present, with a historyof cancerous melanoma, or with elevated blood pressure.The typical adult dose is 500–1500 mg two to three times a day. It is best takenon an empty stomach with water or juice. Be cautious when takingDL-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine together, as they may be too stimulating.RHODIOLAAn herb that is grown at high altitudes in Asia and Europe, rhodiola hastraditionally been used to fight fatigue, improve memory, and increase attentionspan. It is called an adaptogen, because it helps plants adapt to harshenvironments. Research has found that it does indeed help prevent fatigue. Inaddition, scientific evidence points to an ability to fuel sexual energy, boostimmunity, and ease depression. In a study we conducted at the Amen Clinics withDr. Mahtab Jafari from the University of California–Irvine, we found thatrhodiola helped to increase blood flow to the brain, especially the prefrontalcortex. Our study group also reported better mood and energy.The typical adult dose is 200–600 mg daily for the treatment of fatigue anddepression and it is best taken on an empty stomach. Rhodiola should be takenearly in the day as it may interfere with sleep and it should not be used inindividuals with bipolar disorder or those taking hypertensive or hypoglycemicmedications.SUPPLEMENTS RECOMMENDED FOR TYPE 3 IMPULSIVE-COMPULSIVE OVEREATERSFor this type, taking a combination of 5-HTP plus green tea leaf extract andrhodiola is best. (See descriptions above.)GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I used to always gain weight in the winter and lose it in the summer. I neverrealized it was because I was having the ‘winter blues’ and eating more as a wayof dealing with those feelings. Taking the supplements helped me control mymoods and my eating.”—TamaraSUPPLEMENTS RECOMMENDED FOR TYPE 4 SAD OR EMOTIONAL OVEREATERSVitamin D and fish oil supplements are especially important for this type. (Seedescriptions above.)SAMES-adenosyl methionine (SAMe) is involved in the production of severalneurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, epinephrine) and helps the brain tofunction properly. The brain normally manufactures all the SAMe it needs fromthe amino acid methionine. When a person is depressed, the synthesis of SAMefrom methionine is impaired, and SAMe has been shown to have antidepressantqualities. People who have a certain type of ADD that is linked with depressionmay experience an improvement in mood and focus when taking SAMe. SAMe has alsobeen found to suppress appetite and reduce joint inflammation and pain.The typical adult dose is 200–400 mg two to four times a day. Caution should betaken with people who have a tendency toward bipolar disorder. Usually, it isbest to take early in the day as it may be stimulating for some.DHEADHEA is a master hormone that has been found to be low in many people withdepression and obesity. There is good scientific evidence that supplementingwith DHEA is helpful for weight loss in certain patients. DHEA is one of themost abundant hormones in the body, second only to cholesterol. It is usuallywell tolerated. Acne and facial hair are common side effects, as it increasesthe body’s testosterone levels. To avoid getting acne or facial hair, manydoctors prescribe a metabolite of DHEA called 7-keto-DHEA. It is more expensive,but if acne and facial hair are an issue, it is worth it.The main worry about DHEA by some professionals is that it will partly convertitself into sex hormones such as testosterone and estrogens. This seems to be anobvious advantage for healthy people who are looking to combat age-associatedhormonal decline. Unfortunately, this means advising people who are at risk forhormonally dependent cancers (prostate, breast, ovarian) against taking DHEA.For these, 7-keto-DHEA is a good solution.DHEA supplementation is not recommended for children, adolescents, and pregnantor nursing women. Androgenic effects including acne, hair loss, and a deepeningof the voice have been reported in women. If this occurs, discontinue DHEAimmediately.The typical recommended adult dosage is 25–50 mg daily. DHEA is banned by theInternational Olympic Committee, the National Collegiate Athletic Association,the NFL, and other sports organizations for its performance-enhancingproperties.B VITAMINSThe B vitamins play an integral role in the functioning of the nervous systemand help the brain synthesize neurotransmitters that affect mood and thinking.Some research indicates that supplementation with some of the B vitamins mayfight depression. For example, a 2003 study out of Finland found that takingvitamin B12 might aid in the recovery from major depressive disorder. In 2010researchers from Rush University Medical Center in Illinois reported that takingvitamins B6 and B12 may reduce the risk of depression in older adults.The typical adult dose of B6 is 25–50 mg. For B12, it is 250 mcg.SUPPLEMENTS RECOMMENDED FOR TYPE 5 ANXIOUS OVEREATERSGABAGamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an amino acid that also functions as aneurotransmitter in the brain. GABA is reported in the herbal literature to workin much the same way as anti-anxiety drugs and anticonvulsants. It helpsstabilize nerve cells by decreasing their tendency to fire erratically orexcessively. This means it has a calming effect for people who struggle withanxiety, irritability, or temper, whether these symptoms relate to anxiety or totemporal lobe disturbance.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I used to grab for the bread or muffins whenever I felt anxious. Now that I’mtaking the right supplements and doing my relaxation exercises, I don’t have allthat anxiety anymore and my bread cravings are gone.”—EmmaThe typical recommended adult dosage ranges from 100 to 1,500 mg daily foradults and from 50 to 750 mg daily for children. For best effect, GABA should betaken in two or three doses a day.MAGNESIUMMagnesium is a mineral that is essential to good health as it is needed for morethan three hundred biochemical reactions in the body. It has been shown to behelpful in calming anxiety and balancing the brain’s pleasure centers, which canhelp reduce cravings. Magnesium is also important in energy production andassists in calcium and potassium uptake in the body. A deficiency in magnesiumcan lead to irritability and nervousness. Supplementing the body with magnesiumcan help with mood and muscle weakness. In combination with vitamin B6, it hasbeen shown to reduce the hyperactivity seen in children with ADD.Scientists have long known that magnesium also plays an important role in memoryand learning. Research in a 2010 issue of the journal Neuron indicates thatincreasing magnesium in the brain enhances learning abilities in children andadults. Not only that this vital nutrient improved working memory, short-termmemory, and long-term memory. The researchers discovered that elevatingmagnesium levels created positive changes in the hippocampus, one of the brain’smajor memory centers.The typical adult dose is 400–1,000 mg daily, divided into three doses. It isbest to take with calcium as these minerals work synergistically. Magnesium isusually half of your total calcium intake.VALERIAN ROOTMany patients find valerian to be remarkably helpful as a sleeping aid andstress-relief aid. Since valerian promotes sleep, it may also help balanceleptin and ghrelin, the appetite hormones that are regulated during sleep. Whenthese hormones are balanced, they do a better job of telling you when you arefull so you can stop overeating.Valerian is a well-recognized herb with antianxiety properties that is used as amild tranquilizer, sedative, and muscle relaxant. There are about 150 species ofvalerian widely distributed in temperate regions of the world. The activeingredient is found in a foul-smelling oil produced in the root of the plant.Throughout history, people have turned to valerian for its unique properties.The ancient Roman physician Galen wrote about the virtues of valerian; in theMiddle Ages, medical literature used the term All Heal to describe the herb; andvalerian has long been a staple of Chinese and Indian medicine. In the UnitedStates, valerian was commonly used prior to the development of modernpharmaceuticals.This centuries-old treatment for insomnia has also been helpful for symptoms ofnervousness, stress, and pain. It has also been found to decrease seizurefrequency in epileptic patients. Studies have shown valerian to be helpful formany types of anxiety disorders and for people with performance anxiety andthose who get stressed in daily situations like traffic. Valerian appears towork by enhancing the activity of the calming neurotransmitter, GABA.Unlike prescription tranquilizers, valerian has no potential for addiction andhas been used to help people who are trying to decrease their use ofprescription tranquilizers or sleeping pills. (Anyone using prescriptionsleeping pills or tranquilizers should decrease or stop their use only under thesupervision of a physician.) It may take two to three weeks to start feeling theeffects of valerian, so it isn’t the best sleep aid for short-term use, such aswhen you have jet lag. It is better suited for long-term use and has been foundto improve deep sleep, which leaves you feeling more rested in the morning.Valerian should not be taken in combination with alcohol, barbiturates, orbenzodiazepines, and it is not recommended for use during pregnancy or whilebreast-feeding.Valerian is available in capsules, tablets, liquids, tinctures, extracts, andteas. Most extracts are standardized to 0.8 percent valeric acids. The typicalrecommended adult dosage is 150 to 450 mg in capsules or teas.VITAMIN B6The B vitamins are especially effective in controlling stress. When you arefaced with stressful situations or thoughts, the B vitamins are typically thefirst to be depleted. If you have a B-vitamin deficiency, your ability to copewith stress and anxiety is lowered. As you well know, it is much harder to sayno to the pizza, cheesecake, and cinnamon rolls when you are under a lot ofstress.Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) is a water-soluble vitamin essential in the metabolismof amino acids, glucose, and fatty acids and is important in the production ofneurotransmitters (serotonin, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and GABA). It isrequired by the nervous system and is needed for normal brain function as wellas DNA synthesis. It is hard to find a molecule in our bodies that doesn’t relyon vitamin B6 for its production. It is involved in more than one hundredcrucial chemical reactions in our bodies.Vitamin B6 helps our nervous system function properly. It is required for theproduction of hemoglobin, the compound in red blood cells that transports oxygenand carbon dioxide. It increases the amount of oxygen carried in our blood,helping overcome fatigue. It helps maintain a healthy immune system and calmsanxiety. It also helps in processing carbohydrates for energy. Food sources ofvitamin B6 include fortified cereals, beans, meat, poultry, fish, and somefruits and vegetables.The typical adult dose of vitamin B6 is 25 to 50 mg daily.MORE SUPPLEMENTS THAT MAKE YOU SMARTERCHOLINEThis nutrient is essential to the structure and function of all cells. It is aprecursor molecule involved in the synthesis of the neurotransmitteracetylcholine, which is important for normal brain function. Those deficient inacetylcholine may develop Alzheimer’s disease and dementia; therefore, cholinesupplementation may be helpful in preventing the onset of these neurologicaldisorders.Choline is also involved in producing the cell membrane phospholipidsphosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin. The breakdown of cell membranes leads toneuronal death. Therefore, replenishing these vital components of the membraneis a proactive step you can take to help prevent Alzheimer’s disease.Food sources of choline include egg yolk, liver, peanuts, fish, milk, andcauliflower. Generally, up to 3 g choline daily is well tolerated, but possibleside effects may include nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, sweating, and hypotension.The recommended dosage is 300–1,200 mg daily.GINKGO BILOBAThe prettiest brains I have seen are those on ginkgo. Ginkgo biloba, from theChinese ginkgo tree, is a powerful antioxidant that is best known for itsability to enhance circulation, memory, and concentration. Consider takingginkgo if you suffer from low energy or decreased concentration.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“A lot of people don’t notice that their memory isn’t as sharp as it used to be.It wasn’t until I started doing this program and taking the vitamins, fish oil,vitamin D, and Brain & Memory Power Boost that I realized I wasn’t as sharp as Iwanted to be. Now my memory is improving.”—PhilThe best-studied form of ginkgo biloba is a special extract called EGb 761,which has been studied in blood-vessel disease, clotting disorders, depression,and Alzheimer’s disease. A comparison in 2000 of all the published,placebo-controlled studies longer than six months for ginkgo biloba extract, EGb761, versus Cognex, Aricept, and Exelon showed they all had similar benefits formild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease patients.The most widely publicized U.S. study of ginkgo biloba appeared in the Journalof the American Medical Association in 1997 and was conducted by Dr. P. L. LeBars and colleagues from the New York Institute for Medical Research. EGb 761was used to assess its efficacy and safety in Alzheimer’s disease and vasculardementia. It was a fifty-two-week multicenter study with patients who had mildto severe symptoms. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with EGb 761(120 mg per day) or placebo. Progress was monitored at twelve, twenty-six, andfifty-two weeks, and 202 patients finished the study. At the end of the study,the authors concluded that EGb 761 was safe and appears capable of stabilizingand, in a substantial number of cases, improving the cognitive performance andthe social functioning of demented patients for six months to one year. Althoughmodest, the changes induced by EGb were objectively measured and were ofsufficient magnitude to be recognized by the caregivers. Other large-scalestudies have not found a positive benefit. Our experience is that gingko doesenhance blood flow to the brain.In a double-blind placebo-controlled study from Brazil in 2003 using SPECT,researchers studied 48 men between the ages of 60 and 70 for eight months andfound significant improvements in blood flow and global cognitive functioningfor those taking gingko, while the placebo group showed the opposite withdecreased brain blood flow and poorer scores on cognitive testing.Consider taking ginkgo if you are at risk for memory problems or stroke or ifyou suffer from low energy or decreased concentration. There is a small risk ofbleeding in the body, and the dosages of other blood-thinning agents being takenmay sometimes need to be reduced.The typical adult dose is 60 to 120 mg twice daily.HUPERZINE AThis remarkable compound has been studied in China for nearly twenty years. Itappears to work by increasing the availability of acetylcholine, a major memoryneurotransmitter in the brain, and preventing cell damage from excitotoxins. Ithas been shown to be effective in improving patients who suffered with cognitiveimpairment from several different types of dementia, including Alzheimer’sdisease and vascular dementia. Since 1991 it has been studied as a treatment forthe prevention of Alzheimer’s disease and can be considered safe to use as analternative or adjunct to medication in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.Huperzine A has also been found to help learning and memory in teenagers.Researchers divided thirty-four pairs of junior high school students complainingof memory problems into a Huperzine A group and a placebo control group. TheHuperzine A group was given two (50 mcg) capsules of Huperzine A twice a day,while the placebo group was given two capsules of placebo (starch and lactoseinside) twice a day for four weeks. At the end of the trial, the Huperzine Agroup’s memory abilities were significantly superior to that of the placebogroup.Those with seizure disorders, cardiac arrhythmias, asthma, or irritable bowelsyndrome should talk to their health care professionals before taking HuperzineA. Possible side effects include headaches, gastrointestinal effects, dizziness,blurred vision, slow heart rate, arrhythmias, seizures, and increased urination.Use of Huperzine A with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or cholinergic drugs mayproduce additive effects, so caution should be used.The typical adult dose is 50–100 mcg twice a day and 200–400 mcg daily ifcognitive impairment is already noted.PHOSPHATIDYLSERINEPhosphatidylserine (PS) is a naturally occurring nutrient that is found in foodssuch as fish, green leafy vegetables, soy products, and rice. PS is a componentof cell membranes. As we age, these membranes change in composition. There arereports of the potential of PS to help improve age-related declines in memory,learning, verbal skills, and concentration. PS is essential to brain health bymaintaining neurons and neuronal networks so that the brain can continue to formand retain memories.PET (positron emission tomography) studies of patients who have taken PS showthat it produces a general increase in metabolic activity in the brain. In thelargest multicenter study to date of phosphatidylserine and Alzheimer’s disease,142 subjects aged forty to eighty were given 200 mg PS per day or placebo over athree-month period. Those treated with PS exhibited improvement on several itemson the scales normally used to assess Alzheimer’s status. The differencesbetween placebo and experimental groups were small but statisticallysignificant.The types of symptoms that have improved in placebo-controlled studies ofcognitive impairment or dementia include loss of interest, reduced activities,social isolation, anxiety, and loss of memory, concentration, and recall. Milderstages of impairment tend to respond to PS better than more severe stages. Withregard to depression in elderly individuals, Dr. M. Maggioni and colleaguesstudied the effects of oral PS (300 mg per day) versus placebo and notedsignificant improvements in mood, memory, and motivation after thirty days of PStreatment.In a 2010 study from Israel, researchers evaluated the efficacy of PS plus DHA(PS-DHA) in 157 nondemented elderly people with memory complaints. The groupparticipants received either PS-DHA or placebo for 15 weeks. Efficacy wasmeasured following 7 and 15 weeks of treatment. Verbal immediate recall wassignificantly improved in the PS-DHA group compared with the placebo group.PS has also been reported to be helpful for adrenal fatigue. The typical adultdose is 100–300 mg a day.SAGENaturalStandard.com [http://www.NaturalStandard.com] gives the common herb sageits highest “A level” scientific evidence rating for cognitive improvement. Itcites research that has demonstrated that sage can improve memory, confirmingcenturies-old theories. In the seventeenth century noted herbalist NicholasCulpeper wrote that the herb sage could “heal” the memory while “warming andquickening the senses.”Culpeper wasn’t the only herbalist (and certainly not the first) to recognizethat sage can help improve memory. Now—centuries later—scientists believe theyknow why. An enzyme called acetylcholinesterase (AChE) breaks down a chemicalcalled acetylcholine that is typically deficient in Alzheimer’s patients.Researchers from the Medical Plant Research Centre (MPRC) at the Universities ofNewcastle and Northumbria in the United Kingdom have shown that sage inhibitsAChE.A study conducted by researchers at MPRC demonstrates the possible results ofinhibiting AChE. Researchers gave forty-four subjects either sage oil capsulesor placebo capsules containing sunflower oil and then conducted word recalltests. The group that received sage oil turned in significantly better testresults than subjects who took placebo. However, researchers say that furthertests are needed to fully determine just how far-reaching sage’s effect may beon memory.The typical adult dose for improved mood, alertness, and cognitive performanceis 300–600 mg daily of dried sage leaf capsules. Sage can also be used as anessential oil in doses of 25 to 50 mcL (microliters). Sage should be usedcautiously in those with hypertension or those who have seizure disorders.VINPOCETINEThis brain booster is sometimes called a nootropic, or cognition enhancer, fromthe Greek word noos for “mind.” Vinpocetine has been shown in a number ofstudies to help memory, especially for people who are at risk for heart diseaseor strokes. It also helps lower high homocysteine levels, which are alsodangerous to your heart and brain.Vinpocetine is derived from an extract of the common periwinkle plant (Vincaminor) and is used in Europe, Japan, and Mexico as a pharmaceutical agent forthe treatment of blood-vessel disease in the brain and cognitive disorders. Inthe United States it is available as a dietary supplement.Vinpocetine selectively widens arteries and capillaries, increasing blood flowto the brain. It also combats accumulation of platelets in the blood, improvingcirculation. Because of these properties, vinpocetine was first used in thetreatment of cerebrovascular disorders and acute memory loss owing to late-lifedementia. But it also has a beneficial effect on memory problems associated withnormal aging.There is evidence that vinpocetine may be useful for a wide variety of brainproblems. A 1976 study found that vinpocetine immediately increased circulationin fifty people with abnormal blood flow. After one month of taking moderatedoses of vinpocetine, patients showed improvement on memorization tests. After aprolonged period of vinpocetine treatment, cognitive impairment diminishedsignificantly or disappeared altogether in many of the patients. A 1987 study ofelderly patients with chronic cerebral dysfunction found that patients who tookvinpocetine performed better on psychological evaluations after the ninety-daytrial period than did those who received a placebo.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“Yes, I’m losing weight, but I’m also in a better mood and don’t get so angryanymore.”—MiguelMore-recent studies have shown that vinpocetine reduces neural damage andprotects against oxidative damage from harmful beta-amyloid buildup. In amulticenter double-blind placebo-controlled study lasting sixteen weeks, 203patients described as having mild to moderate memory problems, including primarydementia, were treated with varying doses of vinpocetine or placebo. Significantimprovement was achieved in the vinpocetine-treated group as measured by “globalimprovement” and cognitive performance scales. Three 10-mg doses daily were aseffective or more effective than three 20-mg doses daily.Similarly good results were found in another double-blind clinical trial testingvinpocetine versus placebo in elderly patients with blood vessel and centralnervous system degenerative disorders. Some preliminary research suggests thatvinpocetine may also have some protective effects in both sight and hearing.Reported adverse reactions include nausea, dizziness, insomnia, drowsiness, drymouth, transient hypotension, transient fast heart rate, pressure headaches, andfacial flushing. Slight reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressurewith prolonged use of vinpocetine have been reported, as well as slightreductions in blood sugar levels.The typical adult dose is 10 mg a day.SUPPLEMENTS THAT HELP YOU GET BETTER SLEEPMELATONINMelatonin is a hormone made in the brain that helps regulate other hormones andmaintains the body’s sleep cycle. Darkness stimulates the production ofmelatonin while light decreases its activity. Exposure to too much light in theevening or too little light during the day can disrupt the production ofmelatonin. Jet lag, shift work, and poor vision are some of the conditions thatcan disrupt melatonin production. Some researchers think that being exposed tolow-frequency electromagnetic fields (from common household appliances) maydisrupt melatonin levels.One study of postmenopausal women found that melatonin improved depression andanxiety. Studies of people with depression and panic disorder have shown lowlevels of melatonin. People who suffer winter blues or seasonal affectivedisorder (SAD) also have lower-than-normal melatonin levels. Melatonin causes asurge in the neurotransmitter serotonin, which may help explain why it ishelpful in both sleep and depression. The benefit to taking melatonin as opposedto other sleep aids is that it is both safe and nonaddictive.Melatonin is also involved in the production of female hormones and influencesmenstrual cycles. Researchers also consider melatonin levels to be involved inaging. Melatonin levels are highest when we are children and diminish with age.The lower levels of melatonin may help explain why older adults tend to get lesssleep.Melatonin is a strong antioxidant, and there is some evidence that it may helpstrengthen the immune system. It has also been shown to have powerfulneuroprotective effects both as an antioxidant and in the prevention of plaqueformation as observed in Alzheimer’s disease.The best approach for dosing melatonin is to begin with very low doses. Inchildren, start with 0.3 mg a day and raise it slowly. In adults, start with 1mg an hour before bedtime. You can increase it to 6 mg.RESTFUL SLEEPTo support healthy sleep, which as we will see in the next chapter is criticalto brain health and craving control, I have developed a special supplementcalled Restful Sleep. It contains a combination of nutrients designed to supporta calm mind and promote a deep, relaxed, restful night’s sleep. This supplementcontains both an immediate-release and time-release dose of melatonin, thecalming neurotransmitter GABA, a combination of the essential elements zinc andmagnesium, and the herb valerian, which together may produce an overall sedativeeffect to help support sleep."},{"pageContent":"[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_L08_r1.jpg]When Stephanie got pregnant with twins at age thirty, she gained about 80 poundsduring her pregnancy and never lost it. In fact, she continued to pack on thepounds as her twin boys grew up. With kids in the house, she kept the cupboardsstocked with all kinds of chips, candy, and sodas. She initially bought thesethings for the boys, but then she got hooked on them too. She craved sodas inthe morning for a quick energy jolt and craved salty chips in the afternoon, andshe felt like she couldn’t live without cookies and candy in the evenings whilewatching TV. By the time she turned forty-two, her weight ballooned to 270pounds and her doctor diagnosed her with type 2 diabetes. That really scared herand she knew she had to do something now to change her behavior and lose someweight.To jump-start her new lifestyle, she decided to go to a weeklong weight-lossretreat where they served calorie-controlled spa cuisine and offered dozens offitness classes and activities. She did great while she was at the retreat.There were no sodas, candy, or chips in sight and no opportunities to eatanything other than what was served at mealtime. By the end of the week, she hadlost several pounds, and her cravings had started to wane. Stephanie was veryexcited, thinking she was on the way to a new life and a new figure.But when she got back home, reality hit. The kitchen was stocked with thecookies, chips, candy, and sodas she craved. Plus, after being gone for a week,the house was a complete mess, the laundry had piled up, and the twins’ homeworkprojects sat untouched, even though they were due the following day.On her first day back, she jumped out of bed with the best intentions to eatright and go to the gym like she had at the retreat. She scrambled to get theboys ready for their early-morning soccer practice, and by the time she drovethem there, she realized she had forgotten to eat breakfast. She didn’t want todrink a sugary soda like she used to, but she needed some energy so she bought adiet soda from a nearby vending machine. When she got home, she was so hungry,she made a big bowl of cereal. She figured she would go grocery shopping forhealthy foods later after she cleaned up the house.About a half hour after eating the cereal, her energy dropped again, and shefelt the sodas in the fridge calling her name. She tried to resist, buteventually the craving was too strong, and she gave in. Every time she headedthrough the kitchen to the laundry room to wash clothes, she thought about thechips in the cupboard. Then she figured that since she had already ruined herdiet that day with the big bowl of cereal, she may as well have a few chips.Then her husband told her they had been invited to a barbecue at the neighbor’shouse that afternoon and he had said yes to the invitation. Stephanie was reallyticked off at that because she wanted to finish cleaning the house so she couldgo to the grocery store. At the neighbor’s barbecue, there were chips and dip,tubs of ice-cold sodas, bowls of M&M’s, and plates of freshly baked cookies ondisplay.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I saw your public television special and changed my eating habits completely. Ifeel like a new person! The best part? I no longer have the food cravings I oncehad. Thank you!”—KellyStarving, Stephanie stationed herself next to the chips and dip and finished offthe whole bowl before having a burger. After the burger, she told herself shewasn’t going to have dessert and managed to resist until her husband broughtover a plate of cookies for her. With them in her hands, she could smell thevanilla and chocolate and they proved too irresistible and she ate threecookies. When they got back home and Stephanie finally got to sit down and relaxand watch TV, the boys ran into the living room with bags of jelly beans fromthe kitchen and ate them sitting next to her. She told them she didn’t want any,but after a while she found herself mindlessly dipping her hand into the bag ofjelly beans. So much for Stephanie’s new healthy lifestyle.What went wrong? Stephanie didn’t want to be overweight, and she definitelydidn’t want to have type 2 diabetes. She had eaten well at the retreat so sheknew she was capable of going without the snacks and sodas she craved. But athome there were so many temptations that she just couldn’t control her cravings.Or could she? Was there anything Stephanie could have done differently to helpher avoid falling into her old habits? You bet! Let’s rewind Stephanie’s daywith a few tweaks to show how she could have gotten better control of hercravings.At Stephanie’s retreat, she learned a lot about the kinds of foods she shouldeat, and she knew that her kitchen wasn’t filled with any of them. So the daybefore the retreat ended, she called her husband and asked him and the boys tothrow out the junk food. She patiently explained that diabetes would take herlife early and that he and the boys needed to help her, plus it would be goodfor everyone in the long run. Her husband agreed, as his weight had alsoballooned and he had high cholesterol. She also asked him to pick up a fewhealthy groceries before she got home. When she got home and saw the messyhouse, she decided she would spend one hour a day cleaning up rather than tryingto do it all in one day. But she was grateful her husband did as she asked withthe junk food and made sure to give him a hug and tell him how much she lovedhim.That first morning, she spent three minutes making a protein smoothie with thewhey protein powder and frozen berries her husband had picked up for her. Shetook the smoothie with her and drank it while she drove the boys to soccerpractice. She headed straight from soccer to the grocery store where she filledher basket with good foods. The smoothie gave her good energy so she didn’t feellike she needed a soda.At home, she put in her hour of cleaning and then fixed a lunch consisting of aspinach salad with salmon, blueberries, walnuts, avocado, and a little olive oiland lemon. Thanks to the good nutrition, she was able to think clearly duringthe afternoon. With the chips out of her house, she didn’t feel them calling outto her.When her husband told her about being invited to a barbecue, she decided tobring a few of the raw veggies she had bought earlier that day so she couldmunch on them instead of chips and dip. At the barbecue, she sat far away fromthe buffet table and asked her husband to bring her a barbecued chicken breastand a little green salad and nothing else. She asked him to eat any cookies asfar away from her as possible so she wouldn’t be tempted. That night, when theboys sat down next to her on the couch, they each had an apple. Stephanie madeit through her first day at home without giving in to her cravings!For many of us, like Stephanie, cravings can be the culprit that derails ourgood intentions to stick with a brain healthy program. But like Stephanie, youcan make simple changes to your daily habits in order to get better control ofyour cravings. In this chapter I will give you nine secrets for conquering yourcravings. First, I will help you understand how cravings can hijack your brain.WHY AM I A SLAVE TO THESE CRAVINGS? UNDERSTANDING THE BRAIN’S REWARD SYSTEMYou probably think that being a slave to your cravings is a sign of weakness. Inreality, your cravings may be a sign that your brain’s reward system has beenhijacked. What is the brain’s reward system? It is an intricate network of brainsystems and neurotransmitters that are critical to human survival. It drives usto seek out the things we need to stay alive and carry on the human race.For example, when we are hungry we are motivated to eat because food tastesgood, and it eliminates hunger and cravings. Drinking water quenches our thirstand makes us feel cool and refreshed. It is the same with sex. The physicalpleasure we feel from sex drives us to repeat the behavior. The brain’s pleasurecenters link to the emotional memory centers to create powerful memories thatdrive us to repeat rewarding behaviors. If we got no rewards from eating,drinking, or having sex, we wouldn’t be motivated to do them and we certainlywouldn’t last long on this planet.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I always craved things like bacon cheeseburgers. But you can have burgers in abrain healthy way. Now I make them with extra lean ground turkey, avocado, andtomatoes, and I either use whole wheat buns or serve them in lettuce cups.They’re delicious! I don’t miss the beef at all.”—RogerMany other things that are not necessarily crucial to our survival also activatethe reward system, like listening to music, taking a warm bath, or looking at abeautiful painting. Then there are substances and behaviors that are actuallydetrimental to our health and well-being that cause the reward system to kickinto high gear—cocaine; heroin; alcohol; gambling; and yes, even caramel fudgebrownies, salty pretzels, and chronic overeating.Let’s take a closer look at the neurotransmitters and brain systems involved inthe reward system so you can see how it works and how it gets out of whack.First, let’s examine the role played by four neurotransmitters.Neurotransmitters act as the brain’s chemical messengers, relaying informationwithin the brain. The strength or weakness of each of these neurotransmittersplays an important role in your ability to stop overeating.BRAIN CHEMICALS INVOLVED WITH CRAVINGS AND SELF-CONTROL• Dopamine—Motivation, saliency, drive, stimulant• Serotonin—Happy, anti-worry, calming• GABA—Inhibitory, calms, relaxes• Endorphins—Pleasure and pain-killing propertiesDopamine is a feel-good chemical. Whenever we do something enjoyable, it’s likepressing a button in the brain to release a little bit of dopamine to make usfeel pleasure. If we push these pleasure buttons too often or too strong, wereduce dopamine’s effectiveness. Eventually, it takes more and more excitementand stimulation to feel anything at all. Cocaine, methamphetamines, alcohol, andnicotine all cause an increase in dopamine that make these substances highlydesirable. The amount of dopamine released when drugs are taken is much higherthan what your brain produces for natural rewards.Drugs and alcohol aren’t the only substances that can hijack your brain. As Ihave already mentioned, sugar lights up the brain’s dopamine pathway similar tothe way cocaine and heroin do. Let me tell you more about that fascinating 2007study from French researchers. In this trial, rats were allowed to choosebetween plain water, water sweetened with saccharin, water sweetened withsucrose (table sugar), and cocaine. After just one day of sampling cocaine andthe sweetened beverages, the rats overwhelmingly chose the sweet stuff. In fact,94 percent of the animals preferred the sweetened beverages to the cocaine,which is considered to be one of the most addictive drugs available. Even ratsthat were already addicted to cocaine or that received higher doses of the drugcontinued to go for the sweet stuff instead. This led the researchers toconclude that sugar and saccharin can hijack the brain’s reward system and leadto addiction.The same thing can happen from eating too many high-fat, high-calorie foods likebacon, sausage, cheesecake, chocolate bars, frosting, and pound cake, accordingto a 2010 study from the Scripps Research Institute. For this fascinating trial,researchers fed rats a diet of either low-calorie chow or unlimited amounts ofjunk food. Not surprisingly, the rats that ate the junk food began to displaycompulsive eating habits and, after forty days, were obese.What was intriguing is that the junk food diet effectively rewired their brain’spleasure centers. Just a few days of indulging on the junk food basically woreout their reward system and significantly reduced their brain’s ability toexperience pleasure. This means that they no longer got as much of a dopamineboost from the bacon and other fatty foods as they originally had, and theyneeded to consume more and more of it to get that same reward. Needingincreasing amounts of a drug in order to feel the same amount of pleasure is oneof the hallmarks of addiction.And just like drug addicts who continue to use in spite of negative consequenceslike health problems, relationship troubles, and financial woes, the rats lovedtheir junk food so much they were willing to withstand foot shocks to eat it. Bycontrast, rats that had been eating the low-calorie chow quickly stopped eatingthe high-calorie fare when shocked.Also disturbing about this study is the fact that the changes in the brain’sreward system appeared to remain for weeks after the trial had ended. When theaddicted, obese rats were put back on their usual low-calorie chow diet, theysimply refused to eat. They preferred to starve themselves than eat thenutritious, but boring, chow.The link between sugar and addiction can do more than just make you overeat. Didyou know that bingeing on sugar has been found to raise the risk for indulgingin drugs or alcohol? Because alcohol is metabolized in the body the same waysugar is, eating sugar can fuel alcohol cravings, and drinking alcohol cantrigger sugar cravings. Sugar addiction is common in alcoholics and oftendevelops when alcoholics try to quit drinking.Professor Bart Hoebel and a team of researchers from Princeton University havebeen studying sugar addiction in rats for decades. In one of their trials, theyfound that when sugar-addicted rats were deprived of sucrose, they starteddrinking more alcohol than normal. Similarly, rats that consumed more alcoholincreased intake of sugar.As many of you know from personal experience, salt can also be an addictivesubstance. In 2006 a researcher from Turkey published a study called “SaltAddiction: A Different Kind of Drug Addiction.” In it he suggested that if youlook at the current method of diagnosing substance abuse, it would apply to manypeople who have salt cravings. Some of the criteria used to diagnose substanceabuse include withdrawal symptoms (some people experience slight nausea whenthey go without salt), unsuccessful efforts to cut down usage, and use despiteconsequences (high salt intake is associated with hypertension and increases therisk for stroke and cardiovascular disease). That sounds like addiction to me.One of our weight-loss participants is very familiar with the lure of salt. Heused to put salt on everything he ate, even on watermelon. He had been using somuch salt for so many years that he couldn’t taste his food anymore. We told himto cut out salt, and after about three weeks his taste buds started to perk upand he could actually enjoy some of the flavors of his food. He told me that hewent to a restaurant where he had eaten many times before. This time he wasamazed to discover how delicious the food was. He realized he had never actuallytasted the food before. He had no idea what he was missing. Limit your saltintake, or it can hijack your brain.For anyone who has grappled with cravings for foods that make you fat andmiserable, the notion that you can be addicted to certain foods may not come asa shock. The concept is simple. When we eat brain healthy foods, such as a bowlof fresh berries, our brains release small amounts of dopamine, which makes usfeel good. When we eat things like caramel fudge brownies or doublecheeseburgers, our brains pump out lots of dopamine, which makes us feel reallygood. This increases the saliency, or the relative importance, of caramel fudgebrownies and double cheeseburgers in our minds. Soon we no longer get muchpleasure from eating berries and begin craving caramel fudge brownies and doublecheeseburgers instead.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I’ve tried eating lots of diet bars, diet cookies, and diet candy, but I stillhad cravings. A lot of those ‘diet’ snacks have enriched flour, which is justlike eating sugar. The effect on the brain when you eat sugar or enriched flouris the brain asks for more. I’ve found that the less sugar and flour I eat, thebetter.”—JanineExercise and green tea have been shown to be natural ways to increase dopaminein the brain.Serotonin is thought of as the happy, anti-worry, flexibility chemical. Many ofthe current antidepressants work on this neurotransmitter. When serotonin levelsare low, people tend to be worried, rigid, inflexible, oppositional andargumentative, and suffer with anxiety, depression, obsessive thinking, orcompulsive behaviors. One patient described her thinking with low levels ofserotonin like a little mouse that is on an exercise wheel and cannot get off.Their thoughts tend to go over and over and over. Serotonin is raised in thebrain by its amino acid precursor, L-tryptophan or 5-HTP. Amino acids areproteins. Unfortunately, L-tryptophan does not compete well against the otherproteins to get into the brain. Exercise increases L-tryptophan in the brainbecause the other proteins go into the muscles thereby decreasing thecompetition for L-tryptophan to get into the brain. Simple carbohydratesincrease L-tryptophan in the brain, which is why some people can get hooked oncookies, bread, potatoes, and sugar as a way to boost their mood. Exercise and5-HTP or L-trytophan are natural ways to boost serotonin.GABA, or gamma-aminobutyric acid, is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that calmsor helps to relax the brain. If you have suffered an emotional trauma or you areunder a lot of stress, GABA may be depleted and your emotional or limbic brainmay become excessively active, making you feel anxious, uptight, or sad. Thiscan make you eat in an attempt to calm your limbic brain.The amino acid supplement GABA can help, as can vitamin B6, magnesium, lemonbalm, kava kava, and valerian.Endorphins are the brain’s own natural pleasure and pain-killing chemicals. Theyare the body’s own natural morphine or heroin-like substances. These substancesare heavily involved in addiction and the loss of control. Cocoa andDL-phenylalanine have been shown to increase endorphin production in the brain.Now let’s take a look at the brain systems that drive you to seek out rewardingbehavior and that regulate your self-control.BRAIN SYSTEMS INVOLVED WITH CRAVINGS AND SELF-CONTROL * Nucleus accumbens (basal ganglia)—Pleasure and motivation center * Deep limbic system—Emotional memory centers, triggers of behavior * Prefrontal cortex—Focus, judgment, and impulse controlNUCLEUS ACCUMBENSLocated deep within the brain in an area called the basal ganglia, the nucleusaccumbens is the pleasure and motivation center of the brain. It is one of theprimary drivers that trigger your behavior. Be careful not to overstimulate thenucleus accumbens or it gets sensitized and needs more and more stimulation tofeel anything at all.DEEP LIMBIC SYSTEMThe deep limbic system houses your brain’s emotional memory centers and candrive you to action. According to my friend, addiction specialist Mark Laaser,Ph.D., your arousal template, the emotional basis for what turns you on and whatsets people up for addictions, is likely found in the brain’s emotional memorycenters. Understanding your early life triggers for later life addictions isimportant in the healing process. My grandfather, being both a candy maker andsomeone I deeply loved, was clearly involved with my sugar addiction. For you,it is important to understand where you were and how old you were when youexperienced your first pleasurable or arousing experience connected to youraddiction. These intense emotionally pleasurable experiences often strengthenthe neural tracts for later addictions, even if the experience happened as earlyas age two or three. The first experience gets locked into the brain, and whenyou get older you seek to repeat the experience because it was the way you hadthe initial arousal or pleasurable experience, like the first time you tastedice cream, had sex, or fell in love. Understanding the triggers for emotionaleating can be very helpful to breaking addictions.PREFRONTAL CORTEXThe prefrontal cortex (PFC) is involved in impulse control, judgment, focus, andfollow-through. It is the brain’s brake, which reins in your actions and makesyou stop and think before doing something you might regret. The PFC is larger inhuman beings than in any other animal by far. It is the part of the brain thatmakes us human. It represents 30 percent of the human brain. Compare that with11 percent of a chimpanzee’s brain, 7 percent of a dog’s brain, and 3 percent ofa cat’s brain. Cats have little forethought and impulse control. The strength orweakness of this brain system determines in large part whether you can say no totemptations or give in to your cravings.WHY CAN’T I JUST SAY NO? THE BRAIN’S SELF-CONTROL CIRCUITThe brain systems that drive you to seek out things that bring you pleasure andthe PFC, which puts on the brakes when you are about to engage in riskybehavior, work in concert to create your self-control circuit. In a healthyself-control circuit (see Figure 6.1 on the next page), an effective PFCprovides impulse control and good judgment while the deep limbic system offersan adequate dose of motivation so you can plan and follow through on your goals.Healthy dopamine levels drive you to pursue your passions while a healthy PFCacts as the reins or the brake so you do not get out of control. When thesechemicals and brain areas are in balance, you can be focused, goal-oriented, andhave control over your cravings. You can say no to cheesy lasagna, pizza, andhot fudge sundaes.In the addicted brain, the PFC is diminished and the drive circuits takecontrol. When the PFC is underactive (see Figure 6.2 on the next page), it cancreate an imbalance with the reward system and cause you to lose control overyour behavior. When this is the case you are more likely to fall victim to yourcravings. Having low activity in the PFC often results in a tendency forimpulse-control problems and poor internal supervision.Researchers have been studying addicted drive circuits in the brains ofsubstance abusers for many years. Thanks to brain imaging, they are now seeingsimilar brain patterns in people who have problems with gambling, sex, andovereating. For example, researchers at Brookhaven National Laboratory have beenusing PET brain imaging to conduct a series of studies on the inner workings ofthe brain’s self-control circuit in obese patients. The scans reveal the samepatterns of brain dysfunction found in people addicted to cocaine or alcohol,with lower dopamine levels in the basal ganglia. Other PET studies from thissame team show a correlation between a higher body mass index (BMI) anddecreased activity in the PFC, which means overweight and obese people arelikely to have less self-control.Anything that decreases activity to the brain robs you of good judgment andmakes you more likely to give in to your cravings. Pushing on your brain’spleasure buttons too hard or too often can cause the brain’s brakes to fail bydecreasing activity in the PFC. Poor sleep, ADD, and head injuries are alsoassociated with reduced PFC activity. Many people don’t even realize they havehad a head injury that has affected their self-control.[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_027_r1.jpg]Figures 6.1 and 6.2: In the healthy self-control circuit, the prefrontal cortex(PFC) is strong and there is good balance between the chemical dopamine and thebasal ganglia (BG), which houses the nucleus accumbens, and limbic or emotionalcircuits in the brain. In the addicted circuit, the PFC is weak, so it haslittle control over unbridled passions that drive behaviors. Addiction andchronic overeating can actually change the brain in a negative way making itharder to apply the brakes to harmful behaviors. In the healthy brain, the PFCis constantly assessing the value of incoming information and theappropriateness of the planned response, applying the brakes or inhibitorycontrol as needed. In the addicted brain, this control circuit becomes impairedthrough drug abuse, ADD, sleep deprivation, a brain injury, or overeating,losing much of its inhibitory power over the circuits that drive response tostimuli deemed salient.THE AMEN SOLUTION ALL-STARS: DR. RIZWAN MALIKWhile I was writing this book, I received an unexpected e-mail from Dr. RizMalik, one of the psychiatrists in our Reston, Virginia, clinic. Riz is anoutstanding child psychiatrist who works very hard and has many gratefulpatients. The subject line read: “A Different Person.” In the e-mail, Riz sentme the two photos you see on this page with a note saying, “Hey guys, I lost 28pounds in the last three months. The pictures show the difference. I just wantedto share.”I was so excited to see the change in Riz, I had to find out how he did it. Hesaid it was right around the time my book Change Your Brain, Change Your Bodywas released that a friend of his got diagnosed with high cholesterol and highblood pressure, and it scared him. It made him start to examine his own healthand well-being.[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_028_r1.jpg]Left: Before, 183 pounds Right: Four months later, lost 33 poundsAfter Riz came to the United States fifteen years ago at age twenty-five, hepicked up the habit of eating lots of rich food loaded with saturated fat anddrinking sugary beverages. He averaged about four sodas (about 400 calories) andtwo fast-food meals (about 700 calories each) during the workday, bringing himto about 1,800 calories before he ate dinner. For lunch, he was addicted toeating a burger with mushrooms and Swiss cheese. He craved them every day. Healso craved Indian foods with heavy curry sauces and lots of bread to go withthem (and the bread was made with white flour, not whole wheat). In addition, healso started to crave potato bread and was eating three to four slices a daywith butter.Riz said, “It seemed that eating all of this food was a way of rewarding myselffor the hard work, the night calls, and the fact that I sometimes gotoverwhelmed with challenging psychiatric patients, as I had to ‘absorb’ all thenegativity, sadness, and mental turmoil my patients go through. So eating was agood way out. But now I feel that I was, in fact, penalizing myself by eatingall those carb- and fat-loaded meals.”Those high-fat meals weren’t doing him any favors. In addition to pushing hisweight to 183 and his BMI to 27, they gave him gastroesophageal reflux disease(GERD), also known as acid reflux. At forty years of age now, he thought that ifhe kept going in this direction, he would weight about 250 pounds by the time heturned fifty-five.“When I started looking at what I had done to myself, I thought, ‘My God, thisis not good,’ ” Riz exclaimed. “I’m a physician and child psychiatrist, and hereI am telling my patients and kids to eliminate sugar and eat healthy, but whatam I doing?”Riz realized he wasn’t eating any vegetables or getting much fiber in his diet.Using the tips in Change Your Brain, Change Your Body as well as other reputablenutrition sources, he started making changes to his eating habits. He ditchedthe sodas and switched to water with a little lemon. He started eating organicapples and blueberries, yogurt with fiber, skinless chicken and turkey breast,low-calorie whole grain bread, high-fiber lentils, and lots of veggies. He alsostarted taking fish oil and Attention Support, which supports attention andfocus, and doing about ten to fifteen minutes of light exercise every day.At first, the thought of giving up his burgers and comfort foods seemed almostimpossible. “I thought, ‘I don’t like these healthy foods. I need some burgersand meat,’ ” he said. “But after a while, you get used to the healthy food andstart to like it.” Now he looks forward to his blueberries, yogurt, and otherbrain healthy fare.After four months, Riz lost 33 pounds, dropped his BMI to 22.7, and whittled hiswaistline from 36 inches to 30 inches. He weighs 150 pounds now, but weight lossisn’t the only benefit from the changes he has made. “One of the most amazingthings is my sleep has improved,” he said. “I had GERD, and now that’s gone.Plus, my level of alertness is better, and I’m more efficient at work.”NINE WAYS TO CONQUER YOUR CRAVINGSNow that you have a better understanding of the way foods and overeating canhijack your brain, here are nine strategies to help you get control of yourcravings.1. KEEP YOUR BLOOD SUGAR BALANCED.Low blood sugar levels are associated with lower overall brain activity,including lower activity in the PFC, the brain’s brake. Low brain activity heremeans more cravings and more bad decisions. In a 2007 article, Matthew Gailliotand Roy Baumeister detailed the connection between blood sugar levels andself-control. They write that self-control failures are more likely to occurwhen blood sugar is low. Low blood sugar levels can make you feel hungry,irritable, or anxious—all of which make you more likely to make poor choices.What causes low blood sugar levels? Many everyday behaviors can cause dips inblood sugar levels, including drinking alcohol, skipping meals, and consumingsugary snacks or beverages. High-sugar treats and drinks actually cause aninitial spike in blood sugar, but then a crash about thirty minutes later.Gailliot and Baumeister’s study also indicates that the body uses glucose lessefficiently as the day progresses, leading to more self-control failures in theevening and later at night. This doesn’t surprise me. I have worked with so manypeople who tell me they follow their brain healthy eating plan all day long butwhen nighttime rolls around, they can’t resist the foods that tempt them. Doesthat sound familiar to you?Here are tips to keep your blood sugar levels even throughout the day so you canreduce cravings and boost your self-control.Consider taking the supplements alpha-lipoic acid and chromium. They both havevery good scientific evidence that they help balance blood sugar levels and canhelp with cravings. (For more on these supplements and how they work, seechapter 5 [Amen_9780307463623_epub_c05_r1.htm].)GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I used to go a really long time without eating because I was really busy duringthe day, but then I would be starving at night and have really intensecravings.”—MartyEat a nutritious breakfast every day. A lot of people skip breakfast. I used tobe one of them. Don’t think that skipping breakfast will save you calories andhelp you lose weight. In reality, it makes your blood sugar levels drop andmakes you so hungry by lunchtime that you tend to overeat. That was the problemfor Dan, the All-Star you met in chapter 1 [Amen_9780307463623_epub_c01_r1.htm].“I’d get up in the morning and would have coffee but no breakfast until 10a.m.,” he said. “It wouldn’t faze me until I was starving to death, and then Iwould pound down a huge lunch and huge meals for the rest of the day.”Eating a nutrient-rich breakfast helps get your blood sugar off to a good startand can help keep it balanced for hours so you don’t get hungry beforelunchtime. Studies show that people who maintain weight loss eat a healthybreakfast. For All-Star Dan, eating something for breakfast has helped him curbthe cravings for bread, potatoes, and steak that would sneak up on him later inthe day.Add a dash of cinnamon. This fragrant spice has been found to help regulateblood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes.Have smaller meals throughout the day. Big meals send your blood sugarskyrocketing only to plummet later on. Eating smaller meals helps eliminate theblood sugar roller-coaster ride that can impact your emotions and increase yourcravings.Stay away from simple sugars and refined carbohydrates. Things like candy,potatoes, white bread, pretzels, sodas, sweetened fruit juices, and alcoholcause your blood sugar to spike and then drop, so you feel great for a shortwhile and then you feel stupid and hungry. Be very careful with high-fat,high-sugar, high-calorie foods because they work on the morphine or heroincenters of the brain and can be addictive, as you saw earlier in this chapter.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I think of the foods I used to crave like an itch, and getting my brainbalanced got rid of the itches.”—RenéeIn 1994, a study found that carbohydrate cravings in obese people can be asymptom of a condition called chronic hyperinsulinemia, also known as insulinresistance, in which there is too much insulin in the blood. The researchersreported that this condition fosters carbohydrate cravings, and they suggestedthat decreasing the frequency of high-carbohydrate meals could lead to weightloss in people with this condition.The bottom line: Eliminate sugar and refined carbohydrates.When I finally got this one idea through my own thick skull, it made a hugedifference for me, and I was finally able to lose the extra pounds I had beentrying to shed for three decades. I love living without cravings. But for yearsI fought the idea of giving up sweets like Rocky Road ice cream and candy.I know that kicking the sugar habit isn’t easy for many people—it is kicking adrug—and it certainly wasn’t easy for me, but I found that when I substitutedbrain healthy fruit like blueberries, bananas, and apples, the cravingscompletely went away. Have you ever known someone to eat too many blueberries?For most people, it takes about two weeks of completely avoiding sugar for yourcravings to go away.2. DECREASE THE ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS.If you really want to decrease your cravings, you have to get rid of theartificial sweeteners in your diet. We think of these sweeteners as free,because they have no calories, but because they are up to six hundred timessweeter than sugar, they may activate the appetite centers of the brain, makingyou crave even more food and more sugar. A group of Australian scientists foundthat alcohol floods the bloodstream faster when it is mixed with beveragescontaining artificial sweeteners rather than sugar. Diet sodas are not theanswer. The one natural no-calorie sweetener I like is called stevia.3. MANAGE YOUR STRESS.Another very important way to decrease your cravings is to get on a dailystress-management program. Anything stressful can trigger certain hormones thatactivate your cravings, making you believe that you need the mashed potatoes,macaroni and cheese, or ice cream. Chronic stress has been implicated inobesity, as well as addictions; anxiety and depressive disorders; Alzheimer’sdisease; heart disease; and a host of immune disorders, including cancer.When stress hits, there are increased levels of adrenaline (leading to anxiety)and cortisol (leading to many ills) and decreased levels of the hormones DHEAand testosterone (leading to loss of muscle tissue, increased fat, and decreasedlibido). Chronic exposure to adrenaline causes our systems to be overloaded withtoo much stimulation and leads to obesity, anxiety and depression, and memoryproblems. Chronic exposure to cortisol can make you fat, miserable, and stupid.It has been associated with myriad problems that make us unhappy, such asincreased appetite, sugar and fat cravings, and abdominal obesity.Cortisol signals your body to hold onto its fat stores, leading to a highwaist-to-hip ratio (WHR—the circumference of the waist in inches divided by thatof the hips), which makes you look like an apple. A person’s WHR is associatedwith perceived attractiveness. An optimal WHR is 0.8; anything above that puts aperson at risk for the illnesses mentioned above associated with higher cortisollevels, and less sexy. A WHR ratio of 0.7 has been associated with the mostattractive women, in part because it is a sign of health and potentialfertility. As we age, our figures go from being an hourglass to a shot glass(especially if we are drinking too much alcohol or eating too much sugar).Long-term exposure to high levels of cortisol has also been associated with lowenergy, poor concentration, elevated cholesterol levels, heart disease, andhypertension, as well as an increased risk for strokes, diabetes (reducedsensitivity to insulin), muscle wasting, osteoporosis, anxiety, depression,irregular menstrual periods, lowered libido, and decreased fertility. Highcortisol levels decrease immune system function, shrinking the thymus gland andimpairing white blood cell function (as much as 50 percent following a severestress). Chronic stress dramatically increases the use of medical services andhealth care costs. Stress not only increases cortisol, it decreases key anabolichormones, such as DHEA, growth hormone, and testosterone. This combinationcauses you to store fat, lose muscle, slow metabolic rate, and increase yourappetite.In the last decade there has been a clear association between chronic stress,high cortisol levels, and memory problems, causing shrinkage of cells in thehippocampus of the brain. In fact, people with Alzheimer’s disease have highercortisol levels than normal aging people.Here are several brain healthy ways of dealing with stress that do not involvefood.Deep breathing. As part of the body’s natural stress response, your breathingbecomes more shallow. When you take shallow breaths, it reduces the amount ofoxygen that reaches your brain cells, reducing overall brain function. Thesimple act of breathing also serves to eliminate waste products, such as carbondioxide, from the body, and shallow breathing can lead to a buildup of carbondioxide. When there is too much carbon dioxide in your system, it can causestressful feelings of disorientation and panic, things that can lead tocravings.Diaphragmatic breathing, using the big muscle between your chest and abdominalcavity called the diaphragm, is a relaxation technique that can reverse theseeffects. Taking deep breaths with your belly also relaxes your muscles, whichrelieves tension, and helps your brain function more efficiently, which improvesyour thinking and judgment.Here’s how you do it. As you inhale, let your belly expand. When you exhale,pull your belly in to push the air out of your lungs. This allows you to expelmore air, which in turn, encourages you to inhale more deeply. Take ten minutestwice a day to breathe in this fashion and stressful feelings will start to calmdown. I use this exercise with my own patients all the time.DEEP-BREATHING EXERCISEPractice this simple three-step exercise to learn diaphragmatic breathing. Dothis for ten minutes twice a day. Within a week you will be much calmer.1. Lie on your back and place a small book on your belly.2. As you slowly inhale, make the book go up. Hold your breath at the top of thebreath for two seconds.3. When you exhale, make the book go down. Hold your breath at the bottom fortwo seconds.STRESS-RELIEVING BREATHING STRATEGYWhenever you feel stressed out, use the following diaphragmatic breathingtechnique. * Take a deep breath. * Hold it for two to three seconds. * Slowly blow it out (take about six to eight seconds to exhale completely). * Take another deep breath (as deep as you can). * Hold it for two to three seconds. * Blow it out slowly again. * Do this about ten times, and odds are you will start to feel very relaxed.Meditation and hypnosis are also wonderful stress-management practices that canhelp boost your brain so you can get control of your cravings. I will talk aboutthese more in chapter 9 [Amen_9780307463623_epub_c09_r1.htm].There are many other healthy ways to lower your stress levels without running tothe refrigerator. Here’s a list that you can refer to when you feel overwhelmed. * Pet your dog or cat. * Take a warm bath. * Learn to delegate. You don’t have to do everything yourself, and it is okay to ask for help.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I have some friends who did the gastric bypass, or LAP-BAND, surgery who arestill chubby. It makes perfect sense if you are eating lots of high GI foodsconstantly, even if you are only eating three ounces at a time, you are stillmessing up your system.”—Angie * Don’t automatically say yes to every invitation, project, or activity. Say no to things that don’t fit into your goals and desires. * Listen to soothing music. * Lavender has been shown to have calming, stress-relieving properties, so use lavender-scented oils, candles, sprays, lotion, or sachets. * If you’re stressed about an upcoming event or situation where you have to give a talk or meet new people, rehearse what you are going to say. * Learn to laugh at yourself.4. OUTSMART SNEAKY TRIGGERS.To control your cravings you also have to outsmart the sneaky triggers that tryto sabotage you nearly everywhere you go. No matter which foods you crave, thereare environmental triggers all around. If cinnamon rolls are your weakness,going to the mall and smelling the scent of cinnamon wafting from the food courtcan ignite your brain’s emotional memory centers and make you feel like you haveto have one.Basically, you can’t go to the mall, the airport, or the ball game withoutseeing store after store and vendor after vendor advertising something that willfire up your cravings. For example, whenever I went to the movies, I used toimmediately think about getting a big tub of popcorn with lots of butter alongwith licorice. But then I actually thought about the gobs of saturated fat,salt, and sugar that would be flooding my brain. Another trigger for me is goingover to my mom’s house on holidays—she makes the most amazing pizzas. I couldeasily eat eight slices but end up feeling stuffed and stupid.To control your cravings, you have to control your triggers. Know the people,places, and things that fuel your cravings and plan ahead for your vulnerabletimes. For example, I take a snack with me when I go to the movies now so I amnot tempted by the popcorn and licorice, and I eat a little something ahead oftime before going over to my mom’s house on holidays, so that my brain canchoose to eat a slice or two of pizza without blowing the whole holiday seasonin one thirty-minute gorge.5. FIND OUT ABOUT HIDDEN FOOD ALLERGIES.Hidden food allergies and food sensitivities can trigger cravings. For example,did you know that if you have wheat gluten or milk allergies and you eat wheator dairy products, it can reduce blood flow to the brain and decrease yourjudgment? That makes you more likely to give in to your cravings. In addition,many of the symptoms associated with food allergies, such as headaches, sleepproblems, lack of concentration, and anxiety, can increase stress and cravings.One of the things that might surprise you about hidden food allergies is thatthe foods you are allergic to are often the ones you crave the most. It seemscounterintuitive, but it is true. So if you have a sensitivity to chocolate,that may be part of the explanation why you crave it. A sensitivity to glutencould make you crave bread, muffins, and other baked goods. I often order adelayed food allergy test called IgG (or immunoglobin G) on my patients. If yoususpect food allergies ask your doctor to test you for it or try an eliminationdiet. Dr. Annibali, our chief psychiatrist in Reston, wrote up the followingsummary of elimination diets for our patients.Follow an Elimination Diet. We are coming to understand that subtle butimportant food allergies may result in brain inflammation that contributes tomany of the brain issues we see at Amen Clinics. These food allergies can bedelayed, in the sense that bodily reactions to the food items may occur up toseveral days after consuming the item. Conventional medicine has tended toignore these reactions to foods. However, we believe that these food issuescreate a metabolic disorder that can lead to many “mental” symptoms, includingfatigue, brain fog, slowed thinking, irritability, agitation, aggression,anxiety, depression and bipolar conditions, ADD, learning disabilities, autism,schizophrenia, and even dementia.To test the theory that food allergies are involved in your issues, follow anelimination diet—essentially a dairy-free, wheat gluten–free diet—for one to twomonths. Also, consume no sugars, food additives, preservatives, artificialflavorings, or colors. If you find that you feel better after one to two monthson this diet, slowly reintroduce food items, one at a time, every three to fourdays, to determine whether the newly introduced food item triggers problems.When you reintroduce a food to which you may be sensitive, eat them at least twoto three times a day for three days to see if you notice a reaction (unless, ofcourse, you notice a problem right away—then stop immediately). Symptoms canoccur from a few minutes to seventy-two hours later. If you have a reaction,note the food and eliminate it for ninety days. This will give your immunesystem a chance to cool off and your gut a chance to heal.

PRACTICE WILLPOWER TO RETRAIN YOUR BRAIN.Willpower is like a muscle. You have to use it or lose it. Self-control is veryimportant if you want to lose weight and gain control of your life, happiness,and even intelligence. How do self-control and intelligence go hand-in-hand?Research shows that preschoolers who know how to delay gratification achievehigher academic performance, cope better with stress and frustration, and havebetter social and cognitive skills as adolescents. You can thank celebratedpsychology professor and researcher Walter Mischel and his famous “marshmallowexperiment” for this insight.Here’s how the 1960s experiment worked. Mischel or one of his colleagues inviteddozens of preschoolers into a laboratory room one at a time and had them sitdown at a table. On the table was a marshmallow. The researcher told each childthat they had two options. They could either eat the marshmallow right away, orthey could wait for several minutes and then get two marshmallows. Some of thechildren couldn’t wait and gobbled up the marshmallow. Others, however, used anarray of tactics to keep from eating the treat—clapping their hands or turningtheir chair to face away from the marshmallow, for example. (You can findseveral reenactments of this landmark experiment at www.youtube.com[http://www.youtube.com]—just search for “Marshmallow Test.”)Mischel then followed these youngsters for fourteen years and found that thosewho were able to delay gratification fared much better in life than those whoate the marshmallow. The “waiters” had higher self-esteem, were better at copingwith stress and frustration, performed better academically, scored an average of210 points higher on their SATs, and were more socially adept than the“gobblers.”GET SMART TO GET THINNER“With cravings, you get stuck in your habits. You just have to get unstuck.”—SamIn a follow-up study, Mischel reenacted the experiment. This time, he includedadults in the process. The grown-ups used a variety of tactics to avoid eatingthe single marshmallow while the youngsters watched. Then when it was their turnto try to delay gratification, children who previously had eaten the lonemarshmallow used the techniques they had just witnessed and successfully managedto wait it out and get the two marshmallows. In later follow-ups, these childrenperformed at levels similar to those who had the natural ability to delaygratification.What Mischel’s fascinating work tells us is that children can learn techniquesand strategies to delay gratification. If kids can do it, so can you! Learn theart of distraction. Singing a song, taking a brief walk, or meditating for a fewmoments can take your mind off foods you crave. Put your trigger foods out ofsight so they aren’t so tempting.Most of us learn to develop self-control as children. When our parents say no tous when we ask if we can do things that aren’t good for us—have a plate ofcookies before dinner, ride on the back of a neighbor’s motorcycle without ahelmet, or grab the tail of a strange dog—we learn to say no to ourselves. Butmaybe your parents weren’t around much, and you had free rein to do whatever youwanted so you never learned self-control. Or perhaps your parents had noself-control themselves, and you learned to give in to your desires by watchingtheir behavior. Or perhaps your chronic overeating has robbed you of yourability to say no.No matter what the reason is for your lack of willpower, you can strengthen it.To pump up your willpower, you need to practice it. Make it a habit to say no tothe things that are not good for you and over time, you will find it easier todo.Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a very important concept here. When nerve cellconnections become strengthened, they are said to be potentiated. Whenever welearn something new, our brains make new connections. At first the connectionsare weak, which is why we do not remember new things unless we practice themover time. Practicing a behavior, such as saying no to the doughnuts, actuallystrengthens the willpower circuits in the brain. LTP occurs when nerve cellcircuits are strengthened, practiced, and behaviors become almost automatic.Whenever you give in to your cravings, it weakens your willpower and makes itmore likely that you will continue to give in. When you practice willpower, yourbrain will make it easier for you to say no.7. GET MOVING.In chapter 7 [Amen_9780307463623_epub_c07_r1.htm] you will discover why exerciseis so important for a better brain. Scientific research has found that physicalactivity can cut cravings whether you crave sugary snacks or things likecigarettes, alcohol, or drugs. One study of moderately heavy smokers who hadabstained from smoking for fifteen hours showed that even when faced withsmoking-related images that would typically trigger cravings, the smokers hadless desire to light up after exercising.A 2009 study in the journal Appetite showed that cravings for chocolatedecreased following a fifteen-minute brisk walk. The urges diminished even whenthe study participants were given a chocolate bar to unwrap and handle. Insteadof immediately giving in to your cravings or focusing on how much you wantsomething, get moving if at all possible.8. GET ADEQUATE SLEEP.Have you ever noticed that after a night with almost no sleep, you wake upravenously hungry and want to eat anything and everything in sight? That isbecause lack of sleep increases food cravings. An expanding body of scientificevidence has shown that the less sleep you get, the more cravings you have, themore calories you eat, the more belly fat you have, and the higher your BMI.ARE YOU GETTING ENOUGH SLEEP?Age Range Average Sleep Requirements 1–3 years old 12–14 hours 3–5 years old11–13 hours 5–12 years old 10–11 hours 13–19 years old 9 hours Adults 7–8 hoursSeniors 7–8 hours Sources: National Sleep Foundation, National Institute ofNeurological Disorders and Stroke.Here’s what researchers from around the nation have discovered about sleep,cravings, and your weight.According to a study from the University of Chicago, people who aresleep-deprived eat more simple carbohydrates than people who get adequate sleep.The researchers studied twelve healthy men in their twenties and found that whenthe men slept only four hours a night, they were more likely to choose candy,cookies, and cake over fruit, vegetables, or dairy products.For this study, which appeared in the Annals of Internal Medicine, researchersalso looked at two hormones—leptin and ghrelin—that are regulated by sleep andinvolved in appetite. Leptin and ghrelin work together to control feelings ofhunger and satiety. Ghrelin levels rise to signal the brain that you are hungry,and leptin levels increase to tell your brain when you are full. The researchersmeasured the levels of leptin and ghrelin before the study, after two nights ofonly four hours of sleep, and after two nights of ten hours of sleep. After fourhours of sleep, the ratio of ghrelin jumped 71 percent, compared with a nightwhen the men slept for the longer period of time. This made the men feelhungrier and drove them to consume more simple carbohydrates.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“Pretty soon, when you get away from the sugar and refined carbs, then you startlooking for healthy things to eat instead of thinking, ‘I wish I had a BigMac.’ ”—AllanIn a study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, researchershad people sleep for five and a half hours for two weeks and then eight and ahalf hours for another two weeks at random. Then they measured how many snacksthe subjects munched during their stays in the sleep laboratory. When the peopleslept only five and a half hours, they consumed an average of 221 more caloriesin high-carbohydrate snacks than when they got eight and a half hours of sleep.This pattern is occurring in the real world too, not just in researchers’ sleeplabs. According to the 2009 Sleep in America Poll, people who are having troublesleeping are almost twice as likely to chow down on sugary foods and simplecarbs, such as potato chips, to help them make it through the day. They are alsomore inclined to skip breakfast or other meals, which puts your blood sugarlevels on a roller-coaster ride that’s bad for brain function and often leads topoor nutrition choices later in the day.Sleeping less makes you eat more sugary junk foods rather than fruits,vegetables, and whole grains. It also makes you eat more calories overall. Astudy from researchers at Case Western University tracked the sleeping habitsand weight fluctuations of 68,183 women for sixteen years. The women were brokendown into three categories—those who slept seven hours a night, those who loggedsix hours of sleep, and those who got five hours or less of sleep. They foundthat the women who slept five hours or less gained the most weight over time andwere the most likely to become obese. The women who slept only six hours a nightwere more likely to pack on extra weight than the women who got seven hours ofshut-eye.Dozens of other studies point to a connection between a lack of sleep and weightgain or obesity. For example, researchers at the University of Warwick revieweddata from more than twenty-eight thousand children and more than fifteenthousand adults and found that sleep deprivation almost doubles the risk ofobesity for adults and children.A Stanford University study found lower leptin levels and higher ghrelin levelsin people who sleep less. The researchers examined a thousand people, measuringtheir sleep habits, their sleep on the night before the exam, and their leptinand ghrelin levels. They found that people who consistently slept five hours orless per night had on average 14.9 percent more ghrelin (which stimulatesappetite) and 15.5 percent lower leptin (which tells your brain you are full)than people who slept eight hours a night. These studies show that when youdon’t get enough sleep, you feel hungrier and don’t feel full regardless of howmuch you eat.One of the reasons why lack of sleep makes you more likely to give in tocravings is that people who get fewer than seven hours of sleep a night havelower activity in the PFC. Remember, the PFC is the area of the brain that isinvolved in impulse control, planning, judgment, and follow-through. Decreasedactivity in the PFC can lead to greater impulsivity and more bad decisions.So, if dodging sleep has been contributing to making you fat, can increasing theamount of sleep you get help you lose weight? Researchers at the NationalInstitute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases are attempting to answerthat question with a clinical trial that is currently under way as of thewriting of this book. The study is recruiting 150 obese people who average fewerthan six and a half hours of sleep a night and is following them for four yearsto see how getting more sleep affects their body composition, belly fat, andmore.In the meantime, editors at Glamour magazine decided to put this notion to thetest with an unscientific—yet fascinating—study. They enlisted seven femalereaders and gave them one simple task: sleep at least seven and a half hourseach night for ten weeks. In addition, they were instructed not to make anysignificant changes in their diets or exercise routines during the ten weeks.The results were amazing. All seven women lost weight, with the weight lossranging from 6 pounds to an astonishing 15 pounds.Lack of sleep not only plays a role in cravings and weight, but it also reducesoverall brain function and can wreak havoc on your moods. In addition toreducing activity in the PFC, it also lowers activity in the temporal lobes,which are involved in learning, memory, and mood stability. This makes it harderto pay attention, solve problems, and remember important information, and itmakes you more likely to make mistakes. Sleep-deprived people are definitely notsmarter.They are not happier, either. People who are tired from lack of sleep tend tofeel irritable and cranky. In one study, 44 percent of American workers admittedthat when they are sleep deprived, they are more likely to be in an unpleasantor unfriendly mood.If you want to curb cravings, get thinner, smarter, and happier, you need to getadequate rest. Aim for seven to eight hours of sleep each night.9. TAKE NATURAL SUPPLEMENTS FOR CRAVING CONTROL.N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), alpha-lipoic acid, chromium, DL-phenylalanine, andL-glutamine are five amazing natural supplements that can help take the edge offcravings. See chapter 5 [Amen_9780307463623_epub_c05_r1.htm] for moreinformation on how they work.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“If I catch myself getting a craving, I take the Craving Control supplement andwithin ten minutes, the craving is totally gone!”—TrishDr. Daniel Amen’s Nutraceutical Solutions: Craving Control. Given what I knowabout craving and nutritional supplements, I developed a special formula to helpsupport craving control. You can learn more about it at www.amenclinics.com[http://www.amenclinics.com]. As we have seen, the key to controlling yourcravings is balancing your brain and maintaining healthy blood sugar levels. Insupport of this goal, Craving Control supports healthy blood sugar levels whileproviding antioxidants and brain healthy nutrients. The formulation includesglutamine to reduce cravings, chromium and alpha-lipoic acid to support stableblood sugar levels, and a brain-healthy chocolate designed to boost endorphins.In addition, the super-antioxidant NAC is added, which has been shown inclinical studies to reduce cravings in a number of different conditions."},{"pageContent":"[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_L09_r1.jpg]While conducting our study on retired NFL players, I made a startling discovery.I had assumed that these world-class athletes who used to spend hours in the gymand on the field to achieve peak conditioning would have continued some form ofathletic training for the rest of their lives. Wow, was I wrong! I was shockedto find out that after they retire from professional football, many formerplayers stop doing any kind of exercise at all. In fact, many of the formerplayers in our study had turned into obese couch potatoes. It seemed ironic forme to be giving advice about exercising to men who, in their prime, could haverun circles around me and knew more about exercise physiology. But I found thatI had to give many of them a crash course in how exercise boosts the brain inorder to motivate them to get off the couch.By contrast, I wasn’t at all surprised to discover that most of the people inour non-NFL weight-loss groups weren’t very active. After all, it is no secretthat our society has shifted to a sedentary lifestyle where most of us spend ourdays sitting—working on computers, watching TV, and driving. The problem is thata lack of physical activity robs the brain of optimal function and is linked toobesity, higher rates of depression, a greater risk for cognitive impairment—andworse. Physical inactivity is the fourth most common preventable cause of death.If you want to lose your belly, get smarter, and be happier, you have to get offyour butt and move! Physical activity is one of the most important things youcan do to burn calories, improve mood, and enhance brain function. In thischapter, I will show you what physical activity can do for your brain and body.Plus, you will learn the best kinds of exercise for your specific brain type.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“As part of my new brain healthy lifestyle, I decided to start swimming. Istarted out swimming just four laps of the pool. Then after a while, I was ableto swim fourteen laps, and I thought, ‘Hey I can do this!’ Then somebody told methat sixty-four laps in this pool equals one mile, and that became my goal, andI did it!”—AshleyMoving your body is only half the exercise equation. To supercharge your brain,you need to combine physical exercise with mental exercise. This chapter willalso reveal the best mental gymnastics to help get your brain and body in gear.GET MOVING TO GET THINNERThere is no shortage of research on the effects of exercise on fat loss. Decadesof scientific evidence has found that exercise, when combined with a healthyeating plan, can help you lose the blubber and keep it off. Of course, exerciseburns calories, which is one of the keys to weight loss and a trimmer figure.But burning calories isn’t the only way that exercise can help you trim yourwaist. Check out these exercise benefits.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I used to exercise for my butt. Now I exercise for my brain.”—DavidTURN OFF THE OBESITY GENE.Exciting new research out of Sweden shows that exercise can deactivate the“obesity gene.” Haven’t heard of the obesity gene? Scientists have identified agene variant, known in scientific circles as FTO rs9939609, that predisposespeople to obesity. A person can have no copies, one copy, or two copies of thegene variant, and your likelihood of obesity increases with the number of copiesyou have. According to the Swedish study, having one copy of the gene variant isassociated with a higher BMI, greater body fat percentage, and larger waistcircumference compared with those with no copies of the gene. Having two copiesof the gene variant is associated with even higher BMI, body fat, and waistsize.What is so exciting about this study, which analyzed data from 752 Europeanadolescents, is that those who had the gene variant but got at least sixtyminutes daily of moderate to vigorous activity were no more likely to beoverweight than those who had no copies. So even if you are genetically loadedto have a weight problem, you can blunt the effects of your genetic makeup. Yourgenes are not your destiny.IMPROVE HOW YOUR BRAIN USES SUGAR.Exercise increases your brain’s ability to regulate insulin and sugar.Maintaining blood sugar stability is critical. If you’re insulin-sensitive andyou exercise, your body can handle sugar and insulin much better and you’ll getoff that blood sugar roller coaster.REDUCE CRAVINGS AND OVERCOME FOOD ADDICTION.New research shows that exercise is helpful in the prevention and treatment ofaddiction, including food addiction. Physical activity actually reduces cravingsfor addictive foods like sugary sweets and high-calorie, high-fat fare. When youeliminate your cravings, it can cut out hundreds or even thousands of caloriesfrom your daily diet.HANDLE STRESS BETTER.Working out helps you manage stress by immediately lowering stress hormones, andit makes you more resistant to stress over time. Raising your heart rate throughexercise also makes you a better stress handler because it raisesbeta-endorphins, the brain’s own natural morphine. Increasing your ability tomanage stress can keep you from polishing off a whole bag of chips when you areunder a lot of pressure.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“At first, I thought I weighed too much to go to the gym, but this programencouraged me to give it a try. I started going and just doing a little bit,like using some light weights. But it got the habit started, and now I goregularly.”—JamesEAT HEALTHIER FOODS.A 2008 study found that being physically active makes you more inclined tochoose foods that are good for you, seek out more social support, and managestress more effectively. As you are learning in this book, all of these factorscan help you rein in out-of-control eating so you can lose weight. Obviously,choosing brain healthy foods over junk food provides the foundation for lastingweight loss. Creating a solid support network to encourage your new brainhealthy habits can help you stay on track. And as explained above, getting ahandle on stress is one of the keys to staying on track.GET MORE RESTFUL SLEEP.Engaging in exercise on a routine basis normalizes melatonin production in thebrain and improves sleeping habits. Getting better sleep improves brainfunction, helps you make better decisions about the foods you eat, and enhancesyour mood. Chronic lack of sleep nearly doubles your risk for obesity and islinked to depression and a sluggish brain.GET MOVING TO GET SMARTERPhysical exercise is a powerful brain booster. Here are some of the many waysthat physical exercise benefits the brain so you can make better decisions aboutwhat and how much you eat.INCREASE CIRCULATION.Physical activity improves your heart’s ability to pump blood throughout yourbody, which increases blood flow to your brain. As you have already learned inthis book, better blood flow equals better overall brain function.GROW MORE NEW BRAIN CELLS.Exercise increases great stuff in your body called brain-derived neurotrophicfactor (BDNF). BDNF is like an antiaging wonder drug that is involved with thegrowth of new brain cells. Think of BDNF as a sort of Miracle-Gro for yourbrain.BDNF promotes learning and memory and makes your brain stronger. Specifically,exercise generates new brain cells in the temporal lobes (involved in memory)and the prefrontal cortex (PFC, involved in planning and judgment). Having astrong PFC and temporal lobes is critical for successful weight loss.A better memory helps you remember to do the important things that will help youlose weight, for example, making an appointment with your physician to checkyour important health numbers, shopping for the foods that are the best for yourbrain, and taking the daily supplements that will benefit your brain type.Planning and judgment are vital because you need to plan meals and snacks inadvance, and you need to make the best decisions throughout the day if you wantto lose the love handles.The increased production of BDNF you get from exercise is only temporary. Thenew brain cells survive for about four weeks then die off unless they arestimulated with mental exercise or social interaction. This means you have toexercise on a regular basis in order to benefit from a continual supply of newbrain cells. It also explains why people who work out at the gym and then go tothe library are smarter than people who only work out at the gym.ENHANCE BRAINPOWER.No matter how old you are, exercise increases your memory, your ability to thinkclearly, and your ability to plan. Decades of research have found that physicalactivity leads to better grades and higher test scores among students at alllevels. It also boosts memory in young adults and improves frontal lobe functionin older adults.Getting your body moving also protects the short-term memory structures in thetemporal lobes (hippocampus) from high-stress conditions. Stress causes theadrenal glands to produce excessive amounts of the hormone cortisol, which hasbeen found to kill cells in the hippocampus and impair memory. In fact, peoplewith Alzheimer’s disease have higher cortisol levels than normal aging people.WARD OFF MEMORY LOSS AND DEMENTIA.Exercise helps prevent, delay, and reduce the cognitive impairment that comeswith aging, dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease. In 2010 alone, more than a dozenstudies reported that physical exercise results in a reduction in cognitivedysfunction in older people. One of them came from a group of Canadianresearchers who looked at physical activity over the course of the lifetime of9,344 women. Specifically, they looked at the women’s activity levels asteenagers, at age thirty, at age fifty, and in late life. Physical activity as ateenager was associated with the lowest incidence of cognitive impairment laterin life, but physical activity at any age correlated to reduced risk. This studytells me that it is never too late to start an exercise program.PROTECT AGAINST BRAIN INJURIES.Exercise strengthens the brain and enhances its ability to fight back againstthe damaging effects of brain injuries. This is so critical because braininjuries—even mild ones—can take the PFC offline, which reduces self-control,weakens your ability to say no to cravings, and increases the need for immediategratification as in “I must have that bacon cheeseburger right this minute!”You don’t have to lose consciousness to suffer from brain trauma. Even mild headinjuries that do not typically show up on the structural brain imaging tests canseriously impact your life and increase your risk for overeating problems. Thatis because trauma can affect not only the brain’s hardware, or physical health;but also its software, or how it functions. Head injuries can disrupt and alterneurochemical functioning, resulting in emotional and behavioral problems,including an increased risk for eating problems and substance abuse.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“Every day, I walk at least a couple of miles, and I’m doing some running too. Itake the dogs out and go to the track and do a couple of miles. My next goal isrunning three miles.”—ChrisEach year, two million new brain injuries are reported, and millions more gounreported. Brain trauma is especially common among people with addictions ofall kinds, including food addiction. At Sierra Tucson, a world-renownedtreatment center for addictions and behavioral disorders, our brain imagingtechnology has been used since 2009. One of the most surprising things the brainscans have shown, according to Robert Johnson, M.D., the facility’s medicaldirector, is a much higher than expected incidence of mild traumatic braininjury among their patients.GET MOVING TO GET HAPPIERHave you ever heard the term runner’s high? Is it really possible to feel thatgood, just from exercise? You bet it is. Exercise can activate the same pathwaysin the brain as morphine and increases the release of endorphins, naturalfeel-good neurotransmitters. That makes exercise the closest thing to ahappiness pill you will ever find.BOOST YOUR MOOD.Physical exercise stimulates neurotransmitter activity, specificallynorepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin, which elevates mood.FIGHT DEPRESSION.Type 4 Sad or Emotional Overeaters need to pay special attention to this.Exercise can be as effective as prescription medicine in treating depression.One of the reasons why exercise can be so useful is because BDNF, which I wroteabout earlier in this chapter, not only grows new brain cells but is alsoinstrumental in putting the brakes on depression.The antidepressant benefits of exercise have been documented in medicalliterature. One study compared the benefits of exercise with those of theprescription antidepressant drug Zoloft. After twelve weeks, exercise provedequally effective as Zoloft in curbing depression. After ten months, exercisesurpassed the effects of the drug. Minimizing symptoms of depression isn’t theonly way physical exercise outshone Zoloft.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“Even when I wake up and feel sluggish, I know that once I go to the gym, I willfeel better.”—MarisaLike all prescription medications for depression, Zoloft is associated withnegative side effects, such as sexual dysfunction and lack of libido. Plus,taking Zoloft may ruin your ability to qualify for health insurance. Finally,popping a prescription pill doesn’t help you learn any new skills. On thecontrary, exercise improves your fitness, your shape, and your health, whichalso boosts self-esteem. It doesn’t affect your insurability, and it allows youto gain new skills. If anyone in your family has feelings of depression,exercise can help.I teach a course for people who suffer from depression, and one of the mainthings we cover is the importance of exercise in warding off this condition. Iencourage all of these patients to start exercising and especially to engage inaerobic activity that gets the heart pumping. The results are truly amazing.Over time, many of these patients who have been taking antidepressant medicationfor years feel so much better that they are able to wean off the medicine.Fighting depression is very important if you are overweight because depressionand obesity go hand in hand. A 2010 review of the existing scientific literatureon the subject involving seventeen studies and 204,507 participants showed asignificant association between obesity and depression. The link appears to bestronger in women.Research shows that people who are depressed are more likely to be overweightand experience a faster rise in BMI and waist size than people who are notdepressed. On the flip side, weight problems also increase the risk fordeveloping depression. Which came first, the depression or the weight problem,remains to be seen. But there is no doubt in my mind that getting depressionunder control can help you manage your weight, and losing the extra pounds canhelp alleviate depressive symptoms.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“Now that I’m more active, I really want to go surfing. I never would have triedthat before.”—MaxEASE ANXIETY.Listen up, Type 5 Anxious Overeaters! Although the research on the effects ofexercise on anxiety isn’t quite as voluminous as the evidence on exercise anddepression, it shows that physical activity of just about any kind and at anyintensity level can soothe anxiety. In particular, high-intensity activity hasbeen shown to reduce the incidence of panic attacks.Disclaimer: Always check with your doctor before beginning any exercise program.BEST EXERCISES FOR YOUR BRAINAerobic exercise, coordination activities, and resistance training have all beenfound to benefit the brain and help you lose fat regardless of your brain type.Even walking at moderate intensity can help you keep weight off after you loseit. In a 2000 study, obese women were better able to maintain weight loss thanwomen who did not increase their daily physical activity. Walking is a greatplace to start if you are new to a fitness program.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I had been riding a stationary bike but wasn’t really getting my heart rate up.Learning about bursts changed that. Now I go really hard for a short time thenback to my regular pace.”—StephanieGET THE MOST OUT OF YOUR AEROBIC EXERCISE WITH BURST TRAINING.If you want a higher calorie burner, a faster fat burner, a greater moodenhancer, and a better brain booster, try burst training. Also known as intervaltraining, burst training involves sixty-second bursts at go-for-broke intensityfollowed by a few minutes of lower-intensity exertion. This is the type ofworkout I do, and it works. Scientific evidence says so. A 2006 study fromresearchers at the University of Guelph in Canada found that doinghigh-intensity burst training burns fat faster than continuous moderatelyintensive activities.If you want to burn calories with bursts, do intense exercise, such as fastwalking (walking as if you were late for an appointment), for thirty minutes atleast four to five times a week. In addition, in each of these sessions, you areto do four one-minute bursts. These short bursts are essential to get the mostout of your training. Short burst training helps raise endorphins, lift yourmood, and make you feel more energized. They also burn more calories and fatthan continuous moderate exercise. Here is a sample of a heart-pumpingthirty-minute workout with bursts:SAMPLE BURST TRAINING WORKOUT3 minutes Warm up 4 minutes Fast walking (walk like you are late) 1 minute Burst(run or walk as fast as you) 4 minutes Fast walking 1 minute Burst 4 minutesFast walking 1 minute Burst 4 minutes Fast walking 1 minutes Burst 4 minutesFast walking 3 minutes Cool downIf you can’t devote an entire thirty minutes to an aerobic burst routine, don’tthrow in the towel. Research from Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston showsthat just ten minutes of vigorous exercise can spark metabolic changes thatpromote fat burning, calorie burning, and better blood sugar control for atleast an hour. For the 2010 trial, researchers looked at exercise-inducedmetabolic changes in people of varying fitness levels: people who became shortof breath during exercise, healthy middle-aged individuals, and marathonrunners.All three groups benefited from ten minutes on a treadmill, but the fittestindividuals got the biggest metabolic boost. This indicates that as you increaseyour fitness, your body will become more effective at burning fat and calorieswith exercise.BOOST YOUR BRAIN WITH COORDINATION ACTIVITIES.Doing coordination activities—like dancing, tennis, or table tennis (the world’sbest brain sport)—that incorporate aerobic activity and coordination moves arethe best brain boosters for all types of overeaters. The aerobic activity spawnsnew brain cells while the coordination moves strengthen the connections betweenthose new cells so your brain can recruit them for other purposes, such asthinking, learning, and remembering.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“Getting an exercise buddy made it more fun to work out. Plus I felt more of aresponsibility to show up.”—SashaWhat I really like about aerobic coordination activities is that many of themalso work as burst training sessions. For example, in tennis and table tennis,you give it your all during the point, and then you have a brief rest periodbefore the next point begins. It is the same with dancing, where you dance tothe song and then take a short break.In general, I recommend that anybody trying to lose weight do some form ofaerobic coordination activity at least four to five times a week for at leastthirty minutes.Have you typically avoided coordination activities because you have two leftfeet? This could be part of the reason why you have a hard time controllingyourself around food. That is because the cerebellum, which is the coordinationcenter of the brain, is linked to the PFC, where judgment and decision makingoccur. If you aren’t very coordinated, it may indicate that you are not verygood at making good decisions either. This could make you more likely tocontinue eating even though you are full or to choose the cherry pie instead ofthe cherries. Increasing coordination exercises can activate the cerebellum,thereby improving your judgment so you can make better decisions.STRENGTHEN YOUR BRAIN WITH STRENGTH TRAINING.I also recommend adding resistance training to your workouts. Canadianresearchers have found that resistance training plays a role in preventingcognitive decline. Plus, it builds muscle, which can rev your metabolism to helpyou burn more calories throughout the day. Extensive research shows that addingresistance training to a controlled-calorie nutrition program results in greaterloss of body fat and more inches lost than diet alone.For example, a 2010 study from researchers at the University of Rhode Islandcompared body composition changes between two groups of dieters. Both groupsfollowed the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, but one groupdid moderate-intensity resistance training while the other group did not. At theend of the ten-week trial, the group that participated in resistance traininglost 9 pounds of body fat compared with less than half a pound for the diet-onlygroup. Plus, the resistance training group’s thighs got skinnier while the othergroup’s thighs remained the same size.CALM AND FOCUS YOUR MIND WITH MINDFUL ACTIVITIES.Yoga, tai chi, and other mindful exercises have been found to reduce anxiety anddepression and to increase focus. Although they don’t offer the sameBDNF-generating benefits as aerobic activity, these types of exercise can stillboost your brain so you can improve your self-control and reduce emotional oranxious overeating.BEST EXERCISES FOR YOUR SPECIFIC BRAIN TYPEWhich exercises are best for your individual brain type? In addition to thegeneral suggestions for all types above, see specific recommendations for yourtype below. * Type 1 Compulsive Overeaters Aerobic exercise boosts serotonin in the brain to help you get unstuck when you can’t stop thinking about pepperoni pizza, potato chips, or mint chip ice cream. Be sure to vary your workout each time. This will help you learn to be less rigid. When you get stuck on thoughts about food, get up and move! One study found that as little as five minutes of exercise could help curb cravings. * Type 2 Impulsive Overeaters Aerobic exercise helps increase blood flow and dopamine in the brain to boost the PFC and improve impulse control. People with this type need lots of aerobic exercise. At least thirty minutes every day is best, but make sure it is in an activity you love. If you don’t love it, you probably won’t keep it up. Also try a form of yoga that includes meditation, which will sharpen your focus and strengthen your PFC so you can make better decisions and reduce impulsivity. * Type 3 Impulsive-Compulsive Overeaters Do an aerobic coordination workout for at least thirty minutes every day. Choose three activities you love, and then vary them throughout the week. Adding meditative yoga classes can boost your PFC and your willpower. * Type 4 Sad or Emotional Overeaters Try aerobic coordination activities that are social activities, like dancing. Or join a local tennis club or basketball team. The aerobic activity boosts blood flow and multiple neurotransmitters in the brain. The social bonding aspect of the activity can help calm the hyperactivity in the deep limbic system and enhance your mood. * Type 5 Anxious Overeaters In addition to aerobic coordination workouts, try taking yoga or tai chi for relaxation. Relaxation exercises can soothe overactive basal ganglia to reduce anxiety.Don’t think you can just exercise fourteen weeks and then go back to your oldcouch-potato ways. Several studies have found that the brain benefits ofexercise are only temporary. If you stop exercising, your cravings are likely tointensify and you run the risk of falling back into your old habits. Makeexercise a lifelong habit, like brushing your teeth, to help you stick with yourbrain healthy ways for the rest of your life.

By the time shereached the sixth grade, she already weighed 155 pounds. Granted, at 5′7″, shewas the tallest student in her class, but she was still carrying too much weightfor her age. By her freshman year of college, the scale had already tipped over200 pounds. Patrice often felt driven to eat regardless of whether or not shewas actually hungry. She also found herself eating things she hadn’t planned oneating.Her previous attempts at dieting failed to change those eating patterns. Patricehad learned quite a bit of valuable information from a variety of other dietprograms, but something was missing and she wasn’t able to lose as much weightas she wanted to. All that changed when she joined the weight-loss group in ourReston clinic.“Balancing my brain was the foundational missing piece,” she said. “That was themiracle for me.”Getting diagnosed with adult ADD and getting the medication and supplements sheneeded to begin to balance her brain was the answer to her problem. It took afew weeks to fine-tune the right combination of medication and supplements, butby the fourth week in our weight-loss group, it clicked.“For the first time in my adult life, my body didn’t seem to be driven to eatwhen I wasn’t hungry,” she said.Patrice still had to make dozens of good decisions throughout the day, but shefound it so much easier to make the right decisions. After about six weeks, sherealized, “I have new habits! I’m going to be able to do this for the rest of mylife.”For Patrice, who was 229 pounds at her first weigh-in, the extra weight beganmelting away. After ten weeks, she had lost 22 pounds, but she didn’t stopthere. Five months into her new brain healthy lifestyle, she was down to179½—under 200 pounds for the first time since college!Some of the other keys to her success included counting her calories (somethingshe admits she had never done before), weighing herself every morning,thoroughly completing the Daily Journal, recognizing and challenging her ANTs,and exercising, which she prefers to call “joyful movement.”Like most people who are Type 3 Impulsive-Compulsive Overeaters, she refuses todo any activity she finds boring. “You’ll never find me on a treadmill,” shesaid. But Patrice absolutely loves tennis, water aerobics, dancing, and groupweight training at the gym, and she’s hooked on the feel-good endorphin rush shegets from these activities. She also does yoga classes, which can help Type 2Impulsive and Type 3 Impulsive-Compulsive Overeaters sharpen their focus, andstrengthen their PFC to reduce impulsivity.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I thought I was helping my brain by doing crossword puzzles every day, but thenDr. Amen said that just doing crossword puzzles is like going to the gym anddoing right biceps curls and then leaving. I learned that I have to do acomplete mental workout to have my best brain.”—AndrewPUMP UP YOUR BRAINPOWER WITH MENTAL EXERCISEThe brain is like a muscle. The more you use it, the stronger it gets. Newlearning makes new connections in the brain, making you sharper and making yourbrain work more efficiently. No learning actually causes the brain to disconnectitself. Unlike a muscle, however, the brain gets easily bored and requires newand different challenges to maintain peak mental performance. Once the brainreally learns something, such as how to play Led Zeppelin’s “Stairway to Heaven”on guitar, how to knit a scarf, or how to swing a tennis racquet, it uses lessand less energy to accomplish the task.To keep the brain active, you need to give it a constant stream of new anddifferent challenges. Acquiring new knowledge and new skills encourages brainhealth. Too many people, when they finish school, never think about the need towork out their brains.I meet a lot of people who tell me they are keeping their brain young by doingcrossword puzzles. I usually tell them that by doing crossword puzzles, they areworking the language areas of their brain but nothing else. Just doing crosswordpuzzles is like going to the gym and doing right bicep curls and then leaving. Ahealthy brain workout is not simply doing crossword puzzles. You want to workout many parts of your brain.Here are some workouts for specific brain areas that you might find useful. Ingeneral, I recommend that everyone, regardless of brain type, try to strengthenall areas of the brain. Building up certain areas may be more critical for youdepending on your brain type. * Prefrontal cortex (especially helpful for Type 2 Impulsive Overeaters and Type 3 Impulsive-Compulsive Overeaters) * Crossword puzzles and word games help the language areas of your brain. * Meditation boosts prefrontal function (more on this in chapter 9 [Amen_9780307463623_epub_c09_r1.htm]). * Hypnosis can help focus and boost prefrontal cortex function (more on this in chapter 9 [Amen_9780307463623_epub_c09_r1.htm]). * Temporal lobes * Memory games * Naming games * Basal ganglia (especially helpful for Type 5 Anxious Overeaters) * Deep relaxation * Hand-warming techniques (using mental imagery, such as imagining holding your hands in front of a fireplace or holding a cup of hot cocoa, to warm your hands) * Diaphragmatic breathing * Deep limbic (especially helpful for Type 4 Sad or Emotional Overeaters) * Killing the ANTs (automatic negative thoughts) * Gratitude practice * Parietal lobes * Juggling * Interior design * Cerebellum (especially helpful for Type 2 Impulsive Overeaters and Type 3 Impulsive-Compulsive Overeaters) * Dancing * Table tennis (also works prefrontal cortex) * Martial arts, without risk for brain injury (also works prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes) * Handwriting * CalligraphyKeeping up on the latest advances in brain science can also help your brain.Signing up for our free newsletter online at www.amenclinics.com[http://www.amenclinics.com] can be good for your brain. My team and I give youthe latest developments in brain science and how it applies to your life. Whenyou read the newsletter, it stretches your neurons because you’re storing moreinformation and exercising the storage and memory parts of your brain. Goodbrain fitness, in other words, is more akin to cross-training at thegym—exercising in a variety of ways helps improve overall performance.Here are three more simple ways to give your brain a workout.BREAK YOUR ROUTINE.This is especially important for anyone who is tethered to bad habits that areharming your brain and making you fat and unhappy. You can increase your chancesof getting thinner, smarter, and happier if you change your daily habits androutines. Introducing new habits can help rewire your brain so you don’t fallback into the same patterns of activity. For example, if you always take thesame route home to work and stop at your favorite doughnut shop along the way,take a different route to work and bring a homemade brain healthy proteinpowder-and-fruit smoothie that you can sip along the way. Eventually, you willtrain your brain to look forward to this new habit rather than the olddestructive one.Here are a few ideas to get you started. * For breakfast, make a fruit smoothie instead of having coffee and a cigarette. * Make a new friend—someone who is living a brain healthy life. * Contact an old friend you haven’t talked to in a long while. * Read a book about a subject that is completely new to you. * Listen to a different genre of music than you usually do.LEARN SOMETHING NEW.Boost your brain by learning something new every day of your life. As little asfifteen minutes a day devoted to new learning can help optimize your brain. Hereare a few examples of ways to spark better brain performance. * Try out some new brain healthy recipes. * Learn a foreign language. * Take a class in something outside your major. * Learn to play a musical instrument or a different instrument than you normally play. * Try a sport you’ve never tried. * Cross-train at work and learn how to do someone else’s job.SHARPEN YOUR SKILLS.Although learning things that are completely new to you offer the biggest brainboost, taking your current skills to new levels by pushing yourself to improveis also beneficial. Look at the following for ideas on how to hone your skills. * If you like to paint, try new painting techniques. * If you play tennis, play against more-talented players. * If you like crossword puzzles, tackle more-difficult ones. * If you play guitar, try more-challenging songs. * If you knit, try more-complicated patterns."},{"pageContent":"[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_L10_r1.jpg]Being overweight and being unhappy are not just eating or mood disorders; theyare also “thinking disorders.” ANTs stands for “automatic negative thoughts,”the thoughts that come into your mind automatically and ruin your day. I thinkof these negative thoughts like ANTs at a picnic that infest your psyche andruin your body. Here are some of the ANTs that have run through the minds of ouroverweight NFL players and weight-loss group participants.“I have no control over my eating.”“I have to eat to comfort myself.”“I don’t like any of the foods that are healthy for me.”“I’m fat because my family is fat.”“I will never be successful at losing weight.”“I cannot go out to dinner and not eat dessert.”“I feel deprived.”GET SMART TO GET THINNER“For a long time I thought I was too old to lose weight. That’s an ANT.”—NicoleIf you have ever struggled to lose weight, you have probably had a few of thesethoughts yourself. You may be surprised to discover that these ANTs could be abig part of what is making you fat, stealing your happiness, and reducingcognitive function. ANTs can attack anyone, regardless of age, gender, or braintype. Some types, such as Type 4 Sad or Emotional Overeaters and Type 5 AnxiousOvereaters, are especially vulnerable to ANT infestations. Pay special attentionto this chapter if you have one of these brain types.When we talk about ANTs with our weight-loss groups and NFL players, thereaction is amazing. Many of them say it is the single most helpful thing theylearn from our program. At our clinic in Reston, Virginia, where Dr. LillySomner leads the weight-loss program, the concept of ANTs resonated so stronglywith the participants that it became the focal point of the ten-week programwith several weeks devoted to ANT therapy. “ANT therapy was the one thing thatmade the biggest difference for people,” said Dr. Somner. “They thought it wasso important, they could have spent the entire ten weeks just on ANTs.”Learning to kill the ANTs by challenging your thoughts is critical to winningthe battle of the bulge. In this chapter, you will learn how to develop aninternal ANTeater to talk back to your negative thoughts so they won’t send youracing to the kitchen cupboard or make you feel down in the dumps. Becausegetting control of your thinking is so important to your success, be sure tospend ample time completing the exercises in this chapter and make copies ofthem so you can use them whenever you experience an ANT infestation.YOUR THOUGHTS CAN LIE TO YOUDid you know that the ANTs listed above are lies? Most people don’t know thattheir thoughts can lie. If you are overweight or unhappy, your thoughts probablylie a lot. Your thoughts tell you that you can’t do it, you will never loseweight, you will always be fat, you are not good enough, you don’t deserve tolook and feel better, you will never find love looking the way you do, you willnever get a promotion, and you are doomed to failure.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“Being honest with yourself and with others helps you lose weight.”—RebeccaAre these lying thoughts helpful to you? No! They keep you trapped in yourunhealthy habits. Australian researchers conducting a nationwide study foundthat the more severely obese a person is, the more likely he or she is to feelpowerless to do anything about it. When you believe that you are powerless tochange, you effectively give yourself permission to overeat. It is the littlelies that you tell yourself, like “I have no control” or “It is my genetics,”that make you fat and steal your memory and happiness.That is exactly what happened to retired NFL player Big Ed White of theMinnesota Vikings and San Diego Chargers, who, at 365 pounds, told me that hehad no control over his eating. I asked him, “Is that true? You really have nocontrol over your eating?” He paused and said, “No. That really isn’t true … Ido have some control.” But just by thinking that he was powerless over food, hegave himself the green light to eat anything and everything.As I was writing this book, I was on a tour for my public television show ChangeYour Brain, Change Your Body. On these tours I often visit up to fifteen publictelevision stations in two weeks. Even though they are a grind, I love visitingstations to help them raise money and support my shows. During a recent visit Iwas working with one of my favorite cohosts who was overweight. As we weretalking at a break, she told me that she often went out to eat with her friends,always to places with “the unhealthiest food.” She said it was her only socialtime and even though she wanted to lose weight, she was afraid of losing thesocial connections.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I had no idea that my thinking had anything to do with my weight. It turned outit had a lot to do with it.”—ElsieI asked her if she really thought it was true, that if she didn’t eat atunhealthy places, she would have no friends. Sheepishly, she smiled. She hadbeen watching my programs for years. “That is an ANT,” she said. “If I believethat thought, then I am doomed to only eat at bad places. I am giving myselfpermission to die early.”With a simple question and a nudge, she got the concept. She did not have tobelieve every stupid, irrational thought that was keeping her trapped inunhealthy restaurants. If these ladies were really her friends, they couldchoose healthier places to socialize, or she needed a new group of friends. Areyour friends’ bad habits or negative thoughts killing you? I often say that ANTsare contagious.HOW ANTS CAN MAKE YOU FAT, UNHAPPY, AND STUPIDBrain imaging shows us that negative thinking has a negative effect on brainfunction that sours your mood, slows your thinking process, and makes you moreimpulsive—Pass the cheesecake please! A study we conducted at the Amen Clinicsclearly shows that negative thinking dramatically decreases activity in thecerebellum and temporal lobes.Reduced activity in the cerebellum puts the brakes on your thought process andlowers impulse control. That is the last thing you need when the fast-foodcashier asks if you would like to supersize your meal. Decreased activity in thetemporal lobes is associated with mood problems, memory loss, and temper controlproblems. Talk about a recipe for weight gain! When you feel sad, can’t rememberthe right things to eat, or fly off the handle, you are far more likely to reachfor the chips and soda rather than the raw carrot sticks and green tea.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“Changing my thinking can help make me thinner? Wow, what a concept! Why hasn’tanybody ever told me that before?”—BriannaBad, mad, sad, hopeless, or helpless thoughts also release chemicals that makeyou feel bad. Your hands get cold, you start to sweat, your heart rate speedsup, you breathe faster and more shallowly, and your muscles tense up. Theseawful, miserable, negative thoughts can make you feel anxious, depressed, angry,or despondent. These feelings can take your PFC offline and make it harder tosay no to your cravings.In our weight-loss groups, the vast majority of the participants have absolutelyno idea that their thoughts are controlling them and keeping them chained totheir bad eating habits, dark moods, and constant worrying. When they grasp thisnew concept, they can’t wait to learn how to kill those negative thoughts.Before I show you how to kill them, let’s get better acquainted with various“species” of ANTs.TEN ANTS THAT ARE EXPANDING YOUR WAISTLINE AND SHRINKING YOUR HAPPINESSOver the years therapists have identified ten “species” of ANTs or types ofnegative thoughts that keep you stuck in your bad habits. 1. All or nothing 2. Always thinking 3. Focusing on the negative 4. Thinking with your feelings 5. Guilt beating 6. Labeling 7. Fortune-telling 8. Mind reading 9. Blame 10. Denial1. ALL OR NOTHINGOne of the people I met on my public television show tour for Change Your Brain,Change Your Body said she hated the gym so much that she would never exercise. Iasked her, “Do you like to dance?” And she replied, “Oh, I love to dance.” “Howabout taking a walk on the beach?” I asked. “I like that too,” she said. When Itold her that dancing and walking on the beach are forms of exercise, she gaveme a puzzled look. She had always equated “exercise” only with the gym. When sherealized that any type of physical activity qualified as a type of exercise, shesaid, “Maybe I don’t hate to exercise; maybe I just hate the gym.” This is anexample of all or nothing thinking, when you believe that everything is all goodor all bad. Here are a few more examples.“I haven’t eaten any candy for seven days, I have got this licked.”“I just ate a doughnut. I am doomed to be the fattest person on the planet.”“We had an argument. I think it’s over.”“I couldn’t run a whole mile. I’m a terrible athlete and should just quitworking out.”If you stick to your brain healthy eating plan for a month, you think you arethe most disciplined person on the planet. If you stop for fast food one daybecause you didn’t have time for breakfast and you’re starving, you think youhave no discipline, give up on your new eating habits, and go back to eatingjunk food on a daily basis.Everybody runs into speed bumps and small failures in life, but that doesn’tmean that you are a failure. A better approach is to acknowledge that you atefood that wasn’t the best for your brain or your waistline and then get back ontrack immediately—not tomorrow. One slipup doesn’t mean you should give upentirely.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I didn’t realize that by thinking, ‘I’m never going to lose weight,’ I wasactually preventing myself from losing weight. Getting rid of that ANT helped meget rid of the weight.”—Eric2. ALWAYS THINKINGThis is when you overgeneralize a situation. Always thinking usually involvesthoughts with words, such as always, never, every time, or everyone. Here aresome examples:“I will never be able to stop eating fried chicken.”“I have always been fat; it will never change.”“Every time I try to exercise, I get injured.”“She’s always in a bad mood.”“No one ever listens to me.”“Every time I get stressed, I have to eat something.”“I don’t like any of the foods that are good for me.”Always thinking ANTs are very common. Beware when they creep into your mind,because they can have a very immediate, negative effect on your mood. Plus, theysentence you to a lifetime of overeating and other bad habits. Always thinkingANTs make you believe you have no control over your actions and behaviors andthat you are incapable of changing them. When you find yourself barraged by analways thinking ANT, ask yourself if it is really true. For example, is it truethat no one ever listens to you? Ever? Think of occasions when people havelistened to you to help squash this pesky ANT.3. FOCUSING ON THE NEGATIVESo many people who are overweight and unhappy can find something negative to sayabout any situation no matter how positive it may seem to other people. This ANTcan take a positive experience, relationship, or achievement and taint it withnegativity. It is the judge, jury, and executioner of new experiences, newrelationships, and new habits.“I wanted to lose 30 pounds in ten weeks, but I have only lost 8 pounds. I’m acomplete failure.”GET SMART TO GET THINNER“If you lose 10 pounds in ten weeks, that’s good. But so many people want morethan that and get frustrated. You have to change your mindset. Slow and steadyis brain healthy, because you are learning new habits you can maintain longterm.”—Riley“I went to the gym and did a hard workout, but the guy on the bike next to mewas talking the whole time, so I’m never going back there.”“I started eating two servings of vegetables a day, but I should be eating fivefor optimal health, so I should just give up on eating them altogether.”Focusing on the negative releases brain chemicals that make you feel bad, andthat reduces brain activity in the area involved with self-control, judgment,and planning. This increases your chances for making bad choices like ordering athird 700-calorie margarita and eating a second bowlful of chips, or staying upso late updating your social networking page that you wake up exhausted and needto guzzle caffeine to get going. Focusing on the negative makes you moreinclined to give up on your efforts to lead a brain healthy life and sets you upfor failure.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“Now if I get on the scale and I haven’t lost as much weight as I wanted to, Idon’t get down on myself the way I used to. I just stay focused on how far I’vecome already. It totally changes my attitude and helps me feel good aboutmyself.”—AndreaTry focusing on the positive, and it will improve your mood and make you feelbetter about yourself. Putting a positive spin on your thoughts leads topositive changes in your brain that make you happier and smarter and will helpyou stick with this program. For example, here’s how you could think about thesesame situations.“I have already lost 8 pounds and have changed my lifestyle so I will continueto lose weight until I reach my goal of losing 30 pounds.”“After working out, I had a lot more energy for the rest of the day.”“Eating two servings of vegetables a day is better than none.”If you want your brain to work better, be grateful for the good things in yourlife. At the Amen Clinics, we performed a SPECT study, which found thatpracticing gratitude causes real changes in your brain that enhance brainfunction and make you feel better. Learning how to spin your negative thoughtsinto positive ones takes practice. Here are two exercises I recommend.Gratitude Exercise #1Write down five things you are grateful for every day. Use the form provided oruse our online Daily Journal to write down the things you are grateful for. Theact of writing helps to solidify them in your brain. In research from theUniversity of Pennsylvania, doing a similar exercise boosted patients’ level ofhappiness in just three weeks. This exercise is an integral part of our plan.FIVE THINGS I’M GRATEFUL FOR TODAY 1. [images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_L14_r1.jpg] 2. [images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_L14_r1.jpg] 3.

[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_L14_r1.jpg]Gratitude Exercise #2: The Glad GameNo matter what situation you are in, try to find something to be glad about.Think of a time when you were in a difficult or disappointing situation andstarted to think negatively but then found (or now can see) a “silver lining.”Now try to explain the same situation from a “glad” standpoint. What did youfind to be glad about the situation?SOMETHING I’M GLAD ABOUT[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_L14_r1.jpg][images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_L14_r1.jpg][images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_L14_r1.jpg][images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_L14_r1.jpg][images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_L14_r1.jpg]4. THINKING WITH YOUR FEELINGSThese ANTs occur when you have a feeling about something, and you assume it iscorrect so you never question it. Feelings are very complex and are often rootedin powerful memories from the past. Feelings can lie too. These thoughts usuallybegin with the words “I feel.” For example:“I feel stupid.”“I feel like a loser.”“I feel like nobody will ever love me.”“I feel hungry and must eat or I will get sick.”GET SMART TO GET THINNER“When you walk around being grateful and noticing what you appreciate, you don’teven have any ANTs.”—JoseWhenever you have a strong negative feeling, check it out. Look for the evidencebehind the feeling. Do you have real reasons to feel that way? Or are yourfeelings based on events or things from the past? If you feel like someone ismad at you, ask him!5. GUILT BEATINGGuilt is generally not a helpful emotion. It often backfires and can becounterproductive to your goals. Thinking in terms of “should,” “must,” “oughtto,” and “have to” are typical with this ANT. Here are some examples.“I should stop eating sugar.”“I have to count my calories.”“I ought to go to the gym more.”What happens when you say these kinds of things to yourself? Do they make youmore inclined to cut the sugar, count calories, or hit the gym? I doubt it. Itis human nature to push back when we feel like we “must” do something, even ifit is something that will benefit us in the end. It is better to replace “guiltbeatings” with phrases like “I want to do this,” “It fits with my goals to dothat,” or “It would be helpful to do this.” In the examples above, it would bebeneficial to change the wording of these thoughts as follows.“It is my goal to stop eating sugar because it will reduce my cravings, preventenergy crashes, diabetes, and inflammation in my body and get me off this energyand emotional roller coaster.”“I want to count my calories because it will help me learn to take control of myeating.”“It is in my best interest to go to the gym because exercising will burncalories and will make me feel better and more energized.”GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I used to have ANTs running through my head all day long. Now I’m an expert ANTkiller.”—Zoe6. LABELINGWhenever you call yourself or someone else names or use negative terms todescribe them, you have a labeling ANT in your brain. A lot of us do this on aregular basis. You may have said one of the following at some point in yourlife.“He’s a jerk.”“I’m lazy.”“I’m a loser.”“She’s a slob.”“I’m a wimp.”The problem with negative labels is that they exercise negative pathways in thebrain and make them stronger. Negative pathways can lead to negative behaviors,including the very behaviors you are trying to change. Calling yourself namestakes away your control over your thoughts and actions. For example, if you are“lazy,” then why bother trying to do some kind of physical activity? It is as ifyou have given up before you have even tried. This defeatist attitude keeps youstuck in your old ways.Labeling others prevents you from seeing a situation clearly. When you callyourself or someone else a jerk, you lump them with all the other jerks you haveever known, and you can no longer deal with them as an individual or in areasonable way.BEWARE OF THE RED ANTSThese last four ANTs are the worst of the bunch. I call them the red ANTsbecause they can really sting and can prevent you from losing the muffin top,feeling happier, and getting smarter.7. FORTUNE-TELLINGDo you tend to predict the worst? If so, you may have a fortune-telling ANTinfestation. These ANTs can creep into anybody’s mind, but they are especiallycommon in Type 5 Anxious Overeaters.“If I try to run, I know I will trip and sprain my ankle.”“I might be able to diet for a few months, but I can’t change my habitsforever.”“If I go to bed earlier, I’m just going to lie there awake for hours.”Predicting the worst in a situation causes an immediate rise in heart rate andbreathing rate and can make you feel anxious. When you feel like this, it cantrigger your cravings for sugar or refined carbs and make you feel like you needto eat to calm your anxiety.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I live my life in constant gratitude now. That takes care of the ANT problem.”—WendyWhat makes fortune-telling ANTs even worse is that your mind is so powerful thatit can make happen what you see. For example, when you are convinced that youwill sprain your ankle, you run that thought through your head over and over andmay actually imagine the physical pain of your ankle rolling even though youhaven’t even started running yet. This kind of negative thinking deactivates thecerebellum, which is involved in coordination and motor control. Thiseffectively makes you more clumsy and more likely to sprain your ankle.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I’ve been on diets that work for the first 10 to 20 pounds. I guess they areokay if you want to lose weight quickly and then gain it back. They are not alifestyle change. I’m more impressed by the lifestyle change you get with theAmen Solution. It changes the way you think.”—TaylorSimilarly, if you are convinced that you won’t get a good night’s sleep or won’tchange your habits, you will be less likely to adopt the new brain healthyhabits that could help you sleep better or shed those extra pounds. When youhave fortune-telling ANTS, it keeps you stuck in your old ways.8. MIND READINGWhen you think you know what others are thinking even though they have not toldyou, and you have not asked them, it is called mind reading. Mind reading is acommon cause of trouble between people. It frequently happens in intimaterelationships because one partner assumes they can read the other’s mind. Itdoesn’t work because you can never know what others are thinking. You areprobably familiar with these mind-reading ANTs.“He doesn’t like me because I’m fat.”“They think I won’t be able to keep up with them on our walk.”“They think I will never amount to much.”I have twenty-five years of education—mostly in how to diagnose, treat, and helppeople—and I can’t read anyone’s mind. I have no idea what they are thinkingunless they tell me. A glance in your direction doesn’t mean somebody is talkingabout you or mad at you. I tell people that a negative look from someone elsemay be nothing more than his being constipated! You just don’t know. When thereare things you don’t understand, ask for clarification, and stay away frommind-reading ANTs. They are very infectious and cause trouble between people.THE MOST DANGEROUS RED ANTSOf all the ANTs, the blame and denial ANTs are the ones that hurt the most.Having these ANTs roaming around in your mind can prevent you from ever reachingyour goals.9. BLAMEBlaming others for your problems is toxic thinking. When you blame something orsomeone else for the problems in your life, you become a victim ofcircumstances, and you cannot do anything to change your situation. That keepsyou fat and unhappy. Be honest with yourself and ask yourself if you have atendency to say things like the following.“It’s your fault I’m out of shape because you won’t exercise with me.”“It’s not my fault I eat too much; my mom taught me to clean my plate.”“If restaurants didn’t give such big servings, I wouldn’t be so fat.”Whenever you begin a sentence with “It is your fault that I …,” it can ruin yourlife. These ANTs make you a victim. And when you are a victim, you are powerlessto change your behavior. In order to break free from addiction, you have tochange your thinking, so kill the blame ANTs, by making it your responsibilityto change. It is your life. I love what Vernon Howard once wrote: “Permittingyour life to be taken over by another person is like letting the waiter eat yourdinner.” It just makes no sense.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I’m 5′4″ and I weighed over 240 pounds, but I was in total denial. I kepttelling myself that my weight was okay because I didn’t have any major healthproblems like high blood pressure or diabetes. But it was not okay. I feltlousy, I wasn’t happy, and I was getting mentally foggy.”—Toni10. DENIALIn the Australian study mentioned above, individuals with a BMI between 30 and40, which is in the obese range, believed they could lose weight if they neededto, but they didn’t feel it was necessary! Talk about denial! People who areoverweight are often filled with denial ANTs. For example:“I’m not as fat as my dad, so I’m still okay.”“I don’t have diabetes, so my weight isn’t a problem.”“If I get to 300 pounds then I’ll start thinking about losing weight.”“I can stop drinking caffeine anytime I want. I just don’t want to quit yet.”“I only binge when I’m stressed out, not every day.”Refusing to admit that you have a problem keeps you mired in your current state.If you don’t believe you have a problem, then there is no reason to change yourbehavior. And if you don’t change your behavior, you won’t get thinner, happier,or smarter.KILL THE ANTS TO TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR THOUGHTS, MOODS, AND WEIGHTNow that you are familiar with the various species of ANTs, it is time to learnhow to kill the pesky thoughts. With the ANT-killing exercises in this chapter,you will discover how to turn your negative thinking into positive, accurate,healthy thinking. Did you know that happy, positive, hopeful, loving thoughtsrelease chemicals that make you feel good? Scientific studies have found thatchanging your thinking can be as effective as antidepressant medications totreat anxiety and depression.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“My ANTs? They aren’t here so much anymore now that I know how to talk back tothem.”—RonTake note, I am not recommending pie-in-the-sky happy, delusional thinking. WhatI want you to adopt is honest thinking. Honest thinking can help you feelhappier, think more clearly, and keep you away from the buffet.Strong scientific evidence shows that the ANT therapy you will learn in thischapter helps with weight loss. Researchers from Sweden found that the peoplewho were trained to talk back to their negative thoughts lost 17 pounds in tenweeks and continued to lose weight over eighteen months, proving this techniqueworks long term. And a 2010 study found that a twelve-week program designed tochange thinking patterns helped binge eaters stop bingeing for at least oneyear.CHALLENGE YOUR FAULTY THINKING WITH YOUR VERY OWN ANTEATERDevelop an internal ANTeater that can kill all the negative thoughts that comeinto your head and mess up your life. Teach your ANTeater to talk back to theANTs so you can free yourself from negative thinking patterns.Whenever you feel sad, mad, nervous, obsessive, or out of control, write downthe automatic thoughts that are going through your mind. The act of writing themdown helps to get them out of your head. Identify the ANT species then talk backto them. Challenging negative thoughts takes away their power and gives youcontrol over your thoughts, moods, and behaviors.[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_030_r1.gif][images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_031_r1.gif]My ANTeater ChartWhenever you feel sad, mad, nervous, obsessive, or out of control, use thefollowing chart to write out your thoughts and talk back to them.

In this very wise book, Katie, as her friends call her, describes anamazing transformation that took place in her own life. At the age offorty-three, Katie, who had spent the previous ten years of her life in adownward spiral of rage, addiction, despair, and suicidal depression, woke upone morning on the floor of a halfway house to discover that all those horribleemotions were gone. In their place were feelings of utter joy and happiness.Katie’s great revelation, which came in 1986, was that it is not life that makesus feel depressed, angry, abandoned, and despairing. Rather, it is our thoughtsthat make us feel that way. This insight led Katie to the notion that ourthoughts could just as easily make us feel happy, calm, connected, and joyful.It also led her to realize that our minds and our thoughts affect our bodies.“The body is never our problem. Our problem is always a thought that weinnocently believe,” she wrote in her book On Health, Sickness, and Death. Inthe same book, she also wrote, “Bodies don’t crave, bodies don’t want, bodiesdon’t know, don’t care, don’t get hungry or thirsty. It is what that mindattaches—ice cream, alcohol, drugs, sex, money—that the body reflects. There areno physical addictions, only mental ones. Body follows mind. It doesn’t have achoice.”Katie also writes, “It’s only when I believe a stressful thought that I gethurt. And I’m the one who’s hurting me by believing what I think. This is verygood news, because it means that I don’t have to get someone else to stophurting me. I’m the one who can stop hurting me. It’s within my power.”GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I used to get so stressed out every time I weighed myself. Now I just think ofthe number on the scale as information rather than getting emotional about itand letting it upset me.”—BrittanyKatie wanted to share her revelation with others to help them end theirsuffering by changing their thinking. She developed a simple method of inquirycalled the Work to question our thoughts. The Work is simple and very effective,which is why I love it. It consists of writing down any bothersome, worrisome,or negative thoughts, then asking ourselves four questions, and then doing aturnaround. 1. Is it true? (Is the negative thought true?) 2. Can I absolutely know that it is true? 3. How do I react when I think that thought? 4. Who would I be without the thought? Or how would I feel if I didn’t have the thought?After you answer the four questions, you take your original thought and turn itaround to its opposite and then ask yourself whether the opposite of theoriginal thought is true. Then, turn the original thought around and apply it toyourself (how does the opposite of the thought apply to me personally?). Then,turn the thought around to the other person if the thought involves anotherperson (how does the opposite apply to the other person?).I have done the Work myself many, many times, and it helped me get through avery painful period of grief. When I did the Work, I immediately felt better. Iwas more relaxed, less anxious, and more honest in dealing with my own thoughtsand emotions. Now I always carry the four questions with me, and I use them alot in my practice and with my friends and family. Here is an example of how touse the four questions to kill the ANTs that are keeping you in chains.EXAMPLE OF THE WORKCindy, forty-eight, had been overeating since she was in college. She was obesefor about three decades and had diabetes, high blood pressure, and hightriglycerides. Her family and friends wanted her to lose weight so she could gethealthy. Cindy desperately wanted to lose weight but didn’t believe she couldcontrol her cravings. “I have no control over my cravings,” she told me. Here ishow she worked on that thought.Negative Thought: “I have no control over my cravings.”Question #1: Is it true that you cannot control your cravings?“Yes,” she said.Question #2: Can you absolutely know that it is true that you cannot controlyour cravings?At first she said yes, she knew she couldn’t do it because she had been givingin to her cravings for nearly thirty years. Then she thought about it and said,“Well, I have never tried the strategies you recommend for controlling cravings,so I cannot be sure.” Take time and meditate on each of your answers.Question #3: How do you feel when you have the thought “I cannot control mycravings”?“I feel depressed, guilt ridden, hopeless, and shameful because I believe I willalways be fat and will probably die early because of it. Believing this thoughtmakes me want to eat more.”Question #4: Who would you be without the thought “I cannot control mycravings”?Cindy took some time here because the notion was so foreign to her. After awhile, she said, “I wouldn’t feel so much like a failure. And if I didn’t thinkI was a failure, I might be more willing to try to change.”Turnaround: What is the opposite thought of “I cannot control my cravings”? Isthis thought true or truer than the original thought?GET SMART TO GET THINNER“It was not as hard as I thought to change my thinking habits, and it is a muchhealthier way to lose weight and keep it off.”—LoriCindy said the opposite thought is “I can control my cravings.” She thoughtabout this for a while and said that if she used all the craving controlstrategies in this book, it might be true. She still wasn’t convinced, but thiswas beginning to open the door to a new way of thinking for Cindy.Turnaround to the self: How can you turn the thought “I cannot control mycravings”? around to yourself?Cindy thought about it and said, “My cravings cannot control me.” As she utteredthese words, it was as if a lightbulb turned on in her brain. She finally gotit. She understood that by believing that she had no control over her cravings,she was giving her cravings the power to control her. Looking at her thoughtsfrom a different perspective gave her the push she needed to do something abouther weight.The Work ExerciseDo the following Work Exercise (based on the teachings of my good friend ByronKatie) every day to investigate and turn around the negative thoughts andbeliefs that fuel anxiety, depression, and overeating. Doing the Work helps yousee the truth of your life so clearly that negative emotions and thoughts haveno choice but to disappear. What a comfort! Important: You must complete atleast seventy written exercises in order to rewire your brain so that you startseeing reality for what it is, instead of telling yourself lies. If you do theWork once a day, that means you need to do it for ten weeks to effectivelyretrain your brain and change your thinking patterns. You can also dointeractive exercises using the Work on our website.Write down the negative thought or belief:[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_L14_r1.jpg]1. Is it true? (Close your eyes, be still, go deeply as you contemplate youranswer. If your answer is no, continue to Question 3.)Yes –––– No ––––2. Can you absolutely know that it’s true? (Can you know more than God/reality?)Yes –––– No ––––3. How do you feel when you have the thought (when you believe that thought)?(Pay attention to your body, mind, heart, and self-esteem.)[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_L14_r1.jpg][images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_L14_r1.jpg]4. Who would you be without the thought? (How would you feel or live lifedifferently if you didn’t believe the thought?)[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_L14_r1.jpg][images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_L14_r1.jpg][images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_L14_r1.jpg]Turn the thought around. (Statements can be turned around to yourself, to theother, to the opposite, and to “my thinking” wherever it applies. Find a minimumof three genuine examples in your life where each turnaround is as true or truerthan your original statement.)[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_L14_r1.jpg][images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_L14_r1.jpg][images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_L14_r1.jpg]THE AMEN SOLUTION ALL-STARS: CARLOS[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_033_r1.jpg]Left: Before, 266 pounds Right: About six months later, lost 50 poundsCarlos, forty-nine, knows a lot about ANTs. His mind was filled with worries andnegative thoughts that sometimes sparked angry behavior. He had also experiencedbrain trauma due to a concussion and had problems with impulsivity. Whenever hesaw food, he ate it. His diet consisted of whatever he wanted at that particularmoment. Hash browns were a favorite.When he joined our weight-loss group at 266 pounds, he learned that the foods hewas eating were contributing to his ANT population. “I realized that eating crapjust made me more hungry and left me feeling sluggish. Then the negativethoughts would come,” he said. He also used food as a way to medicate hisfeelings of sadness and said, “I was always looking for something to make mehappy.”By learning to kill the ANTs, he no longer eats to medicate his negativeemotions. And by eating brain healthy foods, he has balanced his energy levelsso he doesn’t have those energy crashes that made him so vulnerable to ANTs.Carlos also started taking supplements, including fish oil and GABA, which hesays took away the anxiety he felt. Conquering his ANTs helped him shed 24pounds in ten weeks, and he is still losing—he’s currently down 50 pounds sincestarting the program, bringing him down to 216 pounds."},{"pageContent":"[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_L11_r1.jpg]Jo-Ellen came to see me at age fifty for help with her weight. She had trieddiet after diet and program after program with no success. At 5′4″ and 200pounds, she was 80 pounds overweight. She told me she thought she was highlyhypnotizable because she had been hypnotized as part of a stage show in LasVegas. She said she did everything the hypnotist suggested but did not remembera thing about it, just what her friends told her. Stage hypnotists are usuallyvery good at picking out people who are highly hypnotizable to remain on stagefor their shows. Even though medical hypnosis and stage hypnosis are worldsapart from their intentions, they do share some commonalities.Jo-Ellen easily went into a hypnotic trance, relaxed deeply, and enjoyed theexperience immensely. For the first three sessions, however, she did not noticeany changes in her behavior. The fourth session was pivotal for her. In thissession, I brought her back to when she first started to gain weight. She hadbeen under stress in her first marriage after she found out her husband hadcheated on her. She had two small children and felt trapped. She began to eat asa way to deal with her stress. Her husband would not go to marital therapy andcontinued his wandering ways. Even though she divorced him several years later,her pattern of dealing with stress through eating was set into place.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“It’s one thing to tell people to watch what you eat and exercise. It’s anotherthing to show you how to use your brain to help you follow through and changeyour lifestyle.”—MattAfter her marriage came to an end, she had several short-term relationships, butnothing that lasted. Food became her one true love. In the trance, I suggestedto her that by overeating she was cheating on herself, cheating on her health,cheating on her children, and cheating on the people who would potentially be ina relationship with her. She could let go of her anger at her ex-husband andstart doing a much better job at loving herself. Over the next few sessions, shebegan to do much better at letting go of anger and loving herself withoutovereating, and she started to lose the weight she wanted.Of course, I also gave her fish oil, enhanced her vitamin D level, and dideverything else in our program. She lost 80 pounds over the next year and wasable to keep it off for the additional year we had contact. For many people,when you add hypnosis to a healthy weight-loss program, you can uncover thereasons for overeating and dramatically improve the outcomes. Hypnosis can alsohelp people learn positive eating behaviors and create healthy long-termpatterns of food intake.Carissa, age forty-three, saw me for ADD, weight loss, depression, and alcoholabuse. Over time she did dramatically better, but weight still remained an issuefor her. Under a hypnotic trance we discovered that she was fearful of gettingthin because she had cheated on her first husband while intoxicated and hatedherself so much that she never wanted to do that again. If she got thin, sheimagined that she would be more likely to cheat on her new husband, whom sheadored. Being overweight was her unconscious way of staying faithful. When weexamined the misguided logic underlying her beliefs, she was able to lose theweight she wanted. She realized with a better body and brain, she would makebetter decisions overall.Laura, thirty-six, came to see me for being overweight. She had struggled withher weight her whole adult life, but as a teenager she was thin. In a hypnotictrance we uncovered that she had been assaulted as a young woman and sheunconsciously overate as a way to protect herself. When I helped her heal thetrauma, it was much easier for her to lose weight. If you have sufferedemotional trauma, then hypnosis, meditation, and psychotherapy can be veryhelpful.In this chapter you will discover how to use hypnosis as well as other mindfultechniques, including meditation, to help you lose the fat and boost your brain.I have personally been using hypnosis, meditation, and other techniques in mypractice for many years and have seen these techniques help many patients intheir weight-loss and mind-enhancement efforts.SLIM YOUR HIPS WITH HYPNOSISTo use hypnosis effectively for weight loss, it needs to be combined with aresponsible weight-management program like the Amen Solution. Research datingback to the 1950s suggests that hypnosis can be a powerful, long-lastingweight-loss aid that can increase the amount of weight you lose over time. Hereis a sampling of some of the most compelling evidence throughout the years: * In 1959 in one of the earliest studies on hypnosis and weight loss, a researcher used group hypnosis to make dietary suggestions to study subjects. After four months, the average weight loss in the group was 27 pounds. * In 1985 a trio of researchers analyzed the effect of adding hypnosis to a nine-week behavioral weight-loss program. The team divided 109 volunteers ages seventeen to sixty-seven into hypnosis and non-hypnosis groups. By the end of the nine weeks, both groups had lost a significant amount of weight. At the eight-month and two-year follow-ups, however, the non-hypnosis group had not lost any more weight whereas the hypnosis group had lost a significant amount of additional weight.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I wasn’t sure if hypnosis could help me stop eating sweets, but I find thatsince I was hypnotized, I think twice before automatically saying yes todessert.”—Aman * A study appearing in a 1986 issue of the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology tested the effectiveness of hypnosis on weight loss in sixty women between the ages of twenty and sixty-five who were at least 20 percent overweight. The researchers divided the women into hypnosis and non-hypnosis groups and analyzed weight loss immediately at the end of the study period and again after a six-month follow-up. In the hypnosis group, the women received both group and individual hypnosis designed to enhance motivation, improve decision making, identify unconscious weight-related issues, and offer weight-loss suggestions. After one month, the non-hypnosis group lost 1½ pounds while the hypnosis group lost 8 pounds. At the six-month follow-up, the hypnosis group had dropped an average of 17 pounds whereas the non-hypnosis group had regained 1 pound, bringing their average weight loss to only half a pound. * A 1996 review comparing weight-loss studies with and without hypnosis found that adding hypnosis significantly improved weight loss. The average posttreatment weight loss without hypnosis was 6.0 pounds; with hypnosis it was nearly double that at 11.83 pounds. This represents a 97 percent increase in weight loss. A further follow-up found the mean weight loss was 6.03 pounds without hypnosis and 14.88 pounds with hypnosis—that is nearly nine additional pounds lost thanks to hypnosis. This means the benefits of hypnosis increased over time, and people continued to lose weight long after the hypnotherapy sessions had ended. * A pair of British scientists conducted a 2005 review of the scientific literature on complementary therapies (hypnotherapy, acupuncture, acupressure, diet pills, and homeopathy) used for weight loss. They concluded that hypnotherapy and diet pills were the only therapies that resulted in reductions in body weight, but they noted that diet pills came with certain risks. Hypnotherapy emerged as the only therapy that produced weight loss without any adverse consequences.LET HYPNOSIS HELP YOU GET SMARTER AND HAPPIER TOOIn addition to helping you lose weight, hypnosis can also help decreaseirritable bowel syndrome, stress, anxiety, insomnia, pain, and negative thinkingpatterns. It has also been shown to aid in diabetes control and enhance mood.All of these conditions have a negative effect on overall brain function, makeyou feel bad, and increase the potential for overeating and weight gain. Byaddressing those issues through hypnosis, you can be a more positive, happyperson. Recent brain imaging studies have shown that hypnosis boosts overallblood flow to the brain, which helps to keep the brain young.WILL HYPNOSIS WORK FOR YOU?Are you concerned that you might not be able to be hypnotized? Are you afraidthat you might never “come to”? Do you worry that while hypnotized you might beforced to do something embarrassing? You’re not alone. I hear these kinds ofconcerns from people all the time. Let me reassure you by answering some of themost common questions I hear.WHAT IF I CAN’T BE HYPNOTIZED?Eighty-five percent of people or more can be hypnotized to some degree if youcan relax and follow some simple instructions. In my experience, I have foundthat most people who want to be hypnotized can be hypnotized.CAN I GET TRAPPED IN A HYPNOTIC TRANCE?No! Everyone comes out of a trance. Hypnosis is a completely natural state, onethat many of us experience in everyday life. For example, have you ever beendriving in your car and all of a sudden realized that you missed your exit byseveral miles? Have you ever caught yourself daydreaming at work? Have you evergotten so engrossed in a book that you didn’t realize how much time you’d spentreading? These are all forms of hypnotic trances.CAN I BE FORCED TO DO EMBARRASSING THINGS?No! You are always in control of your behavior when you are in a hypnotictrance. You will not do things that you wouldn’t normally do or that go againstyour core values while under hypnosis.IS HYPNOSIS LIKE BEING ASLEEP?Hypnosis promotes deep relaxation and an altered state of perception, but itdoes not put you to sleep. If you sleep through a hypnotic exercise, it is nothelping you with anything more than taking a nap.WILL I REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED?Most people do, although not everyone, such as in the case of Jo-Ellen above.Hypnosis promotes a heightened sense of awareness, and most people arecompletely aware of what is happening at all times. After you come out of thehypnotic trance, most people will likely remember the session in vivid detail.WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE HYPNOTIZED: A FIRSTHAND ACCOUNTIf you really want to know what the hypnosis experience is like, take a look atthe following firsthand account from one of my researchers, an admitted“chocoholic,” who agreed to let me hypnotize her to help her overcome heraddiction to sugar. We recorded her hypnosis session as part of a ten-CD audioprogram to go with my book Unchain Your Brain: 10 Steps to Breaking theAddictions That Steal Your Life. During the session, I made suggestions to helpher and listeners curb cravings and boost self-control.When I do hypnosis specifically for weight loss, some of the common hypnoticsuggestions I give to patients include “Feel full faster,” “Eat more slowly,”“Savor and enjoy each bite of your food,” “Visualize yourself at your idealweight and body,” and “See the behaviors you need to do to get the body youwant.”Considering that I get so many questions about what it is like to be hypnotized,I asked her to write about the experience on my blog. Here is what she had tosay:I’ve never been hypnotized before (unless you count the time I was asked to comeup onstage by Pat the Hip Hypnotist who used to perform on the Sunset Strip backin the seventies and eighties), so I was a little nervous when Dr. Amen told mehe wanted to hypnotize me so listeners could follow along on the Unchain YourBrain audio program.A few ANTs started racing through my head: What if I say something embarrassingwhile in the hypnotic trance? What if I can’t be hypnotized and I ruin theprogram? What if he makes me do something stupid?The ANTs melted away as soon as we got started with the process. I just listenedto his soothing voice and let him take me on a beautiful journey.Soon the room we were in and the chair I was sitting in disappeared, and I waswalking down a long staircase toward a beautiful park and a warm healing pool. Icould still feel my body, and it felt warm, relaxed, and very light as if I wasfloating on air. I had expected to feel sleepy, but that wasn’t the case at all.I actually felt very focused and alive, exploring this wondrous new world withall of my senses.I had always assumed that when you were under hypnosis, you wouldn’t know whatthe hypnotist was saying to you or remember anything about it afterward. Butduring the trance, I was very aware of everything Dr. Amen was saying andremembered everything about it later.During the session Dr. Amen gave suggestions to help me kick my personaladdiction—sugar—while addressing other addictions for listeners.After coming out of the trance, I felt a sense of calm relaxation. He asked mehow long I thought the session had lasted and I told him about seven or eightminutes. He told me it was actually twenty-seven minutes! And I didn’t move amuscle the entire time! For a fidgeter like me, that’s amazing.Overall, it was a wonderful experience! I certainly didn’t need to feel nervousabout it and my ANTs were all completely unfounded. But will it help me stayaway from the cookies and candy? We’ll see, but I did go home that night andtoss out the M&M’s that were in the kitchen cupboard.You can find the Unchain Your Brain CD program as well as other hypnosis CDs anddownloads that I have created for you on our website (www.amenclinics.com[http://www.amenclinics.com]). You can use these CDs to help you go into ahypnotic trance anytime, anywhere (just not while you are driving)!PRACTICE GUIDED IMAGERY AND SELF-HYPNOSISGuided imagery and self-hypnosis are both great ways to boost your focus andself-control so you can stay on track with your weight-loss efforts. With guidedimagery, like listening and following along to the hypnosis sessions on my CDs,someone else is inducing the hypnotic trance. With self-hypnosis, you areputting yourself in a hypnotic trance and can stay in the trance for as littleor as long as you would like.Learning self-hypnosis is easy. I have taught thousands of people how to do itsuccessfully. It just takes a little practice. And the more you practice, theeasier it will get. Now I’m going to show you how to do self-hypnosis to putyourself in a hypnotic trance. This exercise helps promote directed focus aswell as stress relief, which are both critical to long-term weight-loss success.SELF-HYPNOSIS EXERCISEUse this self-hypnosis exercise on a regular basis. * First, find a spot on the wall a little bit above your eye level and focus on it. (If you’re lying down, find a spot on the ceiling so your eyes are looking up.) What this does is take all the outside distractions and helps you narrow your focus. * Slowly count to twenty. * Let your eyes close. As your eyes close, take three very deep, very slow breaths with your belly. As you do that, say to yourself with each inhalation, “I breathe in relaxation and warmth.” With each exhale, say, “I blow out all the tension, all the worries, all the things that interfere with me becoming relaxed.” * After that third breath, keep breathing slowly and deeply, and with your eyes closed, roll them up as far as they’ll go. What you’re doing right now is tensing the tiny muscles of your eyes. * After you roll them up as far as they’ll go, let them come back down, and you’ll notice that those muscles you tensed are now becoming relaxed. Just imagine the relaxation spreading from the top of your head all the way down to the bottom of your feet in a very slow progressive fashion. * Now imagine yourself walking down a staircase or walking down a road, or going down an escalator. Something is moving you downward, making your body feel even more relaxed. As you walk down a staircase or descend on the escalator, count backward from ten. * When you reach the number one, find yourself in your favorite place—a special place where you can go to anytime you need it in your imagination. For me, it would be the beach. For you, it might be the green forest or the snowy mountains. What is your special place that has relaxation written all over it? If you could go anyplace in the world, where would you go? Write the name of it here.[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_L14_r1.jpg] * Now I want you to go to that place and experience it in your mind with all five of your senses to see what’s there, feel what’s there, to hear what’s there, and to smell and taste what’s there. Stay in your special place for a few minutes. * When you feel ready, walk back to the staircase or escalator and start heading back up slowly. * When you reach the top of the staircase or escalator, open your eyes, and you should feel calm, refreshed, and alert.LIKE TO DISLIKE: USING THE POWER OF YOUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND TO ELIMINATE PROBLEMFOODSAt Amen Clinics, I am blessed to work with some of the nation’s best and mostinnovative psychiatrists. One of them is Larry Momaya, M.D., who is a masterpractitioner of a powerful technique called Like to Dislike, which is atechnique in neurolinguistic programming (NLP). The basic concept is simple: youtake a food that you know isn’t good for you but can’t stop eating and replacethe way you encode that food in your brain with something you can’t stand. Hereare a few examples of how successful Like to Dislike can be.Derek was an impulsive overeater who had attention deficit hyperactivitydisorder and a real problem with chocolate. He had absolutely no control overhis desire to eat chocolate. For example, he would be driving down the freeway,and all of a sudden he would get an urge for chocolate so intense that he wouldhave to pull off the highway, stop at a gas station, buy a chocolate bar, andeat it right there on the side of the road.Derek did one Like to Dislike session during which Dr. Momaya guided him toreplace all the wonderful qualities he loved so much about chocolate with thething he hated most—celery. At the end of the very first session, Dr. Momayapresented Derek with some gourmet chocolates and asked him if he had any desireto eat them.Derek said, “No.”Dr. Momaya put the chocolates in Derek’s hand and asked, “What do you feel likedoing?”“Nothing.”“Do you feel like eating this?”“No.”“What do you want to do with it?”“Throw it out.”How did Dr. Momaya know that Derek wasn’t faking it? His body language spokevolumes about what he was really thinking. When he was handed the chocolates,Derek actually recoiled from them, a telling sign that he was repulsed by it.Dr. Momaya also did a Like to Dislike session for one of the participants in ourpilot weight-loss group. He led the session in front of about fifty people as ademonstration. This guy loved cheeseburgers. I mean really loved them. And heknew he needed to stop eating them in order to get his weight under control. Dr.Momaya guided him through the steps to make him associate cheeseburgers with thefood he hated most—fish. His reaction was so strong that at the end of thesession, he asked for a wastebasket because he thought he might get sick. Sincethat time, he hasn’t eaten a single cheeseburger.Dr. Momaya worked with one of our staff members on her love of bagels. At theend of the session, she said it had no effect on her. Three months later,however, she had not had any bagels. Other people have gone to Dr. Momaya tohelp them stop eating chips, candy, and frozen yogurt. He helped me with RockyRoad ice cream, which I have avoided since our work together. Dr. Momaya himselfworked with another NLP practitioner to get rid of his own personal weakness:sweet potato fries. “When I went out to lunch, I just couldn’t say no to thesweet potato fries,” Dr. Momaya said. “I knew they weren’t good for me, but Ifelt the need to order them instead of a side salad.” The Like to Dislikeprocess worked, and he hasn’t eaten any sweet potato fries since October 2009.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“With my stress levels, I find that if I take the time to meditate every day inthe morning, it is renewing for my mind and soul.”—BrandiAs part of my Like to Dislike session with Dr. Momaya, I thought about a bowl ofRocky Road ice cream and then changed the image of it to have the innatequalities (look and feel) of a food I can’t stand—Brussels sprouts. It turned mydesire away from Rocky Road ice cream for sure. If you are considering Like toDislike with a therapist, look for a master practitioner of NLP like Dr. Momayawho has a lot of experience with this technique.In addition, think carefully about the food you want to avoid and don’t choosesomething that’s too broad. For example, you wouldn’t want to avoid “sugar”because sugar is in so many things, including brain healthy foods like fruit andlow-fat yogurt—even unsweetened yogurt contains some natural sugars—and you mayhave a negative reaction to all of them. This helpful technique works best ifyou choose something very specific and if you have a very strong negativereaction to the food that you hate.MEDITATE TO SHARPEN YOUR FOCUS AND STAY ON TRACKNeed a little assistance staying focused on your weight-loss plan? Meditationcan help. Decades of research have shown that meditation (and prayer) benefitsthe brain in many ways that can make it easier for you to stick with yourweight-loss program. Here’s how.MEDITATION ENHANCES FOCUS AND SUPERCHARGES ENERGY WHILE STRENGTHENING YOURBRAIN’S BRAKE.At the Amen Clinics, we performed a SPECT study on a Kundalini yoga form ofmeditation called Kirtan Kriya in which we scanned eleven people on one day whenthey didn’t meditate and then the next day during a meditation session. Thebrain imaging scans taken after meditation indicated significant increases inactivity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which shows that meditation helpspeople tune in, not out.Researchers from other labs around the world have also demonstrated thatmeditation enhances activity in the brain’s PFC, even to the point of boostingthe numbers of brain cells. The better your PFC functions, the more focused andenergetic you feel and the less impulsive you are. That helps you stick withyour brain healthy eating program, pumps you up to exercise more, and increasesyour self-control so you can say no to the giant tub of buttered popcorn at themovies.Strengthening the PFC can be tremendously beneficial for all brain types but isespecially helpful for Type 2 Impulsive Overeaters and Type 3Impulsive-Compulsive Overeaters.MEDITATION IMPROVES EMOTIONAL STABILITY AND GIVES YOU A BIGGER BRAIN.A 2009 brain imaging study performed at UCLA found that people who meditate on aregular basis have more gray matter in the hippocampus, orbito-frontal cortex,thalamus, and left inferior temporal gyrus than non-meditators. These areas areall involved in emotional regulation, which may explain why meditators tend tohave more positive emotions and better control over their emotions. Keeping youremotions in check helps keep your eating in check, especially for Type 4 Sad orEmotional Overeaters.MEDITATION REDUCES DEPRESSION.Meditation improves your sense of psychological well-being and diminishessymptoms of depression. One study used EEG to show that people who meditated foreight weeks experienced changes in cerebral electrical activity that aretypically associated with experiencing positive or joyful feelings.MEDITATION REDUCES STRESS, SOOTHES ANXIETY, AND FOSTERS RELAXATION.Brain imaging studies have shown that meditation calms the anterior cingulateand basal ganglia, which diminishes worries and provides a sense of relaxation.A wealth of research indicates that people who meditate regularly have lowerlevels of stress, anxiety, and worry. Considering that stress is one of the mostcommon triggers for overeating, reducing your stress levels can be vital tochanging your eating patterns. The same is true for people who eat to calmanxiety, like our Type 5 Anxious Overeaters.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I used to eat without thinking and didn’t even realize I was eating. Now I’mmore thoughtful of what I’m eating, and it tastes better. I’m eating less butenjoying it more.”—CarmenMEDITATION MAKES YOU MORE MINDFUL.Being mindful means paying attention to what you are doing, thinking, andfeeling in the present moment. This is especially important for those of you whocamp out on the couch all evening and devour entire bags of chips, pretzels, orcookies without even realizing it. With mindless eating, it’s usually quantityover quality. You don’t necessarily enjoy what you’re eating; you just keepwanting more.By contrast, when you eat mindfully, you meditate on each bite of food andbecome aware of the smells, tastes, colors, and textures of your food. You learnto savor each bite. This helps you become more aware of feeling full andstopping before you overeat. In a study on the effects of mindfulness on bingeeating, a group of 18 women diagnosed with binge-eating disorder decreased theirnumber of weekly binges from four to fewer than two. Fourteen of the womenreduced their bingeing so much that they would no longer have met the criteriafor binge-eating disorder.My friend Andy Newberg, M.D., at the University of Pennsylvania, and hiscollaborator Mark Waldman, a therapist and associate fellow at the Center forSpirituality and the Mind at the University of Pennsylvania, have teamed up todo a SPECT brain study on mindful eating. At this writing, the study is in itsearliest stages, and Andy is hesitant to report any specific findings. But hedid say that the initial brain scans show that “the brain is different wheneating mindfully.” That doesn’t surprise me at all.MEDITATION MAKES YOU SMARTER.Dharma Singh Khalsa, M.D., of the Alzheimer’s Research and Prevention Foundationand Andy Newberg conducted a research study that was published in 2010 usingbrain SPECT imaging to evaluate the effects of meditation on memory in fifteenpeople with memory problems owing to normal aging or Alzheimer’s disease. Thegroup underwent a series of tests at the study’s debut and again aftermeditating every day for eight weeks. The results showed that after the twomonths of daily meditation, the group’s cerebral blood flow had increased inareas involved in retrieving memories. They also performed better onstandardized tests that evaluate memory, cognition, and attention. Having abetter memory is essential to help you remember all the important things youneed to do in order to reach your weight-loss goals.MEDITATION AIDS IN THE TREATMENT OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE.If you are wondering what this has to do with helping you lose weight, rememberthat from my perspective, chronic overeating or bingeing is a form of substanceabuse.OVERVIEW OF THE MEDITATION BENEFITS FOR THE FIVE TYPES OF OVEREATERS * Type 1 Compulsive Overeaters Meditation lowers activity in the anterior cingulate gyrus, which reduces compulsivity. * Type 2 Impulsive Overeaters Meditation increases activity in the PFC, which improves focus, attention, and planning. It also boosts your self-control and lowers impulsivity. * Type 3 Impulsive-Compulsive Overeaters See benefits for Types 1 and 2 above. * Type 4 Sad or Emotional Overeaters Meditation decreases depression, which can reduce your desire to self-medicate your feelings of sadness or emptiness. It also boosts areas of the brain that regulate emotion, making you less vulnerable to emotional eating. * Type 5 Anxious Overeaters Meditation cools overactive basal ganglia, which reduces your anxiety and lessens your need to eat as a way to comfort yourself.LEARNING TO MEDITATE IS EASYYou don’t need to devote big chunks of time to the practice of meditation forstress relief or go to India for three months. In my clinical practice, I oftenrecommend meditation as an integral part of a treatment plan. Many of mypatients have reported back that they feel calmer and less stressed after just afew minutes of daily meditation.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I do the saa-taa-naa-maa meditation before I get out of bed in the morning.”—SuzieThe following meditation exercises are effective, feel-good techniques to resetyour nervous system so that you feel ever so much more relaxed. It is verypowerful. You can do this whenever you feel stressed, anxious, or sad. Forexample, you can close your office door and take an inner journey on your lunchbreak. You can do this to mellow out after a hard day or after your childrenhave gone to bed. I have even practiced guided imagery and self-hypnosis whilesitting on trains, buses, and airplanes.To help you get the most out of mediation, use the following tips andtechniques.PREPARE TO MEDITATE * Find a quiet place that’s free of distractions. Lock the door to avoid interruptions and turn off your cell phone. * Give yourself twelve minutes to meditate, once or twice a day, preferably before breakfast and dinner, and don’t stop until this time is up. Check a clock occasionally, or use a soft alarm, not a harsh one, as it might shock you out of your relaxation. * Sit comfortably and consciously relax all your muscles from the bottom of your feet to the top of your head, and close your eyes. Enjoy your calm attitude as you breathe slowly and deeply from your belly. * Try to forget all the thoughts that swirl through your mind. Put a stop to your internal monologue. Cease thinking in words. This is often the hardest part about meditation for people who are new to the practice. When memories arise, simply tell them to go away or imagine a broom gently sweeping them out of your mind. With practice, you will find that your thoughts become less intrusive.DAILY TWELVE-MINUTE KIRTAN KRIYA MEDITATION PRACTICEThis twelve-minute meditation involves chanting the following simplesounds—“saa” “taa” “naa” “maa”—while doing repetitive finger movements. Do thisevery day for maximum effect. * Touch the thumb of each hand to the index finger while chanting “saa.” * Touch the thumb of each hand to the middle finger while chanting “taa.” * Touch the thumb of each hand to the ring finger while chanting “naa.” * Touch the thumb of each hand to the pinkie finger while chanting “maa.” * Repeat the sounds for two minutes aloud. * Repeat the sounds for two minutes whispering. * Repeat the sounds for four minutes silently. * Repeat the sounds for two minutes whispering. * Repeat the sounds for two minutes aloud. * When you finish, sit quietly for a minute or two, and try to merge your calmed mind and body with your regular mode of being.I realize that many people are busy and some days, you just can’t find the timeto meditate for twelve minutes. Or when you are first trying meditation, you mayfind it difficult to focus your mind for twelve minutes. In either case, you maywant to try something called the Relaxation Response developed by HerbertBenson, M.D., at Harvard Medical School. This is a very simple introduction tomeditation. I have found that many of my patients have managed to see benefitswith just two minutes of meditation a day.Kirtan Kriya Fingertip Movements[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_034_r1.jpg]TWO-MINUTE RELAXATION RESPONSE MEDITATIONThis two-minute meditation will help quiet your mind. * Sit quietly. * Close your eyes. * Take slow deep breaths. * Say the word one whenever you exhale. * If your mind wanders, just bring your thoughts back to the word one as you exhale.THE AMEN SOLUTION ALL-STARS: ROYAt 6′7″ Roy was an imposing force as an offensive tackle for the San Francisco49ers. But in his second season, a knee injury put a swift end to his footballcareer. Although his playing days were cut short, Roy had the privilege ofseeing his son and then his grandson each carry on the family football traditionas professional players. All three of them joined our football player study asour only three-generation football family.When Roy, now age seventy-three, first came to see us, he weighed 334 pounds.When I told Roy that I wanted him to weigh 225 pounds, he told me, “My bonesweight 225 pounds!” Then he started to negotiate with me. “How about 275?” heasked. We finally settled on a goal of 265.[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_035_r1.jpg]Left: Before, 334 pounds Right: Six months later, 306 poundsGetting Roy motivated was easy. All he needed to hear was that the moreoverweight you are, the smaller your brain becomes. Roy runs a highly successfulfirm that conducts research and supports families in the transition of wealthfrom one generation to the next, so having a smaller brain was not an option forhim. He was very motivated to have the best brain possible.To boost his brain and trim his waistline, Roy began measuring his food andcounting his calories and discovered that he had been eating far more than herealized. To cut down on calories, he traded his usual glass of wine with dinnerfor green tea. He finds that he gets just as much enjoyment out of the greentea, and he has much more energy in the evenings, which allows him to be moreproductive.Once an inconsistent exerciser, he committed to a daily workout regimen thatincludes riding the recumbent bike, three hundred crunches, strength training,and stretching. He sets the alarm for 4:30 a.m. to get to the gym by 5 a.m.,which he admits his wife isn’t too happy about. Then he works out for an hour toan hour and a half and still gets to the office by about 8 a.m.Meditation is also part of Roy’s early morning routine. Roy has been meditatingfor about thirty years to help him focus and be present in the moment. “It’samazing how being present can create such a change in your whole body. Therelaxation it creates in your body is magical,” he said.Roy’s brain-boosting regimen also includes a daily handful of supplements thatall of the players in our NFL study are taking. They include a high-qualitymultivitamin (our NeuroVite), fish oil (our Omega-3 Power), and our Brain &Memory Power Boost. He thinks these supplements are playing a major role in hissense of heightened brainpower, his weight-loss success, and his renewed vigor.After about six months on our program, he has already lost 28 pounds and feelsbetter than ever. “My wife complains that I have too much energy now. She says,‘You have the energy you had when you were forty.’ ”Roy isn’t the only one in the family who is reaping the benefits of better brainhealth. His son and grandson have each dropped about 40 pounds since beginningthe program. And proving that a brain healthy lifestyle can be contagious, hiswife is also losing weight by adopting some of Roy’s new habits."},{"pageContent":"[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_L12_r1.jpg]Eileen, one of our All-Stars, was doing great with our weight-loss program andwas thrilled to see the pounds melting away as she adopted brain healthy eatinghabits. But then she took a trip to Las Vegas and had to eat at one of thoseopulent buffets that Vegas is known for. You know the kind of buffet I’m talkingabout—fried foods galore, mashed potatoes smothered in butter, rich cream sauceson everything, and endless desserts. With these tempting foods right in front ofher face, Eileen could have easily piled 5,000 calories—or more—onto her plate.Riz, our Amen Clinics psychiatrist All-Star, had no problem sticking with hisnew eating regimen until he went to dinner parties with friends and family. Thenhis loved ones would offer him all kinds of foods that he used to love but thatno longer fit into his new brain healthy lifestyle. Riz’s friends and familywould try to pressure him and coax him into eating or drinking things he hadgiven up. “What’s wrong with you?” they would ask. “You’re not obese. Why aren’tyou having any kebab? Why aren’t you eating any rice? You’ve always loved kebaband rice.” They made Riz feel like he was being rude if he didn’t give in andtake a helping … or two.Jeanne, sixty-five, is one of our weight-loss participants who lost 8 pounds inour ten-week program and then went on to lose another 32 for a total of 40pounds in less than six months. She has learned to control her eating and curbher calories, but she says her husband occasionally tries to sabotage her. Shesays that even though he says he wants her to continue losing weight, hesometimes tries to get her to eat more than she should. “For breakfast, he’llgive me two pieces of toast, two poached eggs, three pieces of turkey sausage,and a big glass of orange juice. I don’t need all that, and I don’t want it,”she said.I know that feeling very well. When I became a grandfather for the first time, Icouldn’t wait to visit my new grandson, Elias. When I went to my daughter’shome, a friend of mine was also visiting. She asked me if I wanted something toeat, and I said no, I wasn’t hungry. A few minutes later, she asked me again,and I told her no again. I thought that would be the end of that discussion, butshe continued to ask me an additional five times if I wanted something to eat!I call these people food pushers. And as you embark on your weight-loss journey,you need to be aware that on a daily basis, you will face many types of foodpushers who will attempt to derail your weight-loss efforts. But food pushersare not the only obstacle you will face. Energy zappers that rob you of the willto exercise and money concerns that hold you back from getting healthy can alsostand in the way of your efforts to improve your brain health and drop the extraweight. Sticking with your lifestyle changes isn’t going to be smooth sailing,but if you are prepared for the challenges, you can deal with them moreeffectively.Fortunately, Eileen, Riz, Jeanne, and I have all strengthened our brain’s brake,which helps us say no when food pushers put us to the test. And we have learnedto deal with the daily obstacles that threaten to derail us. Now it is your turnto learn how to fight back against the food pushers, energy zappers, and otherobstacles. Do not let other people, places, or things make you fat, stupid, andunhappy!PUT A HALT TO THE BARRIERS TO WEIGHT LOSSThe acronym HALT is a term commonly used in addiction treatment programs thatcan be very helpful in dealing with the daily obstacles you will face. Iunderstand that you may not equate an addiction program with weight loss, but asI have said before, chronic overeating is akin to substance abuse. And HALT hasproven to be a very effective way to keep people on track when they are tryingto change their habits. HALT stands for:GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I used to always get sucked into buying popcorn at the movies. Now I bring myown snacks—a few cherries and walnuts with a bottle of water.”—Mario * Don’t get too hungry. Eat frequent, small, high-quality meals and take nutritional supplements to optimize your brain, balance your blood sugar, and keep calories under control. See chapter 3 [Amen_9780307463623_epub_c03_r1.htm] for more on brain healthy eating. * Don’t get too angry. Maintain control over your emotions and don’t let negative thinking patterns keep you stuck in your old ways. See chapter 8 [Amen_9780307463623_epub_c08_r1.htm] for more details on changing your thinking. * Don’t get too lonely. Social skills and a positive social network are critical to happiness and to freeing you from emotional overeating. Enlist a team of supporters and healthy role models. * Don’t get too tired. Make sleep a priority to boost brain function, moods, and energy levels, and to improve judgment and self-control.DON’T LET FOOD PUSHERS SABOTAGE YOUR WEIGHT LOSSFood pushers are all around us. Every day, we’re bombarded with the wrongmessages about food. TV commercials, billboards, and radio ads are constantlyshowing us images of happy, attractive people enjoying greasy fast food,judgment-impairing cocktails, and dehydrating caffeinated drinks that decreasebrain function and lower your self-control.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“The other night, my friends brought out some ice cream and cookie thing. I toldmyself they’re not going to stop you, you’re going to have to stop yourself sojust turn the other way. And I did.”—EvaCorporate America is highly skilled at pushing people to eat and drink thingsthat are not good for brain health. Restaurants and fast-food joints trainemployees to “upsell” as a way to increase sales and, subsequently, expand ourwaistlines. Here are some of the sneaky tactics food sellers use to try to getyou to eat and drink more. * Do you want to supersize that for only thirty-nine cents? * Do you want fries with your meal? * Do you want bread first? (This makes you hungrier so you eat more!) * Do you want an appetizer? * Do you want another drink? * Do you want a larger drink? It is a better deal!Your response to all of these questions should be no! Eating or drinking morethan you need, just because it’s cheaper, will cost you far more in health careproblems in the long run.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I have friends who actually told me I was being rude because I said no thankyou to the food they were offering me. It was hard at first, but now they knownot to offer it to me.”—DerekYour beloved friends and family can also make you fat—if you let them. A 2007study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that your chancesof becoming obese increase dramatically if you have friends and family whobecome obese, regardless of how far away they live. Even if friends livehundreds of miles apart, they can still have a strong impact on your weight. Forthis study, the researchers repeatedly evaluated the BMI of 12,067 people over athirty-two-year period. They found that having an obese pal increased the riskfor obesity by 57 percent and added an average of seventeen pounds to one’sframe. Having an obese sibling raised the risk by 40 percent, and having anobese spouse increased it by 37 percent.Friends also play a major role in influencing the eating habits of tweens andteens. A 2009 study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition tested thesnacking habits of twenty-three overweight and forty-two healthy weight youngpeople. Results showed that the young folks gobbled up substantially more snackswhen they were with a friend compared with when they were with a peer theydidn’t know. Also, when an overweight kid ate with a friend who was also plump,he consumed about 300 calories more than if he ate with a healthy weight friend.So, is obesity contagious? To a certain extent, I would have to say yes. As Ilike to say, you are who you eat with. If you surround yourself with people whohave bad brain habits, it is easy to get sucked into those habits. In mostcases, your friends and family inadvertently influence you to adopt their badhabits. Sometimes, however, they may willfully try to undermine your efforts.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“Lose weight slowly and consistently to build new habits and a new way of life.”—JamieWhen you start living a brain healthy life and losing weight, it can make thosearound you uncomfortable, especially if they are overweight or have a lot of badbrain habits of their own. Deep down, some people—even those who love you themost—don’t want you to succeed because it will make them feel like more of afailure.For others, their habits are so ingrained that they simply don’t know how toreact to your new lifestyle. Many of my patients notice this kind of behaviorwith their families, friends, and coworkers. For example, a friend who smokesmay thoughtlessly light up in front of you even though you are trying to quit. Aneighbor might show up with a box of home-cooked brownies for your birthday whenyou are trying to curb your sugar intake. At work, the receptionist may bring indoughnuts and coffee for your company meetings, or your supervisor may inviteyour team to go to happy hour for some high-calorie cocktails.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“When I started eating brain healthy foods, my wife really got into it too.She’s losing weight also and is below her magic point for the first time intwenty-five years.”—BobOn the flip side, your new brain healthy habits may rub off on your friends andfamily. When people see the new and improved you, they may be inspired to get onthe brain healthy bandwagon. Take Riz, for example. His friends who weresomewhat offended when he first started turning down food are now asking him fortips on how to lose weight.The people around you can either hurt or help your chances for success. This iswhy it is so important to encourage the people in your social network to get onboard with your brain healthy weight-loss efforts.When you enlist your friends, family, and coworkers to support you in your newbrain healthy lifestyle, they will be less likely to put you in situations thatjeopardize your weight loss. It is also critical to create a strong supportgroup of like-minded brain healthy role models, such as our online community,where you can turn for help when you need it.People aren’t the only pushers. Places and environmental cues can trigger yourcravings and overeating. Almost everywhere you go, you will see reminders of thefoods you used to crave or that you ate mindlessly. Drive to work, and you’llhave to pass by the fast-food place where you used to order three cheeseburgers,jumbo fries, and an all-you-can-drink soda. Take a cruise to Alaska because youwant to see the beautiful scenery, and you’ll have to face unbelievably copiousamounts of food and desserts at the buffet, not to mention the free-flowingalcohol.Even though churches can be very good for your soul, many of them can beterrible for your waistline. I have gone to church my whole life and lately havebeen frustrated by the generally poor food they serve their parishioners.Recently, I went to church near my home. My wife, Tana, dropped our daughter offat children’s church and I went to get us our seats. As I walked in I passed thedoughnuts for sale for a dollar apiece, men were cooking sausage and bacon, andI saw hundreds of hot dog buns stacked up for after the service. I was soirritated that when my wife joined me she saw me making notes to myself on myBlackBerry. Giving me one of those disapproving looks that only she can give meabout typing on my BlackBerry in church, I showed her what I had typed in: “Goto church and get dollar doughnuts, sausage, bacon, hot dogs … Send people toheaven early. They need to know how to become a brain healthy church.” Tanaagreed and forgave my indiscretion. Work to help your church, school, business,and family become a brain healthy place.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“Most people want to lose weight fast, but then it fails. The whole point is ifyou just tweak a few things, you can lose a pound a week and be successful.”—DianeSee chapter 6 [Amen_9780307463623_epub_c06_r1.htm] for more information on howto deal with the urges that arise from environmental cues.FOOD PUSHERS YOU MAY HAVE TO FACETV commercialsBillboardsRadio adsServers in restaurantsCashiers in fast-food outletsSpousesParentsGrandparentsIn-lawsKidsChurchesAA organizationsCommunity clubsGymsHolidaysMovie theatersSports arenasCounty fairsAmusement parksBrownies selling cookiesLittle Leaguers sellingcandy barsVendors offering free samplesFriendsNeighborsBossesCoworkersVending machines atwork/schoolOffice/school cafeteriaTeachersClassmatesStudentsSchool administratorsLearning to deal with and say no to all of these pushers in the home, on thetown, at work, and at school is critical to your success. Here are some tips tohelp you fight back.FIFTY TIPS FOR DEALING WITH FOOD PUSHERS 1. Ask your spouse and kids to hide unhealthy treats and snacks out of view or get rid of them so you don’t have to be tempted. 2. If you are going to a dinner with friends or family, call ahead to inform the host that you are on a special brain healthy diet and won’t be able to eat certain foods. You only have to do this once or twice before your friends start to ask you what they could serve that is brain healthy. 3. If you are at a business luncheon, and your new boss or a potential client raves about how wonderful the bread is and offers it to you, take one small bite, tell them it is delicious, and then wait for your meal. 4. When going to parties, consider eating something at home first so you won’t be hungry at the event. 5. Be up front with food pushers. Explain that you are trying to eat a more balanced diet and that when they offer you cake, chips, or pizza, it makes it more difficult for you. 6. Instead of going out to lunch or dinner with friends, choose activities that aren’t centered around food, such as going for a walk. 7. If your coworkers invite you to happy hour, but you don’t want them to push you to drink alcohol, ask the bartender to put sparkling water in a glass with a splash of cranberry juice and sip it slowly. 8. When people offer seconds, tell them you are pleasantly full. If they insist, explain that you are trying to watch your calories. If they continue to push extra helpings on you, gently ask them why they are bent on sabotaging your efforts to be healthy. 9. I know some people who will accept a piece of cake or a cocktail and then toss it in the trash or the sink as soon as the host turns away. 10. Avoid visiting with coworkers who have a bowl of candy on their desk. 11. Tell your host you don’t drink alcohol. Period. 12. With hosts you don’t know well and likely won’t see again, consider telling them you have food allergies so you don’t have to try their chocolate mousse pie or mayonnaise-laden dip. 13. Eat very slowly so when the host starts asking guests if they want seconds, you can say you are still working on your first helping. By the time you have finished, the second round of eating could be over, and you won’t have to be subjected to the offer for more. 14. Give kids a healthy sack lunch so they don’t have to eat from the cafeteria, if schools serve unhealthy food. 15. Commit to taking control of your own body and don’t let other people make you fat and stupid. 16. When food commercials come on TV, leave the room, switch stations, or hit the mute button. 17. When driving past food billboards, focus on how many calories are in the food they are offering and allow yourself to feel disgusted, because you know if you give in to it, you will be sitting in extra fat. 18. When food-related radio ads are aired, turn off the radio or switch to another station. 19. Tell restaurant servers “no bread” or “no chips” before you’re seated. 20. Tell restaurant servers “no dessert” before they have a chance to bring the dessert tray to your table. 21. When ordering fast food, just say no to supersizing. 22. Ask your spouse not to eat trigger foods in front of you. 23. If family members are eating foods that tempt you, leave the room until they finish. 24. Inform parents and in-laws ahead of time that you won’t be partaking in certain foods at family gatherings. 25. Ask grandparents to avoid giving food rewards to your children. 26. Don’t buy junk food for your kids or keep it in the house for them. If they have it, you’ll want it. And it’s better for their brain health too. 27. Ask friends or your spouse to split an entrée with you. 28. Ask the restaurant server to pack up half your meal to go before they bring it to you. 29. If the neighbor brings you a plate of chocolate chip cookies, immediately “regift” them to someone else. 30. If the boss brings birthday cake for your birthday, say thank you, take one small bite, and tell them how wonderful it is. 31. If you can’t resist those high-calorie cocktails or you’re worried that a few glasses of wine will ruin your self-control for the rest of the evening, say no to happy hour with your coworkers. 32. Don’t walk past the vending machines at work/school. 33. Take a sack lunch to work instead of eating out with coworkers. 34. When a coworker suggests celebrating birthdays with cupcakes, recommend a healthy alternative. 35. If coworkers want to share their snacks, say no thank you. 36. Ask office administrators to contract with healthy food providers and get rid of vending machines filled with sodas and candy. 37. At church, skip the doughnuts and coffee after the service and stand outside if you want to socialize. 38. At community clubs, bring your own snacks. 39. Don’t take the free samples of the “energy bars” or “energy drinks” offered at the gym. Remember “energy” equals “calories.” 40. At all-you-can-eat buffets, go for the salad (dressing on the side), steamed vegetables, and lean protein first; then, after you have eaten that, go back if you are still hungry and want to try a higher-calorie item. Chances are you will eat a much smaller portion than if you had started with the fatty fare. 41. Bring your own healthy snacks to the movies so you don’t have to go near the concession stand. 42. If you’re at a sporting event, be aware that many ballparks and sports arenas are offering healthier options, so explore all the offerings rather than heading straight for the hot dog vendor. 43. If you can’t resist the goodies at county fairs or amusement parks, get one item and split it among your friends. 44. When temptation wins out, use the three-bite rule. Take three bites of the item, and then toss it. 45. Donate money to the Girl Scouts rather than buying cookies. 46. When your spouse asks you to finish off the small amount of food left over from dinner, say no, box it up, and put it in the fridge for another meal. 47. When it’s your turn to host a party, send all the leftovers home with your guests so you won’t be tempted to eat them. 48. If someone in your dining party orders fries for the table, make sure you have a glass of water or green tea to sip on while they munch. It will keep you occupied and help prevent you from reaching for a fry, or two, or twenty. 49. At the grocery store checkout stand, keep your eyes focused on the checker so you don’t have to look at the candy and other impulse-buy items calling out to you. 50. Make it a rule never to take free food samples anywhere!GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I used to be around people who told me I was fat. I have taken charge of thatand don’t have critical people around me anymore. Now I’ve surrounded myselfwith people who express appreciation and encouragement. I didn’t realize howothers’ negativity was affecting me.”—LauraHOLD THE BREAD BEFORE MEALSWhy do restaurants serve baskets of bread before each meal for free? Why notcheese? Why not almonds or chunks of beef or chicken? The reason is that breadmakes you hungrier and encourages you to eat more. Bread, especially white breadmade from bleached and processed flour, spikes your blood sugar and boosts thenatural feel-good neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain. Serotonin helps youfeel happier and less anxious.On brain SPECT scans, I have seen that serotonin interventions help to relax orlower function in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). When I prescribe antidepressantmedications or supplements that boost serotonin in the brain, my patients oftensay they feel better, but that they are also less motivated. Anything thatlowers PFC function makes you more impulsive and less worried about long-termconsequences. The bread or simple carbohydrate to start a meal helps you feelbetter but also more impulsive when the dessert tray comes by later on. Hold thebread, wait for your meal, and you will be happier with the end result.THE THREE CIRCLES: KNOW WHEN YOU’RE SAFE, WHEN YOU’RE VULNERABLE, AND WHENYOU’RE IN DANGERIt is absolutely critical that you know what helps keep you on track with yourweight loss, what makes you more likely to fall back into your old ways, andwhat puts you in imminent danger of overeating. To help my patients understandthe people, places, and things that are helping them reach their goals and thosethat are putting them at greater risk for overeating, I use an exercise calledthe Three Circles.For this exercise, I have my patients take a page, draw three circles on it, andlabel them “Red Circle,” “Yellow Circle,” and “Green Circle.” In the greencircle, I have them write down all the things that help them stay on track withtheir weight-loss and brain health goals. In the yellow circle, they put thingsthat make them more vulnerable to getting off track. In the red circle, theylist their danger zones—the things that put them in imminent danger of revertingback to their bad habits.Following is an example of what the Three Circles might look like for someonewho is a binge eater. Then there is a blank form called My Three Circles thatyou can use to identify what helps keep you safe, what makes you morevulnerable, and what puts you in danger. Keep this page with you to help remindyou what’s helping you reach your goals and what is putting you at risk. You canalso find an interactive version of this exercise on our website.THE THREE CIRCLES[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_036_r1.jpg]GET SMART TO GET THINNER“When I eat things that aren’t healthy, it makes me feel lethargic, and I don’twant to go to the gym. In the past, I would have skipped it, but now I know thatonce I go to the gym, I will feel better. So even if I’m not feeling up to it, Igo anyway.”—MonicaMY THREE CIRCLES[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_037_r1.jpg]DON’T LET ENERGY ZAPPERS PREVENT YOU FROM GETTING THE EXERCISE YOU NEEDMaria, forty-four, is one of my patients who has started doing a thirty-minuteburst routine every morning before work in an effort to burn calories and boosther brain. But several days a week, her husband, Ben, tries to coax her intostaying in bed with him and going back to sleep instead of exercising.Be prepared to deal with people who try to get in the way of your commitment toexercise. Like Maria, your spouse might tempt you to give up your workout infavor of a little extra shut-eye. You might be heading out the door to go to thegym when your kids say they need a ride somewhere now. Your boss might put alast-minute project on your desk just as you were about to leave work to go playbasketball. Don’t give in to these people. Slip out of bed quietly so yourspouse can go back to sleep. Tell your kids you will give them a ride after youhave worked out. And let your boss know you had a prior commitment, but you willwork on the new project later that night.When an energy zapper tries to keep you from exercising, let them know whyexercise is important to you and why it is also beneficial to them. Arm yourselfwith responses like these:“I’m exercising because it makes me feel good and helps keep me healthy bypreventing cravings. If you care about me and my health, you won’t ask me toskip it.”“Physical activity puts me in a better mood, which will help our relationshipand make me a better partner/friend.”“If I go exercise for an hour, I will think much more clearly afterward and willdo a better job on this project.”The people around you aren’t the only energy zappers. There are many otherthings that will rob you of energy, including: * Inherited brain disorders * Infectious causes * Hormonal issues * Anemia * Brain trauma * Environmental toxins * Many medications * Chronic stress * Untreated past emotional trauma * Caffeine * Smoking * Poor eating habits * Poor sleep * Too much alcohol * Lack of exercise * Low/erratic blood sugar states from any causeHere are ways to boost your energy. * Treat the energy robbers described above. * Get at least seven hours of sleep. * Eat a brain healthy diet. * Maintain a level blood sugar. * Exercise four to five times a week. * Use stress-reduction techniques. * Test and optimize hormone levels. * Meditate. * Eat low-calorie, high-fiber foods (fruits, vegetables, beans, and whole grains). * Drink green tea, which includes theanine. * Take natural supplements, such as ashwagandha and green tea leaf extract.Sometimes your biggest energy zapper can be yourself—and your excuses. So manyof us can come up with a million excuses why we shouldn’t exercise. Even I havedays when I have to engage in a full-fledged battle against my excuses to getout the door.COMMON EXERCISE EXCUSES * I’m too tired. * I’m too busy. * I’m too fat to go to a gym. * I’m too old to exercise. * I’m too stressed out. * It’s dark out. * It’s drizzling. * It’s too cold. * I don’t know what kind of exercises to do. * I’m bored with my workout. * I hate exercising. * I’m already five minutes late for my aerobics class, so I may as well not go at all. * I’m still sore from yesterday’s workout. * I’m not in the mood. * I get enough exercise around the house. * I don’t have any exercise equipment. * The gym is too far away. * I can’t leave the kids alone.By now, you may recognize that these thoughts are ANTs that can drain yourenergy and motivation to exercise. If you find these thoughts creeping into yourhead, go back to chapter 8 [Amen_9780307463623_epub_c08_r1.htm], and do theexercises to challenge them.DON’T LET MONEY CONCERNS STAND IN THE WAY OF BRAIN HEALTHBrooke, twenty-two, wants to optimize her brain so she can stop her sad andemotional overeating, and she knows that exercising and taking a multivitamin,fish oil, and vitamin D could help. But she’s worried about the cost of a gymmembership and high-quality supplements, so she doesn’t get the mood-boostingexercise or nutrients she needs and continues to overeat.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“A lot of people think, ‘I can’t afford to eat fish,’ but if you’re only eatingfour ounces at twenty dollars a pound, you’re only going to pay five dollars.You might be able to afford that.”—NathanBeing too fat is what is really expensive.

When your brain tells you to stick with the same old habits that havemade you fat, you need to fight back. The steps in this book are designed tohelp you rewire your brain so you can lose weight, but don’t expect it to be aseasy as flipping a switch. It takes time to overwrite old neural pathways withnew ones. Here are a few tips that can help you retrain your brain to stay onthe right path.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“It’s the little changes that will help you get to your goal. A little tweak canmake a big difference.”—KatrinaDON’T TRY TO CHANGE EVERYTHING AT ONCE.If you have come to the decision that you want to make changes in your life, youprobably want them to happen now! But after nearly thirty years of helpingpatients navigate the change process, I have learned that taking a gradualapproach is the surest way to success. So many people try to change all at once,but this almost inevitably invites disappointment and failure. You don’t have tochange dozens of behaviors at once. Start with a few vital behaviors—the onesthat will have the biggest immediate impact—and go from there.BELIEVE YOU CAN DO IT.If you don’t believe in yourself, you will never achieve your goals. Take whatyou learned from chapter 8 [Amen_9780307463623_epub_c08_r1.htm] and startchanging your negative thinking patterns to honest and positive thinking to helpyou believe that you can do it.REWARD YOURSELF FOR THE SMALL SUCCESSES.When you reach short-term goals, give yourself a pat on the back, but don’tcelebrate with substances or activities that harm your brain. Why do we chooseto celebrate birthdays, promotions, and other successes with foods and drinksthat decrease brain function and make us fat? Find brain healthy ways that don’tinvolve eating and drinking to reward yourself. Here are some non-food rewardsyou might want to try.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I’m doing the program in steps. At first, I just tried to work on my eating andfilling out the Daily Journal. Now I’m working on relaxation techniques.”—Kim * Enjoy a few hours of quiet time. * Spend an evening alone with a good book. * Take a warm bath. * Ask your significant other to give you a massage. * Give yourself a manicure or pedicure or go to a nail salon. * Make a hair appointment. * Get a spa treatment. * Go to the movies or watch a favorite movie on TV. * Download your favorite songs to your iPod. * Relax with your favorite magazine. * Give yourself a compliment. Write it down and put it where you can see it often. * Visit a museum. * Listen to your favorite relaxation CD. * Go dancing with your friends or significant other. * Go hiking with a friend. * Spend an afternoon playing fetch with your dog. * Get some fresh-cut flowers, a plant, or herbs for the garden. * Call a friend to share your success. * Buy a spice rack for all the new spices you’re using on your food. * Get a new vegetable steamer or other kitchen gadget to make healthy cooking easier. * Act like a kid—go fly a kite or play Frisbee with a friend. * Treat yourself to a personal training session. * Ask your spouse to take care of the kids for an entire day so you can do whatever you like. * Buy some new workout clothes. * Get a pedometer. * Get a sports watch that also tracks your heart rate and calories burned. * Spend time with a friend you haven’t seen in a long time. * Go out for a guys’ night out.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“Every eight to ten days, I reward myself with something I love.”—Jeff * Go out for a girls’ night out. * Go to a garage sale. * Go window shopping. * Go antiquing. * Put on that bathing suit you refused to wear for so long and go swimming at the local pool. * Take a day off work. * Invite friends over for a game night. * Go to a club where you can sing karaoke. * Ask a friend to take photos of the new you. * Donate your “fat” clothes to a local shelter. * Hire someone to do the housework or gardening for a day so you can have more “me” time. * Spend an afternoon at the beach showing off your new figure. * Let yourself sleep in late on Sunday. * Try a new fitness class. * Go to a local sporting event, like a high school football game or baseball game. * Take a day trip. * Wear that sleeveless shirt you have never worn because your arms used to jiggle too much. * Buy something for your favorite hobby—yarn for knitting, scrapbooking materials, or tools, for example. * Buy yourself a number of small, inexpensive gifts and wrap them up in identical packages. When you reach one of your goals, unwrap one of them for a nice surprise. * Put one dollar—or fifty cents or a dime—in a piggy bank each time you do a particular brain healthy habit. Let it add up until you reach a big goal and spend it on whatever you’d like. * Give yourself a “Congratulations” certificate (you can create one on your computer) for every 5 or 10 pounds of weight loss. Keep them somewhere you can look at them often.When should you reward yourself? It’s up to you. Of course, you can rewardyourself for every pound—or every 5 pounds—but rewarding yourself for the brainhealthy habits that are going to help you shed those pounds may be a smartermove. After all, it’s the new habits you want to reinforce.For example, you can reward yourself for meditating every single day for a week.You can give yourself something special for doing your ANT exercises ten times.You can celebrate a week without caffeine, a month of eating vegetables everyday, or exercising four times a week. In general, it’s best to reward yourselffor the habits that are the hardest to change.DON’T SWAP ONE BAD HABIT FOR ANOTHER.If you’ve got a sweet tooth, you may think that kicking your sugar habit is theultimate goal. So instead of chomping on chocolate in the afternoon, you startsipping a diet soda or a café latte. No, it isn’t chocolate, but it still isn’tgood for your brain or your weight-loss efforts. I see this so many times withmy patients who quit one bad habit only to acquire another one in its place.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I control my food now. My food doesn’t control me.”—LyndaSome people even turn to illicit drugs. At the 2010 meeting of the AmericanSociety of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery, researchers presented evidence thatsome people who have bariatric surgery replace their food addiction with drug oralcohol addiction. A survey of post–bariatric surgery patients in substanceabuse programs revealed that 85 percent of them put some of the blame on“addiction substitution” and 75 percent thought “unresolved psychologicalissues” played a role in their substance abuse.This doesn’t surprise me because, as I said in the introduction, stapling yourstomach may be working on the wrong organ. There may be underlying biological,psychological, social, or spiritual causes for your overeating. If you get ridof your problem foods or have surgery to shrink your stomach but do not addressthese underlying problems, you won’t make any progress. You will simply look forother ways to self-medicate. To be your best self, you need to kick your badhabits without replacing them with others.GET BACK ON TRACK—SETBACKS DON’T MEAN FAILURE.The road to change is not a one-way street. The steps to change are not static.I frequently tell my patients that their journey will be like going up and downa staircase. They will go up several steps, feel like they’ve made progress,then go back down a few steps when difficult situations arise. They will makeseveral more steps of progress, then slip back a few, but usually not as many asbefore. Usually, the slope of progress is in an upward, positive direction.If you aren’t expecting to encounter setbacks, it can derail your efforts. Let’ssay you’ve been doing a great job sticking to your daily calorie limit and havelost five pounds after a few weeks. But then you go to your parents’ house forthe holidays where you overindulge and end up gaining two pounds in a week. Thenyou feel like you’ve blown it, so you continue overeating after you return homeand then you give up entirely on changing.Understanding that setbacks are part of the process and planning how to dealwith them makes them easier to handle. So you ate more than you should duringthe holidays and gained a couple pounds—just get back on your program the nextday. Remember, losing weight is not a race, and faster is not necessarilybetter. Slow and steady is the healthiest way to lose weight and keep it off.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“You can’t beat yourself up for the slipups. If you ate too much one day, justgo for a longer walk the next day.”—JesseIF YOU HIT A PLATEAU, CHANGE THINGS UP A BIT.Hitting a plateau can be one of the most frustrating challenges in yourweight-loss journey. A plateau is when your scale seems to get stuck on acertain number and just won’t budge even though you haven’t veered away fromyour new brain healthy habits. Rest assured that this is a common scenario.Often, the problem lies with your resting basal metabolic rate (BMR). This isthe number of calories you need to maintain your current weight. You see, whenyou lose weight, your BMR goes down too, so you need fewer calories to maintainyour weight.For example, let’s say you are a fifty-year-old man who is 5′10″ and 250 pounds,and you eat 3,000 calories a day. If you cut the recommended 500 calories perday from your diet to lose one pound a week, you’ll be eating about 2,500calories a day, and you’ll start to see the weight come off. (To keep it simplefor this example, we won’t factor exercise into the mix.) If you lose 40 poundsin six months like some of our All-Stars, your BMR goes down and your body nolonger burns as many calories per day. So the 2,500 calories you are stilleating may actually be too high for you now.Using the equation below, at 210 pounds and sedentary, you would need a total of2,308 calories per day to maintain your weight. But you are still eating 2,500calories, so the scale stops moving in the right direction. As you lose weight,you need to make adjustments to your caloric intake and energy output tocompensate for your changing BMR.BASAL METABOLIC RATE (BMR) EQUATIONWomen: 655 + (4.35 x weight in pounds) + (4.7 x height in inches)—(4.7 x age inyears)Men: 66 + (6.23 x weight in pounds) + (12.7 x height in inches)—(6.8 x age inyears)Take that number and multiply by it by the appropriate number below:1.2—if you are sedentary (little or no exercise)1.375—if you are lightly active (light exercise/sports 1–3 days/week)1.55—if you are moderately active (moderate exercise/sports 3–5 days/week)1.75—if you are very active (hard exercise/sports 6–7 days a week)1.9—if you are extra active (very hard exercise/sports and a physical job orstrength training twice a day)Total:_________GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I wanted to lose 2 to 3 pounds a week, but some weeks I only lost 1 pound.Don’t get down on yourself when this happens. Be gentle with yourself. Praiseyourself for what you have done rather than feeling bad because you think youhaven’t done enough.”—AlThe first thing you need to do when your scale gets stuck is make sure that youreally have hit a plateau. Even if the number on the scale hasn’t dropped, yourbody composition might still be improving. That is exactly what happened toEileen, one of our All-Stars. After losing about 15 pounds in her first ten-weeksession and another 15 in her second ten-week session, her weight loss seemed tostall at about 4 pounds midway through her third session. But her body was stillchanging. In fact, even though she had only dropped 4 pounds, she had droppedtwo full pants sizes during her third session alone! Altogether she went downfive pants sizes in about six months.So don’t automatically get discouraged if the number on the scale isn’t changingfast enough for you. We often get so hung up on a specific number that we losesight of our real goal, which is to look slimmer, feel happier and moreenergetic, and be smarter.If you really have hit a plateau, then it is probably time to decrease yourcaloric intake and change up your workout routine. For example, let’s say youhave been doing thirty minutes of walking with bursts four times a week. Atfirst, it was probably a real challenge for you. But after a while, your bodylearns to work more efficiently, and you no longer burn as many calories doingthe same activity. Plus, as your body becomes lighter, you burn fewer calories.To increase your calorie burn, you have to pump up the intensity of yourworkouts. Consider adding some hills, jogging, or full-out sprints to yourwalking routine. Or add fifteen minutes to your workouts. Or try doing anotheractivity altogether, like swimming or dancing, which will challenge your musclesin new ways.GET SMART TO GET THINNER“I stopped believing that I couldn’t do it.”—SarahIt is also a good idea to add strength training to your routine because workingyour muscles ultimately boosts your metabolism. The more lean muscle mass youhave, the higher your metabolism. Strength training can help keep plateaus atbay by increasing your BMR.REMEMBER THAT CHANGE NEVER STOPS.Our bodies and lives are in a constant state of change. Marriages, divorces, jobtransfers, pregnancies, injuries, illnesses, and hormonal transitions are justsome of the many things that keep us in flux. Because of this, as you reach yourinitial goals, you may decide that you want even greater results. Or unexpectedthings might happen in your life that make you reevaluate your originalbenchmarks and downshift your expectations. Just know that with every changethat comes into your life, you have the power to be in control of the way youhandle that change.Dealing with ObstaclesTo prepare yourself for the barriers to brain health and weight loss, take timeto think about the challenges you will face and how you will handle them.

Heplayed football at a very high level in high school, in college at theUniversity of Washington, and eight years in the pros as a tight end with theNew Orleans Saints, New England Patriots, and St. Louis Rams. At agethirty-four, he volunteered for our study because he was struggling withproblems of depression, irritability, low tolerance for frustration, highstress, obsessive thinking, and memory problems.While playing football in college, he had a concussion and was unconscious foreighteen hours. He was diagnosed with a total of eight concussions—three incollege and five in the pros. He said his “bell was rung” every week.Once, in his rookie year while playing for Mike Ditka in New Orleans, he wasinvolved in a hazing incident during which other players whacked him on the headwith socks filled with coins (not a sign of intelligent life). Cam suffered aconcussion and vision problems after the incident. Cam said that the NFL changedits position on hazing after the incident.Cam’s evaluation showed clear evidence of depression, brain trauma, andcognitive dysfunction. His SPECT scan showed left-sided brain damage (he said hewas hit in the left eye during the hazing incident and that he felt better onblocks when he led with the left side of his head). His Microcog (a test ofneuropsychological function) showed significant decreases in general cognitivefunctioning, information processing speed, attention, memory, and spatialprocessing.As part of our study, we put Cam on our brain rehabilitation program, whichincluded fish oil (Omega-3 Power), a great multiple vitamin (NeuroVite), and ourBrain & Memory Power Boost.Eight months later we reassessed Cam, using the same protocol as before. Hereported he felt much better and noticed significant improvements in hisattention, mental clarity, memory, mood, motivation, and anxiety level. He felthis anger was under greater control and he was getting along better with hissmall children.His SPECT scan showed dramatic improvement in the areas of his temporal lobes(memory and mood stability), prefrontal cortex (attention and judgment), andcerebellum (processing speed). His Microcog showed dramatic improvement as well(see the following table).He feels the difference and is excited to do everything he can to change hisbrain and change his life. You see, changing your brain can make you smarter andhappier! It also made him thinner—Cam has lost 25 pounds since starting theprogram.[images/Amen_9780307463623_epub_039_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX ATHE AMEN SOLUTIONMASTER QUESTIONNAIRETHE AMEN SOLUTION Questionnaire is a great place to start helping you evaluateyour own individual brain. For many years, I realized that not everyone is ableto get a brain scan to check on the health of his or her brain. So, in order tobring the life-changing information to as many people as possible, I developedthis questionnaire to help predict the areas of strengths and vulnerabilities ofthe brain.A word of caution is in order. Self-report questionnaires have advantages andlimitations. They are quick and easy to score. On the other hand, people fillingthem out may portray themselves in a way they want to be perceived, resulting inself-report bias. For example, some people exaggerate and mark all of thesymptoms as frequent, in essence saying, “I’m glad to have a problem so that Ican get help or have an excuse for the troubles I have.” Others are in denial.They do not want to see any personal flaws and they do not check any symptoms assignificant, in essence saying, “I’m okay. There’s nothing wrong with me. Leaveme alone.” Not all self-report bias is intentional. People may genuinely havedifficulty recognizing and expressing how they feel. Sometimes family members orfriends are better at evaluating a loved one’s level of functioning than aperson evaluating him- or herself.Questionnaires of any sort should never be used as the only assessment tool. Usethis one as a catalyst to help you think, ask better questions, and get moreevaluation if needed. Always discuss any recommendations with your personalphysician or health care provider, especially if you are taking any medications,such as for your heart, asthma, diabetes, blood thinners, blood pressure, or foranxiety, depression, or pain.THE AMEN SOLUTIONMASTER QUESTIONNAIRECOPYRIGHT © 2011 DANIEL AMEN, M.D.Please rate yourself on each of the symptoms listed below using the followingscale.

Stop thinking that breakfast equals baked goods. Scramble two egg whites with3 ounces chopped chicken breast and ½ cup spinach instead of eating a350-calorie whole-wheat sesame bagel to cut nearly 160 calories and boost yourfocus.2. Try 1 cup cooked quinoa with berries instead of your favorite sweetenedcereal to boost protein content and keep you feeling full longer. You’ll eatfewer calories throughout the day.3. Ditch the chocolate frosted doughnuts (540 calories for two) and get smart bymaking veggies a part of your breakfast. Put spinach, celery, and broccoli in ablender with 1 scoop vanilla whey protein powder to cut nearly 400 calories.4. Use 2 tablespoons fruit-only, no-sugar-added jams instead of regular jam forbagels or toast and save about 20 calories. This also helps to get rid of theextra sugar.5. Replace two slices of regular bacon (80 calories) at breakfast with twoslices of fat-free turkey bacon (40 calories) to cut 40 calories.6. Indulge in modified French toast. Use ½ cup unsweetened almond milk and 2 eggwhites instead of whole milk and eggs to trim about 150 calories. Use sproutedgrain bread instead of white bread to boost fiber and nutrient content.7. If you love pancakes, use oat flour or brown rice flour and ditch the syrup,which costs 104 calories for two tablespoons. Top with ½ cup of sliced freshstrawberries and ½ cup of blueberries instead and save at least 40 calories.8. Eat breakfast every day. People who skip breakfast are four times more likelyto be fat than people who don’t skip breakfast! The National Weight ControlRegistry, which includes people who have maintained at least a 30-pound weightloss for at least one year, reports that 78 percent of its members eat breakfastevery day.9. Don’t reach for the all-American breakfast special (two slices of bacon, twofried eggs, and two pancakes with butter and syrup), which can add up to morethan 800 calories in some restaurants. Rather a 200- to 300-calorieprotein-blueberry shake is a good brain healthy way to start the day.10. Top your steel-cut oatmeal with 1 cup unsweetened almond milk instead ofwhole milk to save 110 calories.11. When you scramble or fry eggs, use cooking spray, which usually costs lessthan 10 calories per one second spray, rather than butter or margarine at 100calories per tablespoon to save 90 calories or more.12. Eat two poached eggs instead of fried eggs and save about 100 calories.13. Try my favorite butter substitute: Earth Balance Natural Buttery Spread withOlive Oil. It has no trans fats, less than half the saturated fat of realbutter, and 20 fewer calories per serving compared with real butter ormargarine.14. Eat only the egg white and toss away the yolk to trim about 60 calories.15. Substitute 1% or fat-free cottage cheese for 2% and save at least 60calories per cup.16. Skip the cheese and Italian sausage in your omelet and add spinach,mushrooms, tomatoes, or bell peppers instead and trim more than 300 calories.17. Replace 1 tablespoon regular mayo (90 calories) on your turkey sandwich with1 tablespoon of reduced-fat mayo to cut 40 calories. Or save about 80 calorieswith 1 tablespoon of fat-free mayo.18. Add more vegetables, such as cucumbers, lettuce, tomato, and onions to asandwich instead of extra meat or cheese and save about 200 calories.19. Accompany a sandwich with salad or fruit instead of chips or French friesand cut anywhere from 150 to more than 500 calories depending on serving size.20. Choose vegetable-based broth soups rather than cream- or meat-based soups.With one famous soup brand, you’ll save at least 100 calories per cup this way.21. Stop putting butter, margarine, or mayonnaise on your sandwiches. Usemustard instead and save up to 95 calories per tablespoon.22. Use water-packed tuna instead of tuna packed in oil. A 5-ounce can of tunain oil costs 220 calories whereas the water-packed tuna is only 100 calories.23. Prepare tuna with nonfat mayonnaise instead of regular mayonnaise to trim 80calories from your sandwich.24. Skip the slice of cheese on your sandwich to save about 100 calories.25. Say no to the free chips and soda with your deli sandwich to trim about 250calories from your meal.26. Use a 6-inch or 8-inch taco-size sprouted grain flourless or brown ricetortilla instead of a 10-inch burrito-size flour tortilla and save 40–100calories.27. Switch to a 6-inch corn tortilla instead of a 10-inch flour tortilla andsave 165 calories.28. Steam veggies instead of sautéing them in 2 tablespoons butter or oil andcut 200 calories.29. Switch to four boiled shrimp instead of 4 ounces of sirloin steak on shishkebabs to trim more than 100 calories.30. Broil or bake foods instead of frying them and cut hundreds of calories.31. Try lemon juice to flavor vegetables instead of oil or butter and save about100 calories per tablespoon.32. Change your thinking. Think of vegetables as your “main dish” rather thanyour “side dish.” You’ll eat fewer calories that way.33. Modify recipes to reduce the amount of fat and calories. For example, whenmaking chili, load it up with shredded vegetables, such as carrots, zucchini,and spinach and use just a small amount of ground white meat turkey instead ofbeef. You’ll cut a couple hundred calories per serving.34. Use 95 percent extra-lean ground beef rather than 70 percent ground beef tocut more than 100 calories per 4-ounce serving.35. Eat sweet potatoes, which contain cellulose and hemicelluloses, insolublefibers that help you feel full faster so you eat less.36. Using fresh herbs and garlic instead of one tablespoon of butter or oil addsa lot of flavor and saves about 100 calories.37. Brown and basmati rice are a good carbohydrate fix because as little as ahalf cup is very filling and has a higher nutritional value than white rice aswell as a lower glycemic index factor so you get more bang for your buck.38. Mix ½ cup pinto beans with ½ cup brown rice to create a complete protein anda low-calorie alternative to meat. Adding fresh herbs, garlic, and salsa orlow-salt Italian diced tomatoes is delicious and adds up to less than 250calories.39. Swap quinoa for white rice. Quinoa is a complete protein and contains moreprotein than any other grain with 9 grams per 1 cup of cooked quinoa. It is muchlower on the glycemic index than white rice, which helps you avoid a spike inblood sugar. This can improve self-control and reduce the calories you consumefor the rest of the day.40. Trim the fat from all meat and avoid eating the skin on poultry to cut about50 calories.41. Squeeze lemon juice on fish instead of 2 tablespoons of tartar sauce andsave 70 calories.42. Make 99 percent fat-free white-meat turkey meatballs instead of 95 percentextra lean beef meatballs to save about 65 calories per serving.43. Use grilled portobello mushrooms instead of 95 percent extra-lean beef inyour burger and save about 140 calories.44. Go bunless. Have your burger on a bed of lettuce instead of a bun and lopoff 150 calories or more.45. At Chinese restaurants, just say no to the fried crunchy noodles they put onwonton soup and save about 150 calories.46. Make your own salad dressings, such as balsamic vinegar with a little freshgarlic. In restaurants, use straight balsamic vinegar or lemon juice to cut 100calories per tablespoon compared with other dressings.47. Limit salad toppings. A big salad might seem healthy, but all those goodieson top can make it more calorie-laden than lasagna or fettuccine Alfredo. Cheesecrumbles, caramelized nuts, bacon, avocado, dried fruit, croutons, and creamydressings can add lots of calories. Save 500 or more calories by having just onetopping, adding flavorful but lower-cal veggies (roasted bell peppers, grilledonions, or mushrooms), and using half the dressing.48. Vinegar and citrus fruits are great substitutes for cream sauces on justabout anything, and they can cut hundreds of calories.49. Spaghetti squash and shredded zucchini are excellent substitutes for pastaand taste like whatever you add to it. You save almost 200 calories per cup.50. “Clean your plate” is one of the worst habits we are taught. Stop eatingwhen you feel full and save the rest for leftovers. This one habit can cuthundreds of calories from your daily intake.51. To learn how to stop cleaning your plate, make it a practice to leave two orthree bites of food on your plate at every meal. The few bites won’t add up tothat many calories but learning not to devour everything a restaurant or dinnerhost serves you can save hundreds of calories on those occasions.52. The best way to limit your calories is to cook at home where you can controlthe amount of food on your plate. This can slash hundreds or even more than1,000 calories in some cases.53. If you must have a high-calorie food at a meal, eat the more nutritious,low-calorie foods on your plate first. Then you likely won’t eat as much of thehigh-calorie food.54. Substitute lower-calorie fish like halibut for steak to trim 80 or morecalories per serving.55. Swap ½ cup steamed brown rice for ½ cup fried rice and save about 100calories.56. If you can’t live without fries (427 calories for a medium order), skip thefrying and make baked sweet potato fries, which are about 100 calories perserving. You save almost 300 calories and you gain loads of brain healthynutrients.57. Say no to fried and breaded chicken and opt for grilled or baked chickeninstead to cut at least 100 calories per serving.58. Less is more when it comes to brain healthy preparation. Eat vegetables rawwithout any oil, butter, or cream sauces to save hundreds of calories.59. With pasta, use marinara sauce instead of Alfredo sauce to save 260 caloriesper cup or instead of pesto sauce to cut 440 calories per cup.60. Put less food on your plate than you think you need. You can always go backto the kitchen for more if you are still hungry, but you might find that youfeel full with less food. You can knock off hundreds of calories with thistrick.61. Never order salad with the dressing already tossed. Get it on the side, soyou are in control of how much you eat, and dip your fork in it before you grabthe salad mix. You will likely cut the calories from the dressing in half—oreven more—and miss none of the taste. Considering how much dressing restaurantspour on, this could easily be several hundred calories.62. When you use olive oil and vinegar on salad, liberally put the vinegar onfirst, then add just a few drops of olive oil. You will likely cut more than 100calories from your meal.63. Steam broccoli and asparagus instead of cooking in 2 tablespoons butter tosave 200 calories.64. Eat more veggies. Researchers at Tufts University found that the morevegetables people eat, the thinner they are.65. Change the proportion of ingredients so that the same amount of food hasmore vegetables or fruits, which are filling and low in calories. For example,instead of 1 cup brown rice, 4 ounces 95 percent extra-lean ground beef, ½ cupof shredded low-fat cheddar cheese, and ¼ cup red bell peppers (total of about550 calories), use 2 cups red bell peppers, ½ cup rice, 3 ounces ground beef,and ¼ cup cheese and save about 180 calories.66. Switch to plain, unsweetened yogurt and add your own fruit. You can get thehealth benefits from yogurt and eliminate about 50 calories per 6-ounce servingand unwanted sugar.67. Bring low-calorie snacks to school or work. I like raw broccoli,cauliflower, carrots, snap peas, celery, and red bell peppers. I may also bringa measured portion of almond butter or mashed avocado with garlic powder as adip. It is important not to let yourself get hungry.68. Eat a medium-sized apple shortly after meals. The fiber will help youcontinue to feel full hours later so you don’t raid the refrigerator, which canadd up to hundreds of unwanted calories.69. Dip carrots, red bell peppers, or celery instead of tortilla chips into yourfavorite salsa, guacamole, or hummus to save about 140 calories.70. When you make air-popped popcorn, put half of it away to eat for anothertime. If you pop 6 cups, put 3 cups away to shave 90 calories.71. For people who have a sweet tooth like me, eat a small portion of somethingsweet, like blueberries (20 calories for ¼ cup) or dark chocolate (about 20calories for one piece of Hershey’s Kisses dark chocolate), so that you can havesomething satisfying without feeling like you are depriving yourself.72. Choose crunchy things. Scientists say the more you chew, the longer it takesto eat and the more time your body has to realize that it is full. Snacks thatoffer a big crunch include carrots, apples, snap peas, and nuts (processedcarbohydrates like sugar cereals and candy don’t count). They keep your mouthbusy longer so you don’t inhale your food like a vacuum cleaner.73. Read the fine print. To get the real scoop on a snack, check out the back ofthe box. When you see a list of hard-to-pronounce ingredients, there is agreater chance something artificial is mixed in that is not necessarilywaistline-friendly. A shorter list usually indicates a more nutritious andslimming pick.74. At the movies, bring 3 cups popcorn that you air-popped at home instead ofgetting the large tub at the concession stand and save more than 1,500 caloriesat some theaters.75. If you’re buying canned fruit cocktail, you can save more than 100 caloriesper cup by choosing fruit packed in water rather than heavy syrup.76. Avoid the vending machine by packing your own healthful snacks to bring towork. For example, consider vegetable sticks, fresh fruit, or low-fat or nonfatyogurt without added sugars. Compared with a candy bar from the vending machine,you can save up to 200 calories if you eat the raw veggies.77. Tree nuts can be a very healthy snack, as long as you don’t eat too many ofthem. One ounce (about one handful) of dry-roasted mixed nuts has about 175calories. Take one handful and seal the bag rather than nibbling straight fromthe bag to keep the calorie count down.78. Choose 1 cup red grapes instead of 1 cup raisins to save about 450 calories.79. Skip the dried fruit with added sugar and eat a piece of fresh fruit to cutup to several hundred calories.80. When your dinner hosts serve dessert, excuse yourself and go for a walk. Byskipping dessert, you can easily cut hundreds of calories.81. Eat a low-sugar protein bar in the afternoon instead of a candy bar. Thecalorie counts may be similar but the protein will help regulate your bloodsugar and help your self-control later in the evening while the candy bar willlead to a sugar crash and a greater likelihood of overeating at night.82. Instead of spending 400-plus calories on a slice of chocolate cheesecake,have a single piece of dark chocolate after dinner and save more than 350calories. A little bit of dark chocolate a day has healthy benefits, includingincreasing blood flow to the brain and decreasing blood pressure, but make sureyou count the calories.83. Have frozen blueberries with 1 cup Greek-style nonfat yogurt and a littlestevia—delicious and only about 150 calories—instead of 1 cup rich ice cream at540 calories.84. Frozen red grapes make a great dessert and are about 450 fewer calories percup than ice cream.85. Instead of store-bought sorbet, make your own by putting fruit in theblender and then pouring into Popsicle trays. You’ll save about 100 calories perserving.86. For dessert, forget the slice of apple pie (500 calories or more!) from yourfavorite restaurant and have a small baked apple sprinkled with cinnamon andnutmeg. It’s delicious and slashes more than 400 calories.87. Eat a banana with 1 tablespoon almond butter (about 200 calories) ratherthan a slice of banana cream pie with whipped cream to cut more than 350calories.88. Satisfy sweet-tooth cravings with a cup of hot or iced fruity tea with alittle stevia and save up to several hundred calories.89. Fluff up your food. In one study from Penn State, twenty-eight men drank oneof three different kinds of milkshakes before lunch. All three milkshakes hadthe same ingredients, but some were blended longer to add air and volume. Themen who drank the “airy” shakes ate 12 percent fewer calories at lunch. And theydid not make up for it by eating more at dinner, meaning they kept thosecalories off. So if you are going to have a protein shake for dessert or forbreakfast like I do, blend it longer to add more air.90. Switch to water first thing in the morning instead of fruit juice. Fruitjuice is high in sugar and just 1 cup orange juice costs 112 calories.91. Instead of drinking fruit juice, eat a piece of fruit. The fruit has fiber,which slows the absorption of the natural sugars to keep your blood sugar levelsfrom spiking. Eating one medium orange instead of a 12-ounce glass of orangejuice can cut 80 calories.92. Stop drinking soda. Regular sodas are filled with sugar and caffeine andcost 150 calories each. The artificial sweeteners from diet sodas may becalorie-free, but they are harmful to your health. Plus, because they are up tosix hundred times sweeter than sugar, they may activate the appetite centers ofthe brain making you crave even more food. So the 150 calories you saved bydrinking the diet soda may be spent later that day.93. Replace sodas with real fruit-flavored water, just like you are at the spa.My favorite drink is water with lemon juice and a little lemon-flavored stevia,a healthier natural sweetener. It has no calories and it tastes like lemonade.You can do it with oranges, limes, watermelon, and so on. This is an easy way todramatically increase your water intake and save 150 calories per glass.94. Don’t let the sports drinks and vitamin waters fake you out. The truth ismost are just sweetened water that will cost more than 100 calories for 12ounces.95. If you can’t kick your sports drink habit, pour half of the bottle into aglass and mix with an equal amount of water and fill up the bottle with wateralso to cut the calories and sugar in half.96. Don’t let beverage labels pull a fast one on you. If it is not water,unsweetened almond milk, decaf coffee, or unsweetened tea, it is dessert.97. Limit alcohol, especially mixed drinks, which can have an outrageous numberof calories. For example, one margarita can have as many as 700 calories! Plus,the alcohol decreases prefrontal cortex function, which means your judgment willbe impaired, making you more likely to eat more high-fat, high-sugar,high-calorie foods.98. Going from one glass of wine every night at dinner to one glass per week cantrim about 600 calories per week.99. If you’re going to drink, skip the Long Island iced tea (upwards of 500calories) and go for one glass of white wine (less than 100 calories) to savemore than 400 calories.100. Limit fat storage by drinking green tea, which contains the antioxidantepigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), shown to boost metabolic rate. In a recentthree-month study, participants who took green tea extract lost 4.6 percent oftheir body weight without changing their diet. To get the benefit, drink atleast three cups a day. My favorite is Tropical Acai Berry Green Tea byCelestial Seasonings.101. Before meals, drink fiber—such as Citrucel, Metamucil, or MiraLAX (withlots of water)—because it fills the belly, so there is less room for food.102. When you get hungry, first drink a full glass of water and then if you arestill hungry, eat. Many people confuse being dehydrated with being hungry.103. Drink ice-cold water. Your body burns a few calories warming up the waterto body temperature. Drinking an 8-ounce glass of ice cold water burns about 8calories. Granted, it’s not much, but calories are calories.104. Use almond milk instead of cow’s milk. Blue Diamond unsweetened almond milkcontains only 40 calories for 8 ounces. Their unsweetened chocolate almond milkcontains only 45 calories and is delicious. I actually like almond milk betterthan cow’s milk.105. Another milk alternative is unsweetened rice milk. It will cut more than100 calories per cup.106. Stop using half-and-half in your coffee or tea. Switch to unsweetenedalmond milk to cut more than 17 calories per tablespoon.107. Sprinkle cinnamon or nutmeg in your coffee rather than using flavoredsyrups, which can cost 20 calories per squirt at your favorite coffeehouse.108. Using stevia is a great no-calorie way to sweeten drinks like coffee andtea and most foods. Stevia is 100 percent natural, and it has no effect on bloodsugar. Compared with 11 calories per packet of sugar, the savings add up.109. Avoid high-calorie coffee drinks. You can cut more than 600 calories byswitching from some fancy coffee drinks to a plain drip (decaf preferably)coffee with a little unsweetened almond milk and stevia.110. Split meals with your spouse or friends when you eat out to cut calories byhalf.111. If you are eating out by yourself, have your server put half your meal in a“to go” bag before serving you. That way, you won’t be tempted to clean yourplate.112. In restaurants, ask if you can substitute a broth-based soup for Frenchfries or chips as a side dish so you can save well over 100 calories.113. Barbara Rolls, a nutrition researcher at Pennsylvania State University andauthor of The Volumetrics Eating Plan: Techniques and Recipes for Feeling Fullon Fewer Calories, conducted a study that found that people who ate 1 cuplow-calorie vegetable broth before lunch reduced their total calorie intake by20 percent.114. Don’t make a lot of different dishes for your meals. Research shows thatthe more choices you have the more you typically eat.115. After hosting family gatherings, immediately give away or discard any foodsthat are not on your everyday diet. If the food is perfectly good, take it toyour local food bank or share it with a neighbor.116. Eat a snack or a light meal before you go to a party so you won’t be hungrywhen faced with high-calorie hors d’oeuvres.117. Skip the bread they serve before meals in restaurants. At one popularrestaurant, a single breadstick adds 150 calories to your meal. And who can stopat just one?118. Eating at a Chinese restaurant? Use chopsticks. It slows down consumptionso you feel full faster and eat less.119. Don’t order appetizers before your entrée—unless it’s a broth-based soup.120. Tell your waiter “No croutons” on your salad. One cup of the crunchy saladtoppers can cost more than 185 calories.121. Be picky. If you don’t love something that’s on your plate, don’t eat it.You can save hundreds of calories this way.122. Use your brain to always think “high-quality calories in.” Focus oncalorie-restricted and optimally nutritious foods when you are deciding what toeat.123. Stay away from “anti-nutrition” foods—such as trans fats, negativecalories, or potentially harmful food additives—even if they are low incalories. Ultimately, they can spike your appetite and make you eat even more.124. Don’t add sugar to anything. A single teaspoon of the sweet stuff adds 16calories.125. Don’t think you are doing yourself a favor by using brown sugar, raw sugar,turbinado sugar, agave syrup, or honey. They all contain calories you don’tneed.126. Beware of fat-free products. Fat-free does not mean calorie-free. Check thenutrition label before you indulge.127. One of the best ways to cut calories is to write down and measureeverything you eat until you are confident that you really know how manycalories you put into your body every day. Studies show that most people tend tounderestimate the number of calories in a meal, but overweight individuals havea greater amount of portion distortion. Seeing is believing.128. Serve your food on smaller plates, which will help to shrink your servingsizes. Turn in your 12-inch plate for a 10-inch version to cut 20 to 25 percentof your calories. You can thank Brian Wansink, author of Mindless Eating, andhis team of researchers at the Cornell University Food and Brand Lab for theresearch behind this tip as well as the following five tips.129. Going to a buffet? Sit at least sixteen feet away from and don’t face thebuffet table. Researchers at the Cornell University Food and Brand Lab foundthat fatter diners tend to sit closer to the buffet and return more often formore helpings than slimmer people.130. Use smaller bowls when eating cereal, yogurt, or soup. Research shows thatthe bigger your bowl, the more you will eat.131. Go small with serving utensils too. It isn’t just the size of the platesand bowls you eat from that influence your calorie intake, it is also the sizeof the serving spoons you use. Bigger spoons equal bigger portions.132. Don’t put the serving bowls and platters on the table. That makes it tooeasy to take seconds … and thirds. Leave the serving dishes in the kitchen tocut calories.133. Say no to big dinner parties with lots of guests. You tend to eat more whenthere are more than seven people at the table.134. In a restaurant, always ask how your meal is prepared and request “nobutter,” “no cheese,” and so on. You can cut hundreds of calories with thissimple trick.135. Substitute lower-fat meats—such as turkey, chicken, or lean pork—forhigher-fat, higher-calorie alternatives. For example, choosing a chicken breastinstead of prime rib can trim more than 300 calories per serving.136. Lean on low-density foods to help you feel fuller faster. Low-density foodstypically contain more water so you can eat larger portions yet fewer calories.High-density foods, on the other hand, pack lots of calories in very smallportions. Be a value spender and go for the low-density variety. For example,for the same number of calories, you could either eat 1 ounce French fries or 9ounces fresh strawberries.137. Chew each bite 20 times. One study found that diners with higher body massindexes (BMIs) chewed each bite only twelve times compared with an average offifteen times for healthy-weight people. Try to savor the food. In essence, youare performing a mindful meditation when you eat. This also makes your foodtaste sweeter. Saliva has an enzyme called amylase that breaks down simplecarbohydrates, such as wheat or potatoes, into sugar.138. Use all of your senses when you eat or drink. Pay attention to the favors,smells, textures, colors, and even the sounds they make when you consume them.This will help you eat more slowly, which can help you feel full on fewercalories.139. Eat with your fork in your nondominant hand to reduce dexterity and slowdown the shoveling of food into your mouth.140. Put down your fork after each bite.141. Cut down on the variety you eat, so that you actually know what is in yourfood. Gorillas tend to eat the same thing, over and over, and they are obviouslystrong and muscular. According to the National Zoo, here are the mainingredients of their diet: “The morning diet is generally made up of vegetables,which may include kale, celery, green beans, carrots, and sweet potato. Eveningfoods include more greens such as romaine, kale, cabbage, or dandelion alongwith the fruits and vegetables du jour. Bananas, apples, oranges, mango, grapes,melon, and papaya are often included. Onions, broccoli, turnips, white potatoes,squash, cucumbers, and beets are also included. Throughout the day, the gorillasare given additional forage items, such as popcorn, peanuts, or jungle mix.Browse (fresh tree trimmings) is given daily and includes bamboo, bradford pear,willow, mulberry, or maple.”142. Learn to eyeball servings. After you spend some time weighing food, learnabout serving sizes. A 3-ounce serving of meat or poultry is about the size of adeck of cards, one serving of pasta or rice is the size of a tennis ball, abread serving is the size of a CD case, and one serving of cheese is the size offour dice. See more suggested serving sizes in appendix C[Amen_9780307463623_epub_app3_r1.htm].143. Eat at the table. Fifty-nine percent of young women eat on the go, a studyin the Journal of the American Dietetic Association finds, and on-the-run eatersconsume more total fat as well as more soda and fast food. The less distractedand stressed you are when you dine, the more efficiently your body absorbsnutrients. Eat at the table and focus on your food, not the traffic.144. Don’t eat in front of the TV. In one study, people ate up to 44 percentmore while watching TV compared with when they weren’t in front of the boobtube.145. For virtually no calories, adding spice to your meals can increase yourmetabolism. Different studies have shown that spicy foods can increase yourmetabolism by 8 to 20 percent for at least 30 minutes after eating. A little bitof cayenne pepper or cinnamon is all you need to add to your favorite recipes.146. Eat veggies at every meal. When people eat vegetables with a meal, theyconsume a full 20 percent fewer calories overall while feeling satisfied,according to a study from the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.147. Increase your fiber intake. Eating fiber helps to prevent overeatingbecause it makes you feel full. You will have an even greater feeling offullness and higher energy levels throughout the day if you eat meals that aremostly made up of fiber, protein, and water. Fiber also slows down the digestionof foods you eat, keeping your blood sugar and energy levels in check andpreventing you from getting hungry. Good sources of fiber are vegetables,fruits, nuts, beans, and some whole grain cereals. The amount of fiber in a foodproduct is listed in the nutritional facts found on most food labels. Fibertakes so long to be digested by your body, a person eating 20–35 g fiber a daywill burn an extra 150 calories a day or lose 16 extra pounds a year.148. To get more fiber in your diet, ditch the white bread and replace it withwhole wheat. A slice of white bread contains about ½ g fiber while whole wheatbread can be packed with 1.5 g to 7 g per slice. Check the labels to look forthe highest fiber content.149. Boost your fiber consumption by adding beans to soups and salads.150. Make sure you eat healthy fats with every meal. It helps with satiety andserves to curb your appetite between meals. An Australian study showed thateating a meal with healthy fats, such as olive oil, significantly increasedfat-burning rate five hours later, particularly in subjects with more abdominalfat.151. Use a food scale to weigh and measure portion sizes and always measure thefoods you tend to overeat.152. Always measure and weigh the foods that you tend to overeat.153. Make sure you have enough calcium in your diet. Researchers have linkedcalcium with lower production of the stress-hormone cortisol (remember cortisolswitches the body into a fat-storing mode). According to several studies, peoplewho increase their calcium intake lose more weight than people with low calciumlevels. Sources of calcium include unsweetened yogurt and spinach.154. Consistently reduce your meal sizes by just 10 percent. You won’t evennotice, and it will save an amazing number of calories.155. Buy food in prepared-portioned sizes so you know exactly how many caloriesyou are eating.156. Get at least seven to eight hours of sleep at night. Getting fewer thanthat has been associated with eating more calories throughout the day and witheating more foods that can trigger cravings. One study in the American Journalof Clinical Nutrition found that people who got only five and a half hours ofsleep ate 221 calories more than people who slept for eight and a half hours.157. Liberally sprinkle cinnamon on your oatmeal in the morning to help regulateblood sugar levels. This will increase your self-control later in the day so youmake better decisions and eat fewer calories.158. Eat smaller, more frequent meals to keep blood sugar levels balanced andprevent overeating.159. Eat with people who share your healthy lifestyle rather than eating withpeople who have bad eating habits. People tend to eat more when the peoplearound them do so.160. If you overeat one day, just get back on track the next day.161. Learn to say no to friends and family members who offer you seconds orfoods that don’t fit into your brain healthy program. Simply saying no can trimhundreds of calories from your daily total.162. Move more. James A. Levine, M.D., a researcher at the Mayo Clinic, hasfound that structured exercise isn’t the only way to burn calories. Walkinginstead of taking the elevator, pacing while talking on the phone, and othereveryday physical activities can burn an extra 500–1,000 calories per day.Levine calls this type of activity NEAT (non-exercise activity thermo-genesis).I think it’s pretty neat that you can burn so many calories so easily.163.
