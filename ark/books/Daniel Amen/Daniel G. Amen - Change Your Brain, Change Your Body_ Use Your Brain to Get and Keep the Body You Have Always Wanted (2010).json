Both matterto your success at work and in your relationships.It is not just vanity, it is about health.To look and feel your best, you must first think about andoptimize your brain.I live in Newport Beach, California. We have often been called the plasticsociety, because we have more plastic walking around our streets and beachesthan almost anywhere else in the world. One of my friends says that God willnever flood Newport Beach because all of the women will float. Most peoplethroughout the world, not just in Newport Beach, care more about their faces,their boobs, their bellies, their butts, and their abs than they do theirbrains. But it is your brain that is the key to having the face, the breasts,the belly, the butt, the abs, and the overall health you have always wanted; andit is brain dysfunction, in large part, that ruins our bodies and causespremature aging.It is your brain that decides to get you out of bed in the morning to exercise,to give you a stronger, leaner body, or to cause you to hit the snooze buttonand procrastinate your workout. It is your brain that pushes you away from thetable telling you that you have had enough, or that gives you permission to havethe second bowl of Rocky Road ice cream, making you look and feel like a blob.It is your brain that manages the stress in your life and relaxes you so thatyou look vibrant, or, when left unchecked, sends stress signals to the rest ofyour body and wrinkles your skin. And it is your brain that turns awaycigarettes, too much caffeine, and alcohol, helping you look and feel healthy,or that gives you permission to smoke, to have that third cup of coffee, or todrink that third glass of wine, thus making every system in your body look andfeel older.Your brain is the command and control center of your body. If you want a betterbody, the first place to ALWAYS start is by having a better brain.My interest in the brain-body connection started more than thirty years ago. Asa college student, my thinking was influenced by the work of O. Carl Simonton,the oncologist who taught people to use visualization to boost their immunesystem in order to fight cancer. In medical school, I became trained in the useof medical hypnosis and began to see the powerful effect it can have on healingthe body. I personally saw that it was helpful for treating headaches, irritablebowel syndrome, pain, weight loss, insomnia, a Parkinsonian tremor, and heartarrhythmias. I then became trained in a treatment technique called biofeedbackand found that when I taught my patients to use their brains to warm their handsor breathe with their bellies, their whole body went into a relaxed state, whichwas helpful in decreasing stress, lowering blood pressure, and combatingheadaches.THE MISSING LINKIt wasn’t until 1991 that I truly started to understand the brain-bodyconnection. That was the year I started the brain imaging work we do now at theAmen Clinics. We do a study called brain SPECT imaging that looks at blood flowand activity patterns. SPECT stands for single photon emission computedtomography. Unlike MRI and CAT scans, which show the anatomy of the brain, SPECTscans look at how the brain functions.Looking at the brain has made an enormous difference in both my professional andpersonal life. At the time I ordered my first scan I had been a psychiatrist fornearly a decade, and I realized that I didn’t have all the information I neededto provide the very best treatment for my patients. When I scanned my firstpatient I was excited to discover that the SPECT scans gave me criticalinformation about brain function that I could not ascertain just by talking tothe patient. The scans helped me and my colleagues be better healers.Since 1991, the Amen Clinics have performed more than 55,000 brain scans, morethan any organization in the world. Analyzing scans in the context of individualpatient histories has helped us better diagnose and treat our patients for awide variety of problems, such as ADD, depression, anxiety, anger, learningproblems, memory problems, brain injuries, and addictions. In addition, I havediscovered that when I improved my patients’ brain functions, I also helped toimprove their bodies and overall life.I saw dramatic evidence of this a few years ago when I created a home studycourse for treating anxiety and depression. To test the course, we enlisted thehelp of ninety people to take part in the pilot program. The results wereastounding. As I expected, most of the individuals experienced significantimprovement in their levels of anxiety and depression. But that’s not all. Anumber of the people told us that by following the twelve-week program, theyalso lost twenty to thirty pounds. This surprising result showed us that whenpeople help their brains, they help their bodies, and they were finally able tolose the weight they had been trying to shed for years.Our brain imaging work opened a new window into why people do what they do.It provided the missing link and allowed people to see what was going on intheir brains, so they could do things to improve their brain and their bodies.Take a close look at yourself in the mirror. If your skin seems dry, you reachfor the moisturizer. Spot a pimple and you dab it with a bit of acne medication.Notice a few split ends and you call the hairdresser for a haircut. If you livein Newport Beach and you detect a few wrinkles, you call a doctor and make anappointment for Botox. Basically, whenever you see a problem with your body, youtry to fix it yourself or get professional help to take care of it. But mostpeople never even think about the health of their own brain, because they cannotsee it. Many of us are walking around with brains that could use some serioushelp, but we don’t know it, so we don’t do anything to address the issue. Thisis at the heart, or should I say brain, of the problem. Let’s look at an exampleof a healthy brain and a troubled brain.In a healthy brain, there is full, even, symmetrical activity, with the mostintensity in the back of the brain, in an area called the cerebellum. Introubled brains, you will see areas that are working too hard or areas thataren’t working hard enough. In Image I.1, see Anna’s eighty-two-year-old brain.It is very healthy and looks like a brain of someone thirty years younger. Annawas very healthy, not on any medications, and was a loving wife of fifty-eightyears, mother, and grandmother. She was sharp, energetic, had a lot ofintellectual curiosity, and was active in her community and church.Image I.1[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_001_r1.jpg]Anna’s 82-year-old healthy brain scan shows full, even, symmetrical activity.By contrast, Becca, age forty-four, came to see me for impulsiveness andobesity. She supported two hundred pounds on her five-foot frame and had triedmany times without success to lose weight. When we scanned her, she had very lowactivity in the prefrontal cortex, located in the front part of her brain (ImageI.2), likely from a car accident in childhood. The prefrontal cortex is the partof her brain responsible for planning, decision making, and impulse control. Ontreatment to enhance activity in her prefrontal cortex (Image I.3), herimpulsiveness significantly diminished and she was able to stay on a brain andbody healthy program that helped her lose eighty pounds over two years.Our brain imaging work taught me that impulsiveness is not just a lack ofwillpower or a bad attitude, which is the belief shared by 95 percent of thepopulation. We could actually see that many people had low activity in the frontpart of their brain, whether it was from a brain injury, toxic exposure, or aninherited problem like attention deficit disorder (ADD). And when we fixed theproblem, we found that these people were better able to stay on the diet andhealth plans they needed for a better body.Image I.2: Before Treatment[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_002_r1.jpg]Low activity in the front of the brain (see the arrow)Image I.3: With Treatment[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_003_r1.jpg]Improved activity (see the arrow)Additionally, after looking at the brain, I no longer thought thatcompulsiveness was just from rigid people who were overcontrolling. I could seethat the front part of their brain worked too hard. When we calmed down thispart of the brain with supplements or medications, people were less likely toovereat or be under chronic stress.Looking at the brain changed everything I did and taught me that in order tochange your body, you MUST first change your brain. Understanding and optimizingyour brain is often the missing link to being successful in your quest for abetter body.YOUR BRAIN CAN CHANGE YOUR BODYThe connection between your brain and body is truly amazing. Here are threeexamples. 1. My first wife, Robbin, and I tried for several years to have our third child. Robbin had a child from a previous marriage, Antony, whom I adopted, and we had already had a child together, Breanne. But this time it just wasn’t happening. She even sent me to the urologist with the little plastic cup to get checked out. Not my idea of fun. Then one day, I was at home with Breanne, age four, and Antony, nine, while Robbin was away at school. It was about 6 p.m. when Breanne heard the sound of something crying. We looked all around the house but couldn’t find anything. Then I noticed that the lonely cries were coming from the attic. I got the ladder and a flashlight and crawled into the attic where I found a kitten just a few hours old, abandoned by her mother, with her eyes still sticky shut, crying weakly. When I brought the kitten down, the children were so excited. I called the local vet, who told me the baby was not likely to live and I should just drown her in a bucket of water. With two young children looking up at me with excited faces, I told the vet that he needed to give me another plan or I was going to be in big trouble. Reluctantly, he told me how to stimulate her to go to the bathroom with a warm, wet cotton swab (that was a new one for me), gave me the name of a baby kitten formula I could get at the pet store, and told me to keep her warm under a lamp—but there was no hope. When Robbin got home, all of her maternal instincts went into overdrive. She cared for the kitten, dreamed about her, and got up frequently at night to check on her. Ipo, the kitten, thrived, and within three weeks Robbin was pregnant! Her maternal instincts changed the receptivity of her body. 2. Larry and I both worked together at my father’s grocery store chain when we were teenagers. I have seen him again periodically through the years at various business and family functions. On the last occasion, my father’s eightieth-birthday celebration, Larry looked twenty years older than his age of fifty-four. His hair was stark white, his skin was wrinkled, and had an ashen tone. His daughter had died of cancer ten years earlier and his wife had died of the same cancer the year before. The mountain of stress he had been under took a noticeably negative toll on his body. 3. On a recent trip for my public television show Change Your Brain, Change Your Life, I went back to the station in Atlanta where I had been a number of times before. The fund-raising director, Alicia Steele, picked me up at the hotel for an on-air appearance. This time Alicia looked different. She looked younger and more vibrant. When I asked her what she was doing, she said that since she had met me she was eating right, taking fish oil, drinking less alcohol, and was better at handling the stresses in her life. She had taken the extended version of my brain system questionnaire, found on our website, and discovered that her prefrontal cortex was likely low in activity, so she started taking the supplement SAMe with great effect. In fact, she told me that she had also dropped fifteen pounds. And she was getting her husband to exercise. That week at her station there had been a death in the family of her producer, which had really upset the schedule; usually, she told me, an event like that would have made her cry; now, she knew she could adapt to the changes and get rid of any automatic negative thoughts (ANTs) that tried to steal her happiness. As she changed her brain, her body, her life, and even her family were much improved. The story of our kitten highlights that when a woman acts maternal, chemical changes in the brain send signals to the body making it more likely for her to conceive. Larry’s story illustrates that when someone is under a mountain of stress, it will likely have a very negative impact on his body. And Alicia’s story teaches us that when you combat stress and get on a brain-healthy program specific to your own brain, you will look and feel younger. Think about this concept for a moment. You can change your brain and subsequently change your body. You can harness the power of your brain to create the body you want!ONE PRESCRIPTION DOES NOT WORK FOR EVERYONEAlicia’s story highlights a very important point that will be a major themethroughout the rest of this book. One prescription does not fit everyone. Thisis why most weight-loss programs don’t work. All of us need individualized orpersonalized prescriptions based on our own brain types and needs. Since Alicialikely had low activity in her prefrontal cortex, in the front part of herbrain, she needed more stimulating interventions, such as the supplement SAMe.People who have too much activity in the front part of the brain tend to dobetter with interventions that are calming and boost the neurotransmitterserotonin, such as using the supplement 5-HTP. Using SAMe with people who havehigh prefrontal cortex activity usually makes them more anxious. Knowing howyour own specific brain works is critical to getting the help that will work foryou. Of course, as we will see, there are interventions that apply to all of us,such as a healthy diet and adequate sleep, but to get the most out of this book,note the interventions that apply to your individual type.WELCOME TO THE BRAIN-BODY CONNECTIONIn the past few decades, scientists and medical professionals have beenexploring and researching what they’ve termed the mind-body connection. Amounting body of scientific evidence supports the concept that your mind has avery powerful influence on your appearance, your mood, your stress levels, andyour overall health. In fact, a whole new branch of alternative medicine hasemerged that focuses on the interactions of the mind and body.Image I.4: A Brain with Alzheimer’s Disease[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_004_r1.jpg]Severe decreased activity in the back half of the brainOne question people often ask me is whether the mind is separate from the brain.The answer, after looking at more than 55,000 brain scans over the past twentyyears, is no. The mind and the brain are completely dependent upon each other.Just think about Alzheimer’s disease, which is clearly a brain illness. Dopeople with Alzheimer’s disease lose their minds? Yes, they do as the diseaseprogresses. When you lose brain tissue (see Image I.4), you lose your memory andyour ability to think rationally.Or let’s consider brain trauma. Becca’s scan above showed damage to herprefrontal cortex. Damage the brain, and you damage the mind and most everythingelse in your life, including your body. When I improved Becca’s brain, her mindand body were so much better.TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE BRAIN-BODY CONNECTIONIf you are reading this book, I’m assuming there are things you’d like to changeabout your body. Maybe you’d like to tighten your tummy, have younger-lookingskin, boost your energy level, stop getting so many colds, reduce the number ofheadaches you get, or lower your blood pressure without having to take medicine.Like most people, you probably know what you have to do in order to achieve yourgoals, but you simply don’t do it. Why not? Because you aren’t taking care ofyour brain. If you want to lose the love handles, you need to improve thefunction of your frontal lobes. If you want to say goodbye to all thoseheadaches, you have to calm your brain.

Don’t you?"},{"pageContent":"1THE BRAIN-BODY SOLUTIONTEN BASIC PRINCIPLES TO CHANGE YOUR BRAIN AND YOUR BODYDevelop brain envy.Loving your brain is the first steptoward getting the body you want.Over the years, I have personally had ten brain SPECT scans to check on thehealth of my own brain. Looking back, my earliest scan, taken when I wasthirty-seven, showed a toxic, bumpy appearance that was definitely notconsistent with great brain function. Initially, I didn’t understand why. All mylife, I have been someone who rarely drank alcohol, never smoked, and never usedan illegal drug. So why did my brain look so bad? Before I understood aboutbrain health, I had many bad brain habits. I practically lived on fast food anddiet sodas, worked like a nut, rarely got more than four or five hours of sleepat night, and didn’t exercise much. My weight was fifteen pounds above where Iwanted it, and I struggled with arthritis and had trouble getting off the floorwhen I played with my children. At thirty-seven, I just thought I was gettingolder.My most recent brain scan at age fifty-two looks healthier and much younger thanmy first scan, even though brains typically become less active with age. Why?Seeing other people’s scans, I developed “brain envy” and wanted mine to bebetter. As I learned about brain health, I put into practice what I’m teachingyou and what I’ve been preaching to my patients for years. In doing so, I gotmore than just a better-looking brain. I also feel more energetic, lookhealthier, have lost weight, and have better body tone, no arthritis, andsmoother-looking skin.In this chapter, you will find ten basic principles that explain why it isessential to love and nurture your brain in order to have your best bodypossible. These are the same principles that underlie our work at the AmenClinics, where we have helped thousands of people learn to love their brains inorder to improve their bodies.Image 1.1: Dr. A’s brain at thirty-seven[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_005_r1.jpg]Bumpy, toxic appearanceImage 1.2: Dr. A’s brain at fifty-two[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_006_r1.jpg]Healthier overall appearanceTEN PRINCIPLES TO CHANGE YOUR BRAIN AND YOUR BODY 1. Your brain is involved in everything you do. 2. When your brain works right, your body looks and feels better. When your brain is troubled, you have trouble with how you look and feel. 3. The brain is the most complex organ in the universe. Respect it. 4. Your brain is very soft and housed in a really hard skull. Protect it. 5. The brain has only so much reserve. The more reserve you have, the healthier you are. The less reserve, the more vulnerable you are. 6. Specific parts of your brain are involved in certain behaviors. Trouble in specific parts of your brain tends to cause certain behavior problems. Understanding your brain can help you optimize it. 7. Many things hurt the brain and make it harder for you to get the body you’ve always wanted. Many things help the brain and make it easier to get and keep a body you love. 8. Brain imaging gives great insight into healing the brain so you can have a better body. 9. One prescription does not work for everyone—we are all unique, and you need to understand how your own personal brain functions. 10. Yes, you can change your brain and body!PRINCIPLE #1Your brain is involved in everything you do.Your brain controls everything you do, feel, and think. When you look in themirror, you can thank your brain for what you see. Ultimately, it is your brainthat determines whether your belly bulges over your belt buckle or yourwaistline is trim and toned. Your brain plays the central role in whether yourskin looks fresh and dewy or is etched with wrinkles. Whether you wake upfeeling energetic or groggy depends on your brain. When you head to the kitchento make breakfast, it is your brain that determines whether you go for theleftover pizza or the low-fat yogurt and fruit. Your brain controls whether youhit the gym or sit at the computer to check your Facebook page. If you feel theneed to light up a cigarette or drink a couple cups of java, that’s also yourbrain’s doing.ACTION STEPRemember that your brain is involved in everything you do, every decision youmake, every bite of food you take, every cigarette you smoke, every worrisomethought you have, every workout you skip, every alcoholic beverage you drink,and more.The moment-by-moment functioning of your brain is responsible for the way youthink, feel, eat, exercise, and even for the way you make love. The impact ofthe brain on your body goes even deeper than that. It is at the core of yourvery health and well-being. Whether you live a long healthy life, suffer from adebilitating condition, or have your days cut short by a terrible disease, yourbrain is at the center of it all. In fact, researchers from the University ofCambridge, England, found that when people made bad decisions with their brains,they took fourteen years off their life spans. People who drank heavily, smoked,didn’t exercise, and had poor diets at the age of sixty had the same risk ofdying as someone with a healthy lifestyle who was seventy-four. The decisionsyour brain makes can steal or add many years to your life!PRINCIPLE #2When your brain works right, your body looks and feels better. When your brainis troubled, you have trouble with how you look and feel.A healthy brain makes it so much easier for you to have your best body possible.When your brain is working at optimal levels, you are more likely to stick to adiet, follow an exercise routine, and adopt healthy lifestyle behaviors. Thatadds up to a slimmer, trimmer body, a more youthful appearance, brighter skin,better immunity, fewer headaches, less back pain, and improved health.On the other hand, a troubled brain often leads to trouble with your body.That’s right, extra pounds, wrinkles, chronic pain, and health conditions can belinked to the way your brain functions. Making poor food choices, blowing offthe gym, and engaging in unhealthy behaviors are more common when your brainisn’t working at its best.Jack, a fifty-two-year-old divorced engineer, is five feet ten inches tall andweighs close to 260 pounds. He tries to diet, but just can’t stick to it. Everymorning, Jack wakes up with the intention of eating healthfully that day, but henever gets around to planning his day’s meals or stocking the refrigerator. Whenlunchtime rolls around, he’s starving and stops at the first fast-foodrestaurant he can find, where he orders a cheeseburger and fries. After cominghome from work, he gazes into an empty refrigerator and then calls the localpizza delivery place for dinner.With three young children, a demanding job, and a strained marriage, Meganappears older than her forty-three years. She’d love to recapture a moreyouthful look, but hasn’t been able to do it with the creams and lotions fromthe cosmetics counter. She rarely gets more than a few hours of sleep at nightand whenever she’s depressed, stressed, mad, or sad, she seeks refuge in acigarette and a glass of wine—or two or three or four glasses of wine, or maybeeven the whole bottle. Smoking and drinking calms down her nerves and makes herfeel better—temporarily.Sarah is twenty-eight years old and would love to have a better body. Althoughshe isn’t technically overweight, she wants to tone and tighten the 135 poundsshe carries on her five-foot-six-inch frame. She knows that exercise could helpher achieve her goals, but she just can’t seem to muster up enough energy ormotivation to hit the gym. Sarah also struggles with feelings of anxiety andnervousness and is constantly thinking of what can go wrong in her life.For years, Jack, Megan, and Sarah have been chalking up their problems to asimple lack of willpower or laziness, but that isn’t necessarily the case. Theirinability to get the body they want lies within their brains. Jack’s lack ofplanning and poor follow-through are common signs of low activity in an area ofthe brain known as the prefrontal cortex (PFC). This is the part of the brainthat is involved with planning, goal setting, forethought, impulse control, andfollow-through. When this area isn’t functioning at the proper level, it makesit very hard to be successful.Smoking or drinking to calm emotions, which is keeping Megan from getting theyouthful look she wants, may signal excessive activity in the deep limbic systemof the brain. This part of the brain is involved in setting your emotional tone.When it is less active, there is generally a positive, hopeful state of mind.When it is heated up or overactive, negativity and feelings of depression orsadness can take over, making you look for solace in nicotine, alcohol, ordrugs.ACTION STEPIf you have trouble following a diet or exercise plan, if you have chronic pain,if you have low energy, or if you have health conditions, improving the healthof your brain will help.Sarah’s energy is drained by anxiety and worry, which may indicate a problem inan area of the brain called the basal ganglia. Located toward the center of thebrain, the basal ganglia are involved with integrating feelings, thoughts, andmotivation. When there is high activity in this area, it can cause problems withanxiety and may drain people of their energy and get-up-and-go.What Jack, Megan, and Sarah show us is that your brain heavily influences yourbehavior and your body. Your brain can either help you have a better body ormake it more difficult for you to have a body you love.PRINCIPLE #3The brain is the most complex organ in the universe. Respect it.The brain is the most complicated, amazing, special organ in the universe. Yourbrain weighs only about three pounds, but it is more powerful than even the mostsophisticated supercomputer. Even though it represents only about 2 percent ofyour body’s weight, your brain uses about 25 percent of the calories youconsume, 25 percent of the total blood flow in your body, and 20 percent of theoxygen you breathe. The calories, blood flow, and oxygen feed the cells insideyour brain.It is estimated that the brain contains more than one hundred billion nervecells, which is about the number of stars in the Milky Way. Each nerve cell isconnected to other nerve cells by thousands of individual connections betweencells. In fact, it is estimated that there are more connections in your brainthan there are stars in the universe! If you take a single piece of brain tissuethe size of a grain of sand, it contains a hundred thousand nerve cells and abillion connections—all “talking” to one another. Information in your braintravels at speeds of up to 268 miles per hour, faster than the race cars in theIndy 500, unless of course you are drunk—then things really slow down. When wedo full-body scans, the brain is lit up like a little heater while the rest ofthe body appears ghostlike. Your brain is the organ of your personality,character, and intelligence and is heavily involved in making you who you are.PRINCIPLE #4Your brain is very soft and housed in a really hard skull. Protect it.If you are like most people, you probably think your brain is firm and rubbery.In reality, your brain is very soft. Composed of about 80 percent water, itsconsistency can be compared to soft butter, custard, or tofu—somewhere betweenraw egg whites and Jell-O. To protect your soft brain, it is housed in a reallyhard skull filled with fluid. Inside your skull are a number of bony edges andridges. Some of these ridges are as sharp as knives and in the event of a headinjury or trauma can damage your soft brain. Your brain was not meant for yourhead to be hitting soccer balls, playing tackle football, boxing, orparticipating in Ultimate Fighting Championships. Brain trauma is much morecommon than you think. Each year, two million new brain injuries are reported,and millions more go unreported. Brain injuries not only damage your brain, theycan ruin your body.If you think brain injury means only serious injuries like flying through thewindshield of a car or falling off the roof onto your head, you are wrong. Itdoesn’t have to be a “serious” injury to have serious consequences for your bodyand your health. After viewing more than 55,000 brain scans, it has become veryclear to me that what many people think of as mild trauma can have asignificantly negative effect on people’s brains and can significantly changetheir lives and their ability to look and feel their best. Many times, theseinjuries go unnoticed, in part because mental health professionals never look atbrain function.ACTION STEPTo keep your brain and body in tip-top shape, protect your brain from injury.Don’t hit soccer balls with your head or ride a bicycle, ski, or snowboardwithout a helmet that fits.Studies show that people who have suffered brain injuries, even mild ones, oftenexperience emotional, behavioral, or cognitive problems. When you have troublethinking or reasoning, you can’t make the best decisions for your body.Suffering a brain injury is also associated with a higher incidence ofalcoholism and drug abuse—both of which lead to premature aging, possible weightproblems, potentially devastating health conditions, and homelessness. Protectyour brain.PRINCIPLE #5The brain has only so much reserve. The more reserve you have, the healthier youare. The less reserve, the more vulnerable you are.Think about your family, friends, and coworkers. When there’s a crisis, do someof them completely fall apart—racing for the candy bowl, reaching for a pack ofcigarettes, or searching for solace in drugs and alcohol—while others manage tosoldier on with their lives in a healthy way? Have you ever wondered why thatis? I have. In my work, I have noticed that stressful events, such as the lossof a loved one, layoffs at work, or divorce can lead to depression, changes inweight, a lack of motivation to exercise, and bad daily habits in some peoplebut not in others.After looking at brain scans for nearly twenty years, I have come to believethat these differences have to do with a concept I call brain reserve. Brainreserve is the cushion of healthy brain function we have to deal with stressfulevents or injuries. The more reserve you have, the better you can cope with theunexpected. The less you have, the harder it is for you to handle tough timesand injuries, and the more likely you are to gobble up a bag of Oreo cookies orswig alcohol as a coping mechanism.Mary and Katie are identical twins. They share the same genes, the same parents,and the same upbringing. Yet their lives—and looks—are very different. Mary, whois very fit, is a successful journalist in a long-term happy marriage with threegreat children. Katie, who is overweight, barely finished high school, sufferedwith depression and a bad temper, and went from job to job and relationship torelationship. Their lives and looks are nothing alike.When I scanned them, Mary had a very healthy brain (Image 1.3), while Katie hadclear evidence of a brain injury, affecting her prefrontal cortex and temporallobes (Image 1.4). At first, when I talked with the twins together, Katie didn’tremember a head injury. Then Mary spoke up, saying, “Don’t you remember the timewhen we were ten years old and you fell off the top bunk bed onto your head? Yougot knocked out and we had to rush you to the hospital.” The injury likelycaused Katie to have less brain reserve, which may be why she was always morevulnerable to stress than her sister.Image 1.3[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_007_r1.jpg]Mary’s Healthy SPECT ScanImage 1.4[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_008_r1.jpg]Katie’s Brain-Damaged SPECT ScanAt conception, most of us have the same amount of brain reserve. From that pointon, though, many things can boost or reduce the level of reserve. For example,if your mother smoked marijuana and drank a lot of Jack Daniel’s while she waspregnant with you, it is likely that she lowered your level of brain reserve. Ifyou fell off the roof as a teenager, were the victim of domestic violence as achild, or abused drugs and alcohol in high school, you probably decreased yourown reserve. Basically, any behavior that harms the brain erodes your brain’sreserve.On the other hand, if your mother ate a healthy diet, took a daily multivitamin,and meditated every day, she probably pumped up your reserve. Your reservelikely got a boost if you were raised in a loving home, were exposed to a widevariety of learning as a child, and steered clear of drugs and alcohol.When you have ample brain reserve, it builds resilience and makes it easier foryou to deal with life’s unexpected twists and turns without turning to Ben &Jerry’s ice cream, alcohol, or drugs.PRINCIPLE #6Specific parts of your brain are involved in certain behaviors. Trouble inspecific parts of your brain tends to cause certain behavior problems.Understanding your brain can help you optimize it.Here’s a very simple crash course in the brain systems that play a major role inyour ability to get a body you love. All of these systems can influence yourbehavior and either help or hurt your ability to have your best body possible.ACTION STEPEnhance your reserve by maintaining a brain-healthy lifestyle.Prefrontal cortex (PFC) Think of the PFC as the CEO of your brain. Situated atthe front third of your brain, it acts like a supervisor for the rest of yourbrain and body. It is involved with attention, judgment, planning, impulsecontrol, follow-through, and empathy. Low activity in the PFC is linked to ashort attention span, impulsivity, a lack of clear goals, and procrastination.Alcohol lowers activity in the PFC, which is why people do such stupid thingswhen they get drunk.[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_009_r1.jpg]Anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG) I like to call the ACG the brain’s gear shifter.It runs lengthwise through the deep parts of the frontal lobes and allows us toshift our attention and be flexible and adaptable and to change when needed.When there is too much activity in this area, people tend to become stuck onnegative thoughts or actions; they tend to worry, hold grudges, and beoppositional or argumentative. It also may make them more vulnerable to beingobsessive or struggle with compulsive behaviors, and has been linked to eatingdisorders, such as anorexia.Deep limbic system (DLS) Lying near the center of the brain, the deep limbicsystem is involved in setting a person’s emotional tone. When this area is lessactive, people tend to be more positive and hopeful. When it is overactive,negativity can take over and lower motivation and drive, decrease self-esteem,and increase feelings of guilt and helplessness. Abnormalities in the limbicbrain have been associated with mood disorders.Basal ganglia Surrounding the deep limbic system, the basal ganglia are involvedwith integrating thoughts, feelings, and movements. This part of the brain isalso involved in setting a person’s anxiety level. When there is too muchactivity in the basal ganglia, people tend to struggle with anxiety and physicalstress symptoms, such as headaches, stomachaches, and muscle tension. With lowactivity here, people tend to lack motivation. This area is also involved withfeelings of pleasure and ecstasy. Cocaine works in this part of the brain.Cookies, cakes, and other treats also activate this area, according to afascinating new book called The End of Overeating by Dr. David Kessler, theformer commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.Temporal lobes The temporal lobes, located underneath your temples and behindyour eyes, are involved with language, short-term memory, mood stability, andtemper issues. They are part of the brain’s “what pathway,” because they helpyou recognize and name what things are. Trouble in the temporal lobes oftenleads to memory problems, mood instability, and temper problems.Parietal lobes The parietal lobes toward the top back part of the brain areinvolved with sensory processing and direction sense. The “where pathway” in thebrain, they help you know where things are in space, such as navigating your wayto the kitchen at night in the dark. The parietal lobes are one of the firstareas damaged by Alzheimer’s disease, which is why people with this conditiontend to get lost. They have also been implicated in eating disorders andbody-distortion syndromes, such as with anorexics who think they are fat.Occipital lobes Located at the back of the brain, the occipital lobes areinvolved with vision and visual processing.Cerebellum (CB) Located at the back-bottom part of the brain, the cerebellum isinvolved with physical coordination, thought coordination, and processing speed.There are large connections between the PFC and the cerebellum, which is whymany scientists think that the cerebellum is also associated with judgment andimpulse control. When there are problems in the cerebellum, people tend tostruggle with physical coordination, slow processing, and trouble learning.Alcohol is directly toxic to this part of the brain. Improving the cerebellumthrough coordination exercises can improve your prefrontal cortex and also helpyour judgment and your body.BRIEF BRAIN SYSTEM SUMMARY * Prefrontal cortex—judgment, forethought, planning, and impulse control * Anterior cingulate gyrus—shifting attention * Deep limbic system—sets emotional tone; involved with mood and bonding * Basal ganglia—integrates thoughts, feelings, and movements; involved with pleasure * Temporal lobes—memory, mood stability, and temper issues; “what pathway” * Parietal lobes—sensory processing and direction sense; “where pathway” * Occipital lobes—vision and visual processing * Cerebellum—motor coordination, thought coordination, processing speed, and judgmentPRINCIPLE #7Many things hurt the brain and make it harder for you to get and keep the bodyyou’ve always wanted. Many things help the brain and make it easier to get andkeep a body you love.You may be surprised to find out that common, everyday activities and behaviorsare often the source of brain drain, which makes it more of a challenge to havea body you love. Here are some common things that can hurt your brain and body.Many of these behaviors and activities will be mentioned again in the upcomingsolutions throughout this book. They are so vital to your brain and body healththat they are worth repeating.Physical trauma Severe injuries, concussions, and even mild trauma can affectevery aspect of your health and well-being.Drugs Marijuana, cocaine, ecstasy, methamphetamines, inhalants, and heroinseriously decrease brain function. Illegal drugs aren’t the only culprits.Abusing prescription medications, such as Vicodin, OxyContin, and Xanax, canalso hurt the brain. Drug abuse may make you feel better in the short term, butin the long term it may be a disaster for you, your looks, and your health.Drugs can drastically increase or decrease appetite, causing weight gain orweight loss, can sap your motivation and energy, and can lead to problems withyour skin, teeth, and hair. Search www.youtube.com [http://www.youtube.com] forbefore-and-after pictures of people on methamphetamines. The images will horrifyyou.Alcohol You don’t have to be a heavy drinker to hurt your brain. Even moderateamounts of alcohol can affect brain function. Studies show that people who drinkevery day have smaller brains than nondrinkers. When it comes to the brain, sizematters! Excess drinking lowers activity in the PFC, the area responsible forjudgment, forethought, and planning. That’s why people make such stupiddecisions when they have had a few too many—like stopping at the burger joint atthree o’clock in the morning when they’re trying to lose weight, havingunprotected sex with someone they just met at a bar, or driving when they’ve hadtoo much to drink.Obesity Fat stores toxic materials. The more fat you have on your body, theworse for your brain. Obesity doubles the risk for Alzheimer’s disease and hasbeen associated with decreased brain tissue.Hormonal abnormalities Abnormalities with your thyroid, estrogen, progesterone,testosterone, DHEA, or cortisol have all been implicated in both brain and bodyproblems.Malnutrition Your body renews all the cells in your body every few months. Thesenew cells draw on all the foods you consume, so you literally are what you eat.If you eat a junk-food diet, you will have a junk-food brain and a junk-foodbody. As we will see throughout the book, low levels of vitamins, especiallyvitamin D, minerals, and omega-3 fatty acids are also harmful to brain tissueand your body.Chronic inflammation in the body Chronic inflammation constricts blood flow tothe brain and heart and is now thought to be at the center of many diseases,including diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and Alzheimer’s disease.Low blood flow Blood flow is important because it carries oxygen, sugar,vitamins, and nutrients to the brain, and it gets rid of toxins. Anything thatdecreases blood flow to an organ, such as nicotine, too much caffeine, or a lackof exercise, prematurely ages it. Nowhere is this more true than for your brain.Chronic stress Difficult marriages, demanding jobs, and financial problems allcause chronic stress. When you constantly feel stressed, your brain tells yourbody to secrete higher amounts of the stress hormone cortisol. At elevatedlevels, cortisol increases your appetite and cravings for sugar, making you fat,bumps up your skin’s oil production, making you more prone to pimples, increasesmuscle tension and chronic pain, increases blood pressure, and raises your riskfor many serious health conditions.Sleep deprivation Getting less than six hours of sleep a night lowers overallbrain function and causes your brain to release hormones that increase yourappetite and cravings for high-sugar snacks like candy, cakes, and cookies.People who don’t get enough sleep tend to eat more calories and gain weight.Skimping on shut-eye also prematurely ages your skin and leaves you with dark,puffy circles under your eyes.Smoking Smoking constricts blood flow to the brain and all the organs in yourbody, including your skin. Most people can tell if a person is a smoker becausehis skin looks older than he is. I can tell you that their brains look that waytoo. Smoking is linked with many serious brain and health problems.Too much caffeine Drinking too much caffeinated coffee, tea, sodas, or energybeverages restricts blood flow to the brain, dehydrates the brain, body, andskin, and fools the brain into thinking it does not need to sleep, which are allbad things for your brain and body.Too much TV Watching too much TV can be harmful for your brain and body.Excessive TV watching has been associated with ADD in children and Alzheimer’sdisease in adults. Watching more than two hours of TV a day also significantlyincreases your risk for obesity.Violent video games Playing violent video games has led to an increased rate ofviolence and learning problems. With brain imaging, we see that video games workin the same area as cocaine, and kids and adults tend to get hooked on them likea drug. Spending more than two hours a day playing video games increases therisk of being overweight.Dehydration Your body consists of 70 percent water, and your brain is 80 percentwater. If you aren’t drinking enough water, you reduce brain function. You canalso expect to see thinner skin and more fine lines and wrinkles.Lack of exercise When you don’t exercise, you decrease blood flow to your brain,your body, and your genitals. It is well documented that a lack of physicalactivity can negatively affect your weight and overall health; it can alsodecrease sexual performance.Negative thinking We have conducted studies that show that focusing on thethings you don’t like lowers brain activity, causes your heart to beat faster,increases blood pressure, and negatively affects many systems in your body.Negative thinking can also sabotage your efforts to lose weight, start anexercise program, or quit smoking.Excessive texting and social networking on the Internet Neuroscientists haveshown that spending too much time texting and social networking leads toattention problems and may cause difficulties communicating face-to-face. Italso takes time away from physical activities, making you more prone to anuptick in your weight and a decrease in your general health.I developed a high school course about practical brain science to teachteenagers how to love and care for their brains. It is being used in fortystates and seven countries. Every time we talk about the things that hurt thebrain, some sarcastic student pipes up and asks, “How can I have any fun if Ihave to avoid all of these things?” Our response is simple. Who has more fun—theperson with the good brain or the person with the bad brain? No matter what yourage, the person who has more fun is the one with the healthy brain.The guy with the good brain is better at sticking to a diet and exercise plan,which keeps him fit and healthy and gives him lots of energy to play golf withpotential clients or go dancing with his wife. The guy with the bad brain mightimpulsively overeat, which leads to an expanding waistline, type 2 diabetes, andless enjoyment of life. Who is having more fun? The woman with the healthy brainis more likely to sleep well and wake up feeling and looking refreshed, whichgives her more confidence in her relationship and keeps her alert at work. Thewoman with lower brain function might skimp on snoozing, making her feel tired,which affects her job performance and prevents her from getting promoted. Italso makes her look tired, which lowers her self-esteem and causes her towithdraw from her romantic partner. Who is having more fun?I have great news for you! After years of analyzing brain scans and treatingpatients, I have discovered that there are many simple things you can do on adaily basis to boost your brain function. These daily prescriptions can also bethe key to a better body. The rest of the book will contain many ideas forenhancing brain function. Here are just a few things you can do to start.Protect your brain. Be conscious of how precious it is to you and your lovedones.Eat a good diet. Getting good nutrition is essential to good brain function andto a better body. A healthy diet includes lean protein, fruits, vegetables,nuts, and healthy fats like olive oil. Studies show that your brain works betterif you eat nine servings of fruits and vegetables a day.Take daily vitamins, minerals, and fish oil. Because most of us do not get allthe nutrients we need from the foods we eat, I recommend that everybody take adaily multivitamin and mineral supplement. I also urge people to take a dailyfish oil supplement, which can decrease inflammation and boost blood flow to thebrain and can help to combat depression, which has been associated with beingobese as well as many other health conditions.Exercise. When it comes to the brain, exercise acts like the fountain of youth.It boosts blood flow, increases the brain’s use of oxygen, and improves yourbrain’s response to stress. It is the single most important thing you can do tokeep your brain healthy and is one of the best ways to change your shape andimprove your mood, energy level, sexual performance, and overall health.Get enough sleep. Getting at least seven hours of sleep at night has been shownto help keep your brain functioning at optimal levels, keeps your appetite incheck, and helps your skin look younger.Meditate. Meditation activates the most thoughtful part of the brain, so you canmake better and more intelligent decisions.Relax. Learning how to counteract stress and calm your body helps your brainwork better, puts you in a better mood, reduces high blood pressure, andprotects you from disease.Practice gratitude. When you focus on what you love, your brain works better,you are more coordinated, and you feel better. Write down five things you aregrateful for every day. In just three weeks you will notice a significantpositive difference in your level of happiness.Have more sex. Safe sex, and especially sex in a loving committed relationship,is good medicine for your brain and your body, helping you reduce stress, boostimmunity, live longer, and more.Balance your hormones. Hormones, such as estrogen and testosterone, play a keyrole in maintaining the health and vitality of your brain and body.Treat mental disorders. A strong link between mental disorders and physicalillnesses and conditions has been well established. Treating mental conditionsimproves brain function and general health and well-being. As you can see, the way you live day to day is making your brain and bodyeither better or worse. Every day you need to ask yourself which brain and whichbody you want. Do you want the unhealthy brain that makes you struggle withweight problems, bad moods, and health conditions? Or do you want the healthybrain that makes it easier for you to look and feel your best? The choice isyours.PRINCIPLE #8Brain imaging gives great insight into healing the brain so you can have abetter body.In my practice, I do a lot of couples work. Rob and his wife came to see mebecause they weren’t getting along. Like many men, he thought he was fine andthat his wife just needed to relax and be more accepting. But when I looked athis fifty-six-year-old brain (Image 1.5), it looked like he was eighty yearsold. Surprised, I asked him what he was doing to hurt his brain.“Nothing,” he said.“Really?” I replied. “How much do you drink?”“Not very much.” (In my experience as a psychiatrist, I’ve learned that wheneverI get the answer “not very much,” I always have to ask the follow-up question.)“What’s not very much?”“Oh, maybe I have three or four drinks a day.”“Every day?”“Yeah, every day. But it is never a problem. I never get drunk.”His brain told me that it was a huge problem. Frightened by his scan, hefollowed my instructions to stay away from alcohol. Plus, he developed brainenvy and wanted a better brain, so he started on our brain-healthy program. Fourmonths later I did a follow-up scan, which looked much better. By then, hisrelationship with his wife was stronger than ever, and he felt like he wasthirty years younger.Brain imaging helped me figure out what was troubling Rob. It has also taught usthat when your brain looks old, your body often does, too. If you have decreasedblood flow to your brain, odds are you have decreased blood flow to your skin,making it dull and wrinkled. You also likely have decreased blood flow to yourorgans, making them less functional, and to your genitals, making sexualfunction and enjoyment much more difficult.Scanning the brain also helps us detect trouble within specific brain systems.For example, if you have poor PFC activity, chances are you are going to be moreimpulsive. Having high ACG activity means you are likely to be more compulsive.When your basal ganglia are overactive, you may be anxious and might eat to calmanxiety. With too much activity in your deep limbic system, you may feel sad andblue and might eat to medicate your sadness. If you have low cerebellaractivity, your processing speed is reduced and you will have trouble organizingand following through on your health plans.Image 1.5: Rob’s Alcohol-Damaged Brain as Shown in a SPECT Scan[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_010_r1.jpg]With the help of imaging, we have learned that conditions such as obesity,depression, anxiety, and addictions are not single or simple disorders and thatone treatment plan does not fit everyone. Imaging helps us understand individualpatients so that we can develop treatment plans specifically tailored to you.Depending on your individual situation, your brain may need to be stimulated orit may need to be calmed down. If we never looked at the brain, how would weknow the best way to treat you?ACTION STEPRemember that having a beautiful brain clearly connects to having a beautifulbody. So if you want to have a better body, ask yourself, What do I need to doto have a beautiful brain?Does this mean that you have to get a brain scan in order to change your brainand change your body? No! My books have been translated into more than thirtylanguages, and I realize that not everyone is able to get a brain scan. That’swhy I have developed a series of checklists to help you predict areas ofstrength and weakness in your brain. The Amen Clinics Abbreviated Brain SystemsQuestionnaire can be found in Appendix B and an extended version of the test isonline atwww.amenclinics.com/my-brain-health/online-tests-calculators/cyb-questionnaire[http://www.amenclinics.com/my-brain-health/online-tests-calculators/cyb-questionnaire].These questionnaires are the next best thing to getting a brain scan and theyhave helped hundreds of thousands of people better target treatment forthemselves. Of course, you should always talk to your own health carepractitioner before embarking on a treatment program.PRINCIPLE #9One prescription does not work for everyone—we are all unique and you need tounderstand how your own personal brain functions.Why would a doctor NEVER give a patient the diagnosis of chest pain? Because itis a symptom. It is too broad, and it has far too many causes to be considered adiagnosis or a single entity. What can cause chest pain? Many problems thatrange from the top of your head all the way to your pelvis, such as grief, panicattacks, hyperthyroidism, pneumonia, lung cancer, toxic fumes, a heart attack,abnormal heart rhythm, heart infection, rib injuries, indigestion, gastricreflux esophagitis, gallbladder stones, liver disease, kidney disease, andpancreatic cancer. Chest pain has many different possible causes and manypossible treatments.In the same way, what can cause obesity? Again, many different problems, such asa poor diet, no exercise, low thyroid, pituitary tumors, certain forms ofdepression, and some medications. Obesity can be caused by low activity in thebrain, causing people to eat impulsively, or by overall increased activity inthe brain, causing people to be anxious overeaters. Obesity can be caused byincreased anterior cingulate hyperactivity (the compulsive sort of obesity) orby increased deep limbic activity (the emotional kind of overeating) or acombination of these plus still other problems. There are many different typesof obesity.How does chest pain relate to obesity, skin problems, low energy, or depression?All of these problems are just symptoms, not causes. As such, many physiciansand patients view these common problems as single or simple disorders. Sincethey view these disorders in a simplistic way, they often have the idea that onetreatment fits everyone with a certain disorder. From a brain imagingperspective this attitude just does not make sense, as there is not one type ofobesity, stress response, anxiety, or depression. Understanding your individualvariability is critical to getting the right help, whether it is to help yourmood, your focus, your weight, or your overall health.PRINCIPLE #10Yes, you can change your brain and body!This is one of the most exciting breakthroughs in medicine. By targetingspecific interventions and lifestyle changes, you can improve your brain andyour body. Working to enhance your brain can be the answer if you’ve beenstruggling with diets your entire life, have never been able to stick with afitness routine, have been trying to quit smoking for years, or want to improveyour overall health.ACTION STEPTo get the body you want, you need to believe in your ability to change yourbrain.Think of Becca, the impulsive, obese woman I mentioned in the introduction tothis book. With low activity in her PFC, she wasn’t capable of controlling herimpulsive eating. It was only when treatment helped heal her brain that she wasfinally able to stick with a brain-healthy diet that allowed her to shed eightypounds.In my practice, I have seen this same pattern many times. When I boost someone’sPFC, they become more thoughtful, more reliable, more consistent, and betterable to follow through with a health plan. The same thing happens when weoptimize other areas of the brain. When we calm someone’s ACG, they become lessworried, less negative, and happier, and they get better sleep, which helps themget a body they love. Stabilizing the temporal lobes improves memory understress, which helps people remember what they need to do to reach their goals.Calming the basal ganglia makes people more relaxed and happier and results infewer headaches and digestive problems. Boosting the cerebellum helps peoplelearn better, makes them more apt to stick with a brain-healthy program, andimproves athletic performance—yes, it can even improve your batting average orfree-throw percentage.The Brain-Body SolutionBrain Robbers Brain Enhancers Ignoring the health of your brain Brain envy Braininjuries Brain protection Alcohol or drug abuse Multiple vitamins Excessivecaffeine Fish oil Smoking Deep breathing Excessive stress Relaxation practiceNegative thinking Gratitude Poor diet Healthy diet Lack of sleep, poor sleepHealthful, restful sleep Lack of exercise Exercise Environmental toxins Cleanenvironment Excessive TV New learning Excessive video games, cell phones,Meditation text messaging, computer time Dehydration Hydration Unbalancedhormones Balanced hormones Untreated mental disorders Mental health"},{"pageContent":"PART TWO[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_line_r1.jpg]CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR WEIGHT"},{"pageContent":"2THE CRAVING SOLUTIONUSE YOUR BRAIN TO INCREASE YOUR WILLPOWER AND CALM THE URGES THAT PREVENT YOUFROM ACHIEVING YOUR GOALSFrom craving is born grief, from craving is born fear. For one freed fromcraving, there’s no grief—so how fear?—BUDDHAI had been good all day. I had a protein-fruit shake for breakfast; a spinachsalad with turkey, blueberries, and walnuts for lunch; and sweet red bell pepperand apple slices with a little almond butter in the afternoon. All seemed rightwith my relationship with food, until I went to the Los Angeles Lakersbasketball game. I know how to eat when I am away from home. But this night mybrother bought a huge caramel apple with peanuts. I find that I now have totalfocus, not on the game, but on the sticky, gooey, sweet apple.Our grandfather was a candy maker and some of my best memories are standing on astool at the stove with him when I was a little boy making and then, of course,eating candy. Sweets have always been an emotional food for me. I am named aftermy grandfather, and he was my best friend growing up. Yet, I know how tired andfoggy a sugar load makes me feel twenty to thirty minutes later.Nonetheless, I am still totally focused on my brother’s caramel apple. I try notto look at it, but the urge to look, sort of like when you are next to a verypretty woman, nudges me in that direction. The memories of the sweet taste tryto hijack my brain. Dopamine, the pleasure and motivation brain chemical, pusheson an area in my brain called the nucleus accumbens, in the basal ganglia, whichdrives me toward asking for a piece, or heck, just getting up and buying anapple of my own. My prefrontal cortex, the brain’s brake, fights back. Eatingwell earlier that day has given me a good blood sugar level, which helps toprotect me against my urges. “I’ll be back,” I tell my brother, and I take abrief walk to reset my brain, let him finish the apple, and get my mind back onthe game.I come from a family of not only candy makers but also amazing cooks andoverweight people. My brother, whom I adore, is at least one hundred poundsoverweight. My grandfather, also overweight, had a heart attack in his sixties.If I was not focused on taking care of my brain, eating well, and exercise, Iwould, for sure, be overweight too. I am grateful for my neurosciencebackground, because it shows me how to maintain control over my urges.In this chapter, I will share with you what I have learned on how to have thewillpower to control your cravings to stay on track toward your goals of havinga healthy brain and a vibrant body.THE CIRCUITRY OF CONTROLUnderstanding the brain circuits of willpower and self-control is an importantstep in gaining mastery of your brain and body. There are centers in the brainresponsible for focus, judgment, and impulse control (the prefrontal cortex, inthe front third of the brain). There is also a pleasure and motivation center,called the nucleus accumbens, which is part of the basal ganglia, largestructures deep in the brain. The nucleus accumbens provides the passion andmotivation that is one of the main drivers of behavior. Additionally, the brainhas emotional memory centers that trigger behavior.According to my friend, addiction specialist Mark Laaser, Ph.D., “the arousaltemplate” in the emotional memory centers underlies many behaviors that get outof control. It is important to understand where you were and how old you werewhen you experienced your first pleasurable or arousing experience, such asstanding at the stove making fudge with my grandfather when I was four yearsold. This intense, emotionally pleasurable experience often lays the neuraltracks for later addictions, even if the experience happened as early as age twoor three. The first experience gets locked into the brain, and when you getolder, you seek to repeat the experience because it was the way you had theinitial arousal or pleasurable experience, like the first time you tasted fudge,had sex, fell in love, or used cocaine. Understanding the triggers for emotionaleating, smoking, or drinking can be very helpful to breaking addictions.Four neurotransmitters are also important to mention here. 1. Dopamine is often thought of as the pleasure, motivation, and drive chemical in the brain. Cocaine and stimulants like Ritalin boost dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is often associated with “saliency,” or the relative importance of something. At the moment I saw the caramel apple, it became much more salient or important in my mind. 2. Serotonin is thought of as the happy, antiworry, flexibility chemical. Most of the current antidepressants work on this neurotransmitter. When serotonin levels are low, people tend to suffer with anxiety, depression, and obsessive thinking. 3. GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that calms or helps to relax the brain. 4. Endorphins are the brain’s own natural pleasure and painkilling chemicals.The relative strength and weakness of each of these brain areas and each ofthese neurotransmitters goes a long way in determining how much control we haveover ourselves and how well we are able to stick to our plans, even aroundcaramel apples with peanuts at the Lakers game. They all work togethersymphonically to give us beautiful control over our lives. When they are out ofbalance, the noise can be very irritating.BRAIN AREAS INVOLVED WITH CRAVING AND WILLPOWER * Prefrontal cortex (PFC)—focus, judgment, and impulse control * Basal ganglia (nucleus accumbens)—pleasure and motivation center * Deep limbic (emotional memory centers)—triggers of behaviorBRAIN CHEMICALS INVOLVED WITH CRAVING AND WILLPOWER * Dopamine—motivation, saliency, drive, stimulant * Serotonin—happiness, antiworrying, calming * GABA—inhibitory, calming, relaxing * Endorphins—pleasure and painkilling propertiesIn a healthy brain, there is good judgment and emotional control by a competentprefrontal cortex (PFC), but also plenty of emotion and drive from the deeplimbic system to stay on track and get things done. Figure 2.1 shows a healthyself-control circuit. Healthy dopamine levels can drive passion, especially inthe context of good activity in the PFC, which acts as the reins or the brake soyou do not get out of control. Low levels of dopamine are associated withcertain problems that rob us of motivation, such as Parkinson’s disease, someforms of depression, and ADD. Addictions occur when the drive circuits hijackthe brain and take over control.When these chemicals and brain areas are in balance, we can be focused and goaloriented and have control over our cravings; we can walk away from caramelapples, chocolate cake, the bag of chips, French fries, and the myriad of otherunhealthy choices. When these chemicals and brain areas are troubled (Figure2.2), we often get off track and can do serious damage to ourselves.For example, having low activity in the PFC from a head injury, poor sleep,persistent drug or alcohol use, or inheriting ADD, makes it more likely you willhave impulse-control problems and poor self-supervision. Even though the goalwould be to stop drinking, hold the cigarettes, or maintain a healthy weight,you do not have the willpower (or the PFC power) to say no on a regular basis.Figure 2.1: Healthy Self-Control Circuit[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_011_r1.jpg]Figure 2.2: Addicted Passion Circuit[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_012_r1.jpg]In the healthy self-control circuit, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is strong andthere is good balance between the chemical dopamine and the basal ganglia (BG)and limbic or emotional circuits in the brain. In the addicted circuit, the PFCis weak, so it has little control over unbridled passions that drive behaviors.Addiction actually changes the brain in a negative way, making it harder toapply the brakes to harmful behaviors. In the nonaddicted brain, the PFC isconstantly assessing the value of incoming information and the appropriatenessof the planned response, applying the brakes or inhibitory control as needed. Inthe addicted brain, this control circuit becomes impaired through drug abuse,ADD, sleep deprivation, or a brain injury, losing much of its inhibitory powerover the circuits that drive response to stimuli deemed salient.I once treated a forty-two-year-old woman who failed six alcohol treatmentprograms. Her impulse control was virtually zero. She could not be given aprescription for any medication because she would take them all at once. When Iasked her initially if she had ever had a brain injury, she said no. But when Ipushed her, she remembered that she had been kicked in the head by a horse whenshe was ten years old. Her brain SPECT scan showed severe PFC damage (Image2.1). She had virtually no supervisor in her head. Comedian Dudley Moore oncesaid that, “The best car safety device is a rearview mirror with a cop in it.”The PFC acts like the cop in your head, and when it shows this level of damage,most people are in serious trouble. If I did not address the damaged PFC, shewould never be well. Giving her a medication to enhance PFC function was veryhelpful to her.If you have suffered an emotional trauma or you are under a lot of stress, thefeel-good chemicals, such as serotonin and GABA, may be depleted and youremotional or limbic brain may become excessively active, making you feel sad.This makes you eat or drink in an attempt to calm your limbic brain. MITresearchers demonstrated that simple carbohydrates, such as cookies or candy,boost serotonin levels. Many people unknowingly use these substances as a way tomedicate their underlying negative feelings. But as with cocaine, over timethese substances lose their effectiveness, and people engage in thecorresponding behaviors not so much for the high or good feelings as for theattempt to prevent the terrible feelings of withdrawal.Image 2.1: Brain Injury from Horse Kick[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_013_r1.jpg]Marked decreased PFCLikewise, if you have engaged in excessive amounts of pleasure or used cocaineor too many excessively pleasurable foods, your brain may have been exposed totoo much dopamine. Over time, it becomes numb to it, and it takes more and moreto get the same pleasurable response. Keeping these brain chemicals and systemsin balance is critical to maintaining focus and control over your cravings.Anything that decreases activity to the brain, especially to the PFC, robs youof good judgment and self-control. Head injuries are obvious. Protect yourbrain. Poor sleep has been associated with overall decreased brain activity.Strive to get at least seven hours a night (see Chapter 10[Amen_9780307463593_epub_c10_r1.htm], “The Sleep Solution”).REGAINING CONTROL—BALANCE YOUR BRAIN SYSTEMS1. Boost Your Prefrontal CortexTo gain control over willpower and cravings, it is critical to strengthen yourPFC. To do so: * Treat any PFC problems that may exist, such as ADD, toxic exposure, or brain trauma. (See Chapter 15 [Amen_9780307463593_epub_c15_r1.htm], “The Brain Health Solution.”) * Get good sleep—at least seven hours, more is better—to maintain adequate PFC blood flow. * Maintain a healthy blood sugar level by eating frequent smaller meals. In a 2007 article by Matthew Gailliot and Roy Baumeister, the authors outline the critical nature of blood sugar levels and self-control. They write that self-control failures are more likely to occur when blood sugar is low. Low blood sugar levels can make you feel hungry, irritable, or anxious—all of which make you more likely to make poor choices. Many everyday behaviors can cause dips in blood sugar levels, including drinking alcohol, skipping meals, and consuming sugary snacks or beverages, which causes an initial spike in blood sugar then a crash about thirty minutes later. * Keeping glucose levels even throughout the day improves self-control. Several studies have examined the relationship between glucose and smoking cessation, and the majority of these studies have found that healthy glucose levels increase the likelihood of successfully quitting smoking. Coping with stress requires self-control because it requires that people make a concerted effort to control their attention, thoughts, and emotions. People with healthy blood sugar levels are therefore also able to manage stress more effectively than others. Maintaining your blood sugar levels with complex carbohydrates, lean protein, and healthy fat will significantly cut down on your cravings. * Exercise to boost blood flow to the brain. Table tennis is a great choice. One study from Japan showed that ten minutes of table tennis boosted activity in the PFC. * Practice meditation—numerous studies have found that it boosts activity and blood flow to the PFC. * Create focused, written goals. The PFC is involved in planning and forethought. It needs clear direction. I have my patients do an exercise called the One-Page Miracle (OPM) because it makes such a dramatic difference in the lives of those who practice it. Here are the steps: On a piece of paper, write down the specific goals you have for your life, including your health, relationships, work, and money. There’s a reason why your OPM includes more than just your physical goals. As you will learn throughout this book, your relationships, career, and financial situation—and the stress they can cause—all affect your body and your willpower. Take your time with this exercise. Keep the paper with you so you can jot down ideas and goals as they come to you. After you complete your initial draft, place it somewhere where you are sure to see it every day, such as on the refrigerator, on your bathroom mirror, or on your desk at work. This way, on a daily basis, you will be focusing on what’s important to you. When you are focused on what you want, it makes it much easier to match your behavior to make it happen. Ask yourself every day, Is my behavior today getting me what I want? Your mind is powerful and it makes happen what it sees. Focus and meditate on what you want. You will find that your willpower goes up dramatically. Here is an example.TAMARA’S ONE-PAGE MIRACLEWhat Do I Want for My Life?RELATIONSHIPS—to be connected to those I loveSpouse/Significant other: to maintain a close, kind, caring, loving partnershipwith my husband. I want him to know how much I care about him.Family: to be a firm, kind, positive, predictable presence in my children’slives. I want to help them develop into happy, responsible people. To continueto keep close contact with my parents, to provide support and love.Friends: to take time to maintain and nurture my relationships with my siblingsWORK—to be my best at work, while maintaining a balanced life. Specifically, formy work activities to focus on taking care of my current projects, doingactivities targeted at obtaining new clients, and giving back to the communityby doing some charity work each month. I will focus on my goals at work and notget distracted by things not directly related to my goals.MONEY—to be responsible and thoughtful and help our resources growShort-term: to be thoughtful of how our money is spent, to ensure it is directlyrelated to our family’s and my needs and goalsLong-term: to save 10 percent of everything I earn. I pay myself and my familybefore other things. I’ll put this money away each month in a pension plan forretirement.HEALTH—to be the healthiest person I can beWeight: to lose thirty pounds so my body mass index (BMI) will be in the normalrangeFitness: to exercise for at least thirty minutes three days a week and to starttaking martial arts lessons. I promise no head injuries here.Nutrition: to eat breakfast every day so I don’t get really hungry untillunchtime. To prepare a sack lunch at least three days a week so I’m not temptedto go to the fast-food restaurant across from work. To eliminate diet sodas andreduce the amount of sugar I eat. To take a multivitamin and fish oil every day.Physical health: to lower my blood pressure and cholesterol levelsEmotional health: to meditate for ten minutes every day to help me calm stressMY ONE-PAGE MIRACLEWhat Do I Want for My Life?[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_014_r1.jpg]Along the same lines, having a clearly written set of rules also helps to boostthe PFC.For example, one of my rules is to stay away from mayonnaise. I like it, but notenough to make it worth the calories. Here is an example of some helpful rules. * I treat my body with respect. * I read my One-Page Miracle daily. * I look for ways to optimize my nutrition. * I eat breakfast every day. * I eat frequently enough during the day so that I do not get hungry or a low blood sugar level. * I get seven to eight hours of sleep at night whenever possible. * I exercise three or four times a week. * I do not poison my body with toxins such as nicotine or my mind with persistent negative thoughts. * If I break a rule, I will not dwell on it and give up on the rest of the rules. I will be kind and forgiving.No more than twelve rules. I once had a patient with obsessive-compulsivedisorder who made up 108 rules.Willpower is like a muscle. The more you use it, the stronger it gets. This iswhy good parenting is essential to helping children develop self-control. If wegave in to our six-year-old every time she wanted something, we would raise aspoiled, demanding child. By saying no, I teach her to be able to say no toherself. To develop willpower, you need to do the same thing for yourself.Practice saying no to the things that are not good for you, and over time, youwill find it easier to do.Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a very important concept. When nerve cellconnections become strengthened, they are said to be potentiated. Whenever welearn something new, our brains make new connections. At first the connectionsare weak, which is why we do not remember new things unless we practice themover time. Practicing a behavior, such as saying no to the caramel apple,actually strengthens the willpower circuits in the brain. LTP occurs when nervecell circuits are strengthened, practiced, and behaviors become almostautomatic. Whenever you give in to the caramel apple, it weakens willpower andmakes it more likely you will not have any. You have to practice willpower, andyour brain will make it easier for you.ACTION STEPTo improve your willpower, you have to practice it.2. Balance the Pleasure Centers and Calm AnxietyAs mentioned, the basal ganglia are large structures deep in the brain. They areinvolved with pleasure and motivation. When the basal ganglia are healthy, wefeel happy and motivated. When they work too hard, we can be anxious or overlydriven. When they are low in activity, we may feel low or unmotivated. Here aresome ways to balance your pleasure centers. * Be careful with too much technology. In Dr. Archibald Hart’s book Thrilled to Death, he suggests that the evolution of technology in our society is wearing out our brain’s pleasure centers. I believe it is having a very negative effect on our relationships and our bodies. With the onslaught of video games, text messaging, cell phones, Facebook, and Twitter, as well as online dating, pornography, and gambling, our pleasure centers are being worn out. Pretty soon, we will not be able to feel anything at all. As I mentioned above, our pleasure centers deep within the brain operate on a chemical called dopamine, which is the same chemical that cocaine stimulates and one of the main chemicals of new love. Whenever a little bit of dopamine is released, we feel pleasure. If dopamine is released too often or too strongly, we become desensitized to it and it takes more and more excitement to get the same response. More and more, I see people coming into our offices complaining about their partner or children being addicted to new technology. Christina and Harold were having big problems in their relationship. Christina wanted more time with Harold, but he spent hours hooked on his video games. He became angry when she asked him to stop playing so much, and when he told her to stop nagging him, she moved out. Subsequently Harold became depressed and came to see us. This couple played out the same pattern I have seen with many other types of addictions—she didn’t want to leave, but she didn’t know what else to do. ACTION STEP Work to keep your pleasure centers healthy. Be careful with the high-excitement activities, limit video games, and stop ALWAYS being on your computer. As a society, we have unleashed massive amounts of technology on the population with virtually no study on what it all does to developing brains or to our families. We need to be more careful. Stop it. In a study sponsored by Hewlett-Packard, people who were addicted to their cell phones or their computers lost ten IQ points over a year. Find natural sources of pleasure, such as nature, a great conversation, and long, loving eye contact. * Use relaxation techniques to help balance and calm this part of the brain. * Engage in meaningful activities that give you motivation without putting you in overdrive. * Use supplements to calm anxiety and balance the pleasure centers. These include vitamin B6, magnesium, and N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC). See Appendix C, “The Supplement Solution,” for more information.3. Calm Your Brain’s Emotional Centers and Eliminate Your TriggersEmotional stresses and depression decrease willpower. If you have unresolvedemotional issues, it is essential to understand and work through them, otherwisethey will hijack your brain. Here are six tips to help get your emotions undercontrol. * Talk about what bothers you to someone close or a therapist. Talking about issues can help get them out of your head. If there has been past trauma, one of the psychotherapies I often recommend is called EMDR (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing). It is fast and very powerful. You can learn more about it at www.emdria.org [http://www.emdria.org]. * When you are upset, journal rather than eat, drink, or light up. Studies show that writing down your bothersome thoughts and feelings can have a healing effect. * Write down five things you are grateful for every day. Our research suggests that focusing on gratitude helps to calm the deep limbic or emotional areas of the brain and enhances the judgment centers. * Exercise. It not only boosts PFC activity, it also calms the limbic brain by boosting serotonin, the feel-good chemical. * Correct the ANTs, or automatic negative thoughts (see Chapter 13 [Amen_9780307463593_epub_c13_r1.htm], “The ANT Solution”). You do not have to believe every thought that goes through your head. Whenever you feel sad, mad, or nervous, write down the thoughts that are bothering you and talk back to them. * Try the supplement SAMe to help calm this area of the brain and boost the PFC. See Appendix C, “The Supplement Solution,” for more information.REGAINING CONTROL—BALANCE YOUR BRAIN CHEMISTRYBeyond brain-system balancing, it is also important to balance the chemicalsthat drive behavior.1. DopamineDopamine is the chemical of motivation, saliency, drive, and stimulation. It isthe chemical that both cocaine and Ritalin stimulate in the brain. Low levelsare associated with low motivation, low energy, poor concentration,impulse-control problems, some forms of depression, Parkinson’s disease, andADD. You can boost dopamine levels by: * Doing intense physical exercise * Eating a protein-rich meal * Working at a job or organization that is exciting or deeply meaningful * Being wary of excitement-seeking behaviors, which may wear out your pleasure centers, deplete dopamine, and make you feel numb or unable to feel pleasure * Taking natural supplements, such as L-tyrosine or SAMe. See Appendix C, “The Supplement Solution,” for more information.2. SerotoninSerotonin is the chemical of feeling peaceful, happy, and flexible. When it islow, people suffer with some forms of depression, along with anxiety, obsessivethinking (such as about the caramel apple), or compulsive behaviors. You boostserotonin by * Engaging in physical exercise, which allows the serotonin precursor L-tryptophan, a relatively small molecule, greater access to the brain. * Practicing willpower. Giving in to obsessive behaviors solidifies them in the brain and establishes nerve tracks to make them more automatic. Practicing willpower actually does the opposite and has been found to change the brain, much like serotonin medications, such as Prozac. * Taking supplements, such as 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), L-tryptophan, inositol, or St. John’s wort. Good scientific evidence supports 5-HTP’s usefulness for helping people lose weight. Inositol is a natural chemical found in the brain that is reported to help neurons use serotonin more efficiently. St. John’s wort comes from the flowers of the Saint-John’s-wort plant and seems to increase serotonin availability in the brain. See Appendix C, “The Supplement Solution,” for more information.3. GABAGABA, or gamma-aminobutyric acid, is an amino acid that helps to regulate brainexcitability and calms overfiring in the brain. GABA and GABA enhancers, such asthe anticonvulsant gabapentin and L-theanine (found in green tea), function toinhibit the excessive firing of neurons, which results in a feeling of calm andmore self-control. Low levels of GABA have been found in many psychiatricdisorders, including anxiety and some forms of depression. Rather than overeator drink or use drugs to calm your anxiety, natural ways to boost GABA may help.I often recommend GABA supplements. * Glycine is also an inhibitory neurotransmitter, which means it calms brain activity. It is an important protein in the brain, and recent studies have demonstrated its effectiveness in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder and in reducing pain. * L-theanine, one of the components of green tea, has also been shown to boost GABA, while at the same time helping with concentration and mental alertness.4. EndorphinsEndorphins are chemicals linked to feeling pleasure and eliminating pain. Theyare the body’s own natural morphine or heroinlike substances. These substancesare heavily involved in addiction and the loss of control. Natural ways to boostendorphins include the following: * Exercise, which is why some people feel a runner’s high when they exercise intensely * Acupuncture, which has been found to be effective for a number of pain syndromes. Its positive painkilling effect can be blocked by using endorphin-blocking drugs, such as naltrexone. * Hypnosis, which has been shown to be helpful in pain syndromesThe craving solution involves balancing the brain areas and chemistry ofpleasure and control. It involves using your PFC as the master controller andmaking sure there is a bridle on the pleasure and emotional centers to help themguide you to where you want to go.The Craving SolutionWillpower Robbers Willpower Boosters Any brain problems Brain health Braintrauma Focusing on brain protection Poor sleep Adequate sleep (at least sevenhours) Low blood sugar Frequent small meals with at least some protein tomaintain healthy blood sugar Poor diet Enriched diet Alcohol Freedom fromalcohol ADHD Clearly focused, written goals (see One-Page Miracle) Some forms ofdepression Journaling when sad or anxious Anxiety Meditation for relaxation andto boost the PFC Negative thinking Killing the ANTs (automatic negativethoughts) Focusing on problems and fears Gratitude practice Bad habits, givingin Practicing willpower Too much pleasure Being careful with too much pleasureor too much technology Artificial forms of pleasure Finding natural sources ofpleasure Negative or meaningless behaviors Engaging in positive and meaningfulactivities Social isolation Social support Being in denial about problemsEffectively treating any brain problems Lack of exercise Exercise Denial offeelings Understanding emotional triggers Decreasing cravings with B6,magnesium, and NAC Boosting dopamine (L-tyrosine, DL-phenylalanine, SAMe)Boosting serotonin (5-HTP, L-tryptophan, inositol, St. John’s wort) BoostingGABA (GABA, glycine, L-theanine) Boosting endorphins (exercise, acupuncture,hypnosis)"},{"pageContent":"3THE WEIGHT SOLUTIONUSE YOUR BRAIN TO ACHIEVE YOUR OPTIMAL WEIGHTI am what I ate … and I’m frightened.—BILL COSBYRebecca, forty-four, couldn’t stop herself from eating, especially at night. Shethought about food constantly throughout the day. The thoughts haunted her, eventhough she did not want to have them. Over eight years, she had gained nearlyten pounds per year and was now eighty pounds overweight despite trying manydiets and going to multiple weight-loss clinics. She hated how she looked andwas thoroughly disgusted with herself. The Atkins diet—very high protein and lowcarbohydrate—made her irritable and emotional. Diet pills made her anxious. Shefelt as though she needed a glass—or two or three—of alcohol at night to settleher worries, but the extra calories were certainly not helping her weightproblem. She came to our clinics because she was starting to have maritalproblems, in part because her husband was upset about her weight, and alsobecause she had trouble letting go of hurts, held grudges, and worriedincessantly.Rick, thirty-seven, was growing larger by the year. At five feet eight inchestall, he was over 250 pounds. As a highly successful salesman for a large WestCoast liquor company, he was always on the run and attended many fancy dinnersand sporting events. His wife was starting to complain about his weight, whichmade him angry. Why doesn’t she just love me the way I am? he thought, eventhough she married him when he was nearly seventy-five pounds lighter a decadeearlier. Growing up, Rick had problems with focus and impulsivity. He barelyfinished his first year of college when he found a job in the liquor industrythat he loved. Rick brought his son to our clinic for school-related problems,much like the problems Rick had experienced in school. After he saw how muchbetter his son was on treatment, Rick decided to get an evaluation as well.Cherrie, fifty-two, had been bulimic as a teenager, and the hidden truth for herwas that she still had bouts of bingeing and purging, especially during times ofstress. Cherrie was chronically thirty pounds overweight and hated how shelooked. She would not undress in front of her husband and found that she oftenpicked on him as a way to not have to have sex or be seen naked. Her ownthoughts were extremely negative, and she vacillated between being obsessiveabout her work and housekeeping to being overwhelmed and disorganized. Cherriegrew up in an alcoholic home and had trouble talking about her feelings andtrusting others.She had tried a number of diet programs without success, until the fen-phencraze of the 1990s. On fen-phen, a combination of medications that increased theneurotransmitters serotonin (fenfluramine) and dopamine (phentermine), she didamazingly well, losing the unwanted pounds and feeling more emotionally stablethan at any other time in her life. When the fen-phen was pulled from the marketbecause fenfluramine was associated with a deadly illness called pulmonaryhypertension, Cherrie relapsed and went back to her emotional roller coaster andlack of success at losing and keeping off weight. Cherrie came to see us on theadvice of her sister, whom we were seeing for issues of depression.Jerry, sixty-two, was baffled by his weight problem. As a child, he was fit,athletic, energetic, and loved being outside in the sun. He was raised inSouthern California and made the most of the beach, surfing, and volleyball. Inhis thirties, still in great shape, he got a new job in the Northwest as asupervisor at Boeing. He loved his job, the new responsibility, and the income,but over time he noticed that particularly in the winter, his mood and energywould lag, and he started to gain weight despite trying to work out. Over time,he retained more of the weight he gained in the winter than what he could manageto lose in the summer. His weight gain and loss was like a yo-yo that was losingsteam. He also complained of many more aches and pains. He came to our Northwestclinic to get a handle on his moods and weight.Connie, twenty-eight, seemed to be constantly eating. She munched on the way towork, at work, on the way home, and late into the night. She found that when shetried to go without eating for a few hours, she felt anxious and nervous. Sheoften felt a sense of dread and was often waiting for something bad to happen.She frequently complained of an irritable bowel, sore muscles, and headaches.Marijuana helped to calm her down in college, but it also gave her the munchies,so she used it only sporadically. Her weight continued to creep up; when shereached 165 pounds on her five-foot-two-inch frame, she knew something needed tobe done. She came to our clinic because her family had complained about herlevel of anxiety and irritability.Camille, sixty-four, could not keep on any weight. Two years before seeing us,she had gone through a difficult divorce, and the year before, her mother died.Camille had lost twenty-five pounds during that time and now none of her clothesfit. She had felt as if her whole system was in hyperdrive. She had troublesleeping, her thoughts seemed to race, she had diarrhea, and both her heart rateand blood pressure were up. She came to our clinics to help calm her mind andbody and put back on some weight.ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT EVERYONERebecca, Rick, Cherrie, Jerry, Connie, and Camille all struggled with theirweight. Yet they all had very different clinical presentations and brainpatterns.Rebecca was a compulsive overeater. She couldn’t stop thinking about food. Herbrain SPECT study showed too much activity in the front part of her brain (in anarea called the anterior cingulate gyrus), likely due to low levels of theneurotransmitter serotonin. On a rational weight-loss program plus a regimen of5-HTP to boost serotonin levels in her brain, she lost weight, felt muchhappier, was more relaxed, and got along better with her husband.Rick was an impulsive overeater. He also had trouble controlling his behavior.His brain SPECT scan showed too little activity in his prefrontal cortex, likelydue to low dopamine levels, so he had trouble supervising his own behavior. Likehis son, he was also diagnosed with ADD. On treatment to boost his dopaminelevels, he felt more focused and in better control of his impulses. Over thefirst year, he lost thirty-five pounds and was getting along better with hiswife and child.Cherrie was an impulsive-compulsive overeater. Cherrie had features of bothimpulsivity (the bulimia) and compulsivity (manifested by the repetitivenegative thoughts and rigid behavior). Her brain SPECT scan showed areas in herprefrontal cortex that were both overactive and underactive, likely due to lowserotonin and dopamine levels. In my research, I discovered that this pattern iscommon in children and grandchildren of alcoholics. On treatment to raise bothserotonin and dopamine levels, she felt much more emotionally balanced andconsistently lost weight.Jerry was a SAD or emotional overeater. He struggled with his mood and weight,but only after he moved to a place where he got little sunlight. He sufferedfrom seasonal affective disorder (SAD), which has been associated with lowvitamin D levels, and his brain SPECT study showed increased activity in hisemotional or limbic brain and decreased activity in his PFC. On a combination ofvitamin D, bright light therapy, and SAMe, he did much better, experienced fewerpain symptoms, and returned to his premove weight over a two-year period.Connie was an anxious overeater. She medicated her underlying anxiety with food.Her brain SPECT study showed increased activity in her basal ganglia, an areaoften associated with anxiety. By calming her anxiety with relaxation techniquesand a combination of B6, magnesium, and GABA, she stopped the constant grazing,felt more relaxed and more in control of her emotions and behavior. She losttwenty pounds over the next year and noticed a boost in her energy.Camille was on adrenaline overload. This was causing her to waste away. Thechronic intense stress from her divorce and the recent loss of her mother resether brain and body to an overactive state. Her brain SPECT study showed overallincreased activity in the deep centers of her brain, a pattern on SPECT we callthe diamond pattern because of the hyperactivity of the different structures wesee. On treatments to calm her brain—including a form of psychotherapy calledEMDR for people who have been emotionally traumatized, plus phosphatidylserine,B6, magnesium, and GABA—she was able to sleep, quiet her mind, and come back toa normal weight.WHY MOST WEIGHT-MANAGEMENT APPROACHES DO NOT WORKWeight-loss pills, clinics, books, programs, and cookbooks are everywhere youlook. Why are there so many different approaches to weight loss and weightmanagement? Why do they generally have such poor results? Why are peopleconstantly searching for the next idea and the next fix? The problem with thewhole notion of weight management is that one treatment, one program, or onemethod is advertised to work for everyone. Based on our brain imaging work withtens of thousands of patients, the premise for most weight-management programsthat promote a single path or prescription is ridiculous. First, you need toknow about your own individual brain and then target the interventions in a waythat fits your own specific needs.Looking at the descriptions below and taking the brief questionnaire in AppendixB, plus the extended online version atwww.amenclinics.com/my-brain-health/online-tests-calculators/cyb-questionnaire[http://www.amenclinics.com/my-brain-health/online-tests-calculators/cyb-questionnaire],you will get an idea about how your own brain works and what specific needs youmay have. Then, based on your answers, you will be better able to target thetreatment interventions. Of course, you should do this in consultation with yourown health-care provider.SUMMARY OF THE AMEN CLINICS: SIX TYPES OF WEIGHT-MANAGEMENT ISSUESType 1: The Compulsive OvereaterPeople with this type have trouble shifting their attention and tend to getstuck on thoughts of food or compulsive eating behaviors. They may also getstuck on anxious or depressing thoughts. The basic mechanism of this type isthat they tend to get stuck or locked into one course of action. They tend tohave trouble seeing options and want to have things their way. They strugglewith cognitive inflexibility. This type is also associated with worry, holdinggrudges, and having problems with oppositional or argumentative behavior.Nighttime-eating syndrome, where people tend to gorge at night and not be hungryearly in the day, usually fits this pattern.The most common brain SPECT finding in this type is increased anterior cingulategyrus activity, which is most commonly caused by low brain serotonin levels.High-protein diets, diet pills, and stimulants, such as Ritalin, usually makethis type worse. Interventions to boost serotonin in the brain are generally themost helpful. From a supplement standpoint (see Appendix C), 5-HTP,L-tryptophan, St. John’s wort, and the B vitamin inositol are helpful, as arethe serotonin-enhancing medications, such as Prozac, Zoloft, and Lexapro. Infact, 5-HTP has good scientific evidence that it helps with weight loss, and inmy experience, I have found that it works best for this type.ACTION STEPBehavioral interventions that boost serotonin to help compulsive overeaters: * Exercise to allow more of the serotonin precursor, L-tryptophan, to get into the brain. * If you get a negative or food-oriented thought in your head more than three times, get up and go do something to distract yourself. * Make a list of ten things you can do instead of eating so you can distract yourself. * People with this type always do better with choices, rather than edicts. Do not tell them where you are going to eat or what they are going to eat; give them choices. * Avoid automatically opposing others or saying no, even to yourself. * If you have trouble sleeping, try a glass of warm milk with a teaspoon of vanilla and a few drops of stevia.Type 2: The Impulsive OvereaterPeople with this type struggle with impulsivity and trouble controlling theirbehavior, even though nearly every day they intend to eat well. “I am going tostart my diet tomorrow” is their common mantra. This type results from toolittle activity in the brain’s PFC. The PFC acts as the brain’s supervisor. Ithelps with executive functions, such as attention span, forethought, impulsecontrol, organization, motivation, and planning. When the PFC is underactive,people complain of being inattentive, distracted, bored, off task, andimpulsive. This type is often seen in conjunction with ADD, which is associatedwith long-standing issues of short attention span, distractibility,disorganization, restlessness, and impulsivity.Research published in the July 2008 issue of Pediatrics found that children andadolescents with ADD who do not currently take medications are at 1.5 times therisk of being overweight than non-ADD children. These individuals are morelikely to be impulsive overeaters. On the other hand, those taking medicationfor ADD had 1.6 times more risk of being underweight compared to childrenwithout ADD, which is a side effect of their medication, which decreasesappetite.Impulsive overeaters may also be the result of some form of toxic exposure, anear-drowning accident, a brain injury to the front part of the brain, or abrain infection, such as chronic fatigue syndrome. The most common brain SPECTfinding in this type is decreased activity in the PFC, which is most commonlyassociated with low brain dopamine levels. High-carbohydrate diets andserotonin-enhancing medications, such as Prozac, Zoloft, or Lexapro, orsupplements, such as 5-HTP, usually make this type worse. Interventions to boostdopamine in the brain are generally the most helpful. From a supplementstandpoint, green tea and rhodiola are helpful, as are stimulant medications,such as phentermine, Adderall, and Ritalin, which are commonly used to treatADD.ACTION STEPBehavioral interventions that boost dopamine to help impulsive overeaters: * Exercise, which helps increase blood flow and dopamine in the brain—especially doing an exercise you love. * Clear focus—make a list of weight and health goals displayed where you can see it every day. * Outside supervision—someone you trust checking in with you on a regular basis to help you stay focused. * Avoid impulsively saying yes to offers for more food or drink and practice saying, “No, thank you, I’m full.”Type 3: The Impulsive-Compulsive OvereaterPeople with this type have a combination of both impulsive and compulsivefeatures. The brain SPECT scans tend to show low activity in the PFC (associatedwith impulsivity, likely due to low dopamine levels) and high activity in theanterior cingulate gyrus (associated with compulsivity and low serotoninlevels). This pattern is common in the children or grandchildren of alcoholics.People with this mixed type tend to have done very well emotionally andbehaviorally on the fen-phen combination, which raised both dopamine andserotonin in the brain.Using serotonin or dopamine interventions by themselves usually makes theproblem worse. For example, using a serotonin medication or supplement helps tocalm the compulsions but makes the impulsivity worse. Using a dopaminemedication or supplement helps to lessen the impulsivity but increases thecompulsive behaviors. Treatments to raise dopamine and serotonin together, witheither a combination of supplements, such as green tea and 5-HTP, ormedications, such as Prozac and Ritalin, have worked the best in my experience.ACTION STEPBehavioral interventions that boost both serotonin and dopamine to helpimpulsive-compulsive overeaters: * Exercise. * Set goals. * Avoid automatically opposing others or saying no, even to yourself. * Avoid impulsively saying yes. * Have options. * Distract yourself if you get a thought stuck in your head.Type 4: The SAD or Emotional OvereaterPeople with this type often eat to medicate underlying feelings of boredom,loneliness, or depression. Their symptoms can range from winter blues to mildchronic sadness (termed dysthymia) to more serious depressions. Other symptomsmay include a loss of interest in usually pleasurable activities; decreasedlibido; periods of crying; feelings of guilt, helplessness, hopelessness, orworthlessness; sleep and appetite changes; low energy levels; suicidal thoughts;and low self-esteem. The SPECT findings that correlate with this type aremarkedly increased activity in the deep limbic areas of the brain and decreasedPFC activity.When this type occurs in the winter, it is usually in more northern climates,where there is often a deficiency in sunlight and vitamin D levels. Low vitaminD levels have been associated with depression, memory problems, obesity, heartdisease, and immune suppression. In recent years, there is an increase invitamin D deficiencies even in southern and western states in the summer. Thereare two reasons for this: People are wearing sunscreen more than ever, so theyare not being exposed to the sun even when they are outside, and they arespending more and more time indoors on their computers or watching TV. Someresearchers believe nearly half of the U.S. population suffers from a vitamin Ddeficiency. I screen all of my patients for it by ordering a 25-hydroxy vitaminD level. To treat SAD or emotional overeaters, check vitamin D levels andcorrect them when low by taking a vitamin D supplement. Bright light therapy maybe helpful to correct vitamin D problems, help with mood states, and help peoplelose weight.There is evidence that bright light therapy might also enhance the effectivenessof physical activity for weight loss. In studies, it significantly reduced thebinge-eating episodes in people with bulimia and is an effective treatment forSAD. Research studies have also shown it to be more effective than Prozac forthese patients. Using bright light therapy in the workplace was effective inimproving mood, energy, alertness, and productivity.ACTION STEPBehavioral interventions that boost mood to help SAD or emotional overeaters: * Exercise to increase blood flow and multiple neurotransmitters in the brain. * Kill the ANTs (automatic negative thoughts) that steal your happiness. * Write down five things you are grateful for every day (this has been shown to increase your level of happiness in just three weeks). * Volunteer to help others, which helps to get you outside of yourself and less focused on your own internal problems. * Surround yourself with great smells, such as lavender. * Try melatonin to help you sleep. * Work to improve your relationships.Also, make sure to check your DHEA blood levels. DHEA is a master hormone thathas been found to be low in many people with depression and obesity.Supplementing with DHEA has good scientific evidence that it is helpful forweight loss in certain patients. Another helpful treatment for emotionalovereaters is the natural supplement SAMe, in dosages of 400 to 1,600 mg. Becareful with SAMe if you have ever experienced a manic episode, and take itearly in the day as it has energizing properties and may interfere with sleep. Ilike the medication Wellbutrin for this type, which has been shown to haveweight-reducing properties.Type 5: The Anxious OvereaterPeople with this type tend to use food to medicate underlying feelings ofanxiety, tension, nervousness, and fear. They tend to feel uncomfortable intheir own skin. They may be plagued by feelings of panic, fear, and self-doubt,and suffer physical symptoms of anxiety as well, such as muscle tension, nailbiting, headaches, abdominal pain, heart palpitations, shortness of breath, andsore muscles. It is as if they have an overload of tension and emotion. Peoplewith this type tend to predict the worst and look to the future with fear. Theymay be excessively shy, easily startled, and freeze in emotionally chargedsituations. The SPECT finding in this type is increased activity in the basalganglia, which is commonly caused by low levels of the calming neurotransmitterGABA.Interventions to boost GABA, by using B6, magnesium, and GABA, are generally themost helpful. From a medication standpoint, the anticonvulsant Topamax hasstrong evidence that it is helpful for weight loss, and in my experience, it isespecially helpful for this type. Relaxation therapies can also be helpful tocalm this part of the brain.ACTION STEPBehavioral interventions that boost GABA and calm the brain to help anxiousovereaters: * Exercise. * Try relaxation exercises, such as: * [images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_L02_r1.jpg] meditation * [images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_L02_r1.jpg] prayer * [images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_L02_r1.jpg] hypnosis * [images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_L02_r1.jpg] deep diaphragmatic breathing exercises * [images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_L02_r1.jpg] hand-warming techniques * Kill the anxious ANTs. * For sleep, try self-hypnosis, kava kava, or valerian root.Type 6: The Adrenaline-Overload AnorexicFor most people, excess stress leads to weight gain. But some people havetrouble keeping a healthy weight on their bodies when they’re under a lot ofstress. The stress causes them to go into an emotional overload state, and theystart to waste away. Typically, these people’s thoughts often go too fast, theytend to have trouble sleeping, they may experience diarrhea, and they oftencomplain of memory problems. Their brain SPECT studies show overall increasedactivity, especially in the deep centers of their brains, similar to what I seewith post-traumatic stress syndrome.Treatments to calm the brain are generally the most helpful, including EMDR—eyemovement desensitization and reprocessing (see www.emdria.org[http://www.emdria.org] for more information)—hypnosis, and cognitive therapy.The supplements phosphatidylserine (PS), B6, magnesium, and GABA are alsohelpful to calm the stress. There are not any current medications I use to helppeople gain weight. Any medications I prescribe depend on what other factors maybe contributing to the current stress.ACTION STEPBehavioral interventions—the same as those recommended for anxiousovereaters—that boost GABA and calm the brain to help adrenaline overloadanorexics: * Exercise. * Try relaxation exercises, such as: * [images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_L02_r1.jpg] meditation * [images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_L02_r1.jpg] prayer * [images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_L02_r1.jpg] hypnosis * [images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_L02_r1.jpg] deep diaphragmatic breathing * [images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_L02_r1.jpg] hand-warming techniques * Kill the anxious ANTs. * For sleep, try self-hypnosis, kava kava, or valerian root.Knowing your brain type is essential to the Weight Solution and getting theright help for yourself. For any weight solution to be effective, it must becentered on your particular brain, your particular problems, and your particularneeds. Any program that gives you a one-size-fits-all approach is destined tofail.Do You Have More Than One Type?Having more than one type is common, and it just means that you may need acombination of interventions. Type 3 Impulsive-Compulsive Overeaters is actuallya combination of Type 1 Compulsive Overeater and Type 2 Impulsive Overeater. Itis common to have Type 1 mixed with Type 4 SAD or emotional overeater or withType 5 Anxious Overeater. In those cases, we may mix 5-HTP for Type 1 with SAMefor Type 4 or GABA with Type 5. Again, it is always smart to discuss theseoptions with your health-care provider. If he or she does not know much aboutnatural treatments, consult a naturopath or a physician trained in integrativemedicine or natural treatments.WEIGHT CONTINUES TO BE A RISING PROBLEMOur poor eating habits are making us one of the fattest nations on the planet.More than half of American women have a waistline greater than thirty-fiveinches, while half of their male counterparts measure in at more than fortyinches around the belly. Obesity is becoming an epidemic with a devastatingimpact on our health and our brains. Research from 2005 and 2006 indicates thatfully one-third of adult men and more than 35 percent of adult women in theUnited States are obese. About six million people are considered to have morbidobesity, which is defined as being at least 100 pounds overweight. Obesity isdetermined by a person’s body mass index (BMI), which is a ratio of their weightand height.Body Mass Index (BMI) Categories * Underweight: <18.5 * Normal weight: 18.5–24.9 * Overweight: 25–29.9 * Obese: 30 or higher * Morbid obesity: 40 or higherSources: National Institutes of Health and American Society for Metabolic &Bariatric SurgeryHere are the steps to calculate your BMI: weight in pounds × 703/height ininches2 1. Multiply your weight in pounds times 703. 2. Multiply your height (in inches) times your height (in inches). 3. Divide the number in step 1 by the number in step 2 to get your BMI.For example: If you weigh 148 pounds and you are five feet six inches tall, thecalculation would look like this: 1. 148 pounds × 703 = 104,044 2. 66 × 66 = 4,356 3. 104,044/4,356 = 23.9 BMI (normal)Or, if you weigh 260 pounds and you are five feet six inches tall, thecalculation would look like this: 1. 260 pounds × 703 = 182,780 2. 66 × 66 = 4,356 3. 3.182,780/4,356 = 42.0 BMI (morbidly obese)Morbid obesity is associated with more than thirty medical conditions anddiseases, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure, aswell as brain-related conditions, such as stroke, chronic headaches, sleepapnea, and Alzheimer’s disease. These diseases can devastate a person’s life.Diabetes is a disease that occurs when blood sugar levels in the body aren’tright. The high blood sugar level causes small blood vessels in the body tobecome fragile and break, which can lead to terrible consequences. I have afriend who is diabetic, and due to the disease, he has lost his sight and hashad to have both of his legs amputated. If you have a disease such as diabetesor heart disease, it is even more important for you to eat right in order toprevent or delay progression of the disease. Obesity is also associated withsignificantly longer hospital stays for comparable conditions. Ultimately,obesity puts you at increased risk for death. A review of several long-termstudies on obesity and longevity found that the risk of death rises as weightincreases above normal weights.People who are obese or overweight also have smaller brains than lean people,according to new research in the journal Human Brain Mapping. Scientists usedbrain scans to determine the amount of brain tissue in ninety-four people overthe age of seventy. They found that obese individuals had 8 percent less braintissue and their brains looked sixteen years older than the brains of people atnormal weights. Overweight people had 4 percent less brain tissue and theirbrains appeared eight years older.The loss of tissue occurred in several important areas of the brain. In obesepeople, losses affected the frontal lobes, anterior cingulate gyrus,hippocampus, temporal lobes, and basal ganglia. In the overweight crowd, brainloss occurred in the basal ganglia, corona radiata (white matter that speedscommunication between different areas of the brain), and parietal lobe. Overall,the loss of brain tissue puts overweight and obese people at increased risk forAlzheimer’s disease, dementia, and other brain disorders.As if we needed more proof that gaining weight is bad for our health,researchers at the University of Pittsburgh used brain imaging to examine theeffects of increases in BMI on forty-eight otherwise healthy postmenopausalwomen. They found that women whose BMI went up following menopause were morelikely to have a reduction in gray matter.What is even worse is that our kids are becoming overweight or obese at analarming rate. Studies show that a whopping 34 percent of children and teens areeither currently overweight or at risk of becoming overweight, and more than 16percent of kids ages two to nineteen are obese. Among younger children, obesityis skyrocketing. This is putting our children at greater risk for a variety ofdiseases and conditions that negatively affect brain function.If you are overweight or love someone who is overweight, it is important tothink of this as a life-threatening problem. Mind-set here is critical. Someanxiety, or brain alarm, is often necessary for people to take the actionsneeded to be healthy. I think it is also important to treat obesity like achronic disease, because it is. And we need to think about being on healthydiets for life, not just for a few months to fit into a wedding dress or a suitfor a special occasion.When it comes to the brain, size matters. A smaller brain means reduced brainfunction, which can affect every aspect of your life—your relationships, yourcareer, and your mood.FAT IS MORE THAN JUST FATI remember the first day of my anatomy dissection lab in medical school like itwas yesterday. Some of my fellow students had weak stomachs and had to get themop. Even before the vomit, there was a smell in the room unlike anything mostof us had ever experienced. Some of the students were nervous. I was excited andfascinated. Anatomy and neuroanatomy were my favorite subjects. Irma was thewoman who donated her cadaver so that my colleagues and I could become skilledphysicians. Irma and I spent many, many hours together. I remember when I cutthrough her skin how amazed I was to see the bright yellow, greasy layer of fatbelow. I had no idea at the time that fat was anything more than, well, fat.Since that day in the fall of 1978, fat has taken on a whole new meaning. Thefat on your body is not just an energy-storage reservoir; it is a living,biologically active, toxin-storing, hormone-producing factory, and more fat isdefinitely not better.Fat produces the hormone leptin, which usually turns off your appetite.Unfortunately, when people are overweight, the brain becomes sensitized toleptin, and it no longer has a positive effect on curbing hunger cravings. Fatcells also produce the hormone adiponectin, which also helps to turn offappetite and increases fat burning. As fat stores increase, adiponectin levelsdrop, and the process of burning fat as fuel actually becomes less efficient. Inaddition, fat cells pump out immune-system chemicals called cytokines, whichincrease the risk of cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, and high bloodsugar, diabetes, and low-level chronic inflammation.Inflammation is at the heart of many chronic illnesses. The level of fat on yourbody, especially abdominal fat, is also directly linked with higher totalcholesterol and LDL (bad) cholesterol and lower HDL (good) cholesterol.Together, insulin resistance, high blood sugar, excess abdominal fat,unfavorable cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and high blood pressureconstitute the metabolic syndrome, a major risk factor for heart disease,stroke, depression, and Alzheimer’s disease.In recent years, it has been found that fat stores toxic materials, so that themore fat on your body, the more toxins you have. The more animal fat you eat,the more toxins you have as well. Also, fat tends to increase the amount ofestrogen in your body, especially if you are male. Fat cells store estrogen.They contain an enzyme that converts several other steroid hormones to estrogen.Having increased estrogen makes it difficult to lose fat. Estrogen binds with areceptor on the surface of fat cells, which promotes the growth and division offat cells, especially in your butt and thighs.THIRTEEN THINGS ALL OF US SHOULD DO TO MAINTAIN A HEALTHY WEIGHT 1. Know your type(s). 2. Get a complete physical and focus on having healthy vitamin D, DHEA, and thyroid levels. 3. Know your BMI and caloric need numbers. 4. Know the approximate number of calories you eat a day by keeping a food journal and calorie log and work on getting “high-quality calories in versus high-quality energy out.” 5. Exercise four or five times a week, starting with walking fast and light strength training. 6. Optimize your hormone levels. 7. Get great sleep. 8. Use simple stress-management techniques. 9. Stop believing every negative thought that goes through your brain. 10. Use hypnosis to help keep you slim. 11. Take supplements to keep your brain healthy. 12. Using the advice in this book, keep your brain young and active in order to lose ten pounds. 13. Take control of your weight and do not let other people make you fat.1. Know your type(s). From the more than 55,000 scans we have performed at theAmen Clinics, it is clear that not everyone with the same problem, such asobesity or depression, has the same brain pattern. The descriptions above andthe questionnaire in Appendix B or atwww.amenclinics.com/my-brain-health/online-tests-calculators/cyb-questionnaire[http://www.amenclinics.com/my-brain-health/online-tests-calculators/cyb-questionnaire]will help you know your type or types.2. Get a complete physical. Not the five-minute type, but a real physical whereyou spend time talking to your doctor about your health. Medical problems, suchas being on certain medications or having a low or suboptimal thyroid, vitaminD, DHEA, or testosterone levels, or being depressed or anxious, can seriouslysabotage any attempt to lose, maintain, or be at your ideal weight.3. Know your BMI and daily caloric need numbers. This is critical. The basicprinciple of weight loss or weight gain is about energy balance. The BMI formulais given above. The Harris Benedict Formula is commonly used to help peopleunderstand the approximate number of calories a day they need to maintain theircurrent weight. This is a key number for you to understand, because it willserve as a guide to help you lose or gain weight.To find out your basic calorie needs without any exercise, your resting basalmetabolic rate (BMR), fill out the following equation on yourself:Women: 655 + (4.35 × weight in pounds) + (4.7 × height in inches)—(4.7 × age inyears)Men: 66 + (6.23 × weight in pounds) + (12.7 × height in inches)—(6.8 × age inyears)Take that number and multiply it by the appropriate number below.1.2—if you are sedentary (little or no exercise)1.375—if you are lightly active (light exercise/sports 1 to 3 days/week)1.55—if you are moderately active (moderate exercise/sports 3 to 5 days/week)1.75—if you are very active (hard exercise/sports 6 or 7 days a week)1.9—if you are extra active (very hard exercise/sports and a physical job orstrength training twice a day)The total is the number of calories a day you need to maintain your currentweight. Put this number where you can see it. This number helps to give youcontrol over your health.4. Know the approximate number of calories you eat a day by keeping a foodjournal and calorie log and work on getting “ high-quality calories in versushigh-quality energy out.” People lie to themselves constantly about their foodintake. They underestimate the number of calories they eat and subsequently,through ignorance or denial, ruin their brains and their bodies. I am notsuggesting you count every calorie for the rest of your life, but I amsuggesting that you use your brain to become educated about the calories andnutrition you put in your body, and then take control over them.ACTION STEPRemember that it is the little decisions about food that you make every day thatoften determine whether you are fat or trim. See the list of “100 Ways to LeaveYour Blubber” for tips on cutting calories atwww.amenclinics.com/my-brain-health/brain-health-club/100-ways-to-leave-your-blubber/[http://www.amenclinics.com/my-brain-health/brain-health-club/100-ways-to-leave-your-blubber/].New York State recently passed a law making restaurants put the calories oftheir offerings on the menu. I love it! Why? It allows people to be informedconsumers, to use their thoughtful brains rather than just impulsively orderingsomething because it looks good when their blood sugar and willpower are low.For example, when you look at the calories and fat in a Caesar salad, yourealize it is not a healthy choice. Or, take one Cinnabon; it has 730 calories.My daily caloric intake needed to maintain my current weight is about 2,100calories. If I have one Cinnabon a day, it fills more than 33 percent of mycaloric needs with virtually no nutrition. Just knowing this fact will make mereach for a banana.Likewise, knowing the calorie content of what you eat can help you make smalladjustments that will make a big difference. Take having a Venti PeppermintWhite Chocolate Mocha at Starbucks. If you have them make it with whole milk andwhipped cream, it is 700 calories! If you get a tall size of the same drink withnonfat milk and no whipped cream, it is only 320 calories, less than half.To really know your calorie intake without cheating, keep a food journal whereyou write down absolutely everything you put in your mouth. Get a small weightscale and measure your portions of food. I can promise you that your idea of aserving will almost certainly vary substantially from what the food manufacturerputs on the label. Some of you may be thinking this is too much work. Yet Ipromise you it is worth the effort.In our high school course Making a Good Brain Great, we have a lesson onnutrition. We teach the students that people gain weight when they eat morecalories than they burn.Calories in versus calories out.Calories in = what you eat.Calories out = level of exercise.The average male teen burns about 2,500 calories a day, while the average femaleteen burns about 2,000 calories a day. If you eat more calories than you burn,you gain weight. If you eat fewer calories than you burn, you lose weight.Calories are key.1 pound (lb) = 3,500 calories (cals)1 lb weight gain = eat 3,500 cals more than burn1 lb weight loss = eat 3,500 cals less than burnFor example, if you eat 500 extra cals a day (about one cheeseburger), you willgain a pound a weekYou need to know approximately how many calories you eat on a regular basis,otherwise they can seriously get away from you.YOU CANNOT CHANGE WHAT YOU DO NOT MEASURE.In one of the laboratory exercises for the high school course, we have studentswrite down the foods they typically order from their favorite fast-foodrestaurants and then have them go online to www.chowbaby.com[http://www.chowbaby.com] to find the nutritional value of those meals. Moststudents are shocked by what they are putting in their bodies. When myson-in-law Jesse did this exercise (he helped me develop the course and did hismaster’s thesis showing that it is highly effective in helping teens developpro-social attitudes), he found out that for lunch alone he was eating almost100 percent of his daily allotted calories. This knowledge encouraged him tomake some simple adjustments that have helped him stay within his allottedcalories and maintain a healthier weight.You typically hear doctors talk about “calories in” versus “calories out.” To bebrain healthy, we must significantly upgrade this concept and think of “high-quality calories in” versus “ high-quality energy out.” For example, having300 calories from Red Vines licorice or 730 calories from one Cinnabon is notthe same as 500 calories from a piece of wild Alaskan Copper River Salmon,grilled veggies, and a sweet potato. I consider Red Vines and Cinnabonantinutrition, while the wild salmon, veggies, and a sweet potato are nutritionpowerhouses. Likewise, “calories out” can come through taking supplements, suchas caffeine or ephedra, to rev your metabolism and increase your stress hormonesand anxiety and insomnia, or they can come from coordination exercises that burncalories and boost brain function. Aim for “high-quality calories in” versus“high-quality energy out”!5. Exercise four or five times a week. One of the best exercises is walkingfast. Walk like you are late, with periodic one-minute bursts of high-intensitywalking or running. Some studies have shown that exercise can be as effective asantidepressant medications. The usual side effects of exercise are more energyand a healthier body. See Chapter 5 [Amen_9780307463593_epub_c05_r1.htm], “TheExercise Solution,” for more information. Coordination exercises, such as danceor table tennis, are also great for your brain and body.6. Optimize your hormone levels. Much more information on this topic is found inChapter 7 [Amen_9780307463593_epub_c07_r1.htm], “The Hormone Solution.” For now,let’s look at three essential weight-management hormones: insulin, leptin, andghrelin.Insulin is produced by the pancreas and is considered a storage hormone. It getsstimulated primarily in response to a rise in blood sugar. Its function is totake nutrients from the bloodstream and store them in the body’s cells. Insulinincreases the uptake of glucose into the liver and muscles for storage as asubstance called glycogen, and it also helps store excess glucose in fat cells.Since insulin is a storage hormone and not a mobilizing hormone, it also stopsthe body from mobilizing and using fat as a fuel source. Too much insulin stopsfat burning. To maintain a healthy weight and burn fat adequately, it isimportant to keep insulin properly balanced.ACTION STEPFour tips to keep your insulin levels balanced: * Have frequent small meals throughout the day rather than a few large meals. Larger meals tend to cause a greater insulin response. * Control your carbohydrate intake. The more carbohydrates in a meal, the greater the insulin response. * Emphasize more low-density carbohydrates and fewer high-density ones. The low-density carbohydrates, such as broccoli, cauliflower, green beans, and carrots, have more fiber and fewer carbohydrates than high-density carbohydrates, such as bread, pasta, rice, and cereals. * Glucose-balancing agents—such as chromium, alpha-lipoic acid, cinnamon, and ginseng—may help. Chromium is a micronutrient (meaning that the human body doesn’t need very much of it) that enhances the action of insulin and is involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fat, and protein. Alpha-lipoic acid is an antioxidant that may lower blood glucose levels.ACTION STEPWays to boost leptin levels without causing leptin resistance:• Improve your sleeping habits.• Avoid excess sugar and bad fats.• Exercise regularly.• Take supplements, such as melatonin and omega-3 fatty acids.Leptin is a hormone produced by fat cells that tells your body it is full. Themore fat cells you have on your body, the more leptin you tend to have. Leptinworks on the brain’s hypothalamus to reduce your appetite when fat stores arehigh. When fat stores are low, such as after dieting, leptin levels arediminished, which causes a spike in appetite and sabotages weight loss. Leptinhas been described as an antistarvation hormone because low levels lead toincreased hunger. In the past, leptin was described as an antiobesity hormone,but researchers have since discovered that obese people, who produce largeamounts of leptin, are often resistant to its effect in a similar way that somepeople are resistant to insulin. Leptin resistance may also result from overeating, as the hypothalamus becomes desensitized to its effects so you neverknow when you are full. Poor sleep also decreases leptin levels, which isinteresting because many overweight people suffer from sleep apnea, a conditionwhere people snore loudly, stop breathing frequently during sleep, and arechronically tired during the day. The lack of oxygen from sleep apnea is likelyinvolved in lowering leptin levels. Poor sleep also impairs melatoninproduction, which can also lower leptin levels.Ghrelin is a hormone secreted by the stomach that tells your brain you arehungry. I think of ghrelin as gremlins that force you to eat. In one study, whenpeople were given ghrelin injections and then offered a buffet meal, they ate 30percent more than they normally would! One of the main reasons it is thoughtthat people tend to put weight back on after a diet is that ghrelin levelsincrease during dieting. This results in uncontrolled hunger and subsequentovereating. Naturally reducing ghrelin, keeping the gremlins away, is essentialto maintaining a healthy weight. The substance peptide YY3–36 or PYY3–36, whichis also produced in the stomach, blunts the effects of ghrelin. PYY3–36 isincreased by having frequent small meals.ACTION STEPTo stimulate the secretion of PYY3–36 in your stomach and help keep hunger atbay, eat with the acronym CRON (calorie restricted but optimally nutritious) inmind. For example, eating a 500-calorie spinach-and-salmon salad will keep youfeeling full much longer than a 700-calorie cinnamon roll.ACTION STEPPay attention to Chapter 13 [Amen_9780307463593_epub_c13_r1.htm], “The ANTSolution,” to clean up the ANTs that are stealing your happiness and increasingyour waistline.7. Get great sleep. For all of the brain types, being sleep deprived ultimatelywill make you fat and less intelligent. See Chapter 10[Amen_9780307463593_epub_c10_r1.htm] for more information.8. Use simple stress-management techniques. Chronic, unrelenting stress upsetseverything in your body, from your weight to your immune system to your memory.See Chapter 11 [Amen_9780307463593_epub_c11_r1.htm] for more information.9. Stop believing every negative thought that goes through your brain. Peoplewith weight issues typically are infested with a lot of ANTs. See Chapter 13[Amen_9780307463593_epub_c13_r1.htm] for more information. For many, thesenegative thinking patterns are one of the primary sources of worry, stress,depression, and anxiety, which often contribute to overeating or erratic eating.A former professional football player who came to see us as part of a brainimaging study I am conducting on retired NFL athletes was six feet two inchesand struggled at a weight of 365 pounds. When I asked him about it, he said, “Ihave no control over food.” I asked, “Is that really true?” He said, “No, itisn’t really true.” I told him, “By saying or thinking that thought, I have nocontrol over food, you just gave yourself permission to have no control overfood and eat whatever you want.”In the same way, I was recently at dinner with a friend who was morbidly obeseand ordered a large plate of nachos smothered in cheese. His wife was trying toget him on a healthy food plan, but he said, “I don’t like any of that rabbitfood.” I responded by asking him what he meant. He said, “You know, all thosevegetables and fruits.” I told him that his way of thinking was giving himselfpermission to eat anything he wanted, and was going to kill him. “I don’t likepaying taxes,” I said, “but I do it because I know there are consequences if Idon’t.” Pay attention to your thoughts. They can help keep you on track towardyour goals or completely give you permission to fail.10. Use hypnosis to help keep you slim. When I was an intern at the Walter ReedArmy Medical Center in Washington, D.C., one of my favorite teachers was thenoted psychologist Harold Wain. He was the president of the American Society forClinical Hypnosis and the chief of our Consultation-Liaison Service, the groupof psychologists and psychiatrists who helped patients on medical wards who hadpsychiatric issues. Harold was a wonderful teacher. When he would use hypnosisfor weight loss, he would help patients take their time to savor their food anddrink. To patients in a trance he could describe drinking a cup of coffee insuch a seductive way that it made them think drinking was as pleasurable as sex.He pointed out that people typically inhale their food and take little time toactually enjoy it. By using a simple, descriptive hypnotic technique, he couldget people to slow down, feel full faster, and really start to enjoy the energythey put into their bodies.I have personally been using hypnosis in my practice with patients for thirtyyears. To use it effectively for weight loss, it needs to be used in combinationwith a responsible weight-management program. There is also significantscientific evidence that suggests that hypnosis can be a powerful aid to weightloss. In one scientific review comparing a series of weight-loss studies withand without hypnosis, it was found that adding hypnosis significantly improvedweight loss. The average post-treatment weight loss was 6.0 pounds withouthypnosis and 11.83 pounds with hypnosis, nearly double. In a further follow-upperiod, the mean weight loss was 6.03 pounds without hypnosis and 14.88 poundswith hypnosis. The benefits of hypnosis increased over time.Hypnosis can help people learn positive eating behaviors and create healthylong-term patterns of food intake. Some common hypnotic suggestions I give topatients include “feel full faster … eat more slowly … savor and enjoy each biteof your food … visualize yourself at your ideal weight and body … see thebehaviors you need to do to get the body you want.”In addition, hypnosis has been found to be helpful to decrease stress, anxiety,insomnia, pain, and negative thinking patterns, all conditions that increase thepotential for weight gain. Brain imaging studies have also shown that hypnosisboosts overall blood flow to the brain, which, as you will see below, helps tokeep the brain young and may help you burn more calories. On our website(www.amenclinics.com [http://www.amenclinics.com]), you can find a series ofhypnosis CDs and downloads that I have created for you.11. Take supplements to keep your brain healthy. Taking nutritional supplementscan make a big difference in your efforts to reach your ideal weight. To all ofmy patients, I recommend taking a daily multiple vitamin/mineral supplement.Studies have reported that they help prevent chronic illness. In addition,people with weight-management issues often are not eating healthy diets and havevitamin and nutrient deficiencies.I also recommend fish oil. Increased blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids fromfish or fish oil have been recently linked to a lower incidence of obesity.Research results reported in the British Journal of Nutrition indicate thatoverweight and obese people have blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids that arelower than those of people with a healthy weight.A considerable number of studies already support the benefits of the omega-3fatty acids for heart, skin, eye, joint, brain, and mood health. In thisparticular study, researchers recruited 124 people of varying weights: 21 wereclassified as having a healthy weight, according to their body mass index (BMI);40 were classed as overweight; and 63 were obese. People who consumed omega-3supplements were excluded from the study. Blood samples were taken after thesubjects fasted for at least ten hours. Researchers reported an inverserelationship between total omega-3 blood levels with BMI, the subjects’ waistsize, and their hip circumference. The researchers suggested that a diet rich inomega-3 fatty acids or omega-3 supplementation may play an important role inpreventing weight gain and improving weight loss when used in combination with astructured weight-loss program.Results from animal studies suggested that omega-3s may increase the productionof heat by burning energy (thermogenesis). Another study suggested a role ofomega-3s in boosting the feeling of fullness after a meal, and may help regulatethe levels of hunger hormones like ghrelin and leptin, which impact appetite.In addition, I recommend a craving supplement containing chromium picolinate,N-acetyl-cysteine, L-glutamine, and vitamin D and DHEA if levels of these arelow. (See more about these supplements in Appendix C, “The Supplement Solution,”and on our website: www.amenclinics.com [http://www.amenclinics.com].) Then,depending on your brain type, choose the supplements, if needed or desired, thatbest fit your brain. See the table at the end of this chapter.I only consider recommending medication or surgery for weight loss if nothingelse is working. People who have mild to moderate weight issues are often ableto get a handle on the problem through natural means, but sometimesmedications—especially those targeted to your type—or even surgery may be neededto save your life. The medications for each type are listed in the Summary Tableof the Six Types of Weight-Management Issues at the end of this chapter. Obesityis a life-threatening problem, and sometimes lifesaving means are necessary. Myfriend Anthony Davis, a College Football Hall of Fame running back from USC, hadbariatric surgery with great success.There are several new weight-loss treatments currently being studied. Forexample, scientists are working on developing drug treatments that targetabdominal fat. Another breakthrough technique involves brain surgery to treatobesity. Called deep brain stimulation, it delivers electricity to specificareas of the brain and has proved successful in eliminating or reducing tremorsand tics in people with epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, and other neurologicalconditions. It has also been found to be useful in resistant depression andobsessive-compulsive disorder.12. Using the advice in this book, keep your brain young and active in order tolose ten pounds. The brain uses 20 to 30 percent of the calories you consumeeach day. It is the major energy consumer in your body. Based on tens ofthousands of brain scans that we have performed at the Amen Clinics, we haveseen that the brain becomes dramatically less active as we age. In Image 3.1,you can see that the activity of the PFC peaks around age ten and then becomesless and less active. This happens in part because nerve cells are being wrappedwith the white fatty substance myelin, which helps them work more efficiently,and brain connections that are not being used are pruned away. But this alsohappens because later in life there is overall decreased blood flow to thebrain, which contributes to aging. This finding has also been reported by otherresearchers and may be one of the reasons why people need fewer calories withage.Image 3.1 Prefrontal Cortex by Age[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_015_r1.jpg]This graph shows increased activity in the prefrontal cortex early in life, butdramatic decreased activity after age ten over the life span.One way to lose ten pounds is to keep your brain young, healthy, and alwayschallenged. By encouraging a youthful activity pattern and continually learningnew things, you will keep your brain active, which will help you better manageyour weight. So, learning a language or a musical instrument, playing bridge, orlearning a new dance step all contribute to keeping your brain young.13. Take control of your weight and do not let other people make you fat. Myheritage is Lebanese. Like many cultures, Lebanese gatherings are often centeredaround and focused on food—usually tasty, high-calorie foods such as baklava,butter cookies, and rice fried in butter topped with tomatoes, green beans, andlamb. Too often, well-meaning, sweet people sabotage your efforts to maintain ahealthy weight. “Eat this … try that… this is so amazing, you need to try just abite … you are too skinny, eat more … here, have more or we will have to throwit away.” Your own lack of focus, anxiety, and desire to please others allowsthese people to contribute to your early demise.I see these interactions nearly everywhere I go. We were in Subway for lunch ona recent vacation and the store had run out of the little toys that come withthe children’s meal for our five-year-old. The clerk asked me if he couldreplace it with a cookie. I said, “No. Let’s do an apple.”I was once at a store with a friend who asked me if I wanted an ice cream cone.I told her, “No.”She said, “Are you sure?”“As sure as I can be,” I replied.When she came back, she had an ice cream cone for me.“What part of no did you not understand?”“The ice cream was on sale. I would get two cones for five dollars,” she saidinnocently.“Toss it or give it to the poor,” I replied with a smile. “I get to have controlover what goes into my body.”She didn’t believe I would turn it down, but never disrespected my wishes againwhen it came to food.Other people, at home, at parties, or in restaurants, often sabotage our effortsat health. Most of the times the behavior is innocent. Some of the time, it isbecause they feel uncomfortable being overweight and they would like you to jointhem. It is critical, if you want to be healthy, for you to be in control. Hereare five ways to deal with people who, unknowingly or not, try to make you fat: 1. Be focused on your health goals. Before you go to a restaurant, party, or family gathering, know the approximate number of calories you want to spend on yourself. 2. Practice saying no, nicely at first: “No, thank you, I am full.” 3. If the other person persists, add a little more detail: “No, thank you, I am on a special program, and it is really working for me.” 4. If the other person is still persistent, pause, look them in the eye, and smile. Say something like, “Why do you want me to eat more than I want to?” That usually gets their attention. I was recently at the house of a friend who was very persistent. She asked me six times if I wanted something to eat. When I finally smiled and said, “Why do you want me to eat more than I want to?” she replied, “I am sorry, I just wanted to help.” She then realized she was not being helpful, but irritating, and stopped. 5. Be persistent. We train other people how to treat us. When we just give in to their offers for food—so that they can feel helpful and important, or so we do not feel anxious—we train them to invade our health. When we are firm and kind, most people get the message and respect our wishes. Additionally, it may give you an opportunity to tell them about the exciting new information you are learning in this book.IS FAT CONTAGIOUS?A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine shows that one of thestrongest associations in the spread of obesity is whom you spend time with. Itis not a new virus that has been discovered, but the social and behavioralinfluence of your friends. The study was conducted using information gatheredfrom more than twelve thousand people who had participated in amultigenerational heart study collected from 1971 to 2003. The study showed thatif a subject had a friend who became obese, he had a 57 percent higher chance ofbecoming obese himself. That went up to a 171 percent higher chance if bothfriends identified each other as very close friends. Friendship was apparentlythe strongest correlation, and it didn’t matter how far away geographically thefriends were. Distance did not have a notable influence on the results. Siblinginfluence was also ranked high, with a 40 percent greater chance of becomingobese if another sibling was obese.The study highlights the social network effect on health issues and makes animportant point: Our health is heavily influenced by many factors, not the leastof which are the role models around us. Whom you spend time with matters to thehealth of your brain and your body. This powerful influence works both ways, itseems, as the study’s authors also stated that the same network effect showed upbetween friends who were losing weight. Health-conscious friends improve theirhealth and their friends’ health as well. By taking the information in this bookseriously, you can influence your whole network of friends and family.If you lead the way to better health in your circle of friends, your friends mayalso benefit. The author of the study said, “People are connected, and so theirhealth is connected.”[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_016_r1.jpg]The Weight SolutionWeight Boosters Weight Trimmers Thoughtless eating Restricted and optimallynutritious calories Low vitamin D level Adequate vitamin D Compulsive eatingThought-stopping techniques SAD eating Finding healthier ways to be happyAnxious eating Deep relaxation Adrenaline overload Dealing with emotional issuesOnly one diet tried Tailoring the plan to your type Low thyroid Optimal thyroidIgnorance/lying to self on calories consumed Knowledge and honesty Low bloodsugar, which leads to impulsivity Consistent blood sugar Insomnia or low sleepAdequate sleep, at least seven hours/night Negative thinking, i.e., “I have nocontrol” Honest, optimistic thinking, i.e., “I do have control” Sluggish brainActive brain Lack of exercise Physical activity at least four or five times aweek Being unaware of calorie content Counting calories Hormonal imbalancesBalanced hormones Chronic stress Stress-management techniquesSeewww.amenclinics.com/my-brain-health/brain-health-club/100-ways-to-leave-your-blubber/[http://www.amenclinics.com/my-brain-health/brain-health-club/100-ways-to-leave-your-blubber/]for “100 Ways to Leave Your Blubber.”"},{"pageContent":"4THE NUTRITION SOLUTIONFEED YOUR BRAIN TO LOOK AND FEEL YOUNGERLet food be your medicine and medicine be your food.—HIPPOCRATESAs I was writing this book, I saw a feature on ESPN about Los Angeles a Lakersforward Lamar Odom, who has a terrible sweet tooth, consuming up to eightydollars’ worth of candy a week. As a Lakers season ticket holder, I havesuffered through years of Odom’s erratic on-court performances. I decided towrite a piece for my blog, which was picked up by the Los Angeles Times, whichsubsequently caused a firestorm of controversy during the 2009 NBA Finals. Hereis an excerpt of the piece.THE LAKERS’ LAMAR ODOM, SWEET TOOTH, AND ERRATIC PLAYI have been a huge Los Angeles Lakers fan since I was a child. I am reallyexcited about my team being in the NBA Finals for the second year in a row. WhatI’m not as excited about is a piece I recently watched on ESPN about Lakers starLamar Odom and his massive addiction … to candy. In it, you can see the 6-foot,10-inch forward gobbling up massive quantities of the sugary treats.Odom has been a giant source of frustration for Lakers fans. He is unbelievablytalented, but often acts like a space cadet during games. Once, he was takingthe ball out on the sidelines, when he walked onto the court before he threw theball in, causing a turnover. During the Lakers last home game against the DenverNuggets, Kobe Bryant threw him a pass, but the ball hit him on the shoulderbecause he had spaced out and was not paying attention. On talk shows, Odom isconstantly criticized because no one knows if he will play well or not. He canplay great, and be worth his fourteen-million-dollar-a-year salary or he can actlike he is “missing in action.”Odom freely confesses that he just can’t help himself when it comes to the sweetstuff and always keeps a stash on hand of Gummi Bears, Honey Buns, Lifesavers,Hershey’s Cookies ‘n’ Crème white chocolate bars, Snickers bars, cookies, andmore. He eats the sugary snacks morning, noon and night, and even says hesometimes wakes up in the middle of the night, chows down on some treats, thenfalls back asleep.This is bad news for the Lakers. I’ve been telling my patients for decades thatsugar acts like a drug in the brain. It causes blood sugar levels to spike andthen crash, leaving you feeling tired, irritable, foggy, and stupid. Eating toomuch sugar impairs cognitive function, which may explain why Odom doesn’t alwaysmake the smartest decisions on the court.Excessive sugar consumption also promotes inflammation, which can make yourjoints ache and delay healing from injuries, which is definitely a bad thing fora professional athlete. It is also linked to headaches, mood swings and weightgain. Weight gain isn’t a problem now for Odom, but it is for the average personwho isn’t playing full-court basketball for hours each day.As a fan and a physician, it concerns me that our professional sportsorganizations and players are not more concerned about brain health, whichincludes nutrition. My advice to Odom and to all sugar addicts is to get yoursugar consumption under control. You will feel so much better and your brainwill function better, too.After my piece ran, I was interviewed by ESPN radio, and reporters played partof my interview for Odom. Like most addicts, he denied it was a problem and saidhe had eaten candy for breakfast during games five, six, and seven of the lastround of the playoffs against the Denver Nuggets, and he had played well inthose games. The problem with the comment, however, was that there was no gameseven. The Lakers won it in six games. Lakers coach Phil Jackson was also askedabout my comments; he said he knows candy makes kids more troubled and that whenyou have kids, “Halloween is the worst night of the year.” If Odom wants to be aworld-class athlete who performs consistently, he needs to eat a brain-healthydiet. If you want your best physical body, you do, too.In this chapter, I will provide you with the ingredients you need to eat rightfor your body, your brain, and your brain type. Here, you will discover fivetruths about the foods you eat, and you will learn eleven rules forbrain-healthy nutrition.FIVE TRUTHS ABOUT THE FOODS YOU EAT1. You are what you eat.You literally are what you eat. Throughout your lifetime, your body iscontinually making and renewing its cells, even brain cells. Your skin cellsmake themselves new every thirty days! Food fuels cell growth and regeneration.What you consume on a daily basis directly affects the health of your brain andbody, and proper nutrition is the key. I often say if you have a fast-food diet,you will have a fast-food brain and an overweight body. To be your best self,get optimal nutrition from the food you put in your mouth.2. Food is a drug.You have probably noticed how the foods you eat affect your mood and energylevel. Or maybe you have noticed that every time your child snacks on candy orcookies, he or she starts bouncing off the walls. Or that when your boss guzzlescoffee, she gets impatient and demanding. That is because food is a drug.Food can make you feel worse. If you chow down on three doughnuts for breakfast,about half an hour later, you are going to feel foggy, spacey, and stupid.Food can make you sleepy. Have you ever noticed that after wolfing down a hugelunch, you feel like you need a nap?Food can make you feel great. Eating the right foods gives you good energy thatlasts all day long and helps you focus better.3. Diet influences everything in your life.Food does a lot more than just alleviate hunger pangs. It affects every aspectof your physical health and well-being.Your overall health Eat a poor diet, and your health will suffer. Nosh onnutrient-rich foods throughout the day, and you will have a stronger immunesystem.Your ability to think quickly and clearly Brain-friendly foods rev up mentalsharpness to help you stay focused on your goals.Your energy level Whether you are feeling peppy or pooped out depends on thefoods you consume.Your physical and athletic performance Good foods get you pumped up for physicalactivity, while bad foods zap your stamina.Your weight Your eating habits directly affect the size of your body.Your appearance People who have healthy diets tend to look healthier.4. We’re getting the wrong messages about food.As a society, we’re bombarded with bad messages about food. TV commercials,billboards, and radio ads are constantly encouraging us to adopt bad eatinghabits. Restaurants and fast-food joints train employees to “upsell” as a way toincrease sales and, subsequently, expand our waistlines. Here are some of thesneaky tactics food sellers use to try to get you to eat and drink more.Do you want to supersize that for only thirty-nine cents?Do you want fries with your meal?Do you want bread first? (This makes you hungrier so you eat more!)Do you want an appetizer?Do you want another drink?Do you want a larger drink? It is a better deal!Do you want dessert? It comes with the meal!Free refills—you have to keep drinking to get your money’s worth!Happy hour—you can drink more for less!All-you-can-eat buffet—you have to keep eating to get the most for your money!Parents, grandparents, and teachers are sometimes just as guilty of sending outthe wrong messages about food. We sometimes tell children, “If you behave, youcan have a treat when we get home.” Sure, this strategy might get Johnny to sitstill in class or in church or to be quiet while you are trying to have a phoneconversation, but there’s a problem with this. Using poor nutrition as a rewardfor good behavior teaches children to reward themselves later in life with foodsthat are not good for them.5. Who has the worst diets?Teens and young adults often have the worst diets. Parents feel like they havelittle influence over their adolescent children, so they just give up and letthem eat whatever they want whenever they want. The habits young people developduring this time can be hard to break later on, and they can have a major impacton their brain development. Because the brain is still undergoing intensedevelopment up until the age of twenty-five, the foods that teens eat can eitherenhance or impede their development. If young people want to have the best brainpossible, they need the best diet possible.On the other end of the life spectrum, older people often have poor nutritionhabits, too. For example, when an elderly husband or wife dies, the survivingspouse may not be as motivated to eat right while dining alone. A spouse whocooked healthful meals throughout the marriage may not want to go to all thattrouble to cook for one. He or she may shift to prepackaged meals or quick bitesof whatever’s handy. This is a trend that needs to be reversed.Eleven Rules for Brain-Body-Healthy Nutrition 1. Drink plenty of water, some green tea, and not too many calories. 2. Watch your calories. 3. Increase good fats and decrease bad fats. 4. Increase good carbs and decrease bad carbs. 5. Dump artificial sweeteners and replace them with small amounts of natural sweeteners. 6. Limit caffeine intake. 7. Eat great brain foods. 8. Reduce salt intake and increase potassium intake. 9. Plan snacks. 10. Take a daily multivitamin/mineral supplement and fish oil. 11. Recognize when you or someone you care about has hidden food allergies.1. Drink plenty of water, some green tea, and not too many calories.Considering that your body consists of 70 percent water, and your brain is 80percent water, proper hydration is the first rule of good nutrition. Even slightdehydration increases the body’s stress hormones. When this happens, you getirritable and you don’t think as well. Over time, increased levels of stresshormones are associated with memory problems and obesity. (See Chapter 11[Amen_9780307463593_epub_c11_r1.htm], “The Stress Solution,” for more on stresshormones and how they affect your body.) Dehydration also makes your skin lookolder and more wrinkled.I once did a SPECT scan of a famous bodybuilder. His scan looked like he was adrug addict, but he vehemently denied that. Then I learned that he significantlydehydrates himself before photo shoots to look leaner for the camera, and he wasdoing a shoot the day after we did his scan. When he was adequately hydrated thefollowing week, his brain looked much better (see Images 4.1 and 4.2).Image 4.1[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_017_r1.jpg]Bodybuilder’s Dehydrated BrainImage 4.2[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_018_r1.jpg]Bodybuilder’s Adequately Hydrated BrainTo stay adequately hydrated, drink plenty of water every day. Based on weight,everyone’s need is different. One rule of thumb is to drink half your weight inounces every day. So, if you are 150 pounds, you should drink 75 ounces a day.Be aware that not all liquids are created equal. It is best to drink liquidsthat are free of artificial sweeteners, sugar, much caffeine, and alcohol. Ialso encourage my patients to drink unsweetened green tea two or three times aday. Researchers from China found that when people drank two to three cups ofgreen tea per day, their DNA actually looked younger than that of those who didnot. Interestingly, the DNA of people who took multiple vitamins also lookedyounger. Likewise, be careful of drinking too many of your calories. Researchsuggests that people forget about the calories they drink and are more likely togain weight. My favorite drink is water mixed with lemon juice and a little bitof the natural sweetener stevia.2. Watch your calories.The bottom-line message about calories is that the fewer you eat, the longer youwill live, according to many research studies. In a new twenty-year study onprimates, researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison found that anutritious but calorie-reduced diet blunts aging and significantly delays theonset of age-related disorders such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease,and brain deterioration. During the two decades of the study, half of theanimals that were permitted to eat freely have survived, while 80 percent of therhesus monkeys given the same foods, but with 30 percent fewer calories, arestill alive. In terms of overall health of the monkeys, the authors note, therestricted diet leads to longer life span and improved quality of life in oldage. “There is a major effect of caloric restriction in increasing survival ifyou look at deaths due to the diseases of aging.” The incidence of canceroustumors and cardiovascular disease in animals on a restricted diet was less thanhalf that seen in animals permitted to eat freely. Amazingly, while diabetes iscommon in monkeys that can eat all the food they want, it has yet to be observedin any animal on a restricted diet. “So far,” the researchers report, “we’veseen the complete prevention of diabetes.” In addition, the brain health ofanimals on a restricted diet was also better. In particular, the regions of thebrain responsible for motor control and executive functions, such as workingmemory and problem solving, seem to be better preserved in animals that consumefewer calories.Reducing calorie consumption overall helps you control weight and decreases therisk for heart disease, cancer, and stroke from obesity (a major risk factor forall these illnesses). Even better, restricting calories triggers certainmechanisms in the body to increase the production of nerve-growth factors, whichare beneficial to the brain.To get the most out of your food, think CRON (calorie restriction with optimalnutrition). That means making sure that every calorie you consume counts.Counting calories is also one of the keys to lasting weight loss. Many dietprograms today have discarded the traditional concept of calorie reduction.Instead, they insist that you need to eat a specific ratio of protein,carbohydrates, and fats in order to lose weight. Not so, according to a recentstudy in the New England Journal of Medicine conducted at the Harvard School ofPublic Health and Brigham and Women’s Hospital. This study found that caloriereduction—regardless of the percentage of fats, carbohydrates, or proteins in adiet—is what leads to weight loss. For this study, the researchers enlisted 811overweight individuals and assigned them to one of the following four diets: 1. 20 percent fat, 15 percent protein, 65 percent carbohydrates 2. 20 percent fat, 25 percent protein, 55 percent carbohydrates 3. 40 percent fat, 15 percent protein, 45 percent carbohydrates 4. 40 percent fat, 25 percent protein, 35 percent carbohydratesAt the conclusion of the two-year study, all four groups had achieved a similarweight loss of an average of nearly nine pounds. Regardless of the amount offat, carbohydrates, or protein in their particular diet, the participantsreported experiencing similar feelings of hunger and satiety. This studyreinforces the concept that calorie restriction is essential if you want to loseextra pounds.A lot of my patients ask me if it is possible to eat fast food while watchingtheir calorie intake. The answer is yes. Many fast-food restaurants are addinghealthier, low-calorie fare to their menu options. To help you make betterchoices at fast-food restaurants, here’s a chart of calorie-busters to avoid andlighter options that get the green light.[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_01_r1.jpg]Decreasing calories doesn’t mean sacrificing flavor. Cook with brain-healthyherbs and spices to enhance the flavor of your food and boost your brain. Youcan find more information about the following and other brain-healthy spices athttp://www.amenclinics.com/my-brain-health/foods-recipes/10-brain-healthy-spices/[http://www.amenclinics.com/my-brain-health/foods-recipes/10-brain-healthy-spices/]. * Turmeric, found in curry, contains a chemical that has been shown to decrease the plaques in the brain thought to be responsible for Alzheimer’s disease. * A number of studies have found that saffron extract is helpful in treating mild to moderate depression. * Sage has A-level—the highest level possible—scientific evidence for memory enhancement. * Cinnamon has been shown to enhance memory and focus and may aid in the prevention of Alzheimer’s disease. Plus, cinnamon helps regulate blood sugar levels.Restricting calories does not mean starving yourself. Crash diets and diets thatseverely limit the number of calories you consume aren’t doing your brain oryour body any favors. Extremely low calorie intake is associated with a lack ofnutrients, which can deprive your brain and body of the fuel they need foroptimal performance. Similarly, yo-yo dieting, in which you habitually lose andthen regain weight, has been linked to certain health risks, including highcholesterol and high blood pressure. Adopting a brain-healthy eating plan forlife is a more sensible way to shed pounds for good.3. Increase good fats and decrease bad fats.Fat has gotten a bad rap. Many myths and misconceptions surrounding dietary fathave led many of us to fear that eating any kind of fat is bad for our healthand will make us fat. This isn’t true. In fact, we all need some fat in ourdiets.Our brains need fat, too. Did you know that 60 percent of the solid weight ofyour brain is fat? So if somebody ever calls you a fathead, say “Thank you.” Thehundred billion nerve cells in your brain need essential fatty acids tofunction. Myelin, the fatty protective covering that wraps around the nervecells, keeps those neurons working at optimum levels. Any loss of myelin due todiseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), commonly known as LouGehrig’s disease, and multiple sclerosis (MS), compromises the nervous system.Of course, having too much of the wrong fat in your system leads to high “bad”cholesterol, which can kill you with heart disease and stroke. But did you knowthat really low cholesterol levels can kill you as well? Low cholesterol levelshave been associated with depression and violence, and sometimes even homicideand suicide.There are three main categories of fat—bad fat (saturated fats), really bad fat(trans fats), and good fat (unsaturated fats). Saturated fats contribute tohardening of the arteries and plaque formation. Plaque is the sticky, gooeystuff that accumulates on the inside of your blood vessels and can potentiallyblock blood from flowing freely to the heart and brain. Saturated fats are foundin red meat (like prime rib), eggs (especially in the yolks), and dairy foods(like butter and whole milk).Diets high in saturated fats have long been associated with long-term healthrisks, such as heart disease. A 2009 animal study from British researchers hasfound that high-fat diets also cause more immediate problems. After eating afatty diet for just ten days, rats showed short-term memory loss and less energyto exercise—in other words, they became more stupid and lazy. The researcherscompared the performance of the rats on a high-fat diet (55 percent of caloriesas fat) with rats on a low-fat diet (7.5 percent of calories as fat). In therats with the high-fat diet, their muscles worked less efficiently, whichlowered their energy levels, caused their hearts to work harder during exercise,and caused their hearts to increase in size. The rats eating high-fat foods alsotook longer to make their way through a maze and made more mistakes than therats eating low-fat foods. This is one of the first studies to show that itdoesn’t take long for a high-fat diet to make your brain and body more sluggish.Scientific evidence also shows that consuming high-fat foods actually altersbrain chemistry in ways that compel you to overeat. One animal study thatappeared in the Journal of Clinical Investigation found that eating high-fatfoods, such as milk shakes or burgers, caused the brain to release messages tothe body telling it to ignore the feelings of fullness that typically make youstop eating. In this particular study, the brain switched off the fullnesssignal for up to three days and led to overeating. A similar trial found thathigh-fat, high-sugar diets alter brain receptors in an area of the brain thatregulates food intake. Overconsumption of fat-laden, sugar-filled foodsincreased the levels of opioid receptors, which are linked to feelings ofpleasure and euphoria. The researchers suggest that this could be a factor inbinge-eating disorders.The worst fats on the planet are referred to as Frankenfats. These man-made fatshave been chemically altered by adding hydrogen and are more harmful thannatural fats. On food labels, you will find these fats listed in the ingredientsas “partially hydrogenated” oils and amounts listed as “trans fats.”The food industry uses these Frankenfats because they help foods—such asmargarine, cakes, crackers, cookies, potato chips, and bread—have a longer shelflife and better flavor stability. Since 2006, the FDA has required manufacturersto list trans fats on nutrition labels, and many manufacturers have reduced oreliminated their use of these killer fats.Unsaturated fats are good for your health and can actually lower cholesterol.There are two basic types of good fats: monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturatedfats. Foods high in monounsaturated fats include avocados, olive oil, canolaoil, peanut oil, and nuts (such as almonds, cashews, and pistachios). Foods highin polyunsaturated fats include safflower oil, corn oil, and some fish.The polyunsaturated fats found in salmon and mackerel and the monounsaturatedfats found in canola oil and soybean oil are high in essential fatty acids(EFAs), called omega-3 fatty acids. They are called essential fatty acidsbecause our body needs them. When we don’t have enough of these EFAs in oursystem, it can cause problems. For example, research has found that omega-3fatty acid levels tend to be low in people with ADD, depression, and Alzheimer’sdisease; low in those who have trouble thinking; and low in those who attemptsuicide.Studies show that a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids may help promote emotionalbalance and positive mood, two things that can reduce a tendency to overeat. Ina Danish study that compared the diets of more than five thousand healthy olderpeople, findings showed people who ate more fish in their diet were able tomaintain their memory longer. Researchers in Holland found that consuming fishdecreased the risk for dementia and stroke. And according to a French study,older adults who ate fish just once a week significantly lowered the risk ofdeveloping brain problems such as dementia.Even though your body needs EFAs, it can’t produce them itself, so you must getthem through the foods you eat. Getting adequate amounts of omega-3 fatty acidsfrom your diet isn’t easy. EFAs tend to be scarce in many of the processed foodsand fast-food meals we eat on a regular basis. I recommend that people eat oneor two servings of fish per week, particularly fish such as salmon, which ishigh in omega-3 fatty acids. Be aware that even if you eat fish a few times aweek, you may not be getting enough omega-3 fatty acids. That is because much ofthe salmon served in restaurants and sold in supermarkets is farm-raised andcontains less of the important EFAs than salmon caught in the wild. For thehighest amounts of omega-3 fatty acids, opt for wild salmon rather than farmraised. Because it can be so difficult to get all the EFAs you need from yourdiet, I recommend taking a daily fish oil supplement. Adults should take 2,000to 4,000 mg of high-quality fish oil a day (500 to 2,000 mg a day for children).Amen Clinics, Inc., has its own brand, which we took years to develop. Knowingyour good fats from your bad fats can get a little confusing, so use thefollowing chart as a reminder.Good Fats versus Bad Fats Anchovies Bacon Avocados Butter Canola oil Cheese(regular fat) Flaxseed oil Cream sauces Lean meats (chicken/turkey) DoughnutsLow-fat cheeses Fried foods Nuts (walnut are the best) Ice cream Olive oil Lambchops Peanut oil Margarine Salmon Potato chips (fried) Sardines Processed foodsSoybeans Steak Tuna Whole milk4. Increase good carbs and decrease bad carbs.Some of the latest diet trends are giving carbohydrates a bad name. But carbsare a necessary part of a healthy diet, as they provide the fuel your body needsto perform physical activity. The amount of carbs you need in your diet dependson your brain type. As we saw in the last chapter, Type 1 Compulsive Overeaterstend to feel better when they have more carbohydrates in their diets, while Type2 Impulsive Overeaters typically do better with more protein.No matter which type you are, it is important to understand that some carbs arebetter than others. There are two basic types of carbs: complex and simple.Complex carbs, which include fruits, vegetables, beans, legumes, and wholegrains, get a thumbs-up. These foods take longer to digest and are loaded withvitamins, minerals, and fiber that promote good brain and body health. The carbsto avoid are the simple carbs, such as table sugar, pastries, candy, sodas,fruit juices, doughnuts, white bread, pasta, and white rice. Simple carbs aredigested quickly, provide little or no nutritional value, and may promotedisease and weight gain.REDUCE YOUR SUGAR INTAKE.Curbing your intake of sugary foods is an important step to better health. Sugarspikes your blood sugar level then sends it crashing down about thirty minuteslater, leaving you feeling lackluster and dim-witted. As we saw in the story ofLamar Odom at the beginning of the chapter, there is no doubt that sugar can beaddictive. Sugar’s empty calories can also lead to obesity and excessinflammation, which increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, heartdisease, and stroke. Not only that, sugar also promotes seizure activity. In anumber of studies from Johns Hopkins University, when neurologists took childrencompletely off simple carbohydrates, it dramatically cut down on seizureactivity, in some studies by more than half.Sugar affects some people more than others. Jenny, twenty-six, is a primeexample. She had been dealing with anxiety, depression, and fatigue for manyyears. She constantly craved sweets and would often experience headaches, moodswings, and dizziness throughout the day. When Jenny stopped eating treats madewith refined sugar and gave up caffeine and alcohol, her symptoms disappeared.Sugar consumption has been on the rise for decades and Americans currentlyconsume an average of 22.2 teaspoons (almost half a cup) a day (355 calories aday) of added sugars. The number one source of added sugars in the American dietare soft drinks and other sugar-laden beverages. Recognizing the deleteriousrole excess sugar intake plays in our health, the American Heart Associationissued a statement in 2009 recommending that Americans limit their intake ofadded sugars to no more than 100 calories per day for women and 150 calories perday for men.If you want to cut down on your sugar intake, start by cutting out the sodas andlimiting the cookies, candy, and ice cream you eat. I realize that it may not beeasy. As noted earlier, according to Dr. David Kessler’s The End of Overeating:Taking Control of the Insatiable American Appetite, the high-fat, high-sugarcombos found in many mouthwatering snacks light up the brain’s dopamine pathwaysimilar to the same way drugs and alcohol do. He suggests that some people canactually get hooked on chocolate chip cookies the way other people get addictedto cocaine. Kessler and his team of researchers have seen this theory at work inanimals, too. In one study, they found that rats will work increasingly hard fora high-fat, high-sugar milk shake, and that they will consume greater quantitiesof it if more sugar is added.Because sugar is a common ingredient in thousands of processed foods— even foodsthat don’t taste sweet—start checking food labels. Spaghetti sauce, saladdressing, ketchup, peanut butter, and crackers often contain some form of sugar.If food labels simply said “sugar,” it would be easy to figure out what to cutout of your diet, but they don’t. On food labels, sugar may be listed using anyof a wide variety of names (see the box to the left). This list is only thebeginning—Manufacturers use many more names, so you have to be on your toes.When you start looking for these names on labels, you will soon realize just howmany foods contain sugar. You will also notice that a food might not have sugarlisted as one of the top few ingredients, but it might have three, four, or moredifferent types of sugar included. When you add up all of them, it comes to ahuge amount of sugar. I went to the store the other day looking for a healthfulsnack and picked up one of those so-called health bars. The packaging screamed“health,” but the list of ingredients told another story.NAMES FOR SUGAR USED ON FOOD LABELSSugarInvert sugarLactoseMaltodextrinHoneyMaltoseGlucoseMalt syrupGalactoseMolassesFruit juice concentrateSorbitolFruit juiceTurbinado sugarFructoseAgaveDextroseDehydrated cane juiceCorn syrup (or high-fructose corn syrup)Cane juice crystals, extractCane sugarSucanatBarley maltLIST OF INGREDIENTS OF A SO-CALLED HEALTH BAR * granolawhole-grain rolled oats whole wheat flour sugar (SUGAR!) molasses (SUGAR!) riceflour sodium bicarbonate whole-grain rolled wheat soy lecithin partiallyhydrogenated soybean caramel color (SUGAR!) and cottonseed oils with TBHQ barleymalt (SUGAR!)

When you inspect thefood label, this “healthy” snack doesn’t seem so healthy anymore.In looking at the list of sugar names, you might be wondering about fruit juiceand fruit juice concentrate. After all, isn’t fruit one of those complex carbsthat are so good for you? Let me clear this up. Yes, fruit is great for you, butfruit juice isn’t so good. Orange juice, for example, consists of a small amountof vitamin C, a lot of sugar, and water. It doesn’t contain any of the fiber youget from eating an orange. Orange juice is better than a Diet Coke, but it isn’tas good as eating an orange.GLYCEMIC INDEX (Gl)High GI (70 and above)Medium GI (56–69)Low GI (55 and under)GI RATINGSLow-fat yogurt 14 Asparagus 15 Broccoli 15 Cherries 22 Kidney beans 27 Low-fatmilk 33 Apples 38 Carrots 39 Spaghetti 41 Apple juice 41 Grapes 46 Oatmeal 49Whole-grain bread 50 Yams 51 Orange juice 52 Sweet potato 54 Brown rice 55Bananas 55 Popcorn 55 Potato chips 56 Cheese pizza 60 Ice cream 61 Pineapple 66Watermelon 72 Cheerios 74 White bread 75 French fries 75 Doughnuts 76 Waffles 76Rice cakes 77 Rice Krispies 82 Cornflakes 83 Baked potatoes 85 Dates 103 Whiterice 110Sources: The Glucose Revolution, GlycemicIndex.com [http://GlycemicIndex.com],NutritionData.com [http://NutritionData.com], SouthBeachDietPlan.com[http://SouthBeachDietPlan.com], and Diabetesnet.com [http://Diabetesnet.com].GET TO KNOW THE GLYCEMIC INDEX.To help you figure out how carbs affect your blood sugar, understand theglycemic index (GI). The GI rates carbs based on their effect on blood sugarlevels. Low-glycemic carbs cause only small fluctuations in blood sugar levels,which helps you maintain energy throughout the day. High-glycemic carbs causeblood sugar levels to spike then crash. This roller-coaster effect gives you aninitial boost of energy, but then leaves you feeling sluggish and slow. The keyto good brain health is to make sure the majority of the carbs you consume arelow-glycemic.Eating low-glycemic carbs that contain a lot of fiber is even better for yourbrain. Dietary fiber promotes health and can lower cholesterol, which promotesgood blood flow. Good sources of high-fiber foods include vegetables, fruits,whole grains, and beans and legumes. When choosing fruits and vegetables, it isbest to go for non-starchy vegetables and low-sugar fruits—think broccoli ratherthan potatoes, and blueberries instead of pineapple. Check the GI Ratings boxfor tasty low-glycemic, high-fiber foods you should stock up on.HOLD THE BREAD BEFORE MEALS.Why do restaurants serve baskets of bread before each meal for free? Why notcheese? Why not almonds, or chunks of beef or chicken? The reason is that breadmakes you hungrier and encourages you to eat more. Bread, especially white breadmade from bleached and processed flour, spikes your blood sugar and boosts thenatural feel-good neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain. Serotonin helps youfeel happier and less anxious.On brain SPECT scans, I have seen that serotonin interventions help to relax orlower function in the PFC. When I prescribe antidepressant medications orsupplements that boost serotonin in the brain, my patients often say they feelbetter but that they are also less motivated. Anything that lowers PFC functionmakes you more impulsive and less worried about long-term consequences. Thebread or simple carbohydrate to start a meal helps you feel better, but alsomore impulsive when the dessert tray comes by later on. Hold the bread, wait foryour meal, and you will be happier with the end result.5. Dump artificial sweeteners and replace them with small amounts of naturalsweeteners.I love sweet things. I wish it wasn’t so, but growing up with a grandpa whom Iadored who was a candy maker put me at a decided disadvantage. When I found itwas essential to watch my weight, I was grateful for artificial sweeteners. Nocalories! How cool. Have as much as you want, I thought. Diet sodas became aregular companion for me and I drank a ton of them from age twenty-five tothirty-five. Then, at age thirty-five, right as we started our brain imagingwork, I found that I had problems getting off the floor when I played with myyoung children, because my joints hurt. Being a writer, I became even moreconcerned when my fingers and hands started to hurt as well.Initially, I just wrote it off to old age. At thirty-five? Then, as I becamemuch more interested in learning about brain health, I discovered that there wasa large body of information reporting that artificial sweeteners, like aspartamein diet sodas, may be associated with arthritis, gastrointestinal problems,headaches, memory problems, neurological problems, and a myriad of othermaladies. I had a patient who told me her arthritis and headaches went awayafter she stopped aspartame. Another patient told me her confusion went away asshe got rid of artificial sweeteners, and yet another patient told me that itwas only after he stopped diet sodas that he was able to lose weight.So I stopped aspartame, and within four weeks, my arthritis went away. Just totest, as diet sodas have been a big part of my life, I tested it again with adiet soda at lunch. Within twenty minutes, my fingers started to hurt. So Idecided to eliminate aspartame from my diet. The other artificial sweetenerchoices at the time either tasted bitter to me or had been reported to bepossibly associated with cancer.Then sucralose (Splenda) came along, and I felt as though I was in sweet heavenagain, plus it had no aftertaste, and I did not have arthritis with it. In fact,sucralose was reported to be six hundred times sweeter than sugar. Puttingregular sugar in tea or lemonade was bland by comparison. Then, yet again,reports began to emerge that it was associated with health troubles, includingdecreasing the healthy bacteria in the intestinal tract.Besides the reported health problems, one of the significant problems withartificial sweeteners is that they may increase sugar cravings. The emptycalories prime the brain’s appetite centers to expect something good, and whennothing comes, it wants more. Artificial sweeteners also desensitize your tastebuds, and even naturally sweet things, such as a regular portion of sugar, arenot enough to satisfy you.Changing the sensitivity of your taste buds is clearly possible. If you were adiet soda drinker like me, remember how disgustingly sweet regular sodas tastedafter you had not had them for a while? When you dump the artificial sweeteners,your taste buds will adapt back to normal within a few weeks.My favorite natural sweetener, stevia, which has been reported to haveanti-inflammatory and blood pressure-lowering properties, has not beenassociated with negative health effects. Xylitol and agave are other naturalsweeteners. With any of them, use sparingly, and you will be better off in thelong run.Another terribly disturbing trend is the artificial sweeteners that are endingup in gum, candy, packaged foods, sauces, vitamins, medications, nutritionalpowders, nutritional bars, popcorn, toothpaste, and water. The sweeter it is,these companies know, the more hooked you are likely to become. Fight back anddo not collude with the food companies in your own demise.ACTION STEPRead the labels of everything you eat! It is important to know what you areputting in your body.6. Limit caffeine intake.Most of us associate caffeine with coffee, but it can also be found in tea, darksodas, chocolate, energy drinks, and pep pills. If your caffeine intake islimited to one or two normal-size cups of coffee or two or three cups of tea aday, it probably is not a problem. But any more than that can cause problems.Caffeine restricts blood flow to the brain, and anything that compromises bloodflow leads to premature aging.Caffeine dehydrates the brain (remember, your brain is 80 percent water andneeds adequate hydration), which makes it harder to think quickly.Caffeine interferes with sleep, which is essential for good brain health,appetite control, and skin rejuvenation. Caffeine disrupts sleep patternsbecause it blocks adenosine, a chemical that tells us when it is time to hit thehay. When this chemical is blocked, we tend to sleep less, which leads to sleepdeprivation. And when we aren’t getting enough sleep, we feel like we absolutelymust have that cup of joe in the morning in order to jump-start our day.Caffeine can be addictive in high amounts. When you try to kick the habit, youare likely to experience withdrawal symptoms, including severe headaches,fatigue, and irritability.Caffeine can accelerate heart rate and raise blood pressure. In some people,drinking too much caffeine leads to a temporary spike in blood pressure and aracing heart.Caffeine can give you the jitters. Ingesting more caffeine than you normally docan leave you feeling jittery and nervous.Caffeine increases muscle tension. Tight muscles have been linked to caffeineintake.Caffeine can cause an upset stomach. Gastrointestinal troubles are common withexcessive caffeine use.Caffeine can elevate inflammatory markers. Two studies showed that 200 mg ofcaffeine (equivalent to two cups of coffee) raised homocysteine levels, a markerfor inflammation and heart disease.Caffeine can interfere with fertility. Pregnant women should be careful withcaffeine because it has been associated with premature births, birth defects,inability to conceive, low birth weight, and miscarriage.To be fair, there are also a number of studies suggesting that coffee can behelpful for you. It has been shown to decrease the plaques that causeAlzheimer’s disease, lower the risk for Parkinson’s disease, and lower the riskof colon cancer and diabetes. It may be other substances in the coffee, not justthe caffeine, that are actually helpful, and decaffeinated varieties may giveyou the benefits without the troubles noted above. A Harvard University studyfound that those drinking decaf coffee also showed a reduced diabetes risk,though it was half as much as drinking caffeinated coffee. Another study,however, found that caffeine reduced insulin sensitivity and raised bloodsugar—both bad news for you. One question you should ask yourself whenever youread a scientific study promoting the benefits of certain medications, alcohol,or caffeine is, Who funded the research? One of the university departments thatadvocate for coffee use is funded, in part, by Kraft Foods, the makers ofMaxwell House coffee.THE BEST ANTIOXIDANT FRUITS AND VEGETABLES * Açaí berries * Blueberries * Blackberries * Cranberries * Strawberries * Spinach * Raspberries * Brussels sprouts * Plums * Broccoli * Beets * Avocados * Oranges * Red grapes * Red bell peppers * Cherries * KiwisSource: U.S. Department of Agriculture7. Eat great brain foods.You will be glad to know that there are plenty of delicious foods that are greatfor your brain regardless of your brain type. Foods that contain high amounts ofantioxidants help your body and brain stay young. Several studies have foundthat eating foods rich in antioxidants, which include many fruits andvegetables, significantly reduces the risk of developing cognitive impairment.How do they work? Antioxidants neutralize the production of free radicals in thebody. Free radicals are chemicals that play a major role in the deterioration ofthe brain with age. The body produces free radicals every time a cell convertsoxygen into energy. When produced in normal amounts, free radicals help rid thebody of harmful toxins, thus keeping it healthy. When produced in toxic amounts,free radicals damage the body’s cellular machinery, resulting in cell death andtissue damage. This process is called oxidative stress. It is similar to the waymetals rust, or oxidize, when exposed to moisture in the air. Antioxidants actlike the body’s rust busters.Foods rich in antioxidants include a variety of fruits and vegetables.Blueberries are very high in antioxidants, which among neuroscientists hasearned them the nickname “brain berries.” In laboratory studies, rats that ateblueberries showed a better ability to learn new motor skills and gainedprotection against strokes. That is not all. In one study, rats that ate a dietrich in blueberries lost abdominal fat, lowered cholesterol, and improvedglucose levels. Similar studies showed that rats that consumed strawberries andspinach also gained significant protection.THE FIFTY BEST BRAIN FOODS 1. Almonds, raw 2. Almond milk, unsweetened 3. Apples 4.

Yogurt, unsweetenedWhen it comes to antioxidants, I always say eat from the rainbow. By that, Imean eat fruits and vegetables of many different colors—eat blue foods(blueberries), eat red foods (pomegranates, strawberries, raspberries, cherries,red bell peppers, and tomatoes), eat yellow foods (squash, yellow bell peppers,small portions of bananas and peaches), orange foods (oranges, tangerines, andyams), green foods (spinach, broccoli, and peas), purple foods (plums), and soon. This will ensure that you are getting a wide variety of antioxidants tonourish and protect your brain.BALANCE THE FOODS YOU EAT.Your brain needs a balance of lean protein, such as skinless chicken or turkey,complex carbohydrates, and good fats. It is a good idea to include lean proteinat each meal to balance blood sugar levels, especially if you are a Type 2Impulsive Overeater. Adding lean protein to snacks and meals slows the fastabsorption of simple carbs and helps prevent the brain fog that typicallyfollows consumption of sugary snacks.MY TOP 20 BRAIN FOODS1. _________________________________2. _________________________________3. _________________________________4. _________________________________5. _________________________________6. _________________________________7. _________________________________8. _________________________________9. _________________________________10. _________________________________11. _________________________________12. _________________________________13. _________________________________14. _________________________________15. _________________________________16. _________________________________17. _________________________________18. _________________________________19. _________________________________20. _________________________________In 2000, I conducted a five-month study on the effects of a balanced diet onfive college students who had all been diagnosed with ADD, including my own son.Each student followed the Zone diet by Dr. Barry Sears, which advocates eating abalance of lean protein, complex carbohydrates, and good fats. In addition, theyall took high-dose purified fish oil. To track their progress, we didbefore-and-after SPECT scans. After five months of sticking with the dietaryregimen, all of the students performed better in school and lost weight. Theirbrain scans showed positive changes as well, enhancing the concentration centersof the brain and calming overactive areas involved in mood control. It was clearto me that a healthy diet and fish oil helped balance brain function.Use the form on this page to create your own list of your top twentybrain-healthy foods and include them in your diet each week.

Reduce salt intake and increase your potassium intake.A lot of people erroneously blame salt for making them fat. Salt in and ofitself does not cause weight gain, but it does cause your body to temporarilyretain water, which can make it harder to zip up your jeans. Part of the problemwith salt is that it is commonly found in large quantities in high-calorieprocessed foods at the grocery store, fast-food fare, and restaurant meals. Soeating a diet that is high in high-salt foods is likely to make you gain weightover time.Take note that salt is not the same as sodium. Sodium accounts for about 40percent of table salt. It is found naturally in many foods and in the humanbody. Sodium and potassium are electrolytes that are involved in a variety ofbodily functions. For optimal function, these electrolytes need to be balanced.When they are out of balance, with much higher sodium levels and lower potassiumlevels, as in most Americans, they can lead to weight gain, hypertension,insulin resistance, and a depressed immune system.A low-salt diet, such as the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension)diet, has been proven to lower hypertension in just fourteen days, according tonumerous studies. It has also been shown to reduce the risk of stroke and heartdisease. One study found that participants who reduced salt intake lowered theirrisk of dying from heart disease ten to fifteen years later by 25 percent. As abonus, because the diet is based on eating an abundance of great brainfoods—such as fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and healthyfats—it can result in weight loss and enhanced brain function.Just as important as cutting back on salt is increasing potassium intake. Arecent study found that eating twice as much potassium as sodium can cut in halfthe risk of dying from heart disease. A 1997 study in the Journal of theAmerican Medical Association that reviewed the results of thirty-three clinicaltrials found that individuals who took potassium supplements lowered their bloodpressure. Foods high in potassium include bananas, spinach, honeydew melon,kiwi, lima beans, oranges, tomatoes, and all meats.ACTION STEPDietary guidelines currently recommend getting at least 4,700 mg a day ofpotassium and no more than 2,300 mg a day of sodium (about one teaspoon ofsalt).9. Plan snacks.If anybody has ever told you to avoid snacking throughout the day, don’t listen!Going too long without eating can wreak havoc on your brain function and makeyour blood sugar levels drop too low. Low blood sugar levels are associated withpoor impulse control and irritability. It can also cause emotional stress. Philis a fifty-six-year-old man who suffered from anxiety attacks. Every Wednesdaynight, Phil ate dinner in a restaurant, and every Wednesday before he left hishome for the restaurant, he had an anxiety attack. It eventually was revealedthat Phil normally ate dinner at 6 p.m., but on Wednesdays, the dinner didn’tstart until 8 p.m. Waiting the extra two hours for dinner was causing his bloodsugar to drop. When Phil started eating a snack of an apple and a few almonds at6 p.m. on Wednesdays, his anxiety attacks disappeared.Eating approximately every three to four hours throughout the day can helpbalance your blood sugar. This isn’t a license to gorge all day long. Whensnacking, opt for low-calorie foods and include a balance of protein, complexcarbs, and good fats, if possible. Personally, I love to snack. Since I travelfrequently, I’ve learned to pack brain-healthy snacks for the road. Otherwise, Iam tempted to grab candy bars from the airport gift shop. One of my favoritelow-calorie snacks is dried fruits, without any added sugar or preservatives,and fresh raw vegetables—I add a few nuts or some low-fat string cheese tobalance out the carbohydrates in the fruits and vegetables with a little proteinand fat. Be wary when buying dried fruits and vegetables, though; many brandsadd sugar, preservatives, or other ingredients, which renders them less thanhealthy. Read the food labels. Look for brands that don’t add anything.Here are a few more of my favorite midafternoon snacks:Low-fat yogurt and nutsLow-fat cottage cheese with fruit and a couple of almonds or macadamia nuts1 ounce of string cheese and a half cup of grapesTurkey and apple with a macadamia nut or three almondsDeviled eggs with hummus (Slice the eggs in half, discard the yolks, and fillwith 1 tablespoon hummus; add paprika to taste.)10. Take a daily multivitamin/mineral supplement and fish oil.Ninety-one percent of Americans do not eat at least five servings of fruits andvegetables a day, the minimum required to get good nutrition. For years, I havebeen advocating that everybody take a daily multivitamin. The Journal of theAmerican Medical Association (JAMA) agrees. For twenty-two years, the AMArecommended against taking a daily multivitamin, but eventually reversed itsposition. The AMA now recommends daily vitamins for everybody because they helpprevent chronic illness. Many people argue that if you are eating a balanceddiet, you don’t need a supplement. That may be true, but how many of us arereally eating a perfectly nutritious diet every day?In addition to a daily multiple vitamin/mineral supplement, I almost alwaysprescribe a fish oil supplement for my patients as well. Fish oil, a greatsource for omega-3 fatty acids, has been the focus of many research studies. Thetwo most studied fish oils are eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoicacid (DHA). DHA is a vital component of cell membranes, especially in the brainand retina. DHA is critical for normal brain development in fetuses and infantsand for the maintenance of normal brain function throughout life. DHA appears tobe a major factor in the fluidity and flexibility of brain cell membranes, andit could play a major role in how we think and feel. See Appendix C, “TheSupplement Solution,” for more detailed information.11. Recognize when you or someone you care about has hidden food allergies.Many people know that food allergies can cause hives, itching, eczema, nausea,diarrhea, and, in severe cases, shock or constriction of the airways, which canmake it difficult to breathe and can be fatal. But can certain foods and foodadditives also cause emotional, behavioral, or learning problems? You bet. Thesetypes of reactions are called hidden food allergies, and they could be hamperingyour efforts for a better body.My patient Mark had ADD and symptoms of anxiety and depression. He explainedthat whenever he ate foods with MSG, he became violent. To see why this washappening, we scanned his brain twice—once having avoided anything with MSG andonce after he ate a Chinese dinner laced with MSG. The MSG scan showed a markeddifference in activity in Mark’s left temporal lobe, the area associated withtemper control. I told Mark he could either stay away from MSG or takemedication to prevent the problem. To my surprise, he opted for the medication.He explained that if he lost his temper one more time, his wife was going todivorce him, and “you never know what has MSG in it. Sometimes it is listed onthe label as natural flavorings.” If you have problems with your temper, youmight want to hold the MSG.Although Mark’s case is extreme, sensitivity to food additives, such as MSG,artificial sweeteners, or food colorings, is probably more widespread than werealize. As far as food allergies go, the most common culprits are peanuts,milk, eggs, soy, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, and wheat. These eight foodsaccount for 90 percent of all food-allergic reactions. Other foods commonlyassociated with allergies include corn, chocolate, tea, coffee, sugar, yeast,citrus fruits, pork, rye, beef, tomato, and barley.ACTION STEPIf you suspect a food allergy or sensitivity, try an elimination diet.Physical symptoms that might tip you off to a food allergy or sensitivityinclude dark circles under the eyes, puffy eyes, headaches or migraines, redears, fatigue, joint pain, chronic sinus problems (congestion or runny nose), orgastrointestinal issues. Behavioral problems that can be caused by foods includeaggression, sleep problems, lack of concentration, and changes in speechpatterns (turning into a motormouth or slurring words).When a food allergy or food sensitivity is suspected, a medical professional mayrecommend an elimination diet. An elimination diet removes all common problemfoods for a period of one or more weeks. These diets aren’t easy to followbecause they’re very restrictive. After the initial diet period, potentialallergens are reintroduced one by one. Foods that cause abnormal behaviors orphysical symptoms should be permanently eliminated from the diet. Working with anutritionist may make a big difference.Here’s how an elimination diet worked for a thirty-seven-year-old woman whocomplained of fatigue, anxiety, and panic attacks. When she went on theelimination diet, all of these symptoms disappeared. After reintroducing foodsto her diet, she discovered that sugar, corn, cheese, and grapefruit caused hersymptoms to flare up. Now, as long as she avoids these foods, she remainssymptom-free.In a 2008 study from Holland, researchers found that putting children with ADDon a restricted elimination diet reduced their symptoms by more than 50 percentin 73 percent of them. This is basically the same effectiveness as prescriptionADD medication without any of the side effects. Basically, during the study, thechildren could eat only rice, turkey, lamb, vegetables, fruits, margarine,vegetable oil, tea, pear juice, and water. But the results were stunning. Inthis study the researchers also found that the children’s moods and oppositionalbehaviors were improved.In 2003, a SPECT study was performed to determine if eliminating problem foodscould affect brain function. The study tested cerebral blood flow in thirtypeople with celiac disease (an intolerance for wheat and wheat products). Halfof them had been following a gluten-free diet for almost one year, while theother half had not eliminated gluten from their diet. Twenty-four healthyindividuals were also tested as a control group. Researchers concluded that theceliac patients who followed a gluten-free diet were significantly less likelyto experience decreased cerebral blood flow than those who continued to eatgluten. Only 7 percent of the patients who eliminated gluten from their dietexperienced lower blood flow in at least one area of the brain, compared to 73percent of those who continued to eat gluten showing reduced blood flow in atleast one area of the brain. Once again, this shows that the foods you eatdirectly affect your brain.In my practice, I’ve found that many adults and children with emotional,learning, or behavioral problems improve when they eliminate specific foods orfood additives from their diets. In particular, I work with many children whohave autism or Asperger’s syndrome. When I put these kids on a diet free ofgluten (wheat, barley, rye, oats, and any products made from these grains) andcasein (milk protein and all dairy products), I’ve noticed that some of theirbehavioral problems diminish and their language tends to improve.TREAT EATING DISORDERS EARLYEating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia, and obesity, are verycommon. It is estimated that seven million women and one million men areaffected by anorexia nervosa and bulimia. Obesity was discussed in the priorchapter. People with anorexia nervosa starve themselves, which causes extremeweight loss. Even though they may look emaciated, people with the disorder maystill be convinced they are too fat. People who have bulimia engage in a viciouscycle of binge eating and purging, either self-inducing vomiting or usinglaxatives, diuretics, or enemas to eliminate what they’ve consumed. They mayalso exercise excessively in order to burn off the calories consumed in a binge.These conditions can have devastating consequences on health and brain function.Treating eating disorders early is key to recovery and a healthier life.The Nutrition SolutionAntinutrition Boosters Nutrition Boosters Low blood sugar Frequent small mealswith at least some protein to maintain healthy blood sugar Dehydration Adequatehydration Overeating CRON (calorie restriction with optimal nutrition) Transfats Monounsaturated fats Saturated fats Polyunsaturated fats Simple carbsComplex carbs Sugar Low-glycemic foods Artificial sweeteners Natural sweetenersExcessive caffeine Limited caffeine Empty calories Antioxidants High-saltprocessed foods Fruits and vegetables with potassium Office vending machineproducts Healthy snacks from home Junk food Multivitamins and fish oil Foodallergens Elimination dietSee http://www.amenclinics.com/my-brain-health/foods-recipes/shopping-list/[http://www.amenclinics.com/my-brain-health/foods-recipes/shopping-list/] for alist of ways to be a “brain-healthy” shopper at the supermarket.

Theyhunted animals for food, tended to their gardens, built their own homes, andwalked wherever they had to go. In our thoroughly modern world, we drive towork, sit at a desk all day, drive home, and loaf around on the couch. We’vealmost completely eliminated movement from our day-to-day lives. This is badnews for our brains—not to mention our bellies, our butts, and our backs.If you want to have a healthy brain and body, you’ve got to get off your buttand move! Physical activity is the single most important thing you can do toenhance brain function and keep your body looking young. Whether you are sixyears old or ninety-six years old, exercise acts like a fountain of youth. Ifyou can only follow one of the solutions in this book, make it this one.THE MANY WAYS PHYSICAL EXERCISE PUMPS UP YOUR BRAINPOWERPhysical exercise acts like a natural wonder drug for the brain. It improves theheart’s ability to pump blood throughout the body, which increases blood flow tothe brain. That supplies more oxygen, glucose, and nutrients to the brain, whichenhances overall brain function. The number of ways that physical exercisebenefits the brain is truly remarkable. Here are just some of the thingsexercise can do for your brain and body.Exercise encourages the growth of new brain cells. Aerobic activity that getsthe heart rate up for extended periods of time boosts brain-derived neurotrophicfactor (BDNF), a chemical that plays a role in neurogenesis, or the growth ofnew brain cells. Think of BDNF as a sort of Miracle-Gro for your brain. When youexercise, your brain sprouts new cells. When your brain doesn’t create as manynew cells as it loses, aging occurs.Research studies on laboratory rats show that exercise generates new brain cellsin the temporal lobes (involved in memory) and the prefrontal cortex (involvedin planning and judgment). These new cells survive for about four weeks, thendie off unless they are stimulated. If you stimulate these new neurons throughmental or social interaction, they connect to other neurons and enhancelearning. This indicates that it is necessary to exercise consistently toencourage continual new cell growth in the brain. It also explains why peoplewho work out at the gym and then go to the library are smarter than people whoonly work out at the gym.Physical activity enhances cognitive ability at all ages. No matter how old youare, exercise increases your memory, your ability to think clearly, and yourability to plan. In Dr. John J. Ratey’s book Spark, he details how arevolutionary physical education program at a school in Naperville, Illinois,has transformed the student body into some of the smartest kids in the nation.In 1999, eighth graders there took an international standards test called TIMSS(Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study), which focuses on mathand science. For years, U.S. students have been lagging far behind pupils fromother nations—including Japan, Korea, Singapore, and China—in these twosubjects. The Naperville eighth graders defied that trend, ranking first in theworld in science and sixth in math. Compare those results to U.S. students’national rankings of eighteenth in science and nineteenth in math.What’s so special about Naperville’s PE program? It sidelines traditional sportsin favor of high-intensity aerobic activity—a brief warm-up, a one-mile run, anda cool-down. The only rule: Students must keep their average heart rate above185 for the mile-long run. The burst of activity is obviously paying off. I hopeother schools from around the country take notice and start implementing similarPE programs. I highly recommend that you pick up a copy of Spark to learn moreabout the many ways this fitness program is benefiting the students.There’s a lot more evidence that exercise boosts brainpower. In 2005, theCalifornia Department of Education (CDE) released a study that compared therelationship between physical fitness and academic achievement. The studyrevealed that students in the fifth, seventh, and ninth grades with the highestfitness levels also scored highest on standardized reading and math tests. Onthe other end of the scale, the students in these grades who were the leastphysically fit had the lowest academic test scores.In a 2005 issue of Pediatrics, a panel of thirteen researchers published theresults of a large-scale review of 850 studies about the effects of exercise onthe nation’s youth. The panel concluded that for optimal academic performance,school-age children should participate daily in one hour or more of moderate tovigorous exercise that includes a variety of physical activities.Another study, published in Brain Research, found that physically fitthirteen-and fourteen-year-olds showed significantly greater cognitiveprocessing ability than their couch-potato peers. A host of other studies havefound a laundry list of benefits tied to exercise. Physical activity boostsmemory in young women aged eighteen to twenty-five, and it improves frontal lobefunction in older adults. Getting your body moving also protects the short-termmemory structures in the temporal lobes (hippocampus) from high-stressconditions. Stress causes the adrenal glands to produce excessive amounts of thehormone cortisol, which has been found to kill cells in the hippocampus andimpair memory. In fact, people with Alzheimer’s disease have higher cortisollevels than do normal aging people.Exercise enhances your mood. People who exercise consistently report a generalsense of well-being that people who lead a sedentary lifestyle do notexperience. Getting your heart pumping allows more of the natural mood-enhancingamino acid L-tryptophan to enter the brain. L-tryptophan is the precursor to theneurotransmitter serotonin, which balances moods. It is a relatively small aminoacid, and it often has to compete with larger amino acids to cross the bloodchannels into the brain. With exercise, the muscles of the body utilize thelarger amino acids and decrease the competition for L-tryptophan to enter thebrain, which makes you feel better.Exercise helps alleviate depression. In any given year, almost fifteen millionAmerican adults and about 5 percent of children and adolescents experience majordepressive disorder. Millions of these adults and children turn to prescriptionmedication for help, and antidepressants have become the most commonlyprescribed drug in the nation, according to a study by the U.S. Centers forDisease Control and Prevention. What would you say if I told you that exercisecan be as effective as prescription medicine in treating depression?ACTION STEPFor depression or mood troubles, try exercise first before you consider takingantidepressants.I teach a course for people who suffer from depression, and one of the mainthings we cover is the importance of exercise in warding off this condition. Iencourage all of these patients to start exercising and especially to engage inaerobic activity that gets the heart pumping. The results are truly amazing.Over time, many of these patients who have been taking antidepressant medicationfor years feel so much better that they are able to wean off the medicine.The antidepressant benefits of exercise have been documented in medicalliterature. One study compared the benefits of exercise to those of theprescription antidepressant drug Zoloft. After twelve weeks, exercise provedequally effective as Zoloft in curbing depression. After ten months, exercisesurpassed the effects of the drug. Minimizing symptoms of depression isn’t theonly way physical exercise outshined Zoloft.Like all prescription medications for depression, Zoloft is associated withnegative side effects, such as sexual dysfunction and lack of libido. Plus,taking Zoloft may ruin your ability to qualify for health insurance. Finally,popping a prescription pill doesn’t help you learn any new skills. On thecontrary, exercise improves your fitness, your shape, and your health, whichalso boosts self-esteem. It doesn’t affect your insurability, and it allows youto gain new skills. If anyone in your family has feelings of depression,exercise can help.The power of exercise to combat depression is yet another reason why I thinkschools need to make physical education a requirement for all grades. If 5percent of kids and adolescents suffer from depression, why not get them to tryexercise as a way to reduce or eliminate their need for medication? Gettingdepressed kids to take part in PE could even prove to be a life-saver. Considerthis fascinating report from the Secret Service: National Threat AssessmentCenter on school shootings. The researchers examined thirty-seven schoolshootings involving forty-one perpetrators between the ages of eleven andtwenty-one. Aside from the fact that all the shooters were male, what was theone and only characteristic they shared? A history of depression. More than halfof the shooters reported having experienced feelings of depression. In fact, 75percent of them had threatened to commit suicide or had actually tried to killthemselves before they carried out their attacks.Exercise calms worries and anxiety. Anxiety disorders are very common in theUnited States, affecting approximately forty million adults and as many as onein ten young people. Millions more of us spend far too much time worrying aboutthe little things in life. When worry or negative thoughts take over, exercisecan provide a welcome distraction. Research shows that high-intensity activitycan soothe anxiety and reduce the incidence of panic attacks. If, for example,you or your family members are stressing out about an upcoming test or dwellingon an argument you had, physical activity can help clear your mind.Exercise helps prevent, delay, and lessen the effects of dementia andAlzheimer’s disease. Canadian researchers conducted a large-scale, five-yearstudy to determine the association between physical activity and the risk ofcognitive impairment and dementia. From 1991/1992 to 1996/1997, they gatheredinformation on 4,615 men and women sixty-five years or older. The researchersevaluated the participants at the study’s debut and again at its conclusion fiveyears later. The results showed that 3,894 participants remained withoutcognitive impairment, 436 were diagnosed as having cognitive impairment but nodementia (mild cognitive impairment), and 285 were diagnosed as having dementia.Physical activity was associated with lower risks of cognitive impairment,Alzheimer’s disease, and dementia of any type. High levels of physical activitywere associated with even further reduced risks. The researchers concluded thatregular physical activity could represent an important and potent protectivefactor against cognitive decline and dementia in elderly people.A number of other studies support these findings and show that physical exerciseprevents or delays the cognitive decline associated with dementia andAlzheimer’s disease. Research has shown that in people over sixty-five, mild tomoderate exercise reduces the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia due toAlzheimer’s disease by about 50 percent. A study conducted at Case WesternReserve University examined how much TV people watch each day, which correlatesinversely to their exercise level—the more TV people watch, the less they tendto exercise. People in the study who watched two or more hours of TV a day(couch potatoes) were twice as likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease. Incontrast, people over forty years of age who exercised at least thirty minutesper session two or more times a week reaped many protective benefits.ACTION STEPIf you are over the age of sixty-five, it is even more important for you toexercise if you want to delay or prevent cognitive decline.People already suffering from dementia or Alzheimer’s disease may also seerewards from physical activity. Australian researchers found thatmemory-impaired older adults who followed a six-month exercise programexperienced a decrease in cognitive decline over an eighteen-month follow-upperiod.Exercise eases symptoms of ADD. The best natural treatment for ADD is physicalexercise. In my experience, I have seen a direct correlation between the levelof exercise a person gets and the severity of their symptoms. I have noticedthat when my patients exercise on a regular basis, their ADD medication worksbetter. In particular, I work with a lot of children and adolescents with ADD.In the spring, these patients will sometimes complain that their medicationsaren’t working as effectively as before. When I hear this, I always ask them ifthey’ve changed their exercise routine. Often, they will tell me that they hadbeen playing basketball, a highly aerobic sport, but the season ended, so theyaren’t doing any physical activity at the moment. When I get them to exerciseagain, their medication starts working better again. I could just as easilyraise the dosage of their medication, but there are side effects associated withthat. Exercising has no side effects and a wealth of benefits, so I prefertrying that route first.If you want more proof that exercise is a great natural treatment for ADD, lookat Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps. Diagnosed with ADD at the age of nine,Phelps had trouble concentrating in class and struggled with his schoolwork. Hestarted taking prescription stimulant medication for ADD to ease his symptoms.In the sixth grade, he told his mother he wanted to stop taking the medication.By then, he was spending hours a day swimming in the pool, and thanks to theintense aerobic activity, he managed to stay focused without medication.Physical fitness sparks better behavior in adolescents. Researchers at theUniversity of California, Irvine, studied 146 healthy adolescents to determinethe effects of physical exercise on their lives. The results showed that teenswho were more physically fit were less impulsive, felt happier, and were morelikely to do good things with their lives than their less-fit peers.People who exercise regularly sleep better. Regardless of your age, engaging inexercise on a routine basis normalizes melatonin production in the brain andimproves sleeping habits. If you’ve ever watched your kids horse around in thebackyard for hours and then collapse into bed at night, you know how true thisis. In Chapter 10 [Amen_9780307463593_epub_c10_r1.htm], you will learn whysleeping is critical for maintaining optimal brain function throughout yourlifetime. Remember, although regular exercise is advised, it is best to avoiddoing vigorous exercise too close to bedtime. Try to complete physical activityabout four hours before going to bed.Exercise helps women cope with hormonal changes. Evidence shows that regularexercise tends to minimize symptoms associated with PMS. It also helps womendeal with the hormonal fluctuations that occur during pregnancy, perimenopause,and menopause.EXERCISE IS KEY TO BETTER HEALTH, BETTER ENERGY, AND A BETTER MOODExercise promotes better health and helps you live longer. Regular exerciseincreases the chemical nitric oxide, which tells the smooth muscles in yourblood vessels to relax and open, allowing blood to flow more freely throughoutyour body. You probably never think of your blood vessels as having muscles, butthey do. Every time you exercise, you give your blood vessels a workout too.With consistent exercise, your blood vessels become more robust. That helps keepblood pulsing to your heart, organs, and tissues. This boosts the health ofvital organs and reduces the risk for high blood pressure, stroke, and heartdisease—all of which have been linked to cognitive decline.Physical activity also enhances insulin’s ability to prevent high blood sugarlevels, thereby reducing the risk of diabetes. In addition, exercise increasesthe production of glutathione, which is the major antioxidant in all cells.Pumping up the levels of glutathione protects muscles and other tissues fromfree radical damage and premature aging. Research has also shown that mild tomoderate exercise reduces your risk of developing osteoporosis, breast cancer,and colon cancer. For the elderly, physical activity improves muscle tone andendurance, which lowers the risk of falling.ACTION STEPTo increase energy, trade in your caffeine for a daily workout.When you make exercise a habit, it also pumps up your energy levels and keepsyou from feeling lethargic. Instead of sprawling on the couch all day, you willhave a good helping of get-up-and-go. That makes you more likely to go out anddo the things you love to do, which burns even more calories and keeps youlooking and feeling good.ADD EXERCISE TO YOUR BEAUTY REGIMENWhat’s good for the brain is good for the heart is good for the genitals is goodfor the skin. Exercise improves blood flow to every organ in your body, so itmakes sense that it would benefit your skin, which is the largest organ. Thanksto increased circulation, greater amounts of oxygen and nutrients are deliveredto your skin cells. This encourages cell renewal and the production of collagen,the supportive protein that helps keep your skin from sagging and wrinkling. Italso helps skin battle back against the daily assaults from pollution and otherenvironmental toxins. Some forms of exercise, such as yoga, help keep acnebreakouts at bay. How? Yoga and other types of exercise reduce stress, whichminimizes the production of stress hormones that are often associated with acneflare-ups.Improved blood flow also gives your skin a rosy-looking glow. According to ateam of researchers at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, peopleperceive a rosier complexion as healthier and potentially more attractive. Thestudy, featured in the journal Psychological Science, involved havingcollege-age participants alter the color of faces in digital photos to make themappear healthier. The researchers found that the students almost invariablyadded redness to the faces to enhance the appearance. This is more evidence thatexercising does more than just improve your shape—it makes you more attractive.ACTION STEPIf you think you look too old and are considering a face-lift or laser treatmentto rejuvenate your appearance, try exercise first in order to boost blood flowto your skin.In an animal study conducted at the University of Illinois, researchers foundthat moderate regular exercise has another benefit for the skin: it speeds thewound-healing process. The researchers concluded that exercise speeded healingtimes by decreasing inflammation. For people such as diabetics who typicallyhave poor wound healing, this study shows that exercise can be especiallybeneficial.GET MOVING TO BURN FATTo melt away fat, you need to burn more calories than you consume, and exercisecan help. A quick review of the scientific literature on the effect of exerciseon fat reveals thousands of studies showing that physical activity helps youlose weight. Engaging in aerobic exercise also increases your body’s metabolism,which boosts your calorie-burning power. Metabolism is a complex process thatconverts the foods you eat into energy and also determines how quickly you burnthat energy. Daily exercise and activity that builds muscle tissue help you burnmore calories, which allows you to prevent weight gain or to shed a few poundsif that’s your goal. When you exercise, your body looks and feels better, whichmakes you feel better about yourself. Other physical benefits include bettercoordination, agility, speed, and flexibility.ACTION STEPTo burn more calories, add physical activity to your daily routine.EXERCISING LEADS TO MORE BRAIN-AND BODY-HEALTHY CHOICESDid you know that when you are physically active, you are more likely to eatfoods that are good for you, to get more sleep, and to take better care of yourhealth in general? One study examined the effects of a twelve-week exerciseprogram on sixty-two university students. At the end of three months, thestudents who engaged in physical activity reported eating a healthier diet,taking more responsibility for their own health, seeking out more socialsupport, and managing stress better.ACTION STEPIf you want to quit smoking, stop drinking, calm stress, or eat a healthierdiet, exercising can help you achieve these goals.In a remarkable study that was published in a 2006 issue of Pediatrics,researchers found that compared to teens who watch a lot of TV, those who takepart in a wide variety of physical activities are less likely to engage in riskybehavior, such as drinking, smoking, drugs, violence, sex, and delinquency. Thisfascinating study also revealed that teens who participated in physicalactivities with their parents were the least likely to get into trouble withsuch behavior. These teens also tended to have higher self-esteem than bothsedentary teens and active adolescents who didn’t exercise or play sports withtheir parents. Conversely, the study showed that teens who spent a lot of timewatching TV or playing video games tended to be at higher risk for engaging inall of these risky behaviors and had lower self-esteem.This research reinforces what I’ve been advocating for years: Turn off the TVand the video games, and get active.WHY COUCH POTATO SYNDROME IS BAD FOR YOUR BRAIN AND BODYAdopting a sedentary lifestyle is one of the worst things you can do for yourbrain, your overall health, and your body. Lack of physical exercise negativelyaffects blood flow in the body. When you don’t get your blood pumping thanks toaerobic activities, the levels of nitric oxide drop. This causes the bloodvessel walls to become distorted, which limits blood’s ability to pulse freely.This puts you at increased risk for heart disease, high blood pressure, andstroke.Without adequate blood flow, the blood vessels in the deep areas of the brainalso become distorted, increasing the risk of tiny strokes. As the years go by,these tiny strokes accumulate and cause these deep brain areas to shut off andstop working. The deep brain areas control leg movement, coordinated bodymovement, and speed of thinking and behaving. These are some of the areas of thebrain that are affected by Parkinson’s disease, which explains why these strokesproduce a clinical picture that closely resembles this disease. This explainswhy people over the age of forty who don’t exercise aren’t as mentally sharp asthose who are physically active.Being a couch potato also makes you more vulnerable to high blood pressure,which in turn increases the risk of developing other brain-related healthproblems. New research in the journal Neurology shows that people as young asforty-five with hypertension are more likely to experience problems with memoryand thinking skills. In particular, middle-aged people with high diastolic bloodpressure (the number on the bottom) are at greater risk than people with normalreadings. For every 10-percent increase in the diastolic reading, the odds of anindividual having cognitive problems jumped by about 7 percent. With nearlytwenty thousand people involved in this study, it is the largest to investigatethe link between hypertension and memory problems.These findings support those of the Honolulu Study of Aging, which concludedthat middle-aged people between the ages of forty and sixty who have untreatedhigh blood pressure are at greater risk for developing dementia. For middle-agedpeople with a systolic blood pressure of 160 mmHg or higher, or a diastolicblood pressure of 90 mmHg or higher, the risk of dementia after age seventy was3.8 to 4.8 times greater than for those whose hypertension was treated. Thedamage from inactivity can be devastating. Basically, when you shun exercise,you can say good-bye to all the brain, health, and body benefits you read aboutearlier in this chapter.BEST KINDS OF EXERCISEThe best exercises combine aerobic activity to raise your heart rate and getyour blood pumping, resistance to strengthen muscles, and coordination toactivate your brain.Cardiovascular exercise Aerobic exercise is one of the keys to brain health andplays a role in neurogenesis, or new cell growth. Ideally, aerobic exerciseinvolves a brief warm-up period, twenty to forty-five minutes of sustainedmoderate to intense activity, and a cool-down. Some evidence suggests thathigher-intensity activity—even for shorter periods of time—is also beneficial tothe brain. Running, fast walking, swimming, rowing, and stair climbing are justsome of the many aerobic exercise options available.Your brain will benefit whether you get your heart pumping outdoors or in thegym. Animal studies show that running on a treadmill produced a significantenhancement in memory, similar to the cognitive improvements seen in outdooraerobic activities. One of the best things about many aerobic activities is theydon’t require a lot of expensive equipment—you just throw on a pair of runningshoes and go.Resistance training For many years, experts have been touting the benefits ofaerobic activity on the brain. According to a new study published in the BritishJournal of Sports Medicine, it appears that resistance training may also haveprotective powers for the brain. After a review of three exercise trials,researchers concluded that resistance training may prevent cognitive decline inolder adults. Resistance training builds strength and tones muscles by workingagainst any type of resistance, such as dumbbells, medicine balls, resistancetubing, or your own body weight. For example, you can use your own body weightto build strength by doing push-ups, pull-ups, or squats. Someresistance-training exercises—rowing, swimming, and stair climbing—double asaerobic activities, which makes them even more beneficial to your brain.Coordination activities Exercise that requires coordination activates thecerebellum, which is located at the back of the brain and enhances thinking,cognitive flexibility, and processing speed. This means that participating inactivities like dancing, tennis, and basketball, which require coordination, canmake you smarter! And that’s not all. Animal studies have shown that physicalexercise that involves the planning and execution of complex movements actuallychanges the brain’s structure.Researchers from Brazil put this theory to the test when they compared thebrains of competitive judo players and non-judo participants. Judo is a form ofmartial arts that relies on quick reactions and cunning to outsmart andoutmaneuver an opponent. (I think judo is a wonderful activity as long as youdon’t engage in any sort of contact that could result in a brain injury.)Results of the study showed that the judo players had significantly higher graymatter tissue density than people who didn’t practice judo. More gray mattertranslates into more brain cell bodies, which equals better brain function.Combo exercises It is a good idea to engage in various types of exercises.Aerobic activity spawns new brain cells, which might make you think that if youwant to boost your brainpower, you should limit your workouts to high-intensityaerobics. But it is coordination exercises that strengthen the connectionsbetween those new cells so your brain can recruit them for other purposes, suchas thinking, learning, and remembering.THE WORLD’S BEST BRAIN SPORTSMy favorite physical activity is table tennis, which also happens to be theworld’s best brain sport. It is highly aerobic and gets both the upper and lowerbody moving in every which way—twisting, bending down low, reaching up high, andshuffling from side to side. Plus, it gives your brain one heckuva workout. Itis great for hand-eye coordination and reflexes (cerebellum and parietal lobes).You have to focus (prefrontal cortex) so you can track the ball through space(parietal lobes and occipital lobes), figure out spins (parietal lobes andoccipital lobes), and plan shots and strategies (prefrontal cortex andcerebellum). Then you have to follow through and execute those tacticssuccessfully (prefrontal cortex and cerebellum). All the while, you have to staycalm so you don’t get too nervous on game point (basal ganglia). And you can’tdwell on that point you blew a few minutes ago (anterior cingulate gyrus) orblow your top when you make a mistake (temporal lobes). It is like aerobicchess.ACTION STEPFor better brain function, try a variety of activities that combine aerobicexercise and complex movements.One of the things I love best about table tennis is that it involves very fewbrain injuries. In 1999, I played in the U.S. National Table Tennis Tournamentwith hundreds of other players, and there wasn’t a single brain injury. Afascinating brain imaging study from Japan found that table tennis helps balanceyour brain. The researchers examined a group of people before and after playingtable tennis for a period of ten minutes. The “after” images revealed increasedactivity in the prefrontal cortex, the thoughtful part of your brain, and thecerebellum.Another reason why I’m such a fan of table tennis is that it is a sport thewhole family can play. I was lucky enough to have a Ping-Pong table in mybackyard when I was growing up, and I played a lot as a child with my siblingsand my parents. My mother was a fierce competitor with lightning-fast reflexes,and she usually reigned as queen of the court. I always had such a great timeplaying that I never realized that I was “exercising,” or improving my brainfunction. It was just fun.Other great brain sports include dancing and tennis. Dancing is very aerobic andis especially good for your brain if you are learning new steps rather than justgrooving to the music. That’s why taking classes in ballroom, hip-hop, or jazzdancing where you have to memorize routines is ideal. Tennis, like table tennis,is a high-intensity activity that pumps up your brainpower. The main differenceis that traditional tennis is slower so your reflexes don’t get as much of aworkout as they do with table tennis.ACTION STEPAlways choose brain-safe sports and activities.MOVE IT! START AN EXERCISE PLAN NOWThere’s no time like the present to get on the move to better brain-body healththrough exercise. If you are new to fitness, ease into it gradually. Trying todo too much too fast can lead to injuries and burnout. It is just like when youwere a kid. You had to crawl before you walked, and you had to use trainingwheels before you could ride a two-wheeler bike.Making exercise a habit takes time. A habit is a series of actions your brainexecutes—when you tell it to do so—relatively automatically and without effort.It takes numerous repetitions before your brain learns to perform a functionautomatically. The best chance of making exercise a habit is to schedule aspecific time and place to exercise each day or at least on several specificdays each week. This doesn’t mean you have to do the same form of exercise eachtime. In fact, it is better to vary your routine. This prevents boredom andhelps keep you motivated. After a few months of sticking to the routine, youwill find that you no longer think about whether or not to work out; you just doit. By this time, exercise will have become a habit that will help keep yourbrain and body healthy for a lifetime.ACTION STEPMake it a rule to exercise. Don’t give yourself the option of exercising or not.It should be a daily habit just like brushing your teeth.FIND THE BEST PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES FOR YOUR BRAINWhen it comes to exercise, one type doesn’t fit all. Depending on your brain,you may gravitate toward exciting, stimulating, competitive, or even dangerousactivities or you might be more inclined to seek out calming, soothing, orsolitary activities. Whatever type of exercise suits you, make sure you get anaerobic workout at least three times a week for at least twenty minutes. Forexample, if you find that yoga helps you focus and calm stress, do it! Justremember that yoga doesn’t usually get your heart rate up high enough foraerobic benefit. So, if you love yoga, alternate that with sessions of aerobicexercise.See the following chart to find physical activities that are good for your braintype.ACTION STEPTry physical activities that can help heal your brain and keep your body lookinggreat.If you have:PFC problems (ADD, short attention span, impulsiveness, poor planning)Try this type of exercise:LOTS of high-intensity aerobic activities, table tennis, meditationBasal ganglia problems (anxiety, panic attacks, constant worry)Yoga, aerobic activityDeep limbic problems (depression, PMS)Aerobic activity in social activities such as dancingACG problems(holding grudges, getting stuckon negative thoughts)Intense aerobic exercise to boost serotoninTemporal lobe problems (memory troubles)Dancing or aerobics classes that involve music stepsCerebellum problems (slow thinking)Coordination exercisesHere are more brain-friendly activities from which to choose. * Table tennis * Tennis * Dancing and dance classes * Dance Dance Revolution (this is one video game that earns my seal of approval) * Running * Walking * Golf (walk the course quickly; no carts, please!) * Hiking * Frisbee * Swimming * Basketball * Volleyball * Jumping rope * Walking the dog * Running/walking for charity * Working out at the gym * Aerobics classes * Badminton * Martial arts (no contact, and please don’t break boards with your forehead!)Remember that whichever activities you choose, the idea is to drive up yourheart rate. Any of the activities on this list can provide aerobic benefits—ifyou put enough effort into them. Many people make the mistake of thinking thatthe sport they play as a hobby fulfills their exercise quota, but it depends onthe sport and the intensity you put into it.I once outlined a nutrition and exercise program as part of a treatment plan foran overweight patient. After several weeks on the plan, he complained to me thathe wasn’t losing any weight even though he was exercising more than ever. When Iasked him what kind of exercise he was getting, he told me he was playing twowhole rounds of golf a week. I had to break it to him that although walking agolf course is physical activity, it often doesn’t count as aerobic activitybecause you have to stop all the time to hit the ball. He looked at me like Iwas nuts and said, “I don’t walk the course. I get out of the cart, walk to hitthe ball, then get back in the cart. That’s a lot of activity, hopping in andout of that cart!”Even though golf isn’t the best aerobic exercise, it is a great recreationalactivity that gets your brain working. You can always fuel the intensity bywalking the course very quickly and doing a few jumping jacks or push-ups whilewaiting your turn (as long as you don’t distract the other players).When choosing physical activities, always keep brain safety in mind. Forexample, martial arts provide a high-intensity workout involving coordinationand discipline. That’s great for the brain, but only if there isn’t any contactinvolved. To protect your brain, avoid martial arts classes that includesparring with other participants or stupid stunts like breaking boards with yourforehead.Getting involved in brain-friendly sports is easy. If you want to try tabletennis, the best brain sport in the world, get a table and start hostingfriendly competitions at home, at the office, or at school. Or join one of themany table tennis clubs located throughout the nation. To find a local club,visit the United States of America Table Tennis (USATT) website (www.usatt.org[http://www.usatt.org]). I often recommend getting a USATT coach to ramp upskill quickly. The game is faster, more fun, and more challenging if you playwell. Plus, whenever you do something well, you want to do more of it.ACTION STEPOrganized sports, gym workouts, and recreational activities aren’t the only waysto inject physical activity into your daily life. Try these simple tricks to addmore exercise to your day: * Take the stairs instead of the escalator or elevator. * Walk to work or school. * Do the housework at a quick pace. * Use a jogging stroller or baby backpack and walk to the store instead of driving. * Rake leaves, pull weeds, and mow the lawn.You may notice that many common physical activities aren’t included on the listabove. Biking may be one of the most popular aerobic activities, but it alsohappens to be the number one cause for head injuries. I have seen far too manySPECT scans of brains that have been damaged by bike accidents. If youabsolutely must ride a bike, wear a helmet that fits correctly. Helmets thatdon’t fit provide little to no protection. Skateboarding is another activitythat isn’t advised. One of the worst brain scans I have ever seen is of a youngskateboarder who wasn’t wearing a helmet. He lost nearly all function inapproximately one-fourth of his frontal lobe. His life will never be the same.NO EXCUSESI recommend exercise as part of a treatment plan to many of my patients, and Ican tell you that I’ve heard every excuse in the book as to why they can’texercise.ACTION STEPStop using excuses to avoid exercise. In many cases, exercise will helpeliminate or minimize the source of your excuse, such as pain or healthconditions.“My back aches.”“My knees hurt.”“My feet hurt.”“I don’t have the time.”“I’m too tired.”“I’m not very coordinated.”“I don’t like to sweat.”“I have a health condition.”“I hate exercise.” Pain is one of the most common excuses I hear. Our scans have taught me thatthe use of chronic pain medications, such as Vicodin or OxyContin, is harmful tobrain function. The brains of people who use these medications on a long-termbasis look very similar to the brains of alcoholics. If you suffer from backpain, neck pain, or any other kind of pain, consider natural supplements thatmay ease your discomfort. Some of my patients have experienced pain relief fromSAMe. In my practice, I have found that some patients get stuck on the pain. Itis all they can think about. For these individuals, 5-HTP, which boostsserotonin, and fish oil may help get them unstuck.The Exercise SolutionExercise Robbers Exercise Boosters Fatigue Adequate sleep (at least seven hours)Chronic pain Natural pain relief (SAMe, fish oil, 5-HTP, no artificialsweeteners) Lack of time Making exercise a priority Lack of coordinationPracticing coordination activities Lack of focus Clearly focused, written goalsBad habits, giving in Practicing willpower Depression Any physical activityBeing in denial about problems Effectively treating any brain problems"},{"pageContent":"PART THREE[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_line_r1.jpg]CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, BEAUTIFY AND STRENGTHEN YOUR BODY"},{"pageContent":"6THE SKIN SOLUTIONBRAIN SIGNALS TO SOOTHE AND SMOOTH YOUR SKINThe health of your skin is an outside reflection of the health of your brain.On a rare, sunny, glorious, fall day in Seattle, my friend Cynthia, whom I hadknown for the past twelve years, greeted me at the front entrance of the lecturehall. Cynthia was the founder of ADD Resources, a support group for people andfamilies affected by attention deficit disorder. I had spoken to her group manytimes. Cynthia, who has ADD herself, is famous for saying exactly what is on hermind. You always know what Cynthia is thinking. As I hugged her hello, she said,“I have to know what you are taking. Your skin is beautiful.”I blushed. “Fish oil and sleep,” I said.“That’s it,” she said.“That is a big part of it,” I replied. “Plus, I eat a brain-healthy diet,exercise, don’t believe every stupid thought that comes into my head, and dealwith the stress in my life without caffeine or alcohol.”The health of your skin is directly tied to the health of your brain. People,especially women, spend so much time and money working on their skin, when thefirst organ you want to take care of to have great-looking skin is your brain.The cosmetics counter, the dermatologist, the plastic surgeon—this is where yourun when you want to reverse the aging process. But skin-care products, lasertreatments, and the scalpel are often only temporary fixes. The real fix lies inyour brain. It is your brain that tells your skin to produce more or less oil.It is your brain that supervises the production of supportive collagen. And itis your brain at the command post of skin-cell regeneration. We all need to stopthinking about skin care from the outside in and start thinking about it fromthe inside out.ACTION STEPBoost blood flow to rejuvenate your skin.While writing this book, I went to my father’s eightieth-birthday party. Two ofmy childhood friends were there. One was a longtime smoker. As we stood next toeach other, I could see that his skin was deeply wrinkled. Smoking constrictsblood flow to your brain and skin and prematurely ages both. As I wrote in theIntroduction, my other friend had lost his wife to cancer a year earlier. Thechronic stress had aged him what looked like twenty years. As he complainedabout his energy and memory, I worried that his brain would look aged as well.I have often said that whatever is good for your heart is good for your brain,and whatever is bad for your heart is bad for your brain. It is all abouthealthy blood flow. Here we can definitely add that whatever is good for yourheart is good for your brain is good for your skin, and whatever is bad for yourheart is bad for your brain is bad for your skin. The same things that boostblood flow to the brain and enhance overall brain function will rejuvenate yourskin and give it a healthy glow. By the same token, many things that harm thebrain also damage your skin and make you look older.THE BRAIN-SKIN CONNECTIONYou might wonder what your brain has to do with your skin. After all, your skinis on the outside of your body, right? Isn’t it more affected by our environmentand the things we put on our faces—creams, lotions, makeup, aftershave, wrinkleremovers—than by our brains? No. Scientific evidence points to a powerfulbrain-skin connection. Your skin and brain are completely connected to eachother. It is not uncommon to hear:“He is so mad that he is turning red.”“You can tell she is embarrassed because she is blushing.”“Whenever I get upset, I break out in hives.”“I am so excited I have goose bumps.”“He must be the nervous type, because his hands are cold.”“Whenever I get nervous, my hands start to sweat.”I remember the first time I was on television. It was on a small station inConnecticut about twenty years ago. I was so nervous that I unconsciously spentthe whole interview rubbing my hands on my trousers trying to keep them dry.When I watched the video later, I was horrified.ACTION STEPCounteracting responses to stress helps you feel calm and relaxed, and makesyour skin look healthier.Scientists measure both hand temperature and skin sweat gland activity tounderstand the body’s response to stress. Lie detector tests use these two measures as part of their battery to determine when people lie. As a biofeedbacktherapist, I have spent many hours teaching my patients to both warm and drytheir hands as part of relaxation protocols. When we feel anxious or upset, ourskin temperature immediately starts to become colder and we start to sweat.UNRESOLVED EMOTIONS MAY COME OUT THROUGH YOUR SKINWhen I was a resident at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington,D.C., one of my first psychotherapy cases was a U.S. Army colonel named Bob whohad a persistent rash over his whole body that was resistant to treatment. Bobwas referred to our clinic because the rash had started shortly after his wifehad died in a car accident two years earlier. He had no idea why he needed tosee a shrink but was happy to cooperate if it could help. The rash wasinterfering with everything in his life. Plus, he noticed that whenever hebecame stressed, the rash would intensify.One of the unique features of his story was that Bob never cried over the lossof his wife. He told me he had always had problems expressing his feelings, andhe had four children at home who needed him now more than ever. After severalsessions, I decided to use hypnosis with Bob to help him with what I believed tobe unresolved grief. Bob was highly hypnotizable, which is often true of manyintelligent people. During our first hypnotic session, Bob cried for the firsttime. The tears started silently, almost reluctantly, then the sobs came, whichbecame more intense as the session progressed. The next four hypnosis sessionswere filled with tears and the expression of grief over his lost love and bestfriend. He had been so overwhelmed by having to take care of his children andhis job that his unconscious mind did not allow him to grieve, fearful he wouldlose total control. In a safe place, he allowed himself to feel the pain. Overthe next three months, his rash went away.ACTION STEPDon’t bottle up your emotions or it might cause skin problems.YOUR SKIN IS “THE BRAIN ON THE OUTSIDE”Change your brain, change your skin. Numerous studies have shown that when youexperience psychological stress, your brain responds by sending signals to yourskin to react as if it is under physical attack. This can result in a rash,flushing, blushing, or an increase in the production of protective oils and adecrease in the skin’s less-critical functions, such as hair growth. More oiland less hair growth typically equal more blemishes and thinning hair. If youare stressed out about your new job, a test, or a big date, your skin is morelikely to break out.More evidence of the brain-skin link comes from research out of Sweden, whereresearchers have found that it is possible to study the biological roots ofmental health diseases like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia by looking atcertain skin cells rather than having to take tissue samples of the brain.That’s because certain skin cells function similarly to the brain cells that arebelieved to be involved in these disorders. In a sense, this study shows thatyour skin cells mirror your brain cells.On the flip side of the brain-skin connection, your skin can change your brain.In 2008, Wake Forest University’s Gil Yosipovitch and colleagues publishedfindings from a very interesting study using brain scans to see how scratchingaffects the brain. The researchers studied what happened when thirteen healthyadults had their lower right leg gently scratched although the area didn’t itch.Participants were scanned before, during, and after the scratching sessionsusing functional MRI imaging. The scans showed that scratching activated certainareas of the brain, including the prefrontal cortex, inferior parietal lobe, andcerebellum. At the same time, it deactivated the anterior and posteriorcingulated cortices. These areas are associated with unpleasant emotions andmemories. This means that the simple act of scratching your skin changes yourbrain and can make you feel better. You might also want to try this with yourpartner or children to soothe them when they are upset.The brain-skin connection is so strong that some people have begun calling theskin “the brain on the outside.” In fact, the skin has been found to producemany of the same neuropeptides—including melatonin, serotonin, and cortisol—usedby the brain. It is clear that the health and appearance of your skin are areflection of the health of your brain.BAD BRAIN HABITS AND CONDITIONS THAT CAN CAUSE SKIN PROBLEMS AND PREMATURE AGINGWhen you look in the mirror, what do you see? If it is a face full of wrinkles,fine lines, or sagging, don’t run to the plastic surgeon just yet. Take a lookat these common brain causes of premature aging first. The same goes for thoseof you with blemishes and acne. Before you rush to the cosmetics counter for abunch of pricy acne treatments, take a moment to think about what is going oninside your body and your brain and how your lifestyle and environment areaffecting both your skin and brain. In many cases, by taking care of your brain,you will be able to improve the appearance of your skin.Caffeine Too much caffeine from coffee, tea, chocolate, or some herbalpreparations dehydrates your skin, which makes it look dry and wrinkled.Alcohol Alcohol has a dehydrating effect on the body, sapping moisture from yourskin and increasing wrinkles. It also dilates the blood vessels and capillariesin your skin. With excessive drinking, the blood vessels lose their tone andbecome permanently dilated, giving your face a flush that will not go away.Alcohol also depletes vitamin A, an important antioxidant involved in skin-cellregeneration. Alcohol abuse damages the liver and reduces its ability to removetoxins from the body, resulting in increased toxins in the body and skin thatmake you look older than you really are.Smoking Nicotine reduces blood flow to the skin, robbing it of that healthy,rosy glow. It also destroys elasticity, which promotes wrinkles. The act ofpuffing on cigarettes also adds fine lines to the area above your upper lip.Smoking for ten or more years can give you “smoker’s face.” That’s a term Dr.Douglas Model introduced in 1985 when he published a study in the BritishMedical Journal showing that he could identify long-term smokers by doingnothing more than looking at their facial features. The smoker’s face made thepeople look older than their true age and included the followingcharacteristics: lines above and below the lips, at the corners of the eyes, onthe cheeks, or on the jaw; a gaunt appearance; a grayish tone; and a reddishcomplexion. More bad news: Smokers are three times as likely to develop acertain type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma than nonsmokers,according to a study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.Poor diet The foods you eat fuel the regeneration of your skin cells, which makethemselves new every thirty days. Your skin reflects the nutritional quality ofyour diet. If you eat a diet deficient in omega-3 fatty acids, you are morelikely to look older than your age.Too much sugar Eating too many sweets and high-glycemic foods can causewrinkles. A study in the British Journal of Dermatology found that consumingsugar promotes a natural process called glycation, in which sugars attachthemselves to proteins to form harmful molecules called advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs). AGEs damage your brain and also damage collagen and elastin,the protein fibers that help keep skin firm and supple. The more sugar youconsume, the more damage to these proteins, and the more wrinkles on your face.Yo-yo dieting and massive weight loss Every time you gain weight, your skinstretches to accommodate the increased girth. When you lose weight, your skinhas to contract back to your new smaller shape. A lifetime of ups and downs inweight diminishes your skin’s elasticity until it can no longer shrink to fityour size. Gaining a lot of weight—a hundreds pounds or more—can stretch yourskin to the point of no return. After massive weight loss, you may be stuck withloose, hanging skin on your body and face.Inadequate water intake When you don’t drink enough water, your skin becomesdehydrated.ACTION STEPAvoid too much alcohol, too much caffeine, or too little water. They dehydratethe skin and make it look dull and wrinkled.Lack of sleep Without adequate rest, your skin misses out on theever-so-important rejuvenation process that occurs during sleep. The result?Premature aging of the skin, bags under the eyes, and an increase in wrinkles.Lack of exercise Being a couch potato decreases blood flow to the skin anddeprives you of the antiaging benefits of physical activity.ACTION STEPRemember that medical and psychiatric conditions can be the cause of skinproblems. Treat the cause rather than just treating the skin symptom.Stress Researchers have pinpointed a strong brain-stress-skin connection. Inresponse to stress, your brain sends signals to your skin that can result inpimples and breakouts. Scientific evidence has found that psychological stressworsens the symptoms of several common skin diseases, such as psoriasis andeczema.Unresolved emotional conflicts or post-traumatic stress disorderAs in Colonel Bob’s case above, unresolved grief or emotional conflicts causechronic stress and may be reflected in your skin. If you emotionally repress orbury your problems, they may be reflected negatively through your skin. Get helpwhen you need it.Hormonal changes The hormonal fluctuations that occur during puberty, pregnancy,PMS, perimenopause, menopause, polycystic ovarian syndrome (high testosteronelevels in some women), and andropause (low testosterone levels in men) may be atthe root of breakouts and other undesirable changes in your skin. Dry skin iscommonly associated with hypothyroidism when the thyroid gland is underactive.Untreated or undertreated psychiatric conditions Skin picking and cutting aresymptoms of certain types of mental disorders.Dementia and memory problems With impaired cognitive function, you may notremember to take medications, to wear sunscreen, or to follow a skin-healthybeauty regimen.Medications Some prescription and over-the-counter medications can affect yourskin in a negative way. For example, birth control pills may either worsen orimprove the appearance of acne and oily skin.Sun exposure The damaging rays of the sun accelerate the effects of aging andcause age spots, wrinkles, sagging, and in some cases, skin cancer. Scientificstudies show that due to our changing climate and ozone depletion, the risk forskin cancer is on the rise. Although most types of skin cancer are treatable,they may leave unsightly scars. Some sun exposure is important to get healthylevels of vitamin D. But balance is also important.Pollution and environmental toxins Daily exposure to toxins can damage yourbrain and your complexion. A study published in the International Journal ofCosmetic Science found that exposure of the skin to troposphere ozone, the majoroxidant in photochemical smog, reduced vitamin E by 70 percent. It alsoincreased lipid hydroperoxides, which are a sign of oxidative damage in cellmembranes.Climate If you live in a dry, desert area, your skin may look as parched as youfeel.TWELVE BRAIN WAYS TO GET SMOOTHER, YOUNGER-LOOKING SKIN1. Get more sleep for a better brain and skin that glows.Skin cell regeneration, in which dead skin cells are replaced with fresh newcells, revs up while you sleep to rejuvenate your skin. Getting adequate sleepis a better antiaging treatment than anything you could find at the cosmeticscounter. Sleep also repairs skin from daily pollution and toxins and helpsprevent breakouts by regulating the body’s hormones. For more on the importanceof sleep, see Chapter 10 [Amen_9780307463593_epub_c10_r1.htm], “The SleepSolution.”2. De-stress for antiaging your brain and skin.By reducing the stress in your life, you can take years off your appearance anddelay the skin’s aging process. With stress hormones under control, you arelikely to experience fewer wrinkles and breakouts. For more information on howstress affects your skin, check out Chapter 11[Amen_9780307463593_epub_c11_r1.htm], “The Stress Solution.”3. Exercise to improve both brain and skin circulation.Getting your heart pumping improves blood flow to your brain and skin. Improvedcell regeneration, collagen production, and wound healing are some of the manybenefits of enhanced circulation. Chapter 5[Amen_9780307463593_epub_c05_r1.htm], “The Exercise Solution,” included moreways that exercise improves the skin.4. Balance your hormones for better skin and brain function.Acne, dry skin, oily skin, wrinkles, sagging—these can all be signs of hormonalimbalances in your body. For example, the hormone estrogen helps delay the agingprocess to keep your skin looking firm and supple. Estrogen is responsible forcollagen crosslinking, in which collagen intertwines with other collagen to forma sort of mesh network that provides elasticity and smoothness and keeps theskin from sagging. It is similar to the way spandex works—you can stretch itout, and it will snap back to its original shape. Estrogen levels decrease withage, which causes you to lose the protection of crosslinking. This makes yourskin more similar to a delicate wool sweater—if you stretch it out, it staysstretched out and doesn’t spring back into shape. This is when gravity starts totake its toll on your face. By keeping your hormone levels in check, your skinwill be softer, smoother, and clearer. See Chapter 7[Amen_9780307463593_epub_c07_r1.htm], “The Hormone Solution,” for more onbalancing your hormones.5. Have more sex.Having great sex—and a lot of it—can boost the levels of hormones, such asestrogen and DHEA, both of which promote smoother, tighter skin. According tofascinating research, making love on a regular basis is so good for your skin,it can make you look ten years younger. More on this intriguing research inChapter 14 [Amen_9780307463593_epub_c14_r1.htm], “The Passion Solution.”6. Limit caffeine and alcohol.To keep your skin looking soft and supple, avoid any beverages that dehydrateit.7. Quit smoking—now!If you quit smoking, you can reverse some of the damage you’ve done to yourskin.8. Eat a brain-healthy diet.A diet full of brain-friendly antioxidants gives you healthier skin and enhancesthe skin-cell regeneration process.9. Maintain a healthy weight.By stabilizing your weight, your skin is more likely to maintain its tone andelasticity.10. Drink more water.Drinking an adequate amount of water keeps your skin hydrated to preventwrinkles and fine lines.11. Balance your sun exposure.Some sun is essential for healthy skin, to boost vitamin D levels in your body.Too much sun can cause premature aging and age spots. Try to get twenty minutesof good sun exposure during the day, after which you should protect yourselfwith sunscreen.12. Treat mental disorders and memory problems.When your brain works better, your skin will likely look better too. The chronicstress from having depression, anxiety, substance abuse, or attention deficitdisorder robs your skin of its vitality and elasticity. Early treatment isessential.SUPPLEMENTS TO ENHANCE YOUR BRAIN AND YOUR SKINSee Appendix C, “The Supplement Solution,” for more detailed information.Vitamin D is an essential vitamin for both your brain and skin. I have writtenabout it many times in this book in regards to brain health for mood and memory,but it is also important for your skin.Fish oil is another supplement I have written extensively about for the brain,and it is often helpful for your skin.Evening primrose oil contains an essential fatty acid called gamma-linolenicacid (GLA), which scientific evidence says can help with eczema and rashes.DMAE, also known as deanol, is an analog of the B vitamin choline. DMAE is aprecursor of the neurotransmitter of acetylcholine; it has strong effects on thecentral nervous system. DMAE is commonly used to increase the capacity ofneurons in the brain and is also thought to have antiaging properties thatdiminish wrinkles and improve the appearance of the skin.Phenylalanine is an amino acid that has been found to be helpful for depressionand pain. There is also good scientific evidence that it may be helpful forvitiligo, a chronic relatively common skin disorder that causes white patches ofskin. It occurs when the cells responsible for skin pigmentation die or becomeunable to function.Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is made naturally in the body and may protect againstcell damage in a variety of conditions. In a number of studies it has been foundto be helpful for skin issues as well.Grape seed extract comes from grape seeds that are waste products of the wineryand grape juice industries. Extensive research suggests that grape seed extractis beneficial in many areas of health because of its antioxidant ability to bondwith collagen, promoting youthful skin, elasticity, and flexibility.The Skin SolutionSkin Damagers Skin Enhancers Too much caffeine Limit caffeine Alcohol Freedomfrom alcohol Smoking No nicotine products Poor diet Brain-healthy diet Too muchsugar Reduced sugar intake Yo-yo dieting Stable weight Dehydration Adequatewater intake Lack of sleep Adequate sleep, at least seven hours Lack of exercisePhysical activity at least four or five times a week Chronic stress Meditation,deep-breathing exercises Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Therapy Hormonalimbalances Balanced hormones Thyroid conditions Balanced thyroid levelsPsychiatric conditions Treatment, such as therapy and medication Memory problemsBrain-healthy habits or treatment, such as medication Sun exposure Sun exposurelimited to twenty minutes, then wearing sunscreen Aging Supplementation withvitamin D, fish oil, evening primrose oil, DMAE, phenylalanine, alpha-lipoicacid, grape seed extract"},{"pageContent":"7THE HORMONE SOLUTIONBALANCE YOUR HORMONES TO TURN BACK THE CLOCKYour hormones play a critical role in the way you think, act, and look.Did you know that hormones have a huge impact on brain function, for both menand women? When your hormones are balanced, you tend to feel happy andenergetic. When your hormones are off, everything and everyone in your lifesuffers. For example, did you know that low thyroid hormone is associated withoverall decreased brain activity, which makes you feel depressed, irritable, andhave significant trouble thinking (Image 7.1)?Likewise, low testosterone levels have been associated with low libido,depression, and memory problems and have been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease.We are only beginning to talk about male menopause, but for many men it is areal issue that needs to be treated. Low testosterone levels may be asignificant cause of midlife crises and divorce. As his testosterone levels godown, he feels more negative, blames his wife, who is having her own hormonalissues, and looks outside of the marriage to feel young again. Of course, thenew love usually doesn’t make him happy.Low testosterone levels also affect women. I once had a female physician come upto me at a lecture and tell me that at age fifty-one she had no interest in sex,her marriage was in trouble, and her mother had just died from Alzheimer’sdisease. She had NO idea that low testosterone levels could be part of herproblem. Later she e-mailed me that her testosterone levels were near zero andthat taking testosterone made a huge difference for her sexuality, her memory,and her marriage.Image 7.1 Low Thyroid[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_019_r1.jpg]Low thyroid hormones cause overall decreased brain activity.When testosterone levels are too high, men or women can be “too competitive,”have commitment issues, be hypersexual, and struggle with acne or being tooaggressive. A common condition in women associated with too much testosterone iscalled polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). More on this in a bit.Do you believe in PMS? I have five sisters and three daughters. I believe inPMS! But it wasn’t until I met Becky that I finally had evidence that PMS was,in fact, a brain disorder. Becky came to my office after a brief stay in jail.In the week before her period, she often became moody, anxious, aggressive, andtended to drink too much. Shortly before she saw me, during the worst time ofher cycle, she got into a fight with her husband, attacked him with a knife, andwas arrested. When I met her, I decided to scan her during the worst time of hercycle, and then again two weeks later, during the best time. Becky’s scans wereradically different. During the difficult time of her cycle, her worry centerwas overactive, indicated by the arrow on Image 7.2, and her judgment center waslow in activity, which may have been why she grabbed the knife. You can see theholes in the front of her brain. During the best time of her cycle, her brainlooked much better (Image 7.3). Seeing her scans was so instructive, and ontreatment she did much better. Hormone fluctuations can change your brain andliterally rip apart your family.Image 7.2 PMS Worst Time of Cycle[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_020_r1.jpg]Image 7.3 PMS Best Time of Cycle[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_021_r1.jpg]This view is looking down from the top, where gray is average activity and whiteis the top 15 percent of activity. The white area by the arrow indicatesincreased anterior cingulate activity and trouble shifting attention. The holesin the front part of the scan indicate lower prefrontal cortex activity and poorjudgment.Along the same lines, menopause is often associated with lower overall brainactivity, which can lead to depression, anxiety, insomnia, and concentration andmemory problems. Images 7.4 and 7.5 show a woman’s SPECT scan both off and onher hormones.Image 7.4 Off Hormones[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_022_r1.jpg]Image 7.5 On Hormones[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_023_r1.jpg]This view is looking down from the top; the holes indicate areas of lowactivity. On hormones there is much better overall blood flow to the brain.Again, these hormonal shifts can cause seismic problems in relationships.Carefully testing and treating hormonal issues for both men and women iscritical to the health of the brain as well as to the health of relationships.Let me give you a very personal example of how issues with hormones can affectyour relationships.I am married to a neurosurgical ICU nurse. While Tana is both beautiful andsmart, she was also used to being very assertive, working around neuro-surgeonsall day long. She often joked, “What is the difference between a neurosurgeonand God?… At least God knows he is not a neurosurgeon.” Tana also has a blackbelt in tae kwon do and her approach to romance was more like the typicalguy’s—we’d be cuddling together and she’d say, “Okay, that’s enough, I’ve got togo work out.” She also loved masculine dogs and had a big dog named Mack.One of our first fights was over what type of dog we should get together. Iwanted a King Charles cavalier spaniel—they’re cute, little, fluffy, smart, andsweet. She wanted none of it. She actually said that the little dogs werenothing more than chew toys for the bigger dogs. So we compromised on an Englishbulldog. Frasier was cute, but not the kind of cute I was looking for.When Tana was about thirty-eight years old, she went off birth control pills andnoticed that her face started breaking out and her menstrual cycles became veryirregular. Despite her young age, she thought she must be going throughperimenopause, a period of time that can last several years prior to menopause.To figure out what was going on, she went to see her doctor. To herastonishment, she was informed that her cholesterol and triglycerides were highand that she was prediabetic. What?! Tana is five feet six inches tall, weighs118 pounds, has about 15 percent body fat, works out like a nut, and eats allthe right foods. That’s crazy, she thought, I’m the healthiest person I know.Image 7.6 Tana and Her Dog Mack[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_024_r1.jpg]As we were both concerned about her health, a friend of ours introduced us toDr. Christine Paoletti, a gynecologist in Santa Monica. It took only about tenminutes for Dr. Paoletti to suspect that Tana had a condition called polycysticovarian syndrome (PCOS), which causes a woman to have too much testosterone. Itis also linked to irregular menstrual cycles, skin breakouts, high cholesterol,and insulin resistance. An ultrasound confirmed the diagnosis. Why didn’t anyother doctors catch it? Tana doesn’t fit the typical physical profile of a womanwith PCOS. Most women with PCOS are overweight and have excessive facial andbody hair.Dr. Paoletti treated Tana with glucophage, a medication used to balance insulinand reduce testosterone levels. The changes were dramatic. Within a few months,her cholesterol dropped fifty points, her insulin levels normalized, her skincleared up, and her cycle became perfectly regular. Even more dramatic were thechanges in her personality. All of a sudden, she wanted to cuddle more, was lessintense, less anxious, and after about six months she had to have a pocketpoodle and called her Tinkerbell.Image 7.7 Tinkerbell[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_025_r1.jpg]Now, I like to say, change your hormones, change your brain, change your body,change your personality, change your relationships … and even the type of dogyou have. It is clear that our hormones are heavily involved in making us who weare.YOUR BRAIN, YOUR BODY, AND THE HORMONAL CASCADEThere are many myths and misconceptions about hormones. First, people usuallythink hormones are just a female issue. Wrong! Hormones are essential for healthand vitality in both men and women. Second, most people—and even somedoctors—think of our hormone-producing glands as the sole source of any hormonalproblems. Wrong again! In reality, the brain controls all the hormones in yourbody. Think of your hormones as airplanes flying through the air and your brainas the air traffic controller. Your brain tells them how fast they can fly, whenthey can land, and where they can land. For example, if your thyroid gland isoverproducing, it doesn’t know it. Your brain filters your blood to check up onyour thyroid levels, sees that there is too much, and asks the thyroid gland tolower production. The hormone-producing glands don’t communicate with eachother, only with the brain, which controls them all.Third, most of us think of our hormones—estrogen, testosterone, thyroid, andothers—as individual and unconnected systems. Wrong again! For example, when awoman approaches menopause, many doctors look only at the ovaries. And whenthyroid levels are off, they only test and treat the thyroid gland. Thisapproach is wrong, because our hormones all work together to maintain balance.Think of the hormonal system as a symphony, with the brain as the conductor. Ifall the players are playing the right notes at the right time, it is a wonderfulconcert. But if the conductor takes a break and a single player hits a sournote, it ruins the whole effect. Similarly, when one hormone system is out ofbalance, it causes imbalances with the other hormone systems.When your hormones are in sync, a magnificent mind, a slimmer body, clearerskin, better energy, a happier outlook, and improved health are the rewards.Hormonal imbalances lead to cloudy thinking, make you fat, give you acne andwrinkles, sap your energy, sour your mood, and increase your risk for disease.What exactly are hormones? They are little chemical messengers that travelthrough the bloodstream, allowing the brain and bodily organs to communicate.You might be surprised to learn that hormones are derived from cholesterol.Cholesterol gets a bad rap in the media, but cholesterol isn’t the enemy. Yes,it is true that when cholesterol is too high, it is associated with heartdisease. But when it is too low, it is associated with homicide, suicide, andsevere depression. Your brain and body need some cholesterol. Approximately 60percent of the solid weight of the brain is fat, so you need healthy levels ofcholesterol for optimal function. From cholesterol, your body makes a chemicalcalled pregnenolone, a mother hormone, from which all the other hormones arederived. This hormonal tree is referred to as the hormonal cascade (Figure 7.1).Figure 7.1 Hormonal Cascade[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_026_r1.jpg]Like most people, you are probably most familiar with the body’s reproductivehormones: estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. But these are only some ofthe many hormones that help keep your brain and body balanced. In this chapter,you will discover how many other hormones play a vital role in the health ofyour brain and how your body looks, feels, and functions.BALANCE YOUR THYROID FOR A BRIGHTER MIND, MORE ENERGY, SLIMMER SHAPE, AND ABETTER MOODThe small, butterfly-shaped thyroid gland located in the lower neck has becomebig news ever since Oprah revealed that she was suffering from hypothyroidism.Oprah isn’t alone. Tens of millions of people worldwide are estimated to havethyroid problems. The thyroid is the hormone of metabolism, regulating how fastthe processes in your body work. It is similar to a car’s idle.Low thyroid activity (hypothyroidism) When your thyroid is low, your body worksmore slowly or sluggishly. Your heart rate is usually slower, your bowels moveslower, your digestion rate is slower, and your thinking is slower. On SPECTscans of people with hypothyroidism, we see decreased brain activity. Manystudies on hypothyroidism have shown overall low function in the brain, whichleads to depression, cognitive impairment, anxiousness, and a sense of being ina mental fog or feeling spacey. Some people have what’s called subclinicalhypothyroidism. These are patients whose thyroid levels are in the normal rangebut who have symptoms. When other hormonal systems within the body are out ofbalance, it can affect thyroid activity and alter it.Common signs of hypothyroidism Fatigue, weight gain, dry skin, chronically lowtemperature below 98.6, fuzzy thinking, depression, and being cold when othersfeel fine.High thyroid activity (hyperthyroidism) When the thyroid gland is producing toomuch thyroid, everything in your body works too fast. Your heart beats faster,your bowels move faster, your digestion works faster. It is like you’ve had toomuch caffeine and you feel jittery or edgy.Common signs of hyperthyroidism Sleeplessness, anxiety, irritability, racingthoughts, and being hot when others feel fine.Get it balanced A simple blood test is all you need to see if you have thyroidproblems. Unfortunately, many doctors look only at the overall functioning ofthe thyroid, by a test called a TSH, or thyroid-stimulating hormone. Thyroidproblems often go undiagnosed because TSH levels can be normal even when aproblem exists. Ask your doctor to perform a test that looks at your T4 and freeT3 levels, which are the actual levels of thyroid floating in your system. Whatdoes that mean? It is very simple. Nearly all the hormones in the body floataround in the bloodstream attached to a protein. When they’re attached to thisprotein, they aren’t available for use. The hormones that are active, oravailable for use, are free-floating in the bloodstream rather than attached. Soit is these free-floating levels that are very important to test.ACTION STEPBe sure to have your physician test your T4 and free T3 levels when checkingyour thyroid levels.If you are diagnosed with a thyroid imbalance, a number of medications can beprescribed. Typically, when medication is prescribed, it will have to be takenthroughout your lifetime. Many supplements support the thyroid, including iodineand selenium.BALANCE YOUR ADRENAL HORMONES TO CALM STRESS, REDUCE ABDOMINAL FAT, AND DECREASEYOUR RISK FOR DISEASEThe triangle-shaped adrenal glands, which sit on top of your kidneys, arecritically important in helping your body deal with stress. The adrenals produceDHEA and cortisol, which is known as the stress hormone. Our adrenal glands havethe ability to put us in “fight-or-flight” mode. For example, let’s say you arehiking and you come across a bear. Your body produces adrenaline, which givesyou the strength to either fight the bear (usually not a good idea) or run fromthe bear. DHEA has been called coping fuel and the “universal promoter ofgoodness.” DHEA is one of the most abundant hormones in the body, second only tocholesterol. A lack or deficiency of DHEA impacts the person’s ability to copewith stress, potentially leading to damaging effects and behavioral changes andultimately leading to emotional burnout, early aging, and physical exhaustion.With age, DHEA declines.Adrenal fatigue In today’s hustle-and-bustle world, we are faced with stress ona daily basis. Rush-hour traffic, family issues, and work demands mean that weare stressed from the minute we wake up until we go to sleep. This puts ouradrenal gland on overdrive so it is constantly producing cortisol. After monthsor even years of unrelenting stress, the adrenal glands can burn out. We callthis adrenal fatigue or adrenal gland failure, and it means your body no longerhas the capacity to deal with daily stress. You have trouble getting out of bed,struggle to function, and may even have trouble getting yourself to work.Adrenal fatigue makes you fat—especially in your abdomen, which not only looksbad but also increases your risk for cardiovascular disease. Chronic exposure tostress hormones also kills brain cells in the hippocampus, a major memorystructure in the brain.ACTION STEPIf you have a waist circumference of more than 31.5 inches for women or 37inches for men, you might want to consider having DHEA and cortisol levelschecked.Part of the reason why adrenal fatigue is becoming so common is that so many ofus are skimping on sleep. If you don’t get seven to eight hours of sleep atnight, your system automatically goes on stress overload. Then you do terriblethings to try to make up for the lack of sleep. You drink coffee, which is astress inducer, to wake up. Then you drink wine in the evening to calm you down,but when the alcohol wears off, it puts your body into another stress responseand wakes you up at two o’clock in the morning. It is a never-ending cycle ofstress.Common signs and symptoms of adrenal gland failure Abdominal fat, tiredness, lowstress tolerance, craving sweets, difficulty concentrating, mental fog, lowlibido, and poor memory.Overactive adrenal system When the adrenal system is working too hard, it is avery serious medical condition that can lead to a rare kind of tumor, which isusually noncancerous, called pheochromocytoma.Common signs of overactive adrenals High blood pressure and high heart rate.Get it balanced Diagnosing adrenal fatigue or overactive adrenals involveschecking cortisol and DHEA-S levels with a blood test. Ways to combat adrenalfatigue include learning stress-management techniques, meditating, usingself-hypnosis, and getting an ANTeater in your head to talk back to theautomatic negative thoughts (ANTs). See Chapter 13[Amen_9780307463593_epub_c13_r1.htm] for more on ANTs (automatic negativethoughts) and ANTeaters. B vitamins—either in foods like green leafy vegetablesor in supplements—support the adrenal system and help our bodies deal withstress. 5-HTP helps you sleep and boosts serotonin levels in the brain, whichhelps you calm stress and lose weight. Phosphatidylserine can also be helpfulfor adrenal fatigue. See Appendix C, “The Supplement Solution,” for moreinformation on these and the rest of the supplements mentioned in the chapter.DHEA, if low, is an important supplement to counteract adrenal fatigue. DHEAserves as a precursor to male and female sex hormones (androgens and estrogens).DHEA levels in the body begin to decrease after age thirty, and are reported tobe low in some people with anorexia, end-stage kidney disease, type 2 diabetes(non-insulin-dependent diabetes), AIDS, adrenal insufficiency, and in thecritically ill. DHEA levels may also be depleted by a number of drugs, includinginsulin, steroids, opiates, and Danazol. According to the NaturalStandard.com[http://NaturalStandard.com] website, there is good scientific evidencesupporting the use of DHEA in the treatment of adrenal insufficiency,depression, systemic lupus erythematosus, and obesity. Dosages of 25 to 200 mghave been generally recommended. It is usually well tolerated. Acne and facialhair are common side effects, as it increases the body’s testosterone levels. Toavoid getting acne or facial hair, many doctors prescribe a metabolite of DHEAcalled 7-keto-DHEA. It is more expensive, but if acne and facial hair are anissue, it is worth it.The main worry about DHEA for some professionals is that it will partly convertitself into sex hormones such as testosterone and estrogens. This seems to be anobvious advantage for the healthy person looking to combat age-associatedhormonal decline. Unfortunately, this means advising people who are at risk forhormonally dependent cancers (prostate, breast, ovarian) against taking DHEA.For these, 7-keto-DHEA is a good solution.BALANCE TESTOSTERONE FOR BETTER SEXUAL FUNCTION AND A BETTER BRAINWe typically think of testosterone as a sex hormone, but it does a lot more thanjust drive your libido. If you get a Y chromosome from your father, you get aspike of testosterone in the womb, which makes your brain more male. If you getan X chromosome from your dad, you don’t get that spike of testosterone. Thismakes a huge difference in the kind of brain you have. Female brains have betterlanguage ability, are more interconnected, more communicative, more relationshipdriven, and less competitive. Male brains are wired for competing anddominating, but not as much for commitment.Testosterone’s effect on the brain goes far beyond typical male/femaledifferences. Emerging scientific evidence is revealing that testosterone offersneuroprotection, helping prevent cognitive impairment, Alzheimer’s disease, anddepression. Researchers are also uncovering a relationship between lowtestosterone levels in men and chronic pain. Studies are currently under way todetermine if balancing a man’s testosterone levels can improve pain toleranceand reduce the perception of pain.ACTION STEPThere is a simple test I like to do. Hold up your hand and look at the ratio ofyour ring finger to your index finger. If your ring finger is longer, you got alot of testosterone in the womb. Some say that the size of the ring finger alsocorrelates to the size of a man’s genitals.We tend to think of testosterone as a male hormone, but it is also vitallyimportant for women. It is involved in her sex drive, her ability to buildmuscle, her outlook on life, and her memory.Low testosterone in men For men, testosterone levels peak at age twenty-two andslowly decline thereafter. On average, men lose 10 percent of their testosteroneevery decade after age thirty, or about 1 to 3 percent each year. Recentresearch also indicates a link between low testosterone and Alzheimer’s disease.As testosterone drops, there’s less blood flow to the brain, which causesproblems with sexual and cognitive function. It can also affect body weight,muscle mass, sex drive, mood, and energy. We call this male menopause orandropause. Some of my patients like to joke that it puts men on pause.Common signs of low testosterone in men Declining libido, erectile dysfunction,depression, lack of energy, and memory problems.Low testosterone in women Without enough testosterone, a woman’s libido can goout the window. I treat a lot of women who are on the brink of divorce. In manycases, I find that their testosterone levels are off, or their husband’s levelsare low, and that is actually the source of their dissatisfaction with themarriage. So many times, I hear someone tell their spouse, “You are not the sameperson I married.” And they aren’t! That’s because their hormone levels arenowhere near the same levels as when they got married. I think that before youfile for divorce and throw away twenty or thirty years of a good marriage, youshould both get your hormones checked.Common signs of low testosterone in women Lack of libido, depression, and poormemory.High testosterone in men Guys who produce too much of this hormone tend to flyoff the handle for no reason. Men with the most testosterone are also the leastlikely to get married and stay married. That may be why so many men tend to waituntil they’re older to tie the knot.Common signs of high testosterone in men Aggression, moodiness, acne, andextreme competitiveness.High testosterone in women Some women produce too much testosterone, which isoften associated with PCOS—the same condition my wife has. PCOS can cause bigchanges in your body that affect your weight, skin, mood, and overall health.Common signs of high testosterone and PCOS in women Obesity, irregular periods,acne, oily skin, excessive facial and body hair, aggression, high cholesterol,high blood pressure, diabetes.Get it balanced For the best results from this blood test, make sure your doctorlooks at two levels: your total testosterone and your free testosterone. Newresearch shows that spikes in blood sugar can lower a man’s testosterone levelsby as much as 25 percent. So if you want an accurate reading on your test, youmay want to skip having anything like doughnuts, candy, or Gatorade for at leasta few hours before your blood test. For men with low testosterone, optionsinclude creams, gels, and injections. For women who need more of the hormone,creams are the most common treatment method. Treatment for women with hightestosterone or PCOS is highly individualized and may include birth controlpills, diabetes medications, fertility medications, and antiandrogens. DHEA isoften helpful in raising testosterone levels.BALANCE YOUR ESTROGEN TO CONTROL YOUR WEIGHT AND MOODS AND TO STRENGTHEN YOURBONES, HEART, AND MEMORYEstrogen is an amazing hormone that affects every organ system in the body—thebones, cardiovascular system, reproductive system, and the brain. Most peoplethink of estrogen as a female hormone, but men need it too—only in much smallerdoses. When women first start menstruating, estrogen levels begin rising andfalling in a cyclic fashion. During a normal twenty-eight-day cycle, estrogenpeaks and falls like a gentle rolling hill twice (see Figure 7.2).Figure 7.2 Monthly Hormonal Cycle[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_027_r1.jpg]In their thirties and forties, when women enter perimenopause, the hormonesystem doesn’t work as efficiently and changes start to take place in thispattern. Instead of gentle ups and downs, estrogen spikes and then crashesdramatically right before her period starts, which can cause severe PMSsymptoms. This seesaw effect of going from estrogen dominance to estrogenwithdrawal isn’t fun and can make her feel like she is crazy, literally. Aneye-opening study found that 40 percent of women being committed to mentalinstitutions were admitted during the two days prior to the start of theirperiod. By the time menopause hits, estrogen withdrawal is in full swing, whichaffects weight, cognitive function, and health.Women have three kinds of estrogen: estrone, estradiol, and estriol. During thechildbearing years, estradiol is the most abundant of the three. Like a fountainof youth, estradiol protects the brain, heart, and bones, provides antiagingprotection for the skin, and helps prevent weight gain. Researchers at YaleUniversity have found that estradiol suppresses appetite using the same pathwaysin the brain as leptin, one of the hormones involved in regulating the appetite.(See more on leptin later in this chapter.) The scientists concluded thatimpaired estrogen signaling, which may occur during menopause, may be the causeof menopausal weight gain and obesity. In perimenopause and menopause, estradiolbegins to wane, and its protective qualities are lost.Estrogen withdrawal When estrogen levels decline during the menstrual cycle,perimenopause, or menopause, women have more trouble with short-term memory andare more likely to have crying spells and depression. A woman may find herselfwondering, Where did I park the car? or Why did I walk into this room? Lowlevels of estrogen can also make her more sensitive to pain. A study in theJournal of Neuroscience focused on the effects of estradiol on pain. Researcherstested women at different times during their menstrual cycle—first during theirperiod, when estradiol is at its lowest, and then after being treated with thehormone to raise its level. The women were subjected to a controlled amount ofpain and were asked to rate their pain. When estradiol was at its lowest, thewomen reported feeling much more pain than when the hormone was at its highest.This shows that when estrogen levels are low, such as during menopause or duringyour period, women are likely to feel pain more acutely.ACTION STEPConsider taking supplements that may reduce symptoms of estrogen withdrawal,such as fish oil, primrose oil, or flaxseed oil.Common signs of estrogen withdrawal Fuzzy thinking, trouble focusing, anddepression or bad moods.Estrogen dominance High estrogen levels in conjunction with low levels ofprogesterone can cause heavier periods, cramping, and shorter cycles. In somewomen, this leads to a seemingly nonstop period.Common signs of estrogen dominance Weight gain, retaining water, bossiness,aggressive behavior, and depression.Get it balanced A simple blood test is used to determine levels of the threetypes of estrogen. Estrogen pills, birth control pills, creams, and vaginalinserts are just some of the options for estrogen replacement. Living abrain-healthy life by exercising and limiting caffeine, sugar, and alcohol canalso help alleviate symptoms. Fish oil, primrose oil, and flaxseed oil may easesymptoms.BALANCE YOUR PROGESTERONE FOR BETTER MOODS, DEEPER SLEEP, AND ENHANCED COGNITIVEFUNCTIONSay hello to the “feel good” hormone. Progesterone is like nature’s Xanax—itcalms you down, makes you feel peaceful, and helps you sleep. But while Xanaxclouds your brain, progesterone sharpens your thinking. Progesterone issometimes referred to as the pregnancy hormone because it promotes pregnancy.When you get pregnant, your progesterone levels shoot sky high, giving you aglow, great energy, and a flood of enthusiasm and love.Like estrogen, progesterone follows a rolling-hill pattern during the secondhalf of the menstrual cycle, rising and falling along with estrogen. By the timea woman hits her thirties, her body starts to produce progesterone lessefficiently. In her late thirties and forties, those nice rolling hills ofprogesterone decrease to little more than bumps. Without the nice rise, shestarts having progesterone-withdrawal symptoms. If estrogen is on a hill or aspike while progesterone is low, it really exacerbates the symptoms of estrogendominance.Low progesterone Without enough progesterone, you lose the brain’s naturalsleeping pill and antianxiety hormone. A deficiency of this hormone can alsolead to addictions. Wendy, age forty-five, came to the Amen Clinics after herhusband threatened to divorce her if she didn’t stop drinking. She started todrink heavily around the age of forty because she had increasing issues withanxiety and insomnia. When I tested her, she had very low progesterone levels.Research shows that progesterone levels start to decrease eight years before awoman goes into menopause. Balancing her progesterone levels helped to calm heranxiety, improve her sleep, and end her addiction.Common signs of low progesterone Trouble sleeping, headaches, migraines,anxiety, fuzzy thinking, poor memory, mood swings, and difficulty concentrating.Bossiness, aggressiveness, and water retention are intensified when coupled withhigh estrogen.High progesterone It is rare to have high progesterone levels unless you arepregnant or your dosage of hormone replacement therapy is too high. Typically,it can make you feel like you are experiencing the first few weeks of pregnancy.Common signs of high progesterone Morning sickness, extreme fatigue, andbackaches.Get it balanced Most doctors check progesterone levels using saliva, blood, orurine tests. For the best results, tests are usually done on day twenty-one ofyour menstrual cycle. Synthetic and bio-identical hormone replacement isavailable.PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME (PMS)Lisa Nowak, the astronaut in the scandalous love triangle that made the newssome time ago, put on a diaper and drove nine hundred miles to confront thegirlfriend of her love interest. She was later accused of attempted kidnapping.During pretrial motions, I appeared on Fox News to talk about what could havecaused a highly successful woman to do such a crazy thing. I was on a panel withfive women. She had just filed an insanity plea—not guilty by reason ofinsanity—when the moderator asked me, “If you were the consulting psychiatristfor her defense team, what would you want to know?” I told him I would want toknow where she was in her menstrual cycle when she committed the crime. All fivewomen on the panel were aghast and one said, “Oh my God, I can’t believe he justsaid that!” I explained that we’ve scanned many women at different times oftheir cycle, and that during the worst time of their cycles for women with PMS,their brains change. The way our society reacts to saying that a woman mayfluctuate with her hormones is, in my mind, stupid because it is just soobvious.PMS is real. From a hormonal perspective, the days prior to your period coincidewith the days when your estrogen and progesterone levels hit rock bottom. Brainscans show that during the last two weeks of the cycle, the anterior cingulategyrus starts to fire up. That’s the part of your brain that helps you shiftattention, be flexible, and go with the flow. This is due to a deficiency ofserotonin, a natural antidepressant, feel-good chemical. We’ve seen that asestrogen levels fall, serotonin does too. Also, during the worst time of thecycle, the prefrontal cortex tends to go low, which is why women may strugglewith focus and impulse control.Common signs of PMS This crash causes emotional difficulties, intensifiesfeelings of depression, and can affect sleep. By now, you know that this can bea precursor to poor eating habits, which pack on unwanted pounds. It also robsyour skin of the nighttime rejuvenation it needs. Other symptoms includebloating, breast tenderness, irritability, anger, worry, focusing on negativethoughts, poor concentration and impulsivity.ACTION STEPIf you suffer from PMS, try taking 5-HTP to improve your mood and help you sleepbetter.Get it balanced Replacing a small amount of progesterone during the second halfof your cycle may neutralize symptoms. Medications that boost serotonin, such asProzac and Zoloft, have been shown to be helpful to calm the anterior cingulatesymptoms of worry, depression, and anxiety. In my practice, I’ve noticed that5-HTP reduces symptoms of PMS.PERIMENOPAUSEPerimenopause is the ten to fifteen years leading up to menopause. It is thetime when your hormone fluctuations gradually start to change from your regularcycle and you don’t know where your hormones will be on any given day. Mostwomen don’t think about perimenopause until estrogen levels have fallen to apoint where they get hit with hot flashes and night sweats, the most commonsymptoms. But by the time you are having hot flashes, you’ve probably been goingthrough perimenopause for up to ten years. And you may already be saddled withthe effects of estrogen dominance.Common signs of perimenopause Hot flashes, night sweats, weight gain,depression, anxiety, irritability, and poor memory.ACTION STEPHave your physician check your hormone levels every few years starting at agethirty-five.Get it balanced It is a good idea to get your hormone levels checked when youare about thirty-five years old so you have a baseline. Then get them checkedevery two to three years. Synthetic or bio-identical hormone re placementtherapy may be helpful in the form of creams, pills, and vaginal inserts. Thebest way to treat hot flashes is with a combination of estradiol and estriol.Natural treatments include supplements, such as B vitamins, fish oil, primroseoil, and flaxseed oil. Plus, adopt brain-healthy habits. Get plenty of exercise,adequate sleep, drink lots of water, eat whole foods, and meditate.MENOPAUSEMenopause is a woman’s last period, after which she is said to bepost-menopausal. Menopause can also be surgically induced if your ovaries areremoved during a hysterectomy. If you are postmenopausal, you may continue toexperience many of the same side effects associated with perimenopause. By thistime, estrogen and progesterone have usually fallen to such low levels that italso makes you more vulnerable to conditions such as heart disease, stroke, andAlzheimer’s disease.Common signs of menopause Menopause is often associated with lower overall brainactivity, which can lead to depression, anxiety, insomnia, weight gain, andconcentration and memory problems. Hot flashes and night sweats may continue.Get it balanced Typically, a diagnosis of menopause is given only after twelvemonths have passed since your final period. Synthetic or bio-identical hormonereplacement are commonly prescribed. B vitamins, fish oil, primrose oil, andflaxseed oil are natural treatments that may ease symptoms. Adoptingbrain-healthy habits becomes more important than ever to preserve cognitivefunction and keep your body looking young. Exercise, good sleep, greatnutrition, and meditation can help.HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPYThere is a huge controversy surrounding hormone replacement therapy (HRT). In2002, the World Health Initiative Study found that the hormone replacementmedication Prempro increased the risk for breast cancer, heart disease, stroke,and blood clots. The fallout was immediate and widespread, with millions ofwomen tossing their HRT medications in the trash.The problem with this study is that it looked at only one medication, Prempro,which is a combination of synthetic estrogen (made from horse urine), a littleestrone, and a synthetic progesterone called progestin. These hormones are notthe same as those produced in the human body. In addition, the estrogen in thissynthetic drug was more potent than the estrogen your body produces naturally.Today, we have come full circle on the question of HRT and there is a trendtoward treating women with hormones that are identical to those produced in thebody. These medications, called bio-identical hormones, can be helpful inboosting your vitality as well as protecting cognitive function. They alsoprotect you from serious diseases, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, andAlzheimer’s disease. Studies show that women who have complete hysterectomies,including taking their ovaries, without hormone replacement have double the riskfor Alzheimer’s disease. This confirms that these hormones are critical forbrain health. In a new study from UCLA, researchers used brain scans to studythe health of a group of women’s brains on and off hormone replacement. Over twoyears, the women who did not take hormone replacement showed decreased activityin an area of the brain called the posterior cingulate gyrus, one of the firstareas that die in Alzheimer’s disease. The women who were taking HRT showed noreduction in this area of the brain.Research on pain has found that women going through menopause who don’t take HRTmay struggle more with pain. I have noticed this in my own practice. I treatmany postmenopausal women who complain of pain, whether it is chronic backaches,neck problems, or even conditions like fibromyalgia. If you are considering HRT,remember that it is highly individualized and that one treatment does not workfor everyone. Just as your brain is completely unique, so are your hormones.BALANCE LEPTIN AND GHRELIN TO CONTROL YOUR APPETITE AND LOSE WEIGHTThese two hormones may hold the key to your weight loss. Regulated by sleep,leptin and ghrelin work together to control feelings of hunger and satiety.Ghrelin levels rise to signal the brain that you are hungry, then leptin levelsincrease to tell your brain when you are full. Adequate sleep keeps these twohormones nicely balanced. But when you don’t get enough sleep, they get out ofwhack and increase your appetite and your cravings for carbohydrates, cookies,and candy. See Chapter 10 [Amen_9780307463593_epub_c10_r1.htm], “The SleepSolution,” for the latest research on how these two hormones affect your weight.Low leptin Without enough leptin, you never feel like you’ve gotten enough toeat. Overweight people have high levels of leptin because their brain becomesresistant to it. The less fat on your body, the better.ACTION STEPOne of the best ways to balance leptin and ghrelin is to get at least sevenhours of sleep each night.High ghrelin Studies show that high levels of this hormone trick your body intothinking you are hungry and make you want to dive into the doughnuts and candybowl as opposed to the fruit bowl. With chronically high levels of ghrelin,there’s a strong possibility you are going to gain weight.Common symptoms of low leptin and high ghrelin Overweight, obesity, overeating,and cravings for simple carbohydrates.Get it balanced At present the treatment to balance these hormones is mostlybehavioral. Get good sleep, eat small meals throughout the day so that you arenot hungry and maintain a healthy blood sugar, decrease stress eating, andreduce your stress. Since leptin and ghrelin are regulated during sleep,supplements that promote sleep—such as L-tryptophan, 5-HTP, valerian, kava kava,magnesium, and melatonin—may help balance your levels.BALANCE INSULIN TO BATTLE OBESITY AND IMPROVE HEALTHInsulin is produced by the pancreas, primarily in response to a rise in bloodsugar. One of insulin’s primary functions is as a storage hormone. Its functionis to take nutrients from the bloodstream and store them in the body’s cells.Insulin increases the uptake of glucose into the liver and muscles for storage,as glycogen, and it also helps store excess glucose in fat cells. Since insulinis a storage hormone rather than a mobilizing hormone, it also stops the bodyfrom mobilizing and utilizing fat as a fuel source. Too much insulin stops fatburning. Eating too many simple carbohydrates, like candy, cake, or white bread,causes your blood sugar to spike, which triggers intense insulin production toremove the glucose from your bloodstream. Once insulin has removed the glucosefrom your blood, your blood sugar drops, causing cravings for even more sugar.It is a vicious cycle that can lead to obesity, insulin resistance, andeventually type 2 diabetes.Insulin imbalances When this hormone is out of balance, it can lead to weightgain, delayed healing, Alzheimer’s disease, strokes, heart disease, and manyother problems.Common signs of insulin imbalances Obesity, abdominal fat, diabetes, high bloodpressure, and metabolic syndrome (abdominal fat, high cholesterol, and highblood pressure).Get it balanced The most common blood test for glucose looks at the way yourbody is metabolizing glucose on that particular day. A better test checks yourHg A1C levels, which show how you are metabolizing glucose over a two-tothree-month period. Losing weight, exercising, and taking certain medicationssuch as insulin or glucophage can help balance your blood sugar levels.Alpha-lipoic acid, cinnamon, and ginseng have been found to help balance bloodsugar. Reducing your intake of sugary sweets and simple carbohydrates can helpkeep insulin levels in balance.BALANCE YOUR GROWTH HORMONES TO SLOW THE AGING PROCESSThe pea-sized pituitary gland, located at the base of the brain, produces humangrowth hormone. As its name implies, growth hormone fuels growth throughoutchildhood and into adulthood. It also helps bodily tissues and organs repairthemselves for optimal function. As we enter middle age, however, the pituitarygland slows production of growth hormone, also known as IGF-1 (insulinlikegrowth factor-1). The reduction in growth hormone impairs the body’s ability torepair itself, thus triggering cell death and aging.A breakthrough study published in a 1990 issue of the New England Journal ofMedicine sparked interest in growth hormone as a potential antiaging therapy. Inthe study, twelve men over the age of sixty were followed for a six-monthperiod. During that time, one group received growth hormone therapy while theother group did not. The men receiving growth hormone experienced a 14.4 percentdecrease in body fat and an 8.8 percent increase in lean body mass. Thislandmark—albeit small—study prompted a wealth of new research aiming todetermine to what extent low levels of growth hormone promote the aging processand whether raising levels of growth hormone could put the brakes on aging.Low levels of growth hormone Dr. Eric Braverman, a clinical assistant professorof integrative medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College, conducted acomprehensive review of the medical literature about growth hormone. Hisfindings show that low levels of IGF-1 may result in the following: * Delayed cognitive processing speed (the equivalent of ten to twenty years of aging), which leads to declines in memory, IQ, and attention span as well as mood problems, such as anxiety and depression * Decreased blood flow to the brain * Obesity * Decreased muscle mass and bone density * Cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, and diabetesACTION STEPIf you are obese or have age-related problems, try lifestyle and diet changesfirst, then consider having your IGF-1 levels checked.According to Dr. Braverman’s re view, increasing levels of IGF-1 can helpreverse these problems. Growth hormone has also been found to protect againstsome forms of cancer and beta amyloid, an abnormal protein found in the brainthat is considered to be one of the major hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease.Common signs and symptoms of underactive growth hormone Osteoporosis, muscledeterioration, memory problems, obesity, anxiety, depression, cardiovasculardisease, high blood pressure, and diabetes are all potential signs of low levelsof IGF-1.Get it balanced A blood test is typically used to evaluate growth hormonelevels. Growth hormone replacement is achieved with injections that can costthousands of dollars, which makes it prohibitive for many people. The practiceis considered very controversial, and some concern has been raised about apossible link between growth hormone replacement and cancer. However, based onDr. Braverman’s review, there have been no studies that have shown that growthhormone therapy increases the risk of cancer.ACTION STEPOnline athttp://www.amenclinics.com/my-brain-health/online-tests-calculators/cyb-questionnaire/[http://http://www.amenclinics.com/my-brain-health/online-tests-calculators/cyb-questionnaire/],you will find a series of questionnaires for both men and women, developed by myfriend and colleague Angie Meeker, doctor of pharmacy. The questionnaires willgive you a sense of your own potential hormone issues. Of course, you shoulddiscuss the results of the questionnaires with your own health-careprofessional.Take note that growth hormone injections aren’t the only way to increase theamount of growth hormone in the body.

The first time, I wastwenty-six years old and in medical school in Oklahoma. My grandfather had hissecond heart attack at the age of seventy-five. He was a warmhearted, kind,happy man who loved to do things for others. He had many, many friends and hehad been a candy maker who owned his own shop on Wilshire Boulevard in LosAngeles for many years. The candy, and the inflammation caused by excessivesugar, likely contributed to his heart disease. I was named after him and he wasmy best friend growing up.After his heart attack, Grandpa became very depressed for the first time in hislife. Those who loved him were very surprised by the change. He had troublesleeping at night, cried easily, and lost a lot of weight. The antidepressantsthen, in 1980, were not much help to him, and he died within a short time. Athis funeral I had crushing chest pain. His loss was overwhelming and I trulysobbed for the first time in my life. What I found out later, to my sad dismay,was that people who suffer a depressive episode after a heart attack are threetimes more likely to die in the next two and a half years than those who do nothave depression. If only I knew, I would have pushed for them to treat hisdepression more aggressively. As I was writing this book, my first grandchild,Elias, was born. The day of his birth I had constant thoughts of my grandfatherand how important he was in my life, which, I am sure, will help drive me to bea good grandpa too, but without all the candy.The second time I had chest pain was at age forty-five at three o’clock in themorning. I woke up holding my chest, panicked, and couldn’t breathe. Before bedthat night, I was reading Dean Ornish’s book Love and Survival. In it, he wroteabout a study where researchers asked ten thousand men one question, “Does yourwife show you her love?” The men who answered no had significantly moreillnesses and, in fact, died early. At the time, I had been in a twenty-yearmarriage that was filled with stress and chronic unhappiness. I had to answerthe question as a definite no. The chest pain was a reflection of my unconsciousmind telling me that the lack of love was killing me.The third time I had chest pain, at age fifty-one, was during another period ofgrief when I had lost a very close friend. When I could no longer talk to myfriend, my heart ached. I couldn’t sleep, my mind raced, and the crushing painin my chest returned. I also remember that when my other grandfather died, myfather’s mother used to hold her chest and cry with pain and sorrow. Grief ismanifested physically, often through chest pain. After my own experiences, Iresearched the physical effects of grief.Scientific studies report that grief triggers a storm of hormonal activity.Stress chemicals, such as adrenaline and cortisol, are pumped into thebloodstream. They cause the heart to beat irregularly, causing the feeling offluttering in your chest, and they cause spasms of the blood vessels that supplythe heart, also causing pain. If the heart is already compromised byatherosclerosis (fortunately for me, mine was not), it can set the stage for aheart attack by constricting blood vessels, rupturing atherosclerotic plaques,and forming blood clots or triggering dangerous abnormal heart rhythms.In my last experience, I felt so terrible that I decided to do a SPECT scan onmyself during grief. I had already done ten other scans over the years, so I hada pretty good idea of my own brain pattern. In this study, I found that myemotional brain was significantly overactive, especially in the anteriorcingulate gyrus—as I was stuck on thoughts of missing my friend—and my insularcortex, an area of the brain that often sends stress signals to other parts ofthe body, especially the heart. I needed to calm my brain in order to soothe myheart. The brain’s stress is clearly played out in every organ of the body, butmost especially in the heart. Your heart and brain are completely intertwinedwith each other.The brain-heart connection is beautifully and consistently displayed throughoutour language.“My heart is broken.”“You make my heart beat fast.”“I miss you with all my heart.”“He’s a heartthrob.”“She’s a heartbreaker.”“She ripped out my heart.”“I am so nervous that my heart is beating out of my chest.”“He’s got a lot of heart.”“I don’t get heart attacks, I give them.” This chapter will look at the brain-heart connection and how you canoptimize it to enhance your overall heart health. Boosting brain health improvesheart health. Improving heart health also enhances your brain. Let’s start byexamining two of the body’s brain-heart systems: the autonomic nervous systemand heart rate variability. Then we will look at a number of brain-heartconnection robbers and boosters.AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEMThe nerves that link the brain and the heart are part of the autonomic nervoussystem (ANS), which also connects the brain to other organs, such as thestomach, intestines, kidneys, and skin. Unless trained, this system functions inan involuntary, or reflexive, manner. It usually directs the activities of thebody that do not require conscious control. Think of the ANS as allowing thingsto happen automatically or unconsciously. For example, it functions without yourdirection for digestion when you eat a spinach, blueberry, and walnutsalad—without your having to say, “Okay, stomach and intestines, start workingto get the nutrition from this brain-healthy food.” And when you are at a scarymovie, you don’t need to tell your heart to beat faster with excitement; it justdoes as a result of the ANS.The ANS is made up of two divisions—sympathetic and parasympathetic—thatmodulate your body’s responses. These two divisions could be thought of asopposing forces. The sympathetic division signals your heart to increase itsfiring rate and increase the strength of muscle-cell contraction; and theparasympathetic division sends signals to slow down your heart rate and relax.The sympathetic fibers are activated in times of stress, or emergency“fight-or-flight” situations. The parasympathetic fibers slow the heart rate andallow us to “rest” and “digest.”Excessive sympathetic stimulation can cause significant heart and blood vesselproblems, including angina or heart pain, high blood pressure, heartarrhythmias, and even heart attacks. Through training we can learn to calm anexcessively overactive sympathetic nervous system and improve our heart health.When I was an intern at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, I spent a month onthe cardiac intensive care unit. One night when I was on call, I was caring foran army chaplain who had a severe heart arrhythmia. We were having troublegetting his heart rhythm under control, and he was unable to sleep. The chaplainhad been feeling a fair amount of anxiety because his heart problem was causinghim to be medically discharged from the army. As was my habit for sleepingproblems, I asked my patient if I could hypnotize him to see if it would helphim sleep. With his permission, one of the nurses who wanted to watch sat inwith us. He readily went into a hypnotic trance and we noticed a considerablecalming of his anxiety. As I went on, the nurse touched my arm and with anastonished look in her eyes motioned for me to look at the heart rate monitor.His heart rhythm had normalized. He then fell into a peaceful sleep. My nursefriend caused quite a stir on the unit by telling everyone what had happened.The next morning on rounds our attending, a friendly but skeptical cardiologistby the name of Bill Oetgen, asked me what happened. He was intrigued and westudied the chaplain’s heart both in and out of a hypnotic trance. His heartrhythm was definitely healthier under hypnosis. We presented the case at thehospital grand rounds and published the case in the Journal of ClinicalHypnosis.Balancing the sympathetic and parasympathetic tone to the heart can be healing.In a 2008 report published in the Cleveland Clinic Medical Journal, one hundredpeople who had coronary bypass surgery were studied. Fifty were put underhypnosis right after the surgery, while fifty were treated as usual withouthypnosis. In the hypnosis group, there were significantly fewer complications,including heart arrhythmias, than in the control group. Hypnosis is one form oftraining that has a positive impact on heart health, likely through balancingthe ANS. Meditation, deep relaxation therapies, guided imagery, and biofeedbackare other tools for helping.ACTION STEPTry hypnosis, meditation, deep relaxation therapies, guided imagery, andbiofeedback to improve heart health by calming the ANS.HEART RATE VARIABILITYHeart rate variability (HRV) is another important phenomenon to understand inoptimizing the brain-heart connection. HRV is the beat-to-beat variation inheart rhythm. Most people think that a healthy heart rhythm is perfectlyregular. Not so. Normally, under healthy conditions, our heart rhythm is noteven; it bounces around a bit. High HRV has been associated with heart health,while low HRV has been associated with illness.HRV issues are most obvious when mothers deliver babies. Obstetricians typicallymonitor the baby’s HRV before delivery with scalp monitors. In a healthy baby,the heart rate varies significantly. If the baby’s heart rate becomes toosteady, the baby is considered to be in trouble. Lower HRV is a sign ofdistress. The same thing is true after we are born. Low HRV is a sign of stressand trouble for both our hearts and our brains. HRV has been found to predictsurvival after heart attack. Over a half dozen well-designed studies have shownthat reduced HRV predicts sudden death in patients who have had a heart attack.Reduced HRV appears to be a marker of fatal heart arrhythmias. Several studiesalso suggest that lower HRV may predict risk of death even among individualsfree of heart disease.Several studies have suggested a link between negative emotions (such as anxietyand hostility) and reduced HRV. One research group reported an associationbetween anxiety and reduced HRV in 581 men, while another group observed lowerHRV in individuals who were “highly anxious.” At least three well-designedstudies have shown a relationship between high levels of anxiety and heartdisease.One critical piece of HRV is forgiveness. By holding on to hurts and anger, youlower your HRV and increase your own chances for heart problems. Learning to letgo and forgive those who have hurt you is one way to allow your heart’s rhythmroom to expand.ACTION STEPHostility, anger, depression, loneliness, frustration, sleep deprivation,obesity, diabetes, air pollution, and chronic stress all decrease HRV. Positiveemotion, gratitude, appreciation, forgiveness, holding your puppy, listening tosoothing music, smelling lavender, losing weight, exercising, and eating morefruits and vegetables have scientific evidence showing they increase HRV andoverall health. Your brain’s decisions can improve your heart!My best friend as a youngster grew up in a war zone. Will’s mother could neverlet go of hurts, while his father had the temper from hell, especially when hedrank. The constant screaming and chaos had a profoundly negative effect oneveryone in the family. Will frequently suffered from panic attacks andheadaches, and missed many days at school. Will hated his father for the bruiseshe put on his mother, and he was horrified whenever the police showed up at hisdoor. For decades, Will’s own intimate relationships suffered, as he had troubletrusting anyone.Then, years later, Will’s dad had open-heart surgery. After the surgery, his dadbecame psychotic and saw little green men talking to him. I was called to help.As part of my evaluation, I scanned Will’s dad. His scan showed a large defectin the area of his left temporal lobe, a finding often consistent with violence.When I asked his father if he had ever had a brain injury, he said, “By God,Danny, I did. When I was twenty years old, I was driving an old milk truck. Itwas missing its driver’s-side rearview mirror, so I had to put my head out ofthe window to look behind me and one day when I was doing that my head hit awooden pole and knocked me unconscious. After the injury I had more problemswith my memory and my temper.”Image 8.1 Will’s Dad[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_028_r1.jpg]Damage to his left prefrontal and temporal lobe (arrow)Seeing the scans and hearing about the brain injury caused Will and everyone inthe family to look at their dad in a different light. With treatment, Will’sfather did much better. For years, it was easy to say that Will’s dad was a badperson, but when you look at his behavior through the lens of brain imaging, anew world of understanding, help, and forgiveness opens up. Will’s heart andlife also opened up after he could forgive his father, rather than rigidlyholding on to the idea of how much he hated him.BRAIN-HEART CONNECTION ROBBERSDecreased blood flow I often say that whatever is good for your heart is goodfor your brain, and whatever is bad for your heart is bad for your brain. Bloodflow is critical to both organs and critical to your survival. Anything thatdecreases blood flow to your heart, brain, or body decreases healthy function.Smoking, excessive caffeine, excessive stress, certain medications or abusedrugs, and a lack of exercise all have the potential to damage brain-hearthealth.Excessive stress Constant exposure to stress hormones kills cells in the brain’smemory centers and also decreases HRV and heart health. Research has found thathigher self-ratings of anxiety and stress within a week were associated withlower levels of HRV. Having stress-management practices is critical to bothbrain and heart health. Stress hormones may also constrict narrowed bloodvessels. In an instructive study from Duke University, researchers askedfifty-eight men and women with coronary artery disease to wear portable monitorsfor two days. They were asked to write in their diaries what they were doing andfeeling. Tension, frustration, and other negative emotions often led to heartmonitor recordings that pointed to decreased blood flow in the arteries to theheart. This decreased blood flow can cause a heart attack.ACTION STEPEliminating bad brain habits, exercising, and taking fish oil can be veryhelpful in boosting blood flow to the heart and brain.Depression Many studies report that depression increases the risk of heartattacks and sudden death. Getting depression treated promptly and effectively iscritical to heart health. The negative thinking patterns that are associatedwith depression also de crease HRV.Grief As discussed earlier, grief can send stress signals to the heart, causingvasospasm and abnormal heart rhythms. Finding effective ways to deal with griefmay save your life. In one study, Dr. Ivan Mendoza of Caracas, Venezuela, foundthat when he reviewed 102 cases of sudden death in people ages thirty-seven toseventy-nine, thirteen of the deaths occurred on the anniversary of a parent’sdeath. Ten of the sudden deaths occurred in men, who typically internalize theirfeelings, and four of the thirteen died at the same age their parent did.Learning to deal with grief through talking, crying, processing your feelings,and correcting bad thinking habits can save your life.Anxiety disorders Panic attacks, phobias, fears, obsessions, and compulsions allincrease stress on your heart and increase the chances for heart problems.Mitral valve prolapse, a condition where the mitral valve in the heart worksinefficiently, has long been known to be associated with anxiety.Untreated ADD Being late all the time, not completing tasks, always puttingthings off until the last minute; being distracted, inattentive, anddisorganized; having relationship problems; seeking conflict; and having school,work, or relationship problems are all symptoms commonly associated with ADD.Always living on the edge or being upset with someone puts a strain on yourbrain and your heart. A Mayo Clinic study found that people who have ADD usenonpsychiatric medical services three times more than the general population.Constant excitement In a world where we are literally thrilling ourselves todeath by overdoing video games, scary movies, texting, e-mail, and computertime, we are decreasing the health of our brain and heart. The body needs timefor rest and reflection. It is okay to tone down all of the high-stimulusactivities.ACTION STEPGetting ADD effectively treated certainly helps your brain, and it also helpsyour heart.Relationship problems Trouble with the important people in your life predisposespeople to depression, anxiety, and heart problems. There is solid scientificresearch that working on your relationships can help heal depression and sootheyour heart. Or, in my own case—as I discussed in the introduction to thischapter—after my first wife and I had seen eight therapists, the chest pain wastelling me it was time to move on. My heart has been much healthier with theright partner.Dementia Heart disease in its many forms, such as hypertension, heart attacks,and heart arrhythmias, all increase the risk of Alzheimer’s disease and otherforms of dementia. Taking care of your heart is also a very positive step towardtaking care of your brain.Inflammation Chronic inflammation from any cause constricts blood flow to theheart and to the brain. Many scientists now think it is one of the major causesof both cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer’s disease. Homocysteine andC-reactive protein tests are laboratory measures of inflammation. Taking stepsto decrease inflammation, such as eating right and taking fish oil, are criticalto the health of every system in your body.Blood sugar abnormalities Diabetes and blood sugar abnormalities are deadlybecause they eventually cause your small blood vessels to become brittle andbreak, causing strokes, dementia, and heart attacks. Making sure you exerciseand have a brain-body-healthy diet is critical to the brain-heart connection.Doctors have known for decades that too much carbohydrate-laden foods like whitebread and cornflakes can be detrimental to heart health. In an important newstudy, researchers showed how these high-carbohydrate foods increase the riskfor heart problems. Dr. Michael Shechter of Tel Aviv University and colleaguesvisualized exactly what happens inside the body when the wrong foods for ahealthy heart are eaten. He found that foods with a high glycemic indexdistended brachial arteries for several hours. Elasticity of arteries anywherein the body can be a measure of heart health. But when aggravated over time, asudden expansion of the artery wall can cause a number of negative healtheffects, including reduced elasticity, which can cause heart disease or suddendeath. Hold the ice cream and Frosted Flakes.ACTION STEPTo prevent rapid increases in blood sugar levels, stick to foods like oatmeal,fruits and vegetables, legumes, and nuts, which have a low-glycemic index andare also great for your brain.Dr. Shechter says, “Doctors know that high-glycemic foods rapidly in creaseblood sugar. Those who binge on these foods have a greater chance of suddendeath from heart attack. Our research connects the dots, showing the linkbetween diet and what’s happening in real time in the arteries.”Obesity As we saw in Chapter 3 [Amen_9780307463593_epub_c03_r1.htm], “The WeightSolution,” excess fat is associated with inflammation, more stored toxins in thebody, hypertension, and dementia. HRV has also been found to be low in obeseindividuals. Paying attention to decreasing the fat on your body will help yourbrain and your heart.Excessive alcohol In small to moderate amounts, alcohol is reported to be goodfor your heart and, some studies even suggest for your brain. HRV is improvedwith small amounts of wine, but not beer or hard liquor. The problem, of course,is not with a little bit of alcohol, it is with a lot. Daily drinking isassociated with a smaller brain, which means poorer decision making, stress, andheartache. In a fascinating study from the Harvard School of Public Health onthe preventable causes of death, alcohol use caused 90,000 deaths a year fromroad traffic and other injuries, violence, chronic liver disease, cancers,alcohol-use disorders, stroke, arrhythmias, and hypertensive disease. On theother hand, alcohol was reported to have averted 26,000 deaths due to itspositive effect on heart health. On balance, it seems that less alcohol isbetter.Unbalanced hormones Low testosterone levels in men and low estrogen levels inwomen have been associated with lowered HRV and heart disease. See Chapter 7[Amen_9780307463593_epub_c07_r1.htm], “The Hormone Solution,” to make sure yourhormones are properly balanced.BRAIN-HEART CONNECTION BOOSTERSLove and positive emotion It is well established that chronic anger and negativeemotion can have a damaging effect on your brain and your heart, while positiveemotion can improve HRV and overall brain and heart health. Focus on what youlove about your life and those around you, and your heart will be healthier andhappier. I have seen many patients throughout the years who have told me thatthey are pessimists so they will never be disappointed. My response afterunderstanding the brain-heart connection is that they may never be disappointedbut they are also likely to die earlier.Laughter Laughter is another form of positive emotion that can influence yourbrain, heart, and blood-vessel function. In a unique study, researchers from theUniversity of Maryland found that while watching funny movies, such as There’sSomething About Mary, nineteen out of twenty people had increased blood flow tothe heart. Conversely, watching stressful movies, such as the opening scene fromSaving Private Ryan, decreased blood flow in fourteen out of twenty people.Specifically, blood flow decreased by about 35 percent after experiencingstress, while blood flow increased by 22 percent after laughing, which isequivalent to what happens after a fifteen-to thirty-minute workout.The ability of blood vessels to expand is known as vasodilation and is a sign ofheart health. Decreased blood flow limits the body’s ability to react tophysical or emotional stress and results in an increased risk of heart attacksand strokes. Past studies have found that stress hormones like adrenalin andcortisol, which are released when a person is stressed, may harm the body bysuppressing the immune system and constricting blood vessels. On the other hand,laughing causes the body to release chemicals called endorphins, which maycounteract the effects of stress hormones and cause blood vessels to dilate. Ina similar manner, laughing may also boost the immune system and reduceinflammation, which is thought to increase the risk of various health problems.Meditation and yoga Our heart beats faster when we inhale and slower when weexhale. Most meditation and yoga techniques have us exhale slowly, which canslow our heart rate and calm our entire body. This is a wonderful technique tocalm anxiety and increase HRV. Meditation on a regular basis helps to increaseboth brain and heart health. Meditation and yoga both have strong scientificevidence that they can help decrease blood pressure.ACTION STEPGetting control of your breathing is often the first step to getting control ofyour heart and mind.One of my patients from our retired NFL player study told me that he was worriedabout his memory, which was leading to significant anxiety. He was currently aprofessional speaker and had experienced several moments where his mind would goblank while he was speaking. He noticed that the feeling of anxiety wasescalating. I told him that before his talks, he should take ten deep breaths,focusing on exhaling each breath very slowly. And, when his mind went blankduring a talk, to just take a moment and exhale slowly. Anxiety causes yourheart to race and your mind to go blank. He told me later that this simpletechnique was very helpful to him.Hand warming A fascinating biofeedback technique that increases HRV and deepensrelaxation is learning how to warm your hands with your brain. By directingattention to your hands with warm mental images, such as putting your hands infront of a warm fire, holding a cup of hot green tea, holding your partner’swarm skin, or sitting in a hot tub, many people can actually increase thetemperature in their hands and induce a generalized relaxed brain and bodystate.Whenever we are stressed, our hands get cold because blood is shunted away fromour hands and feet to the large muscles of our shoulders and hips, so we canfight or run. Learning to warm your hands counteracts the stress response andincreases parasympathetic tone and relaxation. There are a number of studiesthat report lowered blood pressure with hand warming. In one study from Korea,hand warming was used to treat patients with hypertension. A significant declineof the systolic blood pressure by 20.6 mmHg and of the diastolic blood pressureby 14.4 mmHg was observed in the treatment group.Hypnosis As I wrote earlier in this chapter, hypnosis can be a very powerfultool to enhance heart health and deep brain relaxation, especially in ourfast-paced society. When I was a student of hypnosis at the University ofCalifornia, Irvine, School of Medicine, under the direction of Donald Shafer,M.D., I saw videos of hypnotic masters changing their own blood-flow patterns.One video featured an East Indian physician in a hypnotic trance who put aneedle through a vein in her hand and then withdrew it. The vein was bleedingfrom both sides. Then, under her control, she made the bleeding stop on oneside, then made it bleed again, then made the other side stop and bleed again,then made both sides stop. It was an amazing display of brain-body control. Thisgave me the idea of hypnotic trances, relaxation, and bloodvessel control. As anintern, whenever I had a difficult time drawing blood from a patient, I wouldput them in a light trance, which made it easier for both of us.Ability to regulate emotion Having control over your thoughts and feelings is akey skill in enhancing mood and emotion. A study from Brazil also reports thatthis skill is essential in regulating HRV and heart health. When you allow yourthoughts to run wild in your brain, you may set off a panic attack, with yourheart racing, chest pain, and blood pressure spiking. Learning how to managethem using the techniques outlined in Chapter 13[Amen_9780307463593_epub_c13_r1.htm], “The ANT Solution,” will help your brainand heart.Exercise Physical activity has a positive effect on blood flow to the brain andhelps to strengthen the heart. See Chapter 5[Amen_9780307463593_epub_c05_r1.htm], “The Exercise Solution,” for moreinformation.Fish oil Taking fish oil has been found to be good for your heart and yourbrain. A number of studies report that taking fish oil and boosting omega-3fatty acids helps to raise HRV, which we have seen is good for both brain andheart health. There is also strong scientific evidence that omega-3 fatty acidsmay reduce high cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood, decrease the risk ofsudden cardiac death, and decrease blood pressure.Proper hormone levels Balanced hormones are essential for both brain and hearthealth.WARM HANDS EQUAL A WARM HEARTTake a moment to feel your hands. Feel the energy and temperature in your hands.As I mentioned earlier, there is a simple biofeedback technique that involveshand warming. When you intentionally learn how to warm your hands with yourbrain, by directing your thoughts to warming images, such as putting your handsin front of a fire … your body goes into a relaxed state.There is scientific evidence that using this technique can help you lower yourblood pressure and decreases anxiety. There is also new evidence that when yourpartner holds something warm, such as your warm hand, he or she trusts you moreand feels closer to you and more giving. Cold hands have the opposite effect.Lawrence Williams, Ph.D., assistant professor at the University of Colorado atBoulder, and John A. Bargh, Ph.D., professor of psychology at Yale University,conducted two studies on undergraduate students to assess how hand temperatureaffects emotions. They found that holding warm things may actually make peopleview others more favorably and may also make people more generous.The first study included forty-one college students with an average age of 18.5.A tester met each participant in the lobby of the building where the tests werebeing conducted. In the elevator on the way up, the tester casually asked theparticipant to hold his cup of coffee while he recorded some information on hisclipboard. The participant did not know the coffee was part of the experiment.Half the participants were asked to hold a cup of warm coffee and half wereasked to hold a cup of iced coffee.Once in the testing room, participants were given a packet of information on anunknown person described with words like intelligent, skillful, industrious,practical, and cautious. Participants were then asked to evaluate the person’spersonality using a questionnaire. Participants who had held the warm coffeewere much more likely to score the pretend person as warmer than those who hadheld the iced coffee.“When we ask whether someone is a warm person or cold person, they both have atemperature of 98.6,” Bargh, coauthor of the paper, said. “These termsimplicitly tap into the primitive experience of what it means to be warm andcold.”In the second experiment, fifty-three participants were asked to hold either ahot or a cold therapeutic pad. Participants thought their role was to evaluatethe product. After the “test,” they were offered a reward for themselves or atreat for a friend. The people who had held the warm pad were more likely tochoose the reward for the friend.“It appears that the effect of physical temperature is not just on how we seeothers, it affects our own behavior as well,” Bargh says. “Physical warmth canmake us see others as warmer people, but also cause us to be warmer—moregenerous and trusting—as well. At a board meeting, for instance, being willingto reach out and touch another human being, to share their hand, thoseexperiences do matter although we may not always be aware of them.”These studies are so interesting because we know that when our hands are cold weare more likely to be anxious and fearful, traits that decrease intimacy andcloseness to others.Here’s a simple exercise to bring heartfelt closeness in your intimaterelationships. When holding your partner’s hand, imagine warm, loving energygoing from your hand to hers. With each exhale, send warm and intentionalthoughts of love and gratitude. Do this for just a few minutes a day and soonyou will begin to notice a positive difference in your relationship. I have seenin our imaging studies that the act of focusing loving, grateful energy can bevery powerful.The brain-heart solution lies in understanding that taking care of your brain ishelping to love your heart, and caring for your heart is absolutely essential incaring for your brain.The Heart SolutionHeart Robbers Heart Boosters Hostility, anger Positive emotion, love, gratitude,appreciation Grief Ability to regulate mood and emotion Relationship problems,loneliness Connection Frustration Forgiveness Chronic stress, need forexcitement Meditation/yoga Depression Hand warming Anxiety Hypnosis ADD Holdinga puppy Sleep deprivation Healthy sleep Obesity Losing weight Diabetes/bloodsugar spikes Soothing music Air pollution Smelling lavender Decreased blood flowfrom any cause Exercise Poor diet Eating more fruits and vegetables DementiaFish oil Inflammation Laughter Excessive alcohol Limited alcohol Unbalancedhormone levels Balanced hormone levels"},{"pageContent":"9THE FOCUS AND ENERGY SOLUTIONBOOST YOUR ENERGY TO STAY ON TRACK TOWARD YOUR GOALSAnd what is a man without energy? Nothing—nothing at all.—MARK TWAINDwayne, forty-five, one of my close friends, came to the clinic for a scan. Hisenergy had been waning, and his mind felt older than he liked. He had troubleconcentrating, was starting to mix up names, was more forgetful, and wasstruggling with mental fatigue throughout the day, especially midafternoon andevening. He was working two jobs, one of which was being a psychotherapist inthe evening. His wife was becoming very frustrated with him, as he had no timeor emotion to give her. When we performed a brain SPECT scan on Dwayne, itshowed overall decreased activity in his brain.Dwayne had a slew of bad brain habits. He rarely got more than five hours ofsleep, drank eight to ten cups of coffee a day, did not exercise, and mostly hada fast-food diet on the run. Dwayne had sent me plenty of patients for scans, sowhen he saw his own brain, he knew something had to change. “But I can’t stopthe caffeine,” he said. “I will not be able to work at night. I will be a mess.”“That is only your distorted thought as a justification of the caffeine,” Isaid. Because of our relationship and the fact that Dwayne was a psychotherapistwho understood my work, I could be candid with him. “You do not want to gothrough the pain of withdrawal, so you rationalize that it is easier to continueto poison yourself. Not that smart.”“No, seriously, I will fall apart without the caffeine,” he replied.“Is that true?” I asked. “Can you absolutely know that it is true?” I wasborrowing a phrase from the work of my friend Byron Katie, who wrote Loving WhatIs, a book that teaches people to question their own thoughts.Image 9.1 Dwayne’s Caffeinated SPECT Scan[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_029_r1.jpg]Scalloping, toxic appearanceDwayne thought for several moments, then said, “I guess I really don’t know, butsomething has got to change.”Dwayne realized that his thoughts were only setting him up to fail, and heagreed to cut back on his caffeine use, get better sleep, and get on abrain-healthy diet. A month later, I got an excited call from Dwayne. He told mehe had completely cut out the caffeine and that he was sleeping and eatingbetter. “I feel ten years younger,” he said. “You were right, thank you.” I loveDwayne’s story, because it highlights how the little lies that we tell ourselvesare ruining the health of our brains and our bodies. You can have better energyand focus by paying attention to the health of your brain.Another friend, Ted, called me late at night complaining of feeling sad,overwhelmed, unfocused, and tired. This was very unusual for Ted, whom I hadknown for fifteen years. He had just had a physical, and the doctor foundnothing to explain why he felt so bad. I asked him if his doctor ordered atestosterone level. He said no. I told him to have his doctor order a total andfree testosterone level. Both results came back very low. Testosteronereplacement caused a marked positive change in my friend’s health and overallenergy level. As you saw in Chapter 7 [Amen_9780307463593_epub_c07_r1.htm], “TheHormone Solution,” when testosterone levels are low, both men and women are moreprone to low energy, poor concentration, depression, low libido, and memoryproblems.Image 9.2 Ted’s Low-Testosterone SPECT Scan[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_030_r1.jpg]Low overall activityYour energy and focus are dependent on the health of your brain. In order tostay on track toward your goals and to have the best body possible, it iscritical to optimize your brain so that you can be focused and energetic. Our“bad brain habits” on a daily basis are hurting our ability to concentrate andto feel the energy we need to achieve our goals for a better body. We needenergy to get our butts out of bed and off the couch in order to be physicallyactive. We need energy to help us deal with daily stress. We need energy to cooknutritious meals rather than opting for fast food because we’re too tired tocook. We need laser-sharp focus to plan what we are going to do once we arriveat the gym. We need focus to help us grocery shop and plan what we are going tomake for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The goal is to wake up every day with thefocus to know what you need to do to get the body you want and the energy to doit.In this chapter, we will look at the focus and energy solution to help you livea healthier, more vibrant life. We will look at the “focus and energy robbers”and the “focus and energy boosters,” plus develop a focus and energy solutionall of us can use.FOCUS AND ENERGY ROBBERSFocus and energy robbers fall into a number of different categories, includingthese: * Inherited brain disorders * Infectious causes * Hormonal issues * Low or erratic blood sugar states from any cause * Anemia * Brain trauma * Environmental toxins * Medications * Chronic stress * Untreated past emotional trauma * Bad brain habitsLet’s look at some of these in greater detail.Inherited brain disorders These include illnesses, such as attention deficitdisorder (ADD), some forms of depression, anxiety disorders, andobsessive-compulsive disorder. These disorders tend to run in families. Ofcourse, there are many environmental factors that can make these problems betteror worse, but there is a definite inherited vulnerability to them.ACTION STEPTo ease ADD symptoms, try exercise, an elimination diet, and supplementationwith fish oil, zinc, acetyl-l-carnitine, and SAMe.ADD is the classic focus and energy problem. The energy issue can be too much,such as hyperactivity or restlessness, or too little, which is often associatedwith a subtype of ADD called inattentive ADD. Both types almost always start inchildhood, but the inattentive type, which is more common in girls, is oftenmissed because the students are not disruptive like their hyperactive brethren,often appear spacey, and may have low energy. In addition, symptoms common toboth types of ADD include distractibility, disorganization, trouble being ontime, poor handwriting, and being too sensitive to touch, smells, and light.Dietary interventions may be helpful for ADD. As noted earlier, a study fromHolland reported that children who were put on an elimination diet and ate onlylean protein, fruits, vegetables, rice, and pear juice had the same positiveresponse rate they had when given Ritalin, a common medication for ADD. Exercisehas also been found to be helpful. Certain supplements such as fish oil, zinc,acetyl-l-carnitine, B6, and magnesium have also been found to be helpful forsome people with ADD (see Appendix C, “The Supplement Solution,” for moreinformation), while others do better with medications, such as Ritalin,Adderall, or Provigil.Our brain imaging work has taught us that illnesses such as ADD, anxiety, anddepression are not single or simple disorders, and all of them have multipletypes. Knowing which type you have is essential to getting the right help. Youcan see my books Healing ADD and Healing Anxiety and Depression for moredetailed information.Julie, fifty-four, came to see me for low energy and problems with focus. Shewas also disorganized, easily distracted, often late or in a hurry, andfrequently in conflict with her husband. Her general lab work, including herhormone levels, was normal, plus she had had the primary problems since gradeschool. Her teachers always told her parents that if only she tried harder, shewould do better. I have noticed on brain SPECT scans that the harder people withADD try, the worse their brains look. Typically, we do two brain SPECT scans onour patients, one at rest and one when they are doing a concentration task. Atrest, the ADD person’s brain often looks fine, but when they try to concentrate,there is often decreased activity, especially in the front part of the brain inthe PFC, which is often responsible for sustained attention. We published arecent study that reported this drop-off of activity helps to predict a positiveresponse to stimulant medication over 80 percent of the time.Julie’s scan showed decreased PFC activity with concentration compared to rest,which meant the harder she tried, the worse it got for her. On treatment, whichincluded fish oil, a healthy diet, exercise, acetyl-l-carnitine, and SAMe, shedid much better, especially in the areas of her energy and focus.Untreated depression and anxiety disorders are also commonly associated with lowenergy and trouble focusing. A persistent sad mood, in combination with sleepproblems, appetite issues (either too much or too little), and persistentnegative thoughts, including feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, orworthlessness, tension, fear, and dread, are common symptoms of anxiety anddepression and need to be explored. Untreated depression actually doublespeople’s risk for Alzheimer’s disease. Chapter 15[Amen_9780307463593_epub_c15_r1.htm], “The Brain Health Solution,” explores thisissue in more depth.Image 9.3 Julie’s ADD Scan at Rest[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_031_r1.jpg]Overall healthy activityImage 9.4 Julie’s ADD Scan When Concentrating[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_032_r1.jpg]Decreased prefrontal cortex activityInfectious causes Infections, such as chronic fatigue syndrome or Lyme disease,rob people of their energy and focus. When I first started in private practice,chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) was often thought of as a “crock” illness. Thereis not a single reliable test to diagnose CFS, so many physicians thought thesepatients were “psychiatric” and sent them to me. I hated when that happened. Itseemed that whenever a doctor did not know what to do for a patient, he or shewould label the mysterious illness as “psychosomatic” and send the patient to apsychiatrist or psychologist. When I scanned my first group of ten or so CFSpatients, I was horrified at the level of damage I saw on the scans.Joan was referred to me by her family physician, who thought her “fatigue andtrouble focusing” was all in her mind. The limited tests her doctor did cameback normal. Joan’s brain SPECT scan showed severe overall decreased activity(Image 9.5).This level of damage is not caused by negative thinking or past emotional trauma(although neither of those things helps a brain). Likely, there are many causesof CFS, which need to be worked up by a competent professional. But if you feelterrible and someone says it is all in your head, they may be right. It may bean illness or an infection that affects your brain, which was the case withJoan. In recent years, we have also seen that the brain is often, although notalways, affected by Lyme disease. Other infections, such as meningitis or HIV,can also seriously negatively impact the brain.Image 9.5 Chronic Fatigue Syndrome[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_033_r1.jpg]Overall decreased activityHormonal issues As you can see from Ted’s story, low hormone levels canseriously affect energy levels, focus, and brain function. Some of the worstscans I have seen have been low-thyroid scans. There is a group of scientificstudies showing severe low activity with hypothyroidism. Low estrogen levelshave been associated with decreased brain activity, as well, especially in thearea of the brain that makes people more vulnerable to Alzheimer’s disease.Chapter 7 [Amen_9780307463593_epub_c07_r1.htm], “The Hormone Solution,”discusses hormones in detail.Low or erratic blood sugar states from any cause Things like hypoglycemia, poordiet, or diabetes may have a significant negative effect on energy and focus.This is one reason I tell my employees not to have candy out on their desks forothers to grab when they walk by. These people are looking for love in the wrongplace. Most people know that when you eat a sugar load, you may have a bloodsugar spike and then a blood sugar lull. A recent television piece on the Obamaadministration showed that many of his staffers had M&Ms on their desks. I washorrified that the White House would not have better eating guidelines for theirstaff. Don’t you want the country’s business performed by people who can focusand have great energy? I applaud the Obamas for planting a vegetable garden, butthe president’s smoking and the plentiful candy are not great brain-healthyexamples.ACTION STEPEat small meals that include at least some protein throughout the day to avoidblood sugar spikes and crashes.Anemia Anything that lowers your red blood cell count, such as anemia, causesyou to feel tired and unfocused. Excessive alcohol use causes red blood cells tobecome enlarged and inefficient. Hold the alcohol.I once had a close friend who complained of feeling scattered, tired, anddepressed. Her scan looked like she was an alcoholic or a drug addict, but I hadknown her for many years and knew that this was not the case. In working upmedical causes of fatigue, we discovered she had pernicious anemia from avitamin B12 deficiency (Image 9.6). After treatment, her brain looked much, muchbetter and she felt like her old energetic and focused self.Brain trauma Physical injuries, strokes, lack of oxygen, or other trauma cancause serious brain damage and affect energy and focus.My sister Mary is a very successful insurance agent and has been a member of thehigh-producing insurance agent organization Million Dollar Roundtable for thepast twenty-eight years. In 1994, she lost her husband, Oscar, to stomachcancer, which was very stressful for Mary and her four children. Now as a singlemother, Mary was chronically stressed. Fifteen months later, she was in a caraccident. Afterward, she noticed problems with her focus, follow-through,energy, drive, and motivation. Her scan showed damage to the left side of herbrain. The death of Oscar and the accident had drained all of her brain reserve.Image 9.6 Vitamin B12 Anemia[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_034_r1.jpg]ACTION STEPIf you experience any form of brain trauma, it is critical that you adopt abrain-healthy program to enhance brain function.Getting on a brain-healthy program, including supplements—such as fish oil,acetyl-l-carnitine, and ginkgo biloba to enhance overall brain function—andintense exercise along with cognitive retraining made a huge difference for her.Both of her follow-up scans have shown significant improvement.Environmental toxins Toxins, such as mold exposure, can cause trouble. In 1998,a colleague of mine named Carolyn moved into a home that had been flooded at onetime. Very soon after she and her family moved in, they started experiencinghealth issues. For example, Carolyn suffered from numerous bouts of bronchitis,and she kept getting skin rashes. Over the next couple of years, her symptomsworsened. Carolyn, who had worked as a therapist for years, found that she couldno longer focus on what her patients were saying and couldn’t think clearlyenough to offer them appropriate treatment plans. She often felt anxious andsometimes couldn’t tell right from left, which made it very difficult for her todrive.Her youngest son was in high school at the time, and he kept telling her that hecouldn’t focus or concentrate well enough to study at home. So he would headover to a friend’s house, where he had no problem hitting the books. At home, hehad no energy to get going in the morning, and he started racking up tardies atschool. Whenever he spent the night at a friend’s house, though, he feltenergetic, popped up out of bed with no problem, and easily made it to school ontime.ACTION STEPIf your home has ever been flooded or had water damage, check for mold.By 2001, Carolyn knew there was something very wrong, but she didn’t know what.One day, she saw a feature about toxic mold on TV and suspected that this mightbe the problem. She set up an appointment with a doctor to get tested forallergies to mold, and she hired a mold inspector to check the house. The testscame back positive—mold was the culprit. She and her family moved out of thehouse that year and never went back. Her children have recovered well for themost part, but Carolyn still hasn’t returned to work and lives with residualsensitivities. She says she has good days when her brain functions well and baddays when she has trouble focusing and thinking.Medications Many medications, including chemotherapy, beta-blockers, antianxietypills, antidepressants, and painkillers, can sap energy or make it moredifficult to focus. Most cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiationtherapy, not only kill cancer cells but also kill normal cells. After someonegoes through chemotherapy, radiation, or both, their brain scans often show atoxic appearance, meaning their brains have been affected as well. Manypost-chemotherapy or-radiation patients complain of low energy, poorconcentration, memory problems, and a general lowering of cognitive ability.Understanding this and caring for these brains is absolutely essential to havingthe best brain and body possible. Many cancer chemotherapy medications gostraight to the brain, and they target not only dividing cancer cells but alsoany normal brain cells that are dividing. While the problem area is targeted anddestroyed, there are always “innocent bystanders” caught in the crossfire.Angelo came to the Amen Clinics for a repeat scan after he was aggressivelytreated for leukemia. We had seen him five years earlier for problems in hismarriage. This time he complained of memory problems, trouble concentrating, andlow energy. His SPECT scan showed significant toxicity and lower overallactivity not seen on his prior scan. On our brain recovery program, he felt muchbetter and his energy and ability to focus improved.Chronic stress As you saw with the example of my sister Mary, chronic stress canlead to focus and energy problems.Untreated past emotional trauma Any trauma from the past that still haunts youis yet another energy and focus robber and is important to get treated.Bad brain habits Too much caffeine, alcohol, or sugar; drug use; lack ofexercise; poor sleep; poor diet; and negative thinking patterns makeconcentration and focus much worse. Drinking large amounts of alcohol—four ormore glasses of wine or the equivalent in hard liquor on a daily basis—raisesthe risk of dementia. New research shows that even moderate amounts of alcoholhave negative effects on the brain. One study found that people who drink threetimes a week have smaller brains than do nondrinkers.ACTION STEPIf you want better, sustainable energy and focus, the very first thing to do isto treat energy-robbing conditions and eliminate energy-robbing habits.New research using brain scans confirms that marijuana use harms the brain. In astudy appearing in the Journal of Psychiatric Research, researchers showed thatheavy marijuana use among young adults and adolescents may affect normal braindevelopment, interrupting an important process called myelinization. Withmyelinization, brain cells are coated with a protective sheath that increasesthe brain’s processing speeds. The process, which isn’t completed until aboutage twenty-five, starts at the back of the brain and works forward, making thePFC the last area to gain the protective covering. This explains why thesubjects in this study showed abnormalities in their PFC and temporal lobes, theareas of the brain involved with decision making, attention, executivefunctioning, memory, and language. With a brain that hasn’t developed properly,it is harder to stay focused and make the best decisions for your health.FOCUS AND ENERGY BOOSTERSMy mother is known as the Energizer Bunny. At age seventy-eight, she canoutgolf, outshop, outcook, and outentertain people half her age. She can go frommorning to late at night with a great attitude and a big heart. She has sevenchildren, twenty-one grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren. She issomeone I can call at the last minute and tell I want to bring five people overfor dinner, and she will then tell me what to pick up at the store. She hasamazing energy, a great attitude, and is always ready to play and have fun. Herlifestyle boosts her energy. She exercises regularly by playing golf, doesn’tdrink coffee or smoke, rarely drinks alcohol, and eats healthfully.ACTION STEPHere is a typical lab panel I order for my patients who struggle with issues ofenergy and focus to rule out medical causes that may be contributing to theproblem. It is a good idea to discuss this panel with your health-care provider. * Complete blood count—to rule out anemia, inefficient red blood cells, or too little or too many white blood cells * Fasting chemistry metabolic panel—to check the health of the kidneys, liver, and blood glucose levels * B12—deficiency is a common cause of anemia and lethargy * Folate—an essential brain nutrient * 25-hydroxy vitamin D—low levels are commonly seen with depression, memory problems, and immune system problems * C-reactive protein—a measure of inflammation * Homocysteine—a measure of inflammation * Lipid panel * Fasting insulin * Hemoglobin A1C to check risk for diabetes * Two-hour postmeal glucose—for those suspected of low blood sugar or hypoglycemia * Thyroid panel with TSH, free T3, free T4, thyroid antibodies gland, and thyroid antibodies hormone * DHEA-S * Free and total serum testosterone for men and women * Estradiol and progesterone for women over forty-five years of age * Food-allergy testing * Fatty acid profile to check levels of omega-3 fatty acidsThe first step to getting the energy and focus you need is to eliminate andtreat the focus and energy robbers described above. At the same time, developand maintain a brain-healthy lifestyle described in this book, make sure to getadequate sleep, eat a brain-healthy diet to maintain a level blood sugarthroughout the day, exercise four or five times a week, use a stress-reductionprogram (because anxiety and stress rob us of energy and concentration), andtest and optimize your hormone levels.Even though it sounds odd, meditation in particular is one of the best energyboosters. Researchers from our laboratory and others around the world havedemonstrated that meditation enhances activity in the brain’s PFC, even to thepoint of boosting the number of brain cells. The better your PFC functions, themore focused and energetic you feel. Spend ten minutes every day meditating toboost your energy. See Chapter 11 [Amen_9780307463593_epub_c11_r1.htm] forsimple meditation techniques.ACTION STEPIf you want better energy, meditate. Just a few minutes a day will improve yourenergy.Certain foods are energy boosters, especially those that are low in calories andhigh in fiber (from fruits, vegetables, beans, and whole grains) and protein.Since I was young, my mother was a follower of the innovative physician Dr.Henry Bieler, who emphasized diet and lifestyle for disease prevention. In 1965,he wrote Food Is Your Best Medicine, where he discussed the pH balance in thebody, with an alkaline pH being positive for the body and an acidic pH beingharmful. If the body is too acidic, it withdraws alkaline minerals, such ascalcium and magnesium, from bones and soft tissues to maintain balance. Anacidic body is a breeding ground for disease and results from consuming too muchsugar, caffeine, alcohol, and red meat. From a psychiatric standpoint this makessense, as anything that lowers magnesium can make people feel anxious, agitated,uptight, and stressed. Dr. Bieler’s Broth was a staple for my family. Itconsists of squash, string beans, celery, parsley, fresh herbs, and water.Green tea is another potential energy booster. It has about half the caffeine ascoffee, plus theanine, which helps people feel focused. There is scientificevidence that green tea helps keep weight off, boosts exercise ability, helpsmuscles recover faster from workouts, and improves attention span.In addition, there are a group of supplements with good scientific evidence oftheir helping boost mood, concentration, and energy. Stay away from caffeinatedenergy drinks, as they boost the stress hormone cortisol and can make you fat.Caffeine supplements are also associated with addiction, tolerance (where youneed to take more and more to get the same result), and withdrawal. Green tea,in moderation, is okay because the theanine content helps to balance the effectsof the caffeine.My favorite supplements to boost focus and energy are B3 (niacin), B6(pyridoxine), green tea leaf extract, rhodiola, ginseng, ashwagandha,L-tyrosine, DL-phenylalanine, ginkgo biloba, SAMe, and small amounts ofcaffeine. See Appendix C, “The Supplement Solution,” for more information.The Focus and Energy SolutionEnergy Robbers Energy Boosters Any brain problems Overall brain-healthy programBrain trauma Focus on brain protection Poor sleep Adequate sleep (at least sevenhours) Low blood sugar Frequent small meals with at least some protein tomaintain healthy blood sugar Poor diet Brain-healthy diet Alcohol/drug abuseFreedom from alcohol or drugs Depression Treatment for depression AnxietyMeditation for relaxation and to boost the PFC Chronic stress Stress-reductionplan Lack of exercise Exercise Hormone problems (i.e., thyroid, testosterone,estrogen, cortisol) Optimized hormone levels Medical problems, such as B12deficiency Treatment of any underlying medical problems Medications such asXanax or OxyContin Fish oil to decrease inflammation and enhance blood flowDiabetes Diet and exercise Environmental toxins Great ventilation andelimination of any toxins Any systemic inflammation Anti-inflammation program,including fish oil, healthy diet, and folic acid, and for some, low-doseibuprofen or baby aspirin Chemotherapy Supplements, such as vitamins B3 and B6,L-tyrosine, DL-phenylalanine, green tea leaf extract with L-theanine, Panaxginseng, rhodiola, ashwagandha, SAMe, and a small amount of caffeine Excessivecaffeine When you want a caffeine boost, get it from tea, which has been shownto help keep off weight, boost exercise ability, ease muscle recovery fromworkouts, and improve attention span and relaxation"},{"pageContent":"PART FOUR[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_line_r1.jpg]CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, INCREASE LOVE AND VITALITY"},{"pageContent":"10THE SLEEP SOLUTIONREST YOUR BRAIN FOR A SLIMMER SHAPE AND SMOOTHER SKINSleep plays a major role in preparing the body and brain for an alert,productive, psychologically and physiologically healthy tomorrow.—JAMES MAAS, PH.D., POWER SLEEPYou know how bad you look and feel after a night of poor sleep. You feel likeyour head is glued to the pillow, and you can barely muster the energy to getout of bed. You shuffle to the bathroom, turn on the light, and comeface-to-face with puffy bags and dark circles under your eyes. You head outsidefor your usual thirty-minute jog but stop after ten minutes because you feelwhipped. Then you head to work, where you snap at your coworkers and customersbecause you are in a foul mood. It isn’t a pretty picture, is it?Good sleep is essential for optimal brain and body health. It is involved inrejuvenating all the cells in your body, gives brain cells a chance to repairthemselves, and activates neuronal connections that might otherwise deterioratedue to inactivity. It is also necessary if you want to have glowing skin, highenergy, a sunny mood, excellent health, and stable weight. Unfortunately, asmany as seventy million Americans have trouble sleeping. If you are one of them,your brain and body could be in trouble.ARE YOU GETTING ENOUGH SLEEP?Many Americans aren’t getting the sleep they need. According to the 2009 Sleepin America Poll, Americans are averaging only six hours and forty minutes ofsleep on workdays and school nights. People tend to squeeze in an extratwenty-seven minutes of sleep on weekends. Even more disturbing, the percentageof people getting less than six hours of sleep has risen from 12 percent in 1998to 20 percent in 2009, while the percentage of Americans getting a good eighthours a night has decreased from 35 percent in 1998 to 28 percent in 2009. Thenumbers reveal that getting a good night’s sleep is becoming little more than anelusive dream for many Americans. Chronic sleep problems affect millions of us.Temporary sleep issues are even more common and will affect almost every one ofus at some point in our lifetime.AVERAGE SLEEP REQUIREMENTS BY AGE Age Range Number of Hours of Sleep 1–3 yearsold 12–14 hours 3–5 years old 11–13 hours 5–12 years old 10–11 hours 13–19 yearsold 9 hours Adults 7–8 hours Seniors 7–8 hours Sources: National SleepFoundation, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and StrokeThink about your own sleep habits. When was the last time you drifted off tosleep easily, slept soundly all night long, and woke up feeling refreshed andalert? When was the last time you hopped out of bed in the morning raring to go?When was the last time you sat down to watch a movie and didn’t nod off? If youaren’t getting adequate sleep, your brain and body are at risk.Sleep troubles come in many varieties. Do you have trouble falling asleep? Doyou go to sleep easily but wake up repeatedly throughout the night? Do you findit hard to drag yourself out of bed in the morning? Do you or your significantother snore? All of these problems can lead to decreased brain function and asecond-rate body. Getting less than six hours of sleep a night has beenassociated with lower overall brain activity, which can affect your weight, yourskin, your mood, your health, and your athletic performance.ACTION STEPStop trying to convince yourself that you need only five hours of sleep eachnight. Be aware of the basic sleep requirements for your age group.WHY LOSING SLEEP CAN MAKE YOU FATYou probably thought that your cravings for candy and cookies were just a signof mental weakness and a lack of willpower on your part. You may be wrong. Anexpanding body of evidence has shown that sleep deprivation is associated withweight gain and obesity. Here’s what researchers from around the nation havediscovered about sleep and your weight.According to a study from the University of Chicago, people who are sleepdeprived eat more simple carbohydrates than people who get adequate sleep. Theresearchers studied twelve healthy men in their twenties and found that when themen slept only four hours a night, they were more likely to choose candy,cookies, and cake over fruit, vegetables, or dairy products.For this study, which appeared in the Annals of Internal Medicine, researchersalso looked at two hormones—leptin and ghrelin—that are regulated by sleep andinvolved in appetite. As discussed earlier, leptin and ghrelin work together tocontrol feelings of hunger and satiety. Ghrelin levels rise to signal the brainthat you are hungry, then leptin levels increase to tell your brain when you arefull. The researchers measured the levels of leptin and ghrelin before thestudy, after two nights of only four hours of sleep, and after two nights of tenhours of sleep. After four hours of sleep, the ratio of ghrelin jumped 71percent, compared to a night when the men slept for the longer period of time.This made the men feel hungrier and drove them to consume more simplecarbohydrates. As explained in an earlier chapter, eating simple carbs sendsblood sugar levels skyrocketing then plummeting, which saps energy and leavesyou feeling fatigued.In a study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, researchershad people sleep for five and a half hours for two weeks and then eight and ahalf hours for another two weeks at random. Then they measured how many snacksthe subjects munched during their stays in the sleep laboratory. When the peopleslept only five and a half hours, they consumed an average of 221 more caloriesin high-carbohydrate snacks than when they got eight and a half hours of sleep.This pattern occurs in the real world, too, not just in researchers’ sleep labs.According to the 2009 Sleep in America Poll, people who are having troublesleeping are almost twice as likely to chow down on sugary foods and simplecarbs, such as potato chips, to help them make it through the day. They are alsomore inclined to skip breakfast or other meals, which puts your blood sugarlevels on a roller-coaster ride that’s bad for brain function and often leads topoor nutrition choices later in the day.Sleeping less makes you eat more sugary junk foods rather than fruits,vegetables, and whole grains. It also makes you eat more calories overall, whichincreases your risk of gaining weight and becoming obese. A study fromresearchers at Case Western University tracked the sleeping habits and weightfluctuations of 68,183 women for sixteen years. The women were divided intothree categories—those who slept seven hours a night, those who logged six hoursof sleep, and those who got five hours or less of sleep. They found that thewomen who slept five hours or less gained the most weight over time and were themost likely to become obese. The women who slept only six hours a night weremore likely to pack on extra weight than the women who got seven hours ofshut-eye.Dozens of other studies point to a connection between a lack of sleep and weightgain or obesity. For example, researchers at the University of Warwick, England,reviewed data from more than 28,000 children and more than 15,000 adults andfound that sleep deprivation almost doubles the risk of obesity for adults andchildren. Another study conducted by researchers at Stanford University foundthat people who sleep less have higher body mass index (BMI) levels.The Stanford University study also found lower leptin levels and higher ghrelinlevels in people who sleep less. The researchers examined a thousand people,measuring their sleep habits, their sleep on the night before the exam, andtheir leptin and ghrelin levels. They found that people who consistently sleptfive hours or less per night had on average 14.9 percent more ghrelin (whichstimulates appetite) and 15.5 percent lower leptin (which tells your brain youare full) than people who slept eight hours a night. These studies show thatwhen you don’t get enough sleep, you feel hungrier and don’t feel fullregardless of how much you eat, so you eat more, which makes you fat!ACTION STEPIf you are trying to drop excess weight, spend more time in bed.So, if dodging sleep can make you fat, can getting adequate sleep help you loseweight? Editors at Glamour magazine decided to put this notion to the test withan unscientific—yet fascinating—study. They enlisted seven female readers andgave them one simple task: sleep at least seven and a half hours each night forten weeks. In addition, they were instructed not to make any significant changesin their diets or exercise routines during the ten weeks. The results wereamazing. All seven women lost weight, with the weight loss ranging from sixpounds to an astonishing fifteen pounds.GET MORE SLEEP FOR SKIN THAT GLOWSWe often talk about getting our “beauty sleep,” and we couldn’t be more accuratewith that description. Getting adequate sleep actually does far more for yourskin than a medicine cabinet filled with wrinkle creams, moisturizers, acnetreatments, and antiaging serums. With the right amount of sleep, your skin willlook younger, smoother, and more refreshed. When you try to get by on littlesleep, you set yourself up for premature aging of the skin, dark circles underthe eyes, even acne. Here’s how sleep can benefit your skin.ACTION STEPGive your skin adequate time to repair itself at night.Rejuvenate the skin. Cell regeneration is a process during which old, dead skincells are replaced with fresh new cells. This process goes on at all timeswithin the body, but it happens more quickly at night so you generate more newskin cells while you sleep than at any other time. As we get older, cellreplacement slows down, which makes sleep even more crucial if you want to delaythe thin, saggy skin that comes with age.Reverse skin damage. On a daily basis, your skin is faced with elements,including the sun’s harmful UV rays, secondhand smoke, and other environmentalpollutants, which cause premature aging and damage. While you sleep, your skinrepairs itself from this daily damage.Prevent acne. As we sleep, the brain regulates the body’s hormones, includingandrogens, which stimulate the production of sebum, or oil, in glands located inthe skin. When hormones are balanced, sebum production is regulated to help keepskin looking clear and smooth. Hormonal imbalances can cause too much sebumproduction, which can lead to acne.LOSE SLEEP AND YOU LOSE FOCUS AND WILLPOWERPeople who get less than seven hours of sleep a night have lower activity in theprefrontal cortex and temporal lobes, which are involved in memory and learning.This limits the ability to pay attention, learn, solve problems, and rememberimportant information. These are all vital skills you need if you want to tacklea new dance routine, learn a new sport, learn to cook brain-healthy recipes, orremember to take your medications. Considering this, it is no surprise thatsleep-deprived individuals struggle to maintain a healthy body.ACTION STEPImprove your willpower by maintaining a regular sleep schedule seven days aweek.HIT THE SACK FOR PEAK ATHLETIC PERFORMANCEIt should come as no surprise that lack of sleep hinders athletic performance.Anyone who has ever exercised or played sports while sleep deprived knows thatit is tough to be at your best on the court, on the field, or in the gym.Research shows us that sleep deprivation impairs motor function, which makes youless coordinated and more likely to strike out at bat or shank your drive on thegolf course. Reaction times are slowed, so you don’t get to the ball fastenough. The reduced cognitive functioning associated with lack of sleep meansthat you may not make the best on-court decisions or may not remember the newsteps you learned the week before in your ballroom dancing class. Plus, you tendto feel tired faster because sleep deprivation negatively affects glucosemetabolism.On the other hand, getting a good night’s sleep can give your game a boost.That’s according to researchers at Stanford University who looked at therelationship between sleep habits and athletic performance in six male Stanfordbasketball players. The researchers measured the subjects’ sprint times as wellas free-throw and three-point shooting percentages. For the first two weeks, thecollege players maintained their regular sleep habits; for the second two weeks,they were told to get as much extra sleep as possible. After the extended sleepperiod, the athletes were faster and more accurate shooters. The average sprinttime decreased by one second, free-throw shooting improved by about 10 percent,and three-point shooting increased by more than 10 percent. The extra sleepoffered another performance bonus: The test athletes reported having moreenergy.ACTION STEPTo help you fall asleep faster, avoid exercising or playing sports close tobedtime.A follow-up study involving students on Stanford’s men’s and women’s swim teamsshowed similar improvements. They swam faster, reacted quicker off the blocks,improved turn time, and increased kick strokes after a two-week period ofextended sleep.Sleep may offer other benefits to athletes at every level—from the NBA’s MVP tothe weekend golfer to the company softball player. Research from Harvard MedicalSchool suggests that after initial training—whether it is learning how toexecute your NBA team’s offensive plays, how to hit a chip shot, or how to swinga bat—the brain continues to learn while you sleep. This indicates that sleepingcan make you a better athlete.LACK OF SLEEP WORSENS YOUR MOODIn a 2007 survey from the Better Sleep Council, 44 percent of workers admittedthat when they are sleep deprived, they are more likely to be in an unpleasantor unfriendly mood. In general, people who are tired due to lack of sleep tendto feel irritable and don’t have the energy to do much of anything. Curling upon the couch to watch TV or thumbing through a magazine might be all the energyyou can muster after a sleepless night. Studies show that decreased motivationdue to poor sleep makes you more likely to skip family events, work functions,and other recreational activities. Social connections help keep the brain young,so missing out on get-togethers and events due to fatigue can dampen your moodand prematurely age your brain. This can be especially troublesome for seniorsbecause a lack of social connections and bonding can speed up the brain’s agingprocess.ACTION STEPMake sleep a priority in your life rather than an afterthought.Plus, when you are sleep deprived, you are less inclined to exercise or getintimate with your significant other, which deprives your brain and body offeel-good chemicals that boost your mood. If you want to improve your mood,improve your sleeping habits.SLEEP DEPRIVATION IS HAZARDOUS TO YOUR HEALTHSkimping on sleep can affect your health in more ways than you might imagine. Itcan even stunt growth in young people. Growth hormones produced in the brain aretypically generated as we sleep. If youngsters don’t get enough sleep, they maynot produce enough of the hormones to fuel growth. Chronic sleep loss is alsoassociated with a number of poor lifestyle choices as well as brain-relatedconditions and disorders that put your physical and mental health at risk.Bad lifestyle habits When you don’t get enough sleep, you are inclined to gulpmore caffeine, smoke more, exercise less, and drink more alcohol. Studies showthat sleep-deprived adolescents are also more likely to drink alcohol, smokemarijuana, and use other drugs than those who get enough sleep.Type 2 diabetes Sleep deprivation can put you at risk for this seriouscondition. In a sleep study with healthy volunteers, those who got only 5.5hours of bedtime experienced insulin resistance and impaired glucosetolerance—two precursors of diabetes—after just two weeks.Depression Sleep deprivation has been linked to mood problems and depression ina number of scientific studies. One study published in the journal Sleep foundthat sleep problems are an early sign of depression and that treatment of sleepissues may protect individuals from developing the disorder. Similarly,researchers at the University of Rome who studied children between the ages ofseven and eleven suffering from depression found that 82 percent of themreported having problems sleeping. Another study shows that insomnia inadolescents is a significant risk factor for depression later in life. Among theelderly, sleep deprivation may prolong bouts of depression.Anxiety Research indicates that chronic sleep problems make you more vulnerableto the development of anxiety disorders.ADD Sleep disturbances are very common in children and adults with ADD. Manyhave a harder time falling asleep, spend less time in the restorative rapid eyemovement (REM) stage of sleep, and sleep fewer hours overall than people whodon’t have the disorder. Restless nights tend to worsen ADD symptoms.Alzheimer’s disease Research has found that people with sleep apnea may be morelikely to develop Alzheimer’s disease and that sleep apnea may worsen cognitiveimpairment in people with dementia. Treating sleep apnea has been shown toimprove cognitive function in people with this disease.ACTION STEPGet treated for sleep apnea immediately.Parkinson’s disease People who thrash around while sleeping—a condition calledREM sleep behavior disorder—may face a higher risk of developing Parkinson’sdisease, according to a study in the journal Neurology.Stroke Sleep apnea significantly increases the risk of stroke.Psychosis People can become psychotic from lack of sleep. I noticed this when Iwas chief of Community Mental Health at Fort Irwin in the Mojave Desert. FortIrwin houses the National Training Center that teaches desert warfare tosoldiers. The troops used to spend days at a time in war games without muchsleep. As a result, after being awake for three days in a row, a number ofsoldiers began to hear voices and become paranoid.Some time ago, my uncle started having problems with his memory—he couldn’tremember where he parked the car and was forgetting people’s names. The wholefamily was really concerned, so he went to the doctor and came back with adiagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. He was devastated. His brain SPECT scan showedsevere decreased activity in the back half of his brain, a finding consistentwith severe memory problems, but also consistent with what we have seen withsevere sleep apnea. On testing, he was diagnosed with severe sleep apnea.Treatment helped his cognitive abilities improve significantly. This story showshow critical it is to get treated for sleep problems. But most people sufferingfrom lack of sleep neglect to seek help. They don’t view it as a medical problemand choose to simply live with it. That could be a life-threatening mistake.DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCES OF SLEEP DEPRIVATIONSleep deprivation slows reaction times, clouds judgment, affects vision, impairsinformation processing, and increases aggressive behavior. All of this adds upto danger on America’s highways. According to the National Highway TrafficSafety Administration (NHTSA), drowsiness and fatigue cause more than 100,000traffic accidents each year, causing 40,000 injuries and 1,550 deaths. TheNational Sleep Foundation estimates the numbers are much higher: 71,000 injuriesand more than 5,500 deaths a year. One reason why the NHTSA’s statistics may below is that fatigue is often underreported as a contributing factor to a crash.In more than half of the reported fatigue-related crashes, young drivers are atthe wheel.Image 10.1 Sleep Apnea Scan[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_035_r1.jpg]Decreased parietal lobe and temporal lobe activityEvery day, millions of people hit the road while feeling drowsy. More than halfof the respondents in the 2009 Sleep in America Poll reported having drivenwhile drowsy in the past year, and 28 percent admitted to nodding off or fallingasleep behind the wheel. Night-shift workers, people with untreated sleep apnea,and young people—particularly men—between the ages of sixteen and twenty-nineare especially likely to drive while feeling sleepy. Fatigue has also played arole in many airplane, train, and boating crashes, some of them deadly.WHAT CAUSES SLEEP DEPRIVATION?In our hectic, 24–7 society, I could just as easily ask “What doesn’t causesleep deprivation?” There are a seemingly endless number of reasons why millionsof us are missing out on a good night’s sleep. Here is a list of just a few ofthe many things that may cause sleep troubles.ACTION STEPTake stock of the things in your life that might be causing you to toss and turnat night. * Medications: many medications, including asthma medications, antihistamines, cough medicines, and anticonvulsants, disturb sleep. * Caffeine: too much caffeine from coffee, tea, chocolate, or some herbal preparations—especially when consumed later in the day or at night—can disrupt sleep. * Alcohol, nicotine, and marijuana: although these compounds initially induce sleepiness for some people, they have the reverse effect as they wear off, which is why you may wake up several hours after you go to sleep. * Restless legs syndrome: A nighttime jerking or pedaling motion of the legs that drives a person’s bed partner crazy (as well as the person who has it). * Women’s issues: pregnancy, PMS, menopause, and perimenopause cause fluctuations in hormone levels that can disrupt the sleep cycle. * Thyroid conditions * Congestive heart failure * Chronic pain conditions * Untreated or undertreated psychiatric conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, or anxiety * Alzheimer’s disease: dementia patients “sundown” or rev up at night and wander. * Chronic gastrointestinal problems, such as reflux * Men’s issues: benign prostatic hypertrophy causes many trips to the bathroom at night, which interrupts slumber. * Snoring: snoring can wake you or your sleepmate, or everyone in the house if it is really loud. * Sleep apnea: with this condition, you stop breathing for short periods of time throughout the night, which robs you of restful sleep and leaves you feeling sluggish, inattentive, and forgetful throughout the day. * Shift work: nurses, firefighters, security personnel, customer service representatives, truck drivers, airline pilots, and many others toil by night and sleep by day. Or, at least, they try to sleep. Shift workers are especially vulnerable to irregular sleep patterns, which leads to excessive sleepiness, reduced productivity, irritability, and mood problems. * Stressful events: the death of a loved one, divorce, a major deadline at work, or an upcoming test can cause temporary sleep loss. * Jet lag: international travel across time zones wreaks havoc with sleep cycles.WHO’S AT RISK FOR POOR SLEEP?Nobody is immune to sleep problems—they can affect anyone at any time of life. Astudy presented at the American Psychiatric Association’s annual meeting in 2007analyzed the sleep habits of more than 79,000 adults and revealed that aboutone-third of moms aren’t getting adequate sleep. As a child psychiatrist, I workwith a lot of troubled kids, and I notice that their moms are usually drainedand exhausted. They work so hard to help their children succeed that they tendto neglect their own needs. I think moms need to do a better job of taking careof themselves, and that starts with getting a good night’s sleep.Dads have their own problems getting enough shut-eye. According to the samestudy mentioned earlier, about 27 percent of married dads and more than 30percent of unmarried dads reported getting insufficient sleep.Sleep deprivation is rampant among teens. Researchers have found that when kidshit their teen years, their sleep cycles change, making them more inclined to goto sleep later and wake up later. That makes it especially tough for teens to beup and alert for those early 7 a.m. start times at some schools. A study from1997 found that when a high school switched from a 7:15 a.m. start time to an8:40 a.m. start time, students reported getting more sleep and feeling lesstired during the day. They also got higher grades and were less likely to havefeelings of depression. A 2009 study found that later school start timesincreased the number of hours teens slept during the week and decreased thenumber of car accidents involving teen drivers in the area by 16.5 percent.College students are also plagued by sleep troubles. According to a studypublished in the Journal of American College Health, 33 percent of collegestudents reported taking longer than thirty minutes to fall asleep, and 43percent woke up more than once a night. Since college students usually have morecontrol over their schedules, encourage them to schedule more afternoon classesrather than early-morning classes.Sleep disturbances are also common on the other end of the age spectrum. Thenotion that older people don’t need as much sleep is a common misconception.Studies show that seniors need the same seven to eight hours a night as otheradults. As part of the normal aging process, however, Grandma and Grandpa arelikely to experience more unsettled sleep. As you get older, sleep patterns tendto change, and you typically find it harder to fall asleep and stay asleep. Thiscan speed up the brain’s aging process at a time when you really want to hang onto every brain cell you have.TIPS TO HELP YOU GO TO SLEEP AND STAY ASLEEPHere are twelve ways to make it easier to drift off to dreamland and get a goodnight’s sleep. Remember that we are all unique individuals, and what works forone person may not work for another. Keep trying new techniques until you findsomething that works. 1. Maintain a regular sleep schedule—going to bed at the same time each night and waking up at the same time each day, including on weekends. Get up at the same time each day regardless of sleep duration the previous night. 2. Create a soothing nighttime routine that encourages sleep. A warm bath, meditation, or massage can help you relax. 3. Some people like to read themselves to sleep. If you are reading, make sure it isn’t an action-packed thriller or a horror story—they aren’t likely to help you drift off to sleep. 4. Don’t take naps! This is one of the biggest mistakes you can make if you have insomnia. Taking naps when you feel sleepy during the day compounds the nighttime sleep cycle disruption. 5. Sound therapy can induce a very peaceful mood and lull you to sleep. Consider soothing nature sounds, soft music, wind chimes, or even a fan. 6. Drink a mixture of warm milk, a teaspoon of vanilla (the real stuff, not imitation), and a few drops of stevia. This increases serotonin in your brain and helps you sleep. 7. Take computers, video games, and cell phones out of the bedroom and turn them off an hour or two before bedtime to allow time to “unwind.” 8. Don’t eat for at least two to three hours before going to bed. 9. Regular exercise is very beneficial for falling asleep and staying asleep, but don’t do it within four hours of the time you hit the sack. Vigorous exercise late in the evening may energize you and keep you awake. 10. Don’t drink any caffeinated beverages in the late afternoon or evening. Also avoid chocolate, nicotine, and alcohol—especially at night. Although alcohol can initially make you feel sleepy, it interrupts sleep. 11. If you wake up in the middle of the night, refrain from looking at the clock. Checking the time can make you feel anxious, which aggravates the problem. 12. Use the bed and bedroom only for sleep or sexual activity. Sexual activity releases many natural hormones, releases muscle tension, and boosts a sense of well-being. Adults with healthy sex lives tend to sleep better. When you are unable to fall asleep or return to sleep easily, get up and go to another room.NATURAL TREATMENTS TO HELP YOU SLEEP BETTERBecause of our sleep problems, doctors are prescribing sleep medications thatcan affect your moods and memory at alarming rates. These medications are alsoincreasingly prescribed for children of all ages. A study that appeared in a2007 issue of Sleep showed that 81 percent of children who saw a medicalprofessional for sleep-related problems were given a prescription. In mypractice, my primary course of action isn’t doling out a prescription. I firstencourage my patients to eliminate anything that might interfere with sleep,such as caffeine, alcohol, or reading Stephen King before bedtime. I also trynatural supplements and treatments. Here are some of the natural remedies Irecommend.ACTION STEPBefore you reach for the sleeping pills, try hypnosis. It has been proven towork and has no side effects.ACTION STEPIf you have trouble sleeping, keep a sleep journal and track what time you go tosleep, how long it takes to fall asleep, how often you wake up, what time youget up in the morning, how you feel upon waking, how much energy you havethroughout the day, and any daytime naps. Make a copy of the following sleepjournal entry and fill it in daily.MY SLEEP JOURNALDay/Date ______________(Answer the following questions in the morning.)Last night, my bedtime ritual included: __________________(List things like a warm bath, meditation, reading, etc.)Last night I went to bed at: _________ pm/amLast night I fell asleep in: _________ minutesLast night, I woke up: _________ timesDuring those times, I was awake for: _________ minutesLast night, I got out of bed: _________ timesThings that disturbed my sleep: ___________________(List any physical, mental, emotional, or environmental factors that affectedyour sleep.)I slept for a total of: _________ minutesI got out of bed this morning at: _________ am/pmUpon waking, I felt: _________ refreshed _________ groggy _________ exhausted(Answer the following questions at night.)During the day, I fell asleep or napped: _________ timesDuring my naps, I slept for: _________ minutesDuring the day, I felt: ____refreshed _____groggy _____exhaustedMy caffeine consumption: _________ amount _________ time of dayMedications or sleep aids I took: ___________________HYPNOSISAs a medical student, I saw someone get hypnotized, and I found the process sofascinating that I took a whole month’s training on it. As an intern at WalterReed Army Medical Center, a military hospital with 1,200 beds, I worked withmany patients who were having trouble sleeping and wanted sleeping pills. It iseasy to understand how people might have a tough time getting a decent night’ssleep in such a huge, noisy hospital. On the nights I was on call, I would askthe patients if I could try hypnotizing them rather than give a sleeping pill.Almost everybody said yes, and it worked. I prescribed considerably fewersleeping pills than my colleagues.Hypnosis is a very powerful technique. I worked with one veteran who was a WorldWar II hero. He had helped smuggle Jewish people out of Germany to safety. Inhis later years, he developed Parkinson’s disease and found it difficult tosleep at night. The night I was on call he wanted a sleeping pill. I asked himif I could try to hypnotize him instead. He agreed and when I put him in atrance, his tremor stopped. Parkinsonian tremors usually stop when a personfalls asleep, but his tremor stopped before he actually went to sleep.When I told my attending neurologist, Bahman Jabbari, about it the next morninghe rolled his eyes and looked at me as if I were the dumbest person on theplanet. Later, I repeated the exercise in front of him and it worked. He was soamazed that we filmed our patient going into a hypnotic trance and coauthored apaper on it. That became one of my first professional papers.Hypnosis can even help people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) getbetter sleep. People with PTSD often have trouble sleeping. In a study fromIsrael, one group of fifteen patients was given a daily prescription sleepingpill while the second group of seventeen patients underwent hypnotherapy twice aweek. After two weeks, the hypnosis group showed improvement in sleep quality.The improvements were still evident a full month later, too, showing thathypnosis has lasting benefits.At one point during my internship, I was having trouble sleeping myself. Many ofmy patients were dealing with very serious medical conditions and some evendied. Coping with that level of responsibility was hard for me. I care verydeeply about what happens to my patients, and it was making me anxious andkeeping me up at night. That’s when I started doing self-hypnosis to help mesleep. I figured if it works for my patients, it should work for me too. Withtime, I became so proficient at it that I could put myself to sleep in under oneminute. To help others, I created a hypnosis CD specifically for sleep disordersthat can be ordered through the Amen Clinics website (www.amenclinics.com[http://www.amenclinics.com]).BRIGHT LIGHT THERAPYBright light therapy is a technique that promotes better sleep in people whosuffer from seasonal affective disorder (SAD), more commonly known as winterblues. We see many people with this condition in our clinic in Tacoma,Washington. It is also very common in Alaska and Canada, where some regions getonly a few hours of daily sunlight during the winter, and the lack of light cancause sleep disturbances. Bright light therapy, in which a person sits in frontof a strong light that has the same wavelengths as the sun for thirty minutes,can reset sleep patterns. In my experience, I have found that bright lighttherapy works best in the morning.NATURAL SUPPLEMENTS FOR MORE RESTFUL SLEEPWhen sleep deprivation isn’t relieved by other methods, I prescribe naturalsupplements, such as L-tryptophan, 5-HTP, valerian, kava kava, magnesium, andmelatonin. Some of these natural interventions may also be helpful duringperiods of temporary insomnia due to stress, jet lag, trying to sleep in a newenvironment, or doing shift work. See Appendix C, “The Supplement Solution,” formore information.THE SLEEP SOLUTIONSleep Robbers Sleep Enhancers Any brain problems Brain health Brain trauma Focuson brain protection Low blood sugar Frequent small meals with at least someprotein to maintain healthy blood sugar Caffeine No caffeine Poor diet Enricheddiet Alcohol, drug abuse Freedom from alcohol and drugs ADD Effective treatmentfor ADD Some forms of depression Journaling when sad or anxious, treatmentAnxiety Meditation or self-hypnosis for relaxation Negative thinking Killing theANTs (automatic negative thoughts) Alzheimer’s disease Sleep aids, especiallymelatonin Sleep apnea Treatment for sleep apnea Hormonal fluctuations Balancedhormones Thyroid conditions Treatment for thyroid conditions Chronic painExercise Chronic stress Stress-reduction plan Too much TV, video games,computers Technology turned off a few hours before bedtime Soothing soundsBright light therapy Supplements such as melatonin, L-tryptophan, 5-HTP,valerian, kava kava, and magnesium"},{"pageContent":"11THE STRESS SOLUTIONRELAX YOUR BRAIN TO REDUCE YOUR WRINKLES AND IMPROVE YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEMStress is nothing more than a socially acceptable form of mental illness.—RICHARD CARLSON, PH.D.Maria was in her forties when she came to our offices for help. She was unhappybecause her belly had gotten fat, and she had been struggling for years to losethe weight. She was also under constant stress. Her mother had suffered a strokeseveral years earlier, and Maria had taken on the role of caretaker. On top ofthat, her son had started acting out. Maria was spending so much time caring forthe others in her family that she had been neglecting her own health andwell-being for too long. I told her something that I tell many of my patients,“You need to put on your own oxygen mask first before you help others.” What Imean by this is you need to look out for yourself first so you can be healthyenough take care of the people you love. Thanks to some stress-managementtechniques and a renewed focus on her own needs, Maria lost the abdominal fatand fared much better in taking care of her mother and son.Stress is a normal part of everyday life. Bad traffic, a big deadline at work, afight with your spouse—there are hundreds of things that can make us feelstressed out. When the event passes, so does the stress, and we can breathe abig sigh of relief. With chronic stress, however, there is no relief. Stemmingfrom family discord, financial hardships, health issues, work conflicts, orschool trouble, chronic stress can be unrelenting. And it affects far too manyof us. In a recent poll by the American Psychological Association, a whopping 80percent of Americans said the weakened economy is causing them significantstress. That spells trouble for your brain and body.THE BRAIN-BODY RESPONSEDon’t get me wrong. A little stress can be a good thing. When stress hits, thebrain tells your body to start pumping out adrenaline (epinephrine) andcortisol, two hormones released by the adrenal glands (located above thekidneys). Within seconds, your heart starts to pound faster, your breathingquickens, your blood courses faster through your veins, and your mind feels likeit is on heightened alert. You are ready for anything—running away from awould-be mugger, giving a speech in front of a roomful of peers, or taking anexam.These stress hormones are the primary chemicals of the fight-or-flight responseand are especially useful when you face an immediate threat, such as arattlesnake in your front yard (which happened to me once). What’s amazing isthat the human brain is so advanced that merely imagining a stressful event willcause the body to react to the perceived threat as if it were actuallyhappening. You can literally scare your body into a stress response. The brainis a very powerful organ.Brief surges of stress hormones are normal and beneficial. They motivate you todo a good job at work, study before a test, or pay your bills on time. Theproblem with stress in our modern world is not these short bursts of adrenalineand cortisol. The problem is that for many of us, the stress reactions neverstop—traffic, bills, work, school, family conflict, not enough sleep, healthissues, and jam-packed schedules keep us in a constant state of stress. Takenote that it isn’t just the bad stuff in life that makes us stressed. Even happyevents, such as having a baby or getting a promotion, can be major stressors.Take a look at the following lists of just some of the many events andsituations that can cause stress.NEGATIVE EVENTS THAT CAUSE STRESS * Death of a loved one * Getting laid off * Getting divorced * Unwanted pregnancy * Miscarriage * Financial problems * Being involved in a lawsuit * Having health problems * Having a sick relative * Caring for an ailing family member * Having a mental disorder or living with someone who has one * Problems at work * Problems at schoolPOSITIVE EVENTS THAT CAUSE STRESS * Getting married * Having a baby * Starting a new job * Getting a promotion * Moving to a new home * Transferring to a new school * Going to college * Having a bestselling bookHOW CHRONIC STRESS HARMS THE BRAINChronic stress constricts blood flow to the brain, which lowers overall brainfunction and prematurely ages your brain. A series of studies published in thejournal Psychoneuroendocrinology looked at long-term exposure to stresshormones, especially cortisol, and its effect on brain function in people ofvarying age groups. The research showed that older adults with continuously highlevels of cortisol performed worse on memory tests than older adults withmoderate to low cortisol levels. The older adults with high cortisol levels alsohad a 14 percent smaller hippocampus, the area of the temporal lobes involvedwith memory. The hippocampus is part of the stress response system and isresponsible for sending out signals to halt the production of cortisol once athreat has vanished. But when the number of brain cells in the hippocampus isdepleted, it no longer sends out this signal, which results in the release ofeven greater amounts of cortisol.Researchers found that short, temporary spikes in cortisol had anegative—although temporary—effect on young adults’ thinking and memory skills.In young children and teenagers, the research showed that kids with lowersocioeconomic status had higher average stress hormone levels than the otherchildren. As a group, these studies reveal that chronic stress impairs the brainfunction of people of all ages.Excessive amounts of cortisol affect other areas of the brain, too. Canadianresearchers used functional brain imaging studies to show that exposure tostress hormones is associated with decreased activity not only in thehippocampus, but also in the amygdala, part of the emotional brain and theprefrontal cortex. As a result, chronic stress has negative consequences forboth cognitive function and emotional balance.It gets even worse. An ongoing overload of cortisol reduces brain reserve, whichmakes you more vulnerable to the many physical effects of stress. When stresshurts your brain, it can also ravage your body.HOW CHRONIC STRESS MAKES YOU LOOK OLDERIf you have crow’s-feet, wrinkles, sagging jowls, or thinning skin, don’t blameit on your parents. New research shows that environmental factors—includingchronic stress—rather than genetics, may be at fault. In a fascinating studyinvolving identical twins, environmental factors were found to make people lookolder than they really are. For the study, which was published on the Plasticand Reconstructive Surgery journal’s website, a panel of plastic surgeonsexamined digital photos of 186 pairs of identical twins who had attended theTwins Festival in Twinsburg, Ohio, in 2006 and 2007. The physicians attempted todetermine the age of each individual based on their facial features. What theyfound is that individuals who had experienced stressful events tended to lookolder than their siblings who had led more stress-free lives. For example, twinswho were divorced looked almost two years older than their siblings who weremarried, single, or even widowed. One of the study’s authors cited the presenceof stress as one of the common denominators in the twins who looked older.ACTION STEPBefore you spend hundreds of dollars on wrinkle removers, consider that yourskin problems may be due to stress as opposed to the natural aging process.Other scientific evidence shows that chronic stress can mimic the effects ofaging to make you look and feel like you’ve aged beyond your years. According toa 2009 study of 647 women, the physical effects of chronic stress were found tobe similar to the effects of smoking, being obese, or being ten years older thantheir actual age. The study looked at the association between perceived stresslevels and the length of telomeres, the protective caps located on the ends ofchromosomes. The longer the caps are, the more protection they provide. Theshorter they are, the less protection provided.Telomeres naturally shorten over time as we age, eventually becoming so shortthat they trigger cell death. In this study, the women with higher levels ofperceived stress had shorter telomeres than women with low-level stress,indicating premature aging.You can see the effects of stress-induced aging by simply looking in the mirror.With natural aging, your skin begins to lose collagen and elastin, two proteinsthat provide support and elasticity for a more youthful appearance. Stresscauses collagen and elastin to break down prematurely, which leads to saggingskin and wrinkles. Unfortunately, wrinkles aren’t the only skin problem thatcomes with unrelenting stress. Since chronic stress toys with your hormones, itcan also lead to acne breakouts regardless of your age.HOW CHRONIC STRESS MAKES YOU SICKYour body responds to the way you think, feel, and act. Because of thisbrain-body connection, whenever you feel stressed, your body tries to tell youwhen something isn’t right. For example, high blood pressure or a stomach ulcermight develop after a particularly stressful event, such as the death of a lovedone. Chronic stress weakens your body’s immune system, making you more likely toget colds, flu bugs, and other infections during emotionally difficult times. Ithas also been implicated in heart disease, hypertension, and even cancer. Infact, too much stress can actually kill you.In a 2004 issue of Psychological Bulletin, a team of psychologists publishedfindings from a thorough review of nearly three hundred scientific studieslinking chronic stress and the immune system. According to their analysis, thestudies, which dated from 1960 to 2001 and involved 18,941 test subjects, showincontrovertible evidence that stress causes changes in the immune system. Whatthey found is that short-term stress temporarily boosts immunity, but chronicstress weakens the immune system, making people more vulnerable to commonailments and serious diseases. In particular, the elderly and people who arealready suffering from an illness are more susceptible to changes in the immunesystem due to chronic stress.A recent study in the Journal of Immunotoxicology reported that it isn’t justthe stress you are feeling today that harms your ability to fight off disease.It indicates that exposure to chronic stress early in life makes you even morevulnerable to a depressed immune system throughout your lifetime.Also, when you are feeling stressed, you may not take care of your health aswell as you should. You may not feel like exercising, eating nutritious foods,or taking medicine that your doctor prescribes. Abuse of alcohol, tobacco, orother drugs may also be a sign of chronic stress. These behaviors stand in theway of your goal to get a body you love.HOW STRESS STRETCHES YOUR MIDSECTIONYour boss is handing out pink slips. You just had a fight with your teenagedaughter. You are late for an appointment. How do you react? You may try to calmyour nerves with chocolate, ice cream, French fries, or potato chips (or all ofthe above). And there’s a scientific reason why. Stress and the stress hormonecortisol are linked to increases in appetite and cravings for carbs and sweetstuff that can make you fat.Two studies that appeared in Physiology & Behavior investigated the effect ofstress on the foods people choose to eat and the amount of food they consume.The results were just what you might expect. The first experiment found thatstress causes people to turn away from healthy low-fat foods, such as grapes, infavor of high-fat fare like M&Ms. In the second experiment, researchers lookedat changes in food consumption among men and women. They found that people on adiet—especially women—were the most likely to eat more when they were stressedout.Animal studies show us that chronic stress is a recipe for dangerous weightgain. One study out of Georgia State University showed that when hamsters facedrepeated stress over a thirty-three-day period, they overate, gained weight, andin particular, gained a significant amount of abdominal fat, also known asvisceral fat. This type of fat, which gives people an apple shape rather than apear shape, is the worst kind of fat because it surrounds vital organs and isassociated with a number of serious diseases, such as cardiovascular disease anddiabetes.ACTION STEPIf you are having trouble losing weight, consider stress as a factor. Inaddition to eating a nutritious diet and exercising, learn somestress-management skills.Another study, conducted by re searchers at Georgetown University MedicalCenter, found that chronic stress combined with a high-fat, high-sugar dietleads to abdominal obesity in mice due to a neurotransmitter called neuropeptideY (NPY). The brain releases NPY directly into the fatty tissue in the abdomen.The researchers exposed the mice to cold water or aggression to create astressful environment. The chronic stress stimulated the release of NPY in theabdominal fat and increased its growth by 50 percent in just two weeks. Afterthree months, an expanding belly wasn’t the only physical change the miceexperienced. They also displayed symptoms typically associated with metabolicsyndrome, including high blood pressure, inflammation, high cholesterol, glucoseintolerance, and more. What this study shows us is that chronic stress packs oneven more abdominal fat than you might experience from a high-fat, high-sugardiet alone—and it does it faster.Adolescents and teens are also vulnerable to weight gain from stress. A study inthe Journal of Adolescent Health that looked at data from 1,011 adolescents andtheir mothers found that the more stressors in their lives, the more likely theywere to have weight troubles.Living with stress on a daily basis makes you more likely to have issues withyour weight for a number of other reasons. For example, chronic stress usuallygoes hand-in-hand with a lack of sleep, something that pumps up cortisolproduction and throws your appetite-control hormones out of balance. This leadsto overeating, cravings for sugary treats, and a greater tendency to store fat.The fact that chronic stress can make you feel tired and achy means you are lessinclined to exercise, which can make the numbers on the scale start to rise.Stressful situations also make many of us reach for comfort foods as a way tosoothe our emotions. All of these things make it harder to beat the battle ofthe bulge.IS STRESS MAKING YOU INFERTILE?As mentioned, I have been interested in medical hypnosis since medical school.When I was a psychiatric intern, I hypnotized many of my patients and staff whorequested help. My favorite story from that year was when I helped a nurse getpregnant. As my reputation for using medical hypnosis grew, a very pretty nursecame to me and asked if I could help her get pregnant. That was an interestingrequest, I thought to myself. She told me that she and her husband had beentrying to get pregnant for four years, and it wasn’t happening. Every time theyhad sex, she would start to cry and get really upset at the thought of not beingpregnant. She figured that her stress was interfering with conception.ACTION STEPIf you are having trouble conceiving, make stress reduction your first stepbefore seeking pricey fertility treatments.I explained to her that her fallopian tubes (the tubes between her ovaries anduterus) were wrapped in smooth muscle and that stress hormones were probablyclamping shut the tubes, making it much harder for her to get pregnant. I puther in a hypnotic trance with deep relaxation suggestions focused on her lowerabdomen and also made a hypnosis tape for her to listen to after she made lovewith her husband. Three months later she was pregnant.It was such a joyful experience to see that healing the brain-body connectioncould be so helpful to this couple. The one mistake I made was telling my wifethat I helped a really pretty nurse at work get pregnant. Just kidding.It is clear that too much stress affects the way your body functions, includingits ability to reproduce. Scientific evidence shows that chronic stress causeshormonal changes that disrupt reproductive function.The same way that stress prematurely ages your body and skin, it also speeds upthe aging process of your reproductive system. For women, it is harder toconceive as age advances, whether the aging is natural or stress induced. Womenaren’t the only ones who suffer from infertility due to stress. Researchers inIndia have found that emotional stress damages sperm cells. In addition tocausing problems for natural conception, elevated stress levels also impact thesuccess of fertility treatments, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF).A 2005 study published in Human Reproduction investigated the effects ofstressful life events on IVF treatment. The researchers asked 809 women tocomplete a questionnaire about stressful and negative life events during thetwelve months prior to undergoing fertility treatment. Women who became pregnantfollowing treatment reported fewer stressful events than women who didn’tconceive. The researchers concluded that stress may reduce the chances of asuccessful outcome following IVF treatment.There’s a commentary I love in the same journal from a psychologist on thefaculty at UNED University in Madrid, Spain. He is convinced that stress is toblame for many cases of infertility and suggests that stress reduction should bethe first course of treatment for infertility rather than expensive and invasivetreatments, such as IVF. It makes sense to me—stress reduction poses no sideeffects and doesn’t involve any of the ethical or religious quandaries that comewith some fertility treatments.HOW STRESS PLAYS TRICKS WITH YOUR MENTAL HEALTHChronic stress drains your emotional well-being and is associated with anxiety,depression, and Alzheimer’s disease, all of which can affect your body. Stressactivates the limbic system of the brain, which is your emotional center. If youexperience some form of emotional trauma—say, you are involved in a car accidentor you are raped—your emotional system becomes very active, which can make youmore upset and depressed. After experiencing a trauma, some people developpost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which means the stress never goes away.On July 16, 2003, thirty-three-year-old Steven was working in a bike shop inSanta Monica, California. The bicycle repair mechanic decided to visit the localfarmers’ market for lunch. As Steven arrived at the market,eighty-seven-year-old George Russell Weller lost control of his 1992 BuickLeSabre and plowed through the open-air market. Hearing the screams andcommotion, Steven looked up and saw Weller’s car heading straight for him.Steven thought he was going to be hit, but at the last moment, he managed tojump out of the way of the oncoming car.Steven was one of the lucky ones that day—ten people were killed, and more thanfifty were injured. A former Gulf War veteran, he used the medical skills he hadlearned in the military to help save the wounded around him. In spite of hisefforts, one woman died in his arms. Traumatized, Steven headed back to work.For months after the horrific accident, he couldn’t sleep and he couldn’t stopshaking.To help Steven, we used a treatment technique called eye movementdesensitization and reprocessing (EMDR). This technique involves patientsbringing up emotionally troubling memories while their eyes follow a trainedtherapist’s hands moving horizontally back and forth. Following a specificprotocol, the clinician helps the patient minimize negative thoughts andreactions about the traumatic event. After just one treatment, Steven startedshowing improvement, and after only eight hours of treatment, his shakingsubsided and he felt significantly better.The concept of EMDR sounds simple, but it is not a do-it-yourself therapy. It isimportant that EMDR be performed by a trained therapist. You can contact theEMDR International Association at www.emdria.org [http://www.emdria.org] formore information and a list of certified EMDR therapists.A 2008 study from the Rand Corporation reported that one in five soldiersreturning from Iraq and Afghanistan have symptoms of post-traumatic stressdisorder or major depression. As more of our soldiers begin returning from Iraq,we can expect many of them to suffer with this chronic stress disorder.COMMON SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF STRESS * Frequent headaches or migraines * Gritting or grinding teeth * Stuttering or stammering * Tremors or trembling lips or hands * Neck ache, back pain, or muscle spasms * Light-headedness, faintness, dizziness * Hearing ringing, buzzing, or popping sounds * Frequent blushing or sweating * Cold or sweaty hands or feet * Dry mouth or problems swallowing * Frequent colds, infections, or herpes sores * Rashes, itching, hives, goose bumps * Unexplained or frequent allergy attacks * Heartburn * Stomach pain or nausea * Constipation or diarrhea * Difficulty breathing or sighing * Sudden panic attacks * Chest pain or heart palpitations * Frequent urination * Poor sexual desire or performance * Excessive anxiety, worry, guilt, or nervousness * Increased anger, frustration, or hostility * Depression, frequent or wild mood swings * Increased or decreased appetite * Insomnia, nightmares, or disturbing dreams * Difficulty concentrating, racing thoughts * Trouble learning new information * Forgetfulness, disorganization, or confusion * Difficulty in making decisions * Feeling overwhelmed * Frequent crying spells or suicidal thoughts * Feelings of loneliness and worthlessness * Little interest in appearance or punctuality * Nervous habits, fidgeting, or feet tapping * Increased irritability or edginess * Overreaction to petty annoyances * Increased number of minor accidents * Obsessive or compulsive behavior * Reduced work efficiency or productivity * Lies or excuses to cover up poor work * Rapid or mumbled speech * Excessive defensiveness or suspiciousness * Problems in communication or sharing * Social withdrawal or isolation * Constant fatigue or weakness * Frequent use of over-the-counter drugs * Weight gain or loss without diet * Increased smoking * Increased alcohol or drug use * Excessive gambling or impulse buyingSource: The American Institute of StressWHO’S VULNERABLE TO STRESS?Unfortunately, everyone is vulnerable to the effects of chronic stress. It canattack you at any stage of your life. When chronic stress hits you or someone inyour circle, everybody suffers. You’ve heard of the trickle-down economictheory; there’s also a trickle-down stress theory. When the boss is stressedout, everybody at work is stressed out. When your spouse is stressed out,everybody in the family is stressed out.It happened in my own family when I was growing up. My father owned a chain ofgrocery stores with a colleague. When I was fourteen years old, he decided tosell the stores to a much larger grocery group, Arden-Mayfair. Going to work forsomeone else was a big mistake for my dad. He is a very independent person. Hehated it and was under a lot of stress. He was miserable and not a lot of fun tobe around. Stress often runs downhill.CALMING THE STRESS IN YOUR LIFE SO YOU CAN HAVE A BETTER BODYIn my practice, I deal with so many patients who suffer severe stress. Most ofthe time, it is because no one has ever taught them stress-management skills.When I show them that there are better ways to deal with stress, they do a muchbetter job at it. Here are sixteen different ways to help you calm stress so youcan have better skin, better immunity, and a trimmer figure. Pick four or fiveways that you like the best.1. Meditate or pray on a regular basis. Decades of research have shown thatmeditation and prayer calm stress and enhance brain function. At the AmenClinics, we performed a SPECT study on a Kundalini Yoga form of meditationcalled Kirtan Kriya in which we scanned eleven people on one day when theydidn’t meditate and then the next day during a meditation session. For themeditation, the participants recited the following simple sounds known as thefive primal sounds: “sa,” “ta,” “na,” “ma,” with “aa,” the end of each sound,considered to be the fifth sound. The meditation involved touching the thumb ofeach hand to the index finger while chanting “sa,” the middle finger whilechanting “ta,” the ring finger while chanting “na,” and the pinkie finger whilechanting “ma.” The sounds and fingering were repeated for two minutes out loud,two minutes whispering, four minutes silently, two minutes whispering, and twominutes out loud.Figure 11.1[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_036_r1.jpg]Kirtan Kriya Fingertip MovementsThe brain imaging scans taken after the meditation showed marked decreases inactivity in the left parietal lobes, which showed a decreasing awareness of timeand space. They also showed significant increases in activity in the prefrontalcortex, which showed that meditation helped to tune people in, not out. We alsoobserved increased activity in the right temporal lobe, an area that has beenassociated with spirituality.My friend Andy Newberg at the University of Pennsylvania also used brain SPECTimaging to study the neurobiology of meditation, in part because it is aspiritual state easily duplicated in the laboratory. They scanned nine Buddhistmonks before and during prolonged meditation. The scan revealed distinctivechanges in brain activity as the mind went into a meditative state.Specifically, activity decreased in the parts of the brain involved ingenerating a sense of three-dimensional orientation in space. Losing one’s senseof physical place could account for the spiritual feeling of transcendence,being beyond space and time. They also found increased activity in theprefrontal cortex, associated with attention span and thoughtfulness. Meditationseemed to tune people in, not out. Another functional brain imaging study oftranscendental meditation (TM) showed calming in the anterior cingulate andbasal ganglia, diminishing anxiety and worries and fostering relaxation.The benefits of meditation go far beyond stress relief. Studies have shown thatit also improves attention and planning, reduces depression and anxiety,decreases sleepiness, and protects the brain from cognitive decline associatedwith normal aging. In a study from researchers at UCLA, the hippocampus andfrontal cortex were found to be significantly larger in people who meditateregularly. Meditation has also been found to aid in weight loss, reduce muscletension, and tighten the skin.Many people think it takes years of practice to learn how to meditate. Itdoesn’t. A fascinating Chinese study from my friend neuroscientist Dr. YiyuanTang showed that people who received just twenty minutes of daily meditationtraining for five days showed a significant decrease in stress-related cortisol.You don’t need to devote big chunks of time to the practice of meditation,either. In my clinical practice, I often recommend meditation as an integralpart of a treatment plan. Many of my patients have reported back that they feelcalmer and less stressed after just a few minutes of daily meditation.If the whole concept of meditation seems a little too New Age for you, take notethat you can do it just about anywhere anytime. You don’t have to sitcross-legged on the floor or burn incense or any of those things you mightassociate with meditation. If you are at work, you can simply close the door toyour office, sit in your chair, close your eyes, and relax for a few moments. Athome, you can sit on the edge of your bed after you wake up and spend a coupleof minutes calming your mind. Try the following Relaxation Response for a simpleintroduction to meditation.THE RELAXATION RESPONSEOne of the simplest ways to meditate and reduce stress is a technique called theRelaxation Response, developed by Herbert Benson, M.D., at Harvard MedicalSchool. I encourage you to set aside ten to twenty minutes today to try it. Thefollowing is the technique outlined in Dr. Benson’s book The RelaxationResponse.DIRECTIONSSit quietly in a comfortable position.Close your eyes.Deeply relax all your muscles, beginning at your feet and progressing up to yourface. Keep them relaxed.Breathe through your nose. Become aware of your breathing. As you breathe out,say the word “one” (or some other relaxing word you choose) silently toyourself. For example, breathe in … out, “one,” in … out, “one,” etc.Continue for ten to twenty minutes. You may open your eyes to check the time,but do not use an alarm. When you finish, sit quietly for several minutes, atfirst with your eyes closed and later with your eyes opened. Do not stand up fora few minutes.Do not worry about whether you are successful in achieving a deep level ofrelaxation. Maintain a passive attitude and permit relaxation to occur at itsown pace. When distracting thoughts occur, try to ignore them by not dwellingupon them and return to repeating “one.” With practice, the response should comewith little effort. Practice the technique once or twice daily, but not withintwo hours after any meal, since the digestive processes seem to interfere withthe elicitation of the Relaxation Response.Prayer, too, offers many of the same health and stress-relief benefits asmeditation. Physicians Larry Dossey (Healing Words), Dale Matthews (The FaithFactor), and others have written books outlining the scientific evidence of themedical benefits of prayer and other meditative states. Some of these benefitsinclude reduced feelings of stress, lower cholesterol levels, improved sleep,reduced anxiety and depression, fewer headaches, more relaxed muscles, andlonger life spans. People who pray or read the Bible every day are 40 percentless likely to suffer from hypertension than others.A 1998 Duke University study of 577 men and women hospitalized for physicalillness showed that the more patients used positive spiritual coping strategies(seeking spiritual support from friends and religious leaders, having faith inGod, praying), the lower the level of their depressive symptoms and the highertheir quality of life. A 1996 survey of 269 family physicians found that 99percent believed prayer, meditation, or other spiritual and religious practicecan be helpful in medical treatment; more than half said they currentlyincorporate relaxation or meditation techniques into treatment of patients.2. Take a yoga class. Yoga is an ancient and venerated form of stress relief.Many yoga classes promote mental calmness, self-awareness, and a focus on beingin the present moment—all of which bring about a sense of relaxation andwell-being. Yoga has solid scientific evidence that it can be helpful forreducing high blood pressure, altitude sickness, anxiety, arthritis, asthma,carpal tunnel syndrome, depression, epilepsy, heart disease, lung diseases,substance abuse, and boosting your quality of life. Yoga has become so popularthat you can find classes geared to all ages and all ability levels.3. Learn to delegate. People often have jam-packed schedules that leave littleor no breathing room. Trying to race from one activity to the next while meetingwork, school, and family obligations can become overwhelming. In our modernsociety, it seems like being busy is a sort of badge of honor. Ask anyone whatthey have planned for the day, and it is likely they’ll respond by telling youhow incredibly busy they are. “I’m finishing a project for work, hosting adinner party, making the kids’ costumes for the school play, volunteering atchurch, and going to my book group.” Phew! It can make you stressed out justthinking about all that.News flash! You don’t have to accept every invitation, take on every project, orvolunteer for every activity that comes your way. Two of the greatest lifeskills you can learn are the art of delegation and the ability to say no. Toooften, just to please others, we agree to do things without first askingourselves if the request fits into our own lives. Many people say yes withoutfirst processing the request through their prefrontal cortex. When someone asksyou to do something, a good first response would be “Let me think about it.”Then you can take the time to process the request to see if it fits with yourschedule, desires, and goals. When you have too much on your plate, delegate.4. Practice gratitude. If you want your brain to work better, be grateful forthe good things in your life. Psychologist Noelle Nelson and I did a study ongratitude and appreciation. She was working on a book called The Power ofAppreciation and had her brain scanned twice. The first time she was scannedafter thirty minutes of meditating on all the things she was thankful for in herlife. After the “appreciation meditation,” her brain looked very healthy.Then she was scanned several days later after focusing on the major fears in herlife. One of her fears was about what would happen if her dog got sick and shecouldn’t work. She had a string of frightening thoughts: “If my dog got sick, Icouldn’t go to work because I would have to stay home to care for him. … If Ididn’t go to work, however, I would lose my job. … If I lost my job, I wouldn’thave enough money to take my dog to the vet and he would likely die. … If thedog died, I would be so depressed I still wouldn’t be able to go back to work. …Then I would lose my home, and be homeless.”I scanned her brain after she mulled on these thoughts. Her frightened brainlooked very different from her healthy gratitude brain and showed seriouslydecreased activity in two parts of her brain. Her cerebellum had completely shutdown. The cerebellum, also called the little brain, is involved in physicalcoordination, such as walking or playing sports. New research also suggests thatthe cerebellum is involved in processing speed, like clock speed on a computerand thought coordination or how quickly we can integrate new information. Whenthe cerebellum is low in activity, people tend to be clumsier and less likely tothink their ways out of problems. They think and process information more slowlyand get confused more easily.The other area of her brain that was affected was the temporal lobes, especiallythe one on the left. The temporal lobes are involved with mood, memory, andtemper control. Problems in this part of the brain are associated with someforms of depression, but also dark thoughts, violence, and memory problems. InNoelle’s scans, when she practiced gratitude, her temporal lobes looked healthy.When she frightened herself with negative thinking, her temporal lobes becamemuch less active. Negative thought patterns change the brain in a negative way.Practicing gratitude literally helps you have a brain to be grateful for.IMAGES 11.1–4[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_037_r1.jpg]Notice low left temporal lobe activity decreases with bad thoughts (arrow).[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_038_r1.jpg]Notice marked decreased cerebellar activity with bad thoughts (arrow).Focusing on the good things in your life can make you happier regardless of yourcircumstances, according to decades of research from Dr. Martin Seligman, therenowned director of the University of Pennsylvania Positive Psychology Center.Seligman promotes the fascinating concept of positive psychology, which is basedon the theory that happiness isn’t the result of good genes, rather that it canbe cultivated. In his book Authentic Happiness, he writes that showing gratitudeon a daily basis is one of the keys to increasing your sense of joy, happiness,and life satisfaction.Here is a quick gratitude exercise you can try. Write down five things you aregrateful for every day. Use the form provided, make copies of it, or just use anotepad to write down the things you are grateful for. The act of writing helpsto solidify them in your brain. In my experience, when depressed patients didthis exercise every day, they actually needed less antidepressant medication.Other researchers have also found that people who express gratitude on a regularbasis are healthier, more optimistic, make more progress toward their goals,have a greater sense of well-being, and are more helpful to others. Doctors whoregularly practice gratitude are actually better at making the correct diagnoseson their patients.FIVE THINGS I’M GRATEFUL FOR TODAY 1. __________________________________________________ 2. __________________________________________________ 3. __________________________________________________ 4. __________________________________________________ 5. __________________________________________________5. Get enough sleep. Getting adequate sleep enhances your ability to fightstress. Read Chapter 10 [Amen_9780307463593_epub_c10_r1.htm] to review the manyways sleep helps the brain.6. Get moving. Physical activity is a big stress reliever. Read Chapter 5[Amen_9780307463593_epub_c05_r1.htm] to learn more about why exercise is thesingle most important thing you can do for your brain.7. Learn to warm your hands using only your mind. See Chapter 8[Amen_9780307463593_epub_c08_r1.htm], “The Heart Solution,” for more details.8. Practice diaphragmatic breathing. The simple act of breathing delivers oxygento your lungs, where blood picks it up and takes it to every cell in your body.Breathing also eliminates waste products, such as carbon dioxide, from the body.When there’s too much carbon dioxide in your system, it can cause stressfulfeelings of disorientation and panic. Brain cells are particularly sensitive tooxygen, as they start to die within four minutes when they are deprived ofoxygen. Even the slightest changes in oxygen content can alter the way you feel.Diaphragmatic breathing, in which you direct and control your breathing, hasseveral immediate benefits. It calms the basal ganglia, the area of the brainthat controls anxiety, helps your brain run more efficiently, relaxes yourmuscles, warms your hands, and regulates your heartbeat.Here’s how you do it. As you inhale, let your belly expand. This pulls the lungsdownward, which increases the amount of air (and oxygen) available to yourlungs, body, and brain. When you exhale, pull in your belly to push the air outof your lungs. This allows you to expel more air, which in turn encourages youto inhale more deeply. Keep breathing in this fashion, and stressful feelingsmay diminish.DIAPHRAGMATIC BREATHING EXERCISETry this simple three-step exercise to make sure you are breathing deeplyenough.Lie on your back and place a small book on your belly.When you inhale, make the book go up.When you exhale, make the book go down.Here’s another breathing tip that can soothe stress. Whenever you feel stressedout, take a deep breath, hold it for four to five seconds, then slowly blow itout (take about six to eight seconds to exhale completely). Take another deepbreath (as deep as you can), hold it for four to five seconds, and blow it outslowly again. Do this about ten times and odds are that you will start to feelvery relaxed.9. Listen to soothing music. Music has healing powers that can bring peace to astressful mind. Of course, it depends on the type of music you listen to.Listening to music that has a calming effect, such as classical music or ambientsounds, has been shown to reduce stress and calm anxiety. Other types of musicmay be stress-inducing and destructive. I believe it is no coincidence that themajority of teens who end up being sent to residential treatment facilities orgroup homes listen to more heavy-metal music than other teens. Music that isfilled with lyrics of hate and despair may encourage those same mind states indeveloping teens. What your children listen to can hurt them or help them. Teachthem to love classical music when they are young.ACTION STEPI use music in my own life to help calm stress. Here’s a list of some of myfavorite recordings that I personally find healing. You may want to trylistening to them too. * Don Campbell, Mozart as Healer: Classial Healing for the New Millennium, Essence: The Ambient Music of Don Campbell, and Healing Powers of Tone and Chant * Compiled by Joan Z. Borysenko and Don Campbell, Inner Peace for Busy People: Music to Relax and Renew * Michael Hoppé, Solace * David Lanz, Beloved * Dean Evenson, Arctic Refuge: Gathering of Tribes (with various artists), Ascension to Tibet, Healing Dreams (with Scott Huckabay), Healing Sanctuary, Music for the Healing Arts, Native Healing, Peace Through Music (with various artists)10. Surround yourself with the sweet smell of lavender. Your deep limbic systemis the part of your brain that directly processes your sense of smell. It isalso the emotional center of your brain, which means that smells can have a bigimpact on your mood. The scent of lavender has been used since ancient times forits calming, stress-relieving properties. This popular aroma has been thesubject of countless research studies, which show that it reduces cortisollevels and promotes relaxation and stress reduction.One remarkable study that appeared in the journal Early Human Developmentexamined two groups of mothers giving their babies a bath. The first group usedlavender bath oil; the second didn’t. The first group of moms appeared morerelaxed, smiled more, and touched their babies more often during the bath thanthe second group of moms. Their babies cried less and spent more time in deepsleep following the bath. The first group of moms and their infants also hadsignificantly lower cortisol levels than the second group, which didn’t uselavender bath oil.You can find this natural stress reliever in the form of oils, candles, sprays,lotions, sachets, and potpourri. Many other scents, such as geranium, rose,cardamom, sandalwood, and chamomile, are considered to have a calming effectthat reduces stress.11. Rehearse or practice situations that cause stress. Nobody is completelyimmune to stress. Everybody gets stressed out about something from time to time.For many people, things like speaking in public, going on a job interview, orgoing to an event where you don’t know anybody can make your palms sweat andyour heart race. In these cases, you can benefit from a little practice. Themore you do something, the less stress inducing it becomes.12. Live in the present. The notion of living in the present is a simpleconcept, but it is one of the hardest to implement. Many of us dwell on thepast, holding grudges about things that happened years or even decades ago,stewing over a fight with a colleague, or feeling bad about things that happenedto us in high school. You could be lying on a warm, sunny beach while onvacation, but inside your head, you are fuming about a comment your significantother made the week before. Equally common are those of us who fret about thefuture, worrying about bad things that might happen. In Eckhart Tolle’sextraordinary book The Power of Now, he encourages readers to shed the pains ofthe past, stop fearing the future, and live in the present moment. He believesthat the present is all we really have, that we can’t change the past, and thatit is what we’re doing right now that shapes our future.13. Practice self-hypnosis. Like meditation and prayer, self-hypnosis is apowerful tool to balance brain function and decrease stress. When I’m feelingoverly stressed, I use the same self-hypnosis exercise I wrote about in Chapter10, “The Sleep Solution.” However, instead of drifting off to sleep at the endof it, I stay in my “special place” for about ten or fifteen minutes, then comeback to full consciousness. It usually makes me feel very refreshed and relaxed.This is one of my favorite stress busters.ACTION STEPIn principle, I agree that it is a good idea to live in the present. Worryingabout the past and fretting about the future only add to your stress. However,through SPECT imaging, I have found that when people think about happy memoriesfrom the past, it enhances brain function. Instead of erasing your pastcompletely, make sure the version of it that runs through your head has apositive spin.14. Avoid substances that harm your brain. Consuming caffeine, eating sugarysnacks, drinking alcohol, and smoking are some of the most common—andunfortunately, some of the worst—ways to deal with stress. Duke Universityresearcher James Lane, Ph.D., has been studying the effects of caffeine onstress for more than a decade. According to his findings, caffeine disrupts anatural process that keeps stress under control. When ingested, caffeineprevents the release of adenosine, a chemical that regulates bodily functions.Normally, when we get stressed, adenosine levels rise to reduce the body’sresponse to stress.With caffeine, however, adenosine is suppressed so your body’s response to thestress is heightened. Lane’s body of research shows that consuming caffeineincreases stress hormone levels when people are faced with stressful events ortasks. Basically, this means that drinking a large caffe latte before a test ora big meeting will only amplify any feelings of stress you might haveexperienced normally.People often reach for a glass of wine or alcohol to calm the effects of stress.Research, however, shows that in many people, drinking actually induces stressand elevates stress hormone levels. Alcohol also lowers overall blood flow andactivity in the brain, which diminishes your ability to cope with stress.The same goes for smoking. When smokers get stressed, they tend to light up insearch of relief. But inside the body, it is another story. Nicotine causes yourblood pressure to rise and your heart rate to increase, which are signs ofincreased stress. And like alcohol, smoking causes blood vessels to constrict,which reduces the amount of oxygen going to the brain and subsequently lowersbrain function.ACTION STEPWhen you feel stressed, skip the alcohol, cigarettes, and candy. They lowerbrain function and ultimately increase stress.Numerous studies have shown that when unrelenting stress hits, it causes many ofus to look for solace in a big bowl of Ben & Jerry’s Chunky Monkey, a fistful ofM&Ms, or a bag of Oreo cookies. Unfortunately, high-fat foods can also triggerstressful reactions. Researchers at the University of Calgary examined stressreactions in two groups of students. The first group ate a high-fat breakfastwhile the second group noshed on a low-fat meal. Two hours later, the testsubjects went through a series of stressful tasks. In each of the tasks, thegroup that gorged on the high-fat meal showed higher stress reactions than thesecond group.15. Laugh more. There is a growing body of scientific literature suggesting thatlaughter counteracts stress and is good for the immune system. It is no joke!One study of cancer patients found that laughter reduced stress and improvedcell activity associated with increased resistance to the disease.According to the University of California, Irvine’s Professor Lee Berk, “If wetook what we know about the medical benefits of laughter and bottled it up, itwould require FDA approval.” Laughter lowers the flow of dangerous stresshormones that suppress the immune system, raise blood pressure, and increase thenumber of platelets, which cause clots and potentially fatal coronary arteryblockages. Laughter also eases digestion and soothes stomachaches, a commonsymptom of chronic stress. Plus, a good rollicking guffaw increases the releaseof endorphins, which makes you feel better and more relaxed. Laughter truly maybe the best medicine when it comes to stress relief.The average child laughs hundreds of times a day. The average adult laughs onlya dozen times a day. Inject more humor into your everyday life. Watch comedies(this could be a helpful form of TV), go to comedy clubs, go to humorouschildren’s plays, read joke books (my favorite is The Far Side by Gary Larson,which is pretty sick, but I am a psychiatrist after all), and swap jokes withyour friends and coworkers.I can’t stress enough (pun intended) how important it is to learn to laugh atyourself too. When you drop the milk jug and it goes splashing across thekitchen floor, when you call a business associate by the wrong name, or when youstumble over your words while teaching a class, be the first to chuckle atyourself. When you stop taking yourself so seriously, your stress levels willsubside.16. Seek help for chronic stress. If you are chronically stressed, it may be agood idea to see a psychotherapist to talk about your problems and learn betterstress-management skills. Many people have a negative attitude about seeing apsychotherapist, but I think of them as life consultants. When a great businesshas troubles, it is likely to deal with the problems head-on and find the bestconsultants to help. We should behave the same way in our personal lives. Indealing with stress, I often refer people to biofeedback therapists,hypnotherapists, and people who do a form of psychotherapy called eye movementdesensitization and reprocessing, or EMDR, which helps them deal with anxiety,past traumas, and performance enhancement.SUPPLEMENTS THAT CALM STRESSSome supplements may be helpful in soothing stress, including B vitamins,L-theanine, GABA, St. John’s wort, 5-HTP, magnesium, and valerian.

The directions from hisdoctor were clear: Exercise, eat a healthy diet, and take your medicine. But hekept forgetting. He would regularly go out for doughnuts and coffee laden withcream and sugar. And he often forgot to take his medicine unless his wife handedit to him. Frustrated, his wife would chastise him, and he would promise to dobetter. The diabetes was stealing healthy blood flow to his brain, especially tohis prefrontal cortex (impulse control and short-term memory) and the inside ofhis temporal lobes (where information gets into long-term memory). Even thoughJohn knew what to do, he often forgot and reverted back to his habitualbehavior. And it cost him dearly. Over time, he lost his eyesight and had bothlegs amputated. His skin looked much older than he was, and he was significantlyoverweight.A healthy body requires a good memory. You need to remember what to do every dayto keep yourself healthy and NOT forget. This is different from willpower, whereurges and cravings overtake your prefrontal cortex. Memory is being able to holda plan in your mind so that you can consistently pursue your goals and make themhappen. Memory requires focus to get the information into your brain and then,once inside, the information needs to get into the brain’s long-term storagebins. Some people have a deterioration of memory as they age; some never had avery good memory. Either way, you can improve your memory if you improve theoverall health of your brain and your body.Considering Alzheimer’s disease is expected to triple in the next twenty-fiveyears, it is critical for all of us to think about and optimize our memorycenters. I have seen this disorder ravage families, making everyone feelstressed and look older than they are. In this chapter, I will help youunderstand the different types of memory, specific memory problems, what to doabout them, and how to boost your overall memory.TYPES OF MEMORYMemory is a recording of one’s experiences stored in the brain—be it aninteresting conversation, a piece of information, a “memorable scene,” or anotable event. There are three types of memories differentiated by the timelapse between the experience and the recall of that experience. Each type ofmemory activates different brain areas when one attempts to recall it.Working memory resides in the frontal lobe and lasts less than a minute. Thisform of memory is commonly referred to as one’s attention span and lasts up toone minute before being erased. Trying to memorize a dance step someone justshowed you is an example of working memory.Short-term memory resides on the inside of the temporal lobes in an area calledthe hippocampus and lasts a few minutes to a few weeks before being erased. Whenyou try to recall the dance step you learned in last week’s dance class, thesebrain areas are activated. Not all of your moment-to-moment experiences activateshort-term memory. Only those experiences that are novel, interesting, or thatyou intended to remember will sufficiently stimulate nerve cells in this area ofthe brain to record them.Long-term memory can last a lifetime. Scientists are not yet certain which brainareas are directly involved in long-term memory, but likely they are scatteredacross many areas of the brain. When you try to recall the name of your firstdance teacher when you were a child, you are accessing your long-term memory.MEMORY BOOT CAMPIn order to have the best memory possible, you need to keep your brain and bodyhealthy, work your memory on a regular basis, and treat any memory problemsearly.Exciting research suggests that new learning and doing the same old thing in adifferent way can help your brain stay healthy and young. Boring is not only,well, boring, it is also potentially harmful to the long-term well-being of yourbrain. In several new scientific studies, people who do not engage in regularlearning activities throughout their lives have a higher incidence ofAlzheimer’s disease.The brain is like a muscle. The more you use it, the more you can continue touse it. New learning makes new connections in the brain, making you sharper andmore efficient. No learning actually causes the brain to disconnect itself.Unlike a muscle, however, the brain gets easily bored and requires new anddifferent challenges to stay healthy. Once the brain really learns something,such as how to navigate the streets of your hometown, it uses less and lessenergy to accomplish the task. To keep active, the brain needs a constant streamof new challenges. New adventures, new sites, and new skills encourage brainhealth. Here are three fantastic ways to keep your brain young.1. Foreign immersion Going on a cooking vacation to Italy, unless you have doneit several times before, is a perfect way to keep your brain young. Travel tonew lands, especially ones filled with fascinating history and sites, keeps thebrain learning and working at optimal efficiency. In addition, going todifferent cultures often involves a new language, which really pushes thelinguistic and memory centers of the brain. If you also add another skill, suchas cooking—as long as you do not drink too much wine—there is an even greaterbenefit. Likewise, consider traveling to a new city nearby, watching a foreignfilm, going to an international restaurant, or listening to new music; thesealso expose the brain to new experiences. Learning enhances cells in thehippocampus, a part of the emotional and memory center of the brain.2. New paths A simpler, cheaper exercise closer to home is to start taking newand different ways to and from work each day. Going the same old way each timeputs the brain on automatic pilot, which does nothing positive for it. Look forways to vary your commute or drive. For example, from time to time, take someside streets rather than the highway to see other neighborhoods. New navigationroutes enhance the brain’s parietal lobes, which are involved in directionsense. Driving the scenic route home may help to decrease your stress level,which will have a global positive effect on the brain.3. Move it Exploring new exercises is perhaps one of the most powerful ways tokeep the brain young. One of my favorite exercises for the brain is dancing.Exercise by itself boosts blood flow to the brain and helps keep it young. Whenyou add in a coordination exercise to music, such as learning a new dance step,it boosts the cerebellum and temporal lobes, which are two of the majorprocessing and learning centers in the brain. It gives the brain an extra boost.But go light on the wine spritzers—drinking ruins the positive effect.DON’T IGNORE MEMORY PROBLEMSMemory problems are typically considered an issue for the elderly. In myexperience as both a child and adult psychiatrist, however, I have seen memoryproblems across the life span. They commonly appear in children with learningdisorders, in teens and adults who smoke marijuana, in adults with depressionand substance-abuse problems, and in the cognitive decline that occurs withaging and many forms of dementia. In assessing memory problems, it is importantto consider * Medical causes, such as low thyroid or B12 deficiencies * Medications that interfere with memory, such as antianxiety medicines like Xanax or painkillers like OxyContin * Brain illnesses, such as depression or ADD * Early stages of Alzheimer’s disease * Excessive stress—stress hormones have been found to kill cells in the hippocampus * Lack of sleep or sleep apnea * Postanesthesia—some people react negatively to general anesthesia and complain of subsequent memory problems * Environmental toxins, such as finishing furniture or painting your car in a closed garage * Drug and alcohol abuseUNDERSTANDING AND TREATING MEMORY LOSSThe predominant cause of memory loss is a family of diseases called Alzheimer’sdisease and related disorders (ADRD), which includes but is not limited toAlzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, Parkinson’s disease, and frontal lobedementia. In addition to ADRD, many other conditions cause memory loss. Forsimplicity, the following tables list the major causes of memory loss, theappropriate treatment, and the possible results of treatment.TABLE 12.1 ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE AND RELATED DISORDERS Disease Treatment Result ofTreatment Alzheimer’s disease, thought to be caused by beta-amyloid plaqueformation and excessive tau proteins in brain cells, as well as inflammationMedications or supplements to boost the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, to boostblood flow to the brain, or to modulate the neurotransmitter glutamate.

In looking at our database of scans spanning the life span from threeto a hundred years old, it is clear that the normal brain has fewer and fewerresources with age. There is less blood flow that brings oxygen and glucose tonourish neurons and that takes away waste products, and there are fewerantioxidants for protection against free-radical formation and lower hormonelevels to keep it young. This is the fate of the typical brain. However, yourbrain does not have to succumb to age at the same rate as others’. There aresimple things you can do today to prevent disease and keep your brain healthyfor as long as possible.In order to stay healthy, the brain and body has to repair itself on a constantbasis. It is not like a car that you can take into a garage when it needs atune-up or when it has to have a part replaced. Your brain and body havemechanisms to repair damage as a result of the normal wear and tear of life. Thehardware of the brain—neurons, dendrites, axons, synapses, and others—must becared for. The brain has to maintain its 100 billion neurons to consistentlyfunction well. If the number of neurons in any cortical circuit decreases bymore than a third—as is the case in Alzheimer’s disease—the circuit can nolonger compensate for the loss, and symptoms appear.Diseases of aging in the brain typically cause the following problems: * Reduce the number of brain cells, such as in Alzheimer’s disease. * Reduce the number of connections between cells, which happens when there is depression or a lack of mental or physical exercise. * Impair the generation of electrical activity, which can happen if one consumes three or more alcoholic drinks at a time. * Disrupt cell machinery to produce energy, which happens in Parkinson’s disease, diabetes, or chemotherapy and radiation therapy for cancer. * Damage axons to slow the speed of signals in the brain, such as in hypertension, heart disease, strokes, and head trauma.KNOW AND REDUCE YOUR RISK FOR THE DISEASES OF BRAIN AGINGThe following list contains the risk factors for diseases of brain aging. Thenumbers in parentheses indicate how significant the risk factor is. For example,2.0 means there is twice the risk of having a problem; 4.0 means the risk isquadrupled. Check the ones that apply to you. 1. ____(3.5) one family member with Alzheimer’s disease or other cause of dementia 2. ____(7.5) more than one family member with Alzheimer’s disease or other dementia 3. ____(2.0) a single head injury with loss of consciousness for more than a few minutes 4. ____(2.0) several head injuries without loss of consciousness 5. ____(4.4) alcohol dependence or drug dependence in past or present 6. ____(2.0) major depression diagnosed by a physician in past or present 7. ____(10) stroke 8. ____(2.5) heart (coronary artery) disease or heart attack (myocardial infarction or MI) 9. ____(2.1) high cholesterol (hyperlipidemia) 10. ____(2.3) high blood pressure (hypertension) 11. ____(3.4) diabetes 12. ____(3.0) history of cancer or cancer treatment 13. ____(1.5) seizures in past or present 14. ____(2.0) limited exercise (less than twice a week or less than thirty minutes per session) 15. ____(2.0) less than a high school education 16. ____(2.0) jobs that do not require periodically learning new information 17. ____(2.3) smoking cigarettes for ten years or longer 18. ____(2.5) have one apolipoprotein E4 gene (if known) 19. ____(5.0) have two apolipoprotein E4 genes (if known) 20. ____(38) over eighty-five years old ____Total Score (Add up the scores in parentheses for all items checked.)Interpretation:If the score is 0, 1, or 2, then you have low risk factors for developing thebrain diseases of aging.If the score is 3, 4, 5, or 6, then you have a moderate risk for developing thediseases of aging and prevention should be taken seriously.If the score is greater than 6, then prevention strategies should be part ofyour everyday life.GENETIC RISK FACTORSA family history that includes memory problems is a cause for concern andpreventive action. This is especially true for people who have a first-degreerelative (mother, father, brother, or sister) with Alzheimer’s disease, stroke,or Parkinson’s disease. Several genes are associated with Alzheimer’s diseaseand other causes of memory problems, especially the E4 version of theapolipoprotein E (apoE) gene on chromosome 19. Everyone has two apoE genes, andif one of them—or worse, two of them—is apoE4, that person’s chances of gettingmemory problems is quite high. Of course, apoE genes alone are not dangerous; weneed them to function, but the E4 type increases our risk for age-relatedproblems. There are three versions of the apoE gene: E2, E3, and E4, and it isthe last one that is the culprit. As with all genes, we inherit one copy fromeach parent, and any one person could have the following combination:ACTION STEPKnowing your risk for age-related memory problems is the first step towardprevention.ACTION STEPTo find out your apolipoprotein E genotype, you can ask your doctor to order asimple blood test. I think this should be done under the strictest confidence sothat insurance companies or others cannot obtain the information and potentiallyuse it against you. It would be best to pay for the test on your own and keep itin your personal records, but not allow it to be included in your medicalrecords.E2/E2, E2/E3, E2/E4E3/E3, E3/E4 orE/4, E/4.If a person has two E4 genes, it means he received one from each parent. Forabout 15 percent of the general population, at least one of their two apoE genesis the E4 gene. People who have no apoE4 gene at all have only a 5 to 10 percentchance of developing Alzheimer’s disease after age sixty-five, whereas peoplewith one apoE4 gene have about a 25 percent chance. Given the increase in riskof problems with this gene, it would be wise to know your apoE genotype.ALCOHOL AND DRUG ABUSEAlcohol is a double-edged sword. It can increase the risk for stroke, heartdisease, and possibly Alzheimer’s disease. Five percent of all strokes in theUnited States are alcohol related. Four or more drinks a day increase risks forstroke and heart disease, while one drink every few days actually reduces theserisks (presumably by increasing HDL cholesterol, which clears other types ofcholesterol that cause hardening of the arteries).Clearly, drug abuse damages the brain. There are more than a hundred brainimaging studies that demonstrate that drug abuse—including cocaine,methamphetamines, marijuana, heroin, and other opiates—diminishes brain functionand damages neurons. One of the first things I learned from doing brain imagingon a wide variety of psychiatric patients was that drug abuse damages thefunction seen on SPECT scans. I have made several posters on the effects ofdrugs on brain function that hang in more than fifty thousand schools, prisons,and drug-abuse treatment centers nationwide. Recently, it was found that cocaineinhibits a part of cells involved in energy production, a finding that has alsobeen linked to Parkinson’s disease.Reducing the risk of aging from alcohol and drug abuse is simple—stop using thethings that harm brain function. If drinking is a problem, I recommend stoppingaltogether and seeking treatment if needed. If it is not a problem, limit it tono more than one to two normal-size drinks a week.CANCER AND CANCER TREATMENTIn addition to cancers that invade the brain and can cause dementia, sometreatments for cancer get into the brain and can also cause dementia. However,there are few studies on this issue. One of the studies done examined the effectof chemotherapy in a hundred women with breast cancer. Dr. F. S. van Dam of theNetherlands Cancer Institute found that women who received chemotherapy plustamoxifen were four to eight times more likely to develop cognitive impairmentthan early-stage breast cancer women who had not received chemotherapy. A 1995review of children who are long-term survivors of cancer, particularly braincancer and leukemia, showed that the two most common long-term effects ofradiation therapy and chemotherapy are cognitive and hormonal impairment.Surprisingly, they found that the cognitive impairment is progressive and notstatic. Anything you do to decrease the risk of cancer, such as exercising,eating more fruits and vegetables, decreasing stress and stopping smoking, willalso help your brain stay healthy.CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASEAll forms of cardiovascular disease increase brain aging. The heart andbloodvessel system delivers blood and nutrients to the brain. Whatever is goodfor the heart is good for the brain. Whatever is bad for the heart andblood-vessel system is bad for the brain. Forms of cardiovascular diseaseinclude atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, congestive heart disease,heart rhythm problems, high cholesterol, and hypertension.The most effective way to prevent cardiovascular problems is to prevent thediseases that produce them. Exercise and diet are important factors that youhave some control over. You can also investigate your family history. If itincludes heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or high cholesterol, then you shouldconsult your physician and ask her to screen for these conditions at theappropriate age of risk for the condition or, in general, after the age offorty. An annual screening after the age of fifty is extremely wise. Regularcardiovascular exercise for thirty minutes or more goes a long way to improvinglipid metabolism to reduce lipid deposits in blood vessel walls. The main focusof your diet should be to not overdo it on saturated fats that are high in thebad cholesterols and that contribute to the fatty deposits in the blood vesselsthat cause atherosclerosis. Foods high in saturated fats include butter, cheese,cookies, doughnuts, pastries, ice cream, fatty meat, etc.CEREBRAL VASCULAR DISEASE (BRAIN BLOOD VESSEL DISEASE)The risk of developing serious brain problems in a person who has a stroke issix to ten times greater than that in the general population. Even a strokesmaller than a pencil-head eraser increases the risk for dementia four-totwelve-fold.A stroke is a single, damaging attack, but the risk factors that lead to astroke, such as high blood pressure, smoking, heart disease, and diabetes,develop over a long time. You can reduce your stroke risk by taking thefollowing simple steps: * Keep blood pressure under control. Check your blood pressure often, and if it is high, follow your doctor’s advice on how to lower it. Treating high blood pressure reduces the risk for both stroke and heart disease. * Stop smoking. Cigarette smoking is linked to increased risk for stroke and heart disease. The risk of stroke for people who have quit smoking for two to five years is lower than that for people who still smoke. * Exercise regularly. Exercise makes the heart stronger and improves circulation. It also helps control weight. Being overweight increases the chance of high blood pressure, atherosclerosis, heart disease, and adult-onset (type 2) diabetes. Physical activities like walking, bicycling, swimming, and tennis lower the risk of both stroke and heart disease. Talk with your doctor before starting a vigorous exercise program. See Chapter 5 [Amen_9780307463593_epub_c05_r1.htm], “The Exercise Solution.” * Eat a healthy, balanced diet and control diabetes. If untreated, diabetes can damage the blood vessels throughout the body and lead to atherosclerosis. See Chapter 4 [Amen_9780307463593_epub_c04_r1.htm], “The Nutrition Solution.”The warning signs for stroke include sudden numbness or weakness in the face,arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body; sudden confusion, troublespeaking, or understanding; sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes; suddentrouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance, or coordination; sudden severeheadache with no known cause. If you suspect that either you or someone you knowis having a stroke, call 911 immediately even if the symptoms seem to have goneaway. Sometimes the warning signs last for only a few minutes and then theydisappear, but that does not mean the problem is resolved. You could have had atransient stroke, called a transient ischemic attack (TIA), and although itdoesn’t last long, it is a symptom of a greater medical problem. Don’t ignore aTIA—see your doctor right away.DEPRESSIONDepression has been associated with increased risk for dementia. A prior historyof medically treated depression can be associated with a threefold increase inthis risk. In an impressive study, Drs. Yaffe and Blackwell from the Universityof California, San Francisco, studied the association between depression andcognitive decline. As part of an ongoing prospective study, they evaluated 5,781elderly women. They studied them at baseline and four years later, using testsof depression, memory, and concentration. At baseline, 211 (3.6 percent) of thewomen had six or more depressive symptoms. Only 16 (7.6 percent) of these womenwere receiving treatment, which meant 92.4 percent of depressed women in thestudy were not being treated. Increasing symptoms of depression was associatedwith worse performance at baseline and follow-up on all tests. Women with threeto five symptoms of depression were at 1.6 greater odds for cognitivedeterioration, while women with six or more symptoms of depression were at 2.3greater odds for problems, more than double the risk. They concluded thatdepression in older women is associated with both poor cognitive function andsubsequent cognitive decline.It is critical to note that most psychiatric diseases in general are, in effect,brain diseases. Schizophrenia, for example, has been shown to affect the frontaland temporal lobes, and depression has shown decreased activity in the frontallobes. These illnesses are also exacerbated by chronic stress; increased stresshormones have been shown to kill cells in the hippocampus.Early treatment is essential to stave off the ravages of psychiatric illnesses.Our work with SPECT teaches us that with appropriate treatment, the brainbecomes more balanced and works in a much more efficient way. Treatment caninvolve medication, psychotherapy, supplements, or a combination of all three.Medication and supplements work by altering certain neurotransmitters in thebrain—for example, antidepressants that enhance serotonin, norepinephrine, ordopamine. Psychotherapy has also been shown recently to affect neurotransmittersystems and enhance activity seen on SPECT scans.DIABETESDiabetes damages almost every organ, including the brain, by making bloodvessels hard and brittle. This increases the likelihood of stroke, heartdisease, and hypertension, all of which increase aging problems for the brain.In diabetes there is a failure to keep blood sugar (glucose) at appropriatelevels, which impairs memory and other cognitive functions. Sometimes, thetreatment of diabetes lowers blood glucose too much (hypoglycemia), which canalso impair memory and other cognitive functions.People with a family history of diabetes should have an Hg A1C and fasting bloodglucose test once a year after the age of forty. Also, if symptoms of increasedurination, increased thirst, or increased appetite develop, then fasting bloodglucose should be checked for diabetes. One of the most effective preventionsagainst diabetes is exercise, which improves insulin’s ability to regulate bloodglucose. Although there are many reasons why daily exercise is better thanexercise only every three days, the available data suggest that exercising atleast every three days helps protect against diabetes and a number of otherillnesses. Diets high in refined sugars increase the risk of diabetes.LACK OF EDUCATIONA number of studies that attempted to identify risk factors for dementia havenoted an inverse relationship between education and dementia—the more education,the less dementia. This is a controversial risk factor because educationalbackground and achievement can introduce a number of other factors thatgenerally affect health and opportunity. Despite the controversy, there issignificant evidence to support the idea that education (and increased mentalactivity) produces a functional reserve in the brain, which can provideprotection against developing dementia. The philosophy of use it or lose it isvery much at play in the brain. The more it is challenged and stimulated(without overdoing it, which leads to the harmful effects of stress), the moreability it will have during aging.ACTION STEPKeeping your mind active by reading, doing crossword puzzles, traveling, takingclasses and otherwise acquiring knowledge outside of your typical or usualexperience helps to reduce the risk of aging problems.No one that I am aware of has studied whether or not learning disabilities andother conditions, such as ADD, which often leads to school failure, areassociated with dementia. My strong suspicion is that there is a connection. Anycondition that negatively impacts brain function can put the brain at risk forother problems later on. I believe we should aggressively treat children andteens with school problems so that they will stay in school and, hopefully, growto love learning and be the lifelong learners they need to be in order to helpprotect their brains.HIGH HOMOCYSTEINE LEVELSHomocysteine is an amino acid regulated by folic acid in red blood cells. Ifelevated, homocysteine increases risks for coronary artery disease, stroke, anddementia. The risk is largely eliminated for homocysteine levels of 10 or below.High homocysteine levels in the blood increase LDL cholesterol, which narrowsthe coronary blood vessels. A study of persons who required opening up of theircoronary arteries by a procedure called coronary angioplasty showed thathomocysteine levels higher than 11 could be treated with folic acid (1 mg),vitamin B12 (400 mg), and vitamin B6 (10 mg) to reduce the levels to about 7.This homocysteine reduction helped prevent renarrowing of the coronary arteriesafter the angioplasty surgery and halved the chance that these blood vesselswould close up again and require another angioplasty surgery. High homocysteinelevels can also make blood clot more easily than it should, increasing the riskof blood-vessel blockages and stroke or heart attack.ACTION STEPIf your homocysteine levels are high, consider taking a supplement with B6, B12,and folic acid.Homocysteine is normally changed into other amino acids for use by the body. Ifyour homocysteine level is too high, you may not have enough B vitamins to helpthis process. Most people with a high homocysteine level don’t get enough folate(also called folic acid), vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), or vitamin B12 in theirdiets. Replacing these vitamins helps return homocysteine levels to normal.Other possible causes of a high homocysteine level include low levels of thyroidhormone, kidney disease, psoriasis, some medicines, or inherited deficiencies inthe enzymes used to process homocysteine in the body.HORMONESESTROGEN DEFICIENCY INDUCED BY MENOPAUSESix of ten studies showed that women who took estrogen had a lower risk forAlzheimer’s disease (AD). The best of these studies was the BaltimoreLongitudinal Study of Aging, where 472 women who were going through menopause orhad completed it were followed for up to sixteen years. Women who never usedestrogen during the study were twice as likely to develop dementia.This study and others showing beneficial effects of estrogen have beencontradicted by reports from the Women’s Health Initiative, discussed in Chapter7 [Amen_9780307463593_epub_c07_r1.htm], which found that women who used Premarin(an estrogen made from horse ovaries) were twice as likely to develop AD asnon-estrogen users. However, the Women’s Health Initiative study did not examinethe risk of AD using forms of estrogen made by the human ovary, such asestradiol. Evidence suggesting that these more natural forms of estrogen forwomen may still reduce AD risk and provide other benefits comes from the largeststudy ever done on the severest form of estrogen deficiency—hysterectomy withremoval of the ovaries. This study of 100,000 women who participated in the 1986National Mortality Followback Survey found that women with a hysterectomy weretwice as likely to develop dementia. What one can conclude from this complexmaze of seemingly contradictory research findings is that women should avoidPremarin and other forms of estrogen that are not made by the human ovary.However, severe reductions in female estrogen hormones are equally harmful andshould be treated.There is a large body of basic scientific research demonstrating sound reasonswhy estrogen, in the right amount, protects the brain, the blood vessels, andthe bones. Human forms of estrogen, taken in the smallest amounts needed to keepblood estradiol levels from falling too low in women after menopause, arereasonably safe and have not, to date, been demonstrated by the Women’s HealthInitiative or any other study to be harmful. If there is a family history ofdementia, then it is worth having a blood estradiol test after menopause todetermine if you have estrogen deficiency. You can then evaluate with yourdoctor whether low-dose estradiol or other natural estrogens would be worthtaking.The situation is more complex in women with a family history of both AD andbreast or uterine cancer, because some studies have found that estrogen useincreases the risk of these two cancers. Whether low-dose estradiolsignificantly increases the risk of heart disease or stroke in women withoutsymptoms is more controversial. The relative benefits of taking low-doseestradiol after menopause (reduced risk of AD and osteoporosis) may be greaterthan the relative risks (increased risk of endometrial cancer, breast cancer,and maybe stroke and heart disease), but the decision regarding treatmentdepends on your personal history and the risk factors for each of thesediseases.Although not all studies agree, estrogen use after menopause appears tosignificantly reduce AD risk. Estrogen use in estrogen-deficient women can alsoimprove verbal fluency and possibly verbal short-term memory. Evista is a formof estrogen that is reported to be safer to take in women with increased risk ofbreast or uterine cancer.TESTOSTERONE DEFICIENCY IN MALESTestosterone levels normally start to decline after age fifty. By age eighty,testosterone levels are 20 to 50 percent of their younger adult values. Lowtestosterone levels may increase dementia risk. A case-control study involving83 AD patients and 103 normal volunteers of similar age showed significantlyreduced total testosterone levels in AD males. However, until a well-designedgroup study is done, it is not certain whether or not testosterone deficiency isa risk factor for AD.Men who have or have had prostate cancer treatment or men fifty years and oldermay develop cognitive impairment due to testosterone deficiency, which can bechecked by a blood test. Symptoms including difficulty with vision not due toeye problems, difficulty remembering locations or faces or other objects ofinterest, breast enlargement, or a change in the distribution of body hairshould alert men to check for testosterone deficiency.PARKINSON’S DISEASEParkinson’s disease (PD) is caused by the loss of dopamine-producing cells.There is a significant connection between PD and AD. There is no known cure forPD, but with early detection there are medications that help with the symptoms.It has also been suggested that coenzyme Q10, a powerful antioxidant, along withhigh doses of vitamins C and E, may be helpful in delaying the need for strongerand stronger medications. Vitamin B6 increases the production of dopamine andmay be helpful early in the disease process. The natural hormone melatonin,which regulates sleep, has been found to reduce tremors and protect againstfree-radical damage on dopamine neurons. Fish oils and flaxseeds, which containomega-3 fatty acids, have nerve-nourishing effects that can boost dopamine.SEIZURES AND SEIZURE MEDICATIONAbout 125,000 Americans develop epilepsy every year. Thousands more experienceisolated seizures that may or may not happen again in the future. Recurringseizures are defined as epilepsy. Treatment of epilepsy has improveddramatically in recent years. Seizures can often be controlled, and chances oflong-term remission are improving all the time. However, seizures and certainantiseizure medications can have a negative effect on brain function and beassociated with dementia. During seizures there is dramatic increased activity,and then in the in-between period there is significant decreased activity.Antiseizure medications work by increasing inhibition in the brain. If this isdone too enthusiastically—as with the older antiseizure medications likeDilantin and phenobarbital—it can cause overall decreased activity and damagethe healthy cells around the seizure-promoting ones.Obviously, seizure disorders need to be vigorously treated. Once a person isseizure-free for two years, however, many neurologists start to taper theantiseizure medications to see how much is needed. Also, newer antiseizuremedications, such as Trileptal, are less likely to cause too much overallinhibition of brain function. If you are taking antiseizure medication andnotice memory problems, that is a symptom that the temporal lobes may be calmedtoo much. The most common cause of seizures in someone with epilepsy is nottaking seizure medication as prescribed. For some people whose seizures cannotbe controlled with medication, there is the option of surgery to remove thedamaged tissue. Sometimes it is possible to identify a certain action or eventthat will always produce seizures in sensitive people. Seizure “triggers”include flickering lights, breathing very quickly and deeply, drinking anexcessive amount of fluid, and even, in very rare cases, reading or listening toa certain piece of music. Sleep deprivation (like staying up all night studying)may produce seizures; so may excessive use of alcohol or withdrawal from certaindrugs. Excessive sugar has also been implicated, and ketogenic diets, whicheliminate sugars, have been found to be helpful.SLEEP APNEAObstructive sleep apnea—a condition associated with loud snoring, stoppingbreathing entirely for brief periods many times during the night, and chronictiredness—can cause cognitive impairment. In our clinic we have seen hundreds ofpeople with sleep apnea and they uniformly have troubled brains, especially inthe areas associated with memory. In one brain SPECT study of obstructive sleepapnea, researchers found significantly reduced activity in the left parietallobe. Reduced left-parietal-lobe activity can impair comprehension, making itdifficult to understand conversations or read books. Treatment of the sleepapnea with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), a machine thatpushes air at a high pressure through the nasal passageways, completely reversedthe impaired brain activity in these patients. Sleep apnea should be evaluatedand treated as early as possible.SMOKINGCigarette smoking is the number one cause of preventable deaths in the UnitedStates, accounting for nearly 500,000 deaths per year. It accounts for 12percent of all the strokes in the United States and is therefore a major riskfactor for dementia. Smoking is also a risk for lung, stomach, and bladdercancer, as well as hypertension and heart disease. Nicotine constricts smallblood vessels in all of the organs of the body, including the brain, andprematurely ages everything.ACTION STEPStop smoking now! To help you quit, consider hypnosis, nicotine gum or patches,and the antidepressant Wellbutrin.Obviously, stop smoking. I know this is often much easier said than done. Overthe years, I have helped many people stop smoking and I have found that no oneprogram works for everyone. Hypnosis is effective for some; the use of nicotinepatches or gum works for others; the medication Wellbutrin (bupropion), adopamine-enhancing antidepressant, is helpful for others; and some respond togroup therapy. In my experience, it is usually a combination of treatments thatis needed.Keeping your memory healthy is critical to your efforts to get a better body andvice versa. In order to keep your memory healthy, you need to keep your bodyhealthy as well. As you have seen, the strategies are simple—stop polluting yourbody, eat good food, exercise your mind and body, and treat disease early.SUPPLEMENTS TO ENHANCE MEMORYThe rational use of supplements can also be very helpful for your memory. Ginkgobiloba, phosphatidylserine (PS), sage, vinpocetine, curcumin, and huperzine Ahave been shown to be helpful to enhance memory. Medications that have also beenfound to help memory include Namenda, Aricept, Exelon, and Reminyl. See AppendixC for more information on supplements and also visit www.amenclinics.com[http://www.amenclinics.com].THE MEMORY SOLUTIONMemory Robbers Memory Boosters Any brain problems Overall brain-healthy programBrain trauma Focus on brain protection Poor sleep Adequate sleep (at least sevenhours) Low blood sugar Frequent small meals with at least some protein tomaintain healthy blood sugar Poor diet Enriched diet Alcohol/drug abuse Freedomfrom alcohol or drugs Depression Treatment for depression Anxiety Meditation forrelaxation and to boost the PFC Lack of exercise Exercise Lack of mentalexercise Lifelong learning Excessive TV or computer Limited TV and computerHormone problems (i.e., thyroid, testosterone, estrogen, cortisol) Optimizedhormone levels Medical problems, such as B12 deficiency Treatment of anyunderlying medical problems Medications such as Xanax or OxyContin Fish oil todecrease inflammation and enhance blood flow Diabetes Diet and exerciseAlzheimer’s disease Alzheimer prevention plan described above Stroke Stoppingsmoking Postanesthesia loss Overall brain-healthy program Environment toxinsGreat ventilation and elimination of any toxins Any systemic inflammationAnti-inflammation program, including fish oil, healthy diet, folic acid, or somelow-dose ibuprofen or baby aspirin Chemotherapy Cancer prevention diet, lots offruit and veggies Supplements include ginkgo, huperzine A, PS, sage, curcumin,and vinpocetine"},{"pageContent":"13THE ANT SOLUTIONTHINK YOUR WAY TO BEING THINNER, YOUNGER, AND HAPPIERDon’t believe every negative thought that goes through your brain.“I will never lose weight.”“I can’t help being fat—my whole family is fat.”“It is my wife’s fault I’m fat—she always puts too much food on my plate.”“Dieting is useless—I’m just going to gain all the weight back.”“I’m a failure because I can’t lose weight.”“I’m stressed out, so I have to eat.”“I have always had a sweet tooth—I will never be able to stop eating chocolate.”“It is too hard to stick to a diet.”“I have never been a good sleeper.”“I don’t have to count calories, I already know it all.”“I don’t need a lot of sleep—I can just drink more coffee to stay awake.”“My memory is terrible, but that is normal since I’m forty-five.”“I’m certain I will get Alzheimer’s disease because my dad has it.”“There is nothing I can do to prevent wrinkles.”“Everybody over fifty has bags under their eyes.”“I don’t want to go to the doctor because I know she will find something wrong.”“My kids are always getting colds, so it is normal that I get them, too.”“I just know I’m going to get cancer one day.”“I have no control over my high blood pressure—taking medication is the onlyoption.”Do any of these thoughts sound familiar? If so, you have been lying to yourself.These kinds of thoughts are LIES, and they prevent you from getting the body andthe brain you want. The good news is you don’t have to believe every stupid liethat goes through your head. Even better, you can talk back to the lies. Howmany of you were good at talking back to your parents as teenagers? I wasexcellent! You need to be good at talking back to yourself.Most of us never give thinking a second thought (pun intended). Thinking comesnaturally to all of us. In all our years of education, nobody ever teaches ushow to think, what to think, or what not to think. For many of us, it is afree-for-all in our minds, with random thoughts racing through without any rhymeor reason. For others of us, we get stuck on the same repetitive negativethoughts and can’t get rid of them. Is this good for our brains? No! Is thisgood for our bodies? No! Our negative thinking has taken control of our brains,and we need to take control back. It is time for boot camp for your thinking.Improved brain function, a better figure, enhanced moods, greater immunity, andglowing skin will be your reward.HOW THOUGHTS AFFECT YOUR BRAIN AND BODYDid you know that your thoughts are so powerful that they cause physicalreactions in your brain and body? It is true. Bad, mad, sad, hopeless, orhelpless thoughts release chemicals that make you feel bad. Your hands get cold,you start to sweat more, your heart rate quickens and flattens (low heart ratevariability is associated with negative thinking and heart disease … which isn’tgood for your health), you breathe faster and more shallowly, and your musclestense up. These awful, miserable, negative thoughts make your brain and bodywork less efficiently. On the other hand, happy, positive, hopeful, lovingthoughts release chemicals that make you feel good. Your hands feel warmer, yousweat less, your heart rate slows and becomes more variable (which is a goodthing), your breathing slows and deepens, and your muscles relax. These effectstake place immediately and make your brain and body function better.How do we know the body reacts to our thoughts? Biofeedback instruments, such asthose used for lie detector tests, tell us so. How do we know that the brainreacts to our thoughts? We know this thanks to brain imaging studies.Previously, I told you about a study we did comparing the effects of negativethoughts and gratitude on brain function. The results were astounding. The scansshowed that gratitude and positive thinking enhanced brain function. That makesit easier for you to make the best decisions regarding your diet and overallhealth. Negative thinking, however, caused serious decreases in activity in thecerebellum and temporal lobes, especially the left temporal lobe. When activityin the cerebellum is low, it is harder for you to think and process informationquickly—definitely not something you want to happen when you have to decidewhether or not to accept that third glass of wine your host just offered you orif you want the supersize version of your meal that the fast-food cashier justsuggested.ACTION STEPYour thoughts matter. If you want to feel good, think good thoughts.Decreased activity in the temporal lobes is associated with mood, memory, andtemper-control problems. Feelings of depression, difficulty rememberingimportant information, and violent acts may occur. These pose seriousconsequences for your body. Depression has been linked to being overweight orobese. If you don’t have a good memory, you will not remember all the things youneed to do to maintain good health. And violence can lead to bodily injury.Ouch!Several other studies confirm these findings. Researchers at the NationalInstitute of Mental Health conducted an intriguing study about the affectsthoughts have on brain function. They looked at brain activity in ten healthywomen under three different conditions: when they were thinking happy thoughts,neutral thoughts, and sad thoughts. During the happy thoughts, the womendemonstrated a cooling of their emotional brain, and they felt better. Duringthe sad thoughts, there was a significant increase in the emotional brain’sactivity, which is consistent with depression. Another neuroimaging study fromCanadian researchers found that sadness and negative emotions significantlyinfluence in a negative way brain function and brain plasticity.MEET THE ANTS: AUTOMATIC NEGATIVE THOUGHTSANTs (automatic negative thoughts) are the negative thoughts that enter yourhead throughout the day, make you feel bad, and prevent you from adoptinghealthy behaviors. They sabotage your healthy eating plans, diminish your desireto exercise, destroy your self-esteem, and make you feel rotten.I came up with the concept of ANTs as a way to help my younger patientsunderstand the notion of negative thoughts. One day, I came home to an antinvasion in my kitchen. There were thousands of the creepy crawlers everywhere.I grabbed the bug spray and started spraying to kill them. As I was sprayingthem, I thought, “These ants are just like the thoughts inside my patients’brains.” A few ants aren’t a big deal, but when you have an infestation, itspoils your day. The ANTs in your head are just the same. A negative thoughthere and there isn’t too troublesome, but if you have thousands of awfulthoughts, it makes you feel awful.In our high school course Making a Good Brain Great, we teach a session on ANTs.The students find it one of the most valuable parts of the class. They arefascinated to learn that they don’t have to believe every thought they have, andthey are shocked that nobody has ever taught them this concept before. We haveheard from the students that the idea that they can put a stop to their negativethoughts is very empowering and helps them believe that they can control theirthoughts rather than letting their thoughts control them.In my practice, I have identified nine “species” of ANTs that can steal yourhappiness and ruin your life: 1. All or nothing 2. Always thinking 3. Focusing on the negative 4. Thinking with your feelings 5. Guilt beating 6. Labeling 7. Fortune-telling 8. Mind reading 9. BlameLet’s look at each ANT species more closely.1. All or nothing These are the ANTs that infest your brain when you think thateverything is all good or all bad. It is the same as black-or-white thinking. Ifyou stick to your exercise plan for a month, you think you are the mostdisciplined person on the planet. If you miss a day at the gym, you think youhave no discipline and give up and go back to being a couch potato. A betterapproach is to acknowledge that you didn’t do your daily workout and then getback on track the following day. One slipup doesn’t mean you should give upentirely.2. Always thinking This is when you think in words that overgeneralize, such asalways, never, every time, or everyone. Consider some of the thoughts at thebeginning of this chapter: “I will never lose weight,” “I have always had asweet tooth—I will never be able to stop eating chocolate,” “My kids are alwaysgetting colds, so it is normal that I get them, too.” This kind of thinkingmakes you feel like you are doomed to fail at eating right and staying healthy.It is as if you have no control over your actions or behaviors.3. Focusing on the negative This ANT makes you see only the negative aspects ofsituations even when there are plenty of positives. “I know I lost ten pounds,but I wanted to lose fifteen, so I’m a failure” is an example of this type ofthinking. Focusing on the negative makes you more inclined to give up on yourefforts. Putting a positive spin on this same thought—”Wow! I lost ten pounds.I’m on my way to my goal of fifteen pounds”—encourages you to keep up the goodwork and makes you feel pretty good about yourself.4. Thinking with your feelings “I feel like my skin is never going to clear up.”Thoughts like this occur when you have a feeling about something, and you assumeit is correct, so you never question it. Feelings can lie too. Look forevidence. In this example, schedule an appointment with a dermatologist to findout if there’s anything you can do to improve your skin.5. Guilt beating Thinking in words like “should,” “must,” “ought to,” and “haveto” are typical with this ANT, which involves using excessive guilt to controlbehavior. When we feel pushed to do things, our natural tendency is to pushback. That doesn’t mean that guilt is all bad. There are certainly things inlife that we should and shouldn’t do if we want to have the best body possible:“I want to eat the chips and guacamole at the party, but I should have the rawcarrots instead” or “I feel like staying in bed, but I should do my workout.”Don’t mistake these for guilt-beating ANTs.6. Labeling When you call yourself or someone else names or use negative termsto describe them, you have a labeling ANT in your brain. A lot of us do this ona regular basis. You may have said one of the following at some point in yourlife: “I’m a loser;” “I’m a failure;” or “I’m lazy.” The problem with callingyourself names is that it takes away your control over your actions andbehaviors. If you are a loser, a failure, or lazy, then why bother trying tochange your behaviors? It is as if you have given up before you have even tried.This defeatist attitude can be ruinous for your body.BEWARE OF THE RED ANTSThese last three ANTs are the worst of the bunch. I call them the red ANTsbecause they can really sting.7. Fortune-telling Predicting the worst even though you don’t know what willhappen is the hallmark of the fortune-telling ANT. You probably have these ANTsin your brain if you’ve ever said anything like “I know I’m not going to be ableto stick with an exercise program;” “I’m going to cheat if I try to diet;” “Ijust had a biopsy. I’m sure it is cancer, and I’m going to die.” The problemwith fortune-telling is that your mind is so powerful it can make happen whatyou see. So when you are convinced that your biopsy will bring bad news, you getstressed about it, which depresses your immune system and increases your odds ofgetting sick. In fact, chronic stress has been implicated in a number ofdiseases, including cancer.Nobody is safe from fortune-telling ANTs, not even me. Several years ago, Iwrote an article for Parade magazine called “How to Get Out of Your Own Way.”After the article was published, my office received more than ten thousandletters asking for more information about self-defeating behavior. The media gotwind of the response, and I was invited to appear on CNN. It was a greatopportunity for me to get the word out about the work we do here at the AmenClinics, but I had never been on TV before, and I was nervous—really nervous.I was sitting in the “green room” right before I went on and all of a sudden, Ihad a panic attack. I couldn’t breathe, my heart was racing, and I wanted to getthe heck out of there. Thankfully, I treat people with this problem. I toldmyself the same things I tell my patients: “If you are having a panic attack ina safe situation, don’t leave, or panic will rule your life. Slow down yourbreathing. Write down your thoughts and what kind of ANTs they are.” So I stayedput, took a deep breath, and grabbed a pen to write down my thoughts: “I’m goingto forget my name”—fortune-telling. “I’m going to stutter”—fortune-telling. “Twomillion people are going to think I’m stupid”—fortune-telling.With just one look, I knew that I had a fortune-telling ANT infestation. Then,just like I tell my patients, I told myself to talk back to my thoughts.Okay, if I forget my name, I have my driver’s license in my pocket and can lookit up.I don’t usually stutter, but if I do, all the stutterers out there watching willhave a doctor they can relate to.And as for people thinking I’m stupid, I reminded myself of the 18/40/60 rule,which says when you are eighteen you worry about what everybody is thinking ofyou. At forty you don’t give a damn what anyone else thinks. And, at sixty, yourealize that nobody has been thinking about you at all. Most people spend theirdays worrying and thinking about themselves.This little exercise helped calm me down so I was able to go on TV, and I didfine. I did not forget my name. I didn’t stutter. And I did not get any phonecalls, letters, or e-mails from two million people telling me I was stupid. Thenext time I was asked to appear on TV, I was not quite as nervous. And with eachsubsequent appearance, I became more relaxed. Since that first time, I haveappeared on TV more than one hundred times, and it no longer makes me nervous atall. Just think if I had listened to my lying, fortune-telling ANTs and had runout of the studio. I probably never would have accepted another invitation to beon TV, and it would have dramatically changed my life and career in a negativeway.8. Mind reading When you think you know what somebody else is thinking eventhough they have not told you, and you have not asked them, it is called mindreading. You are probably familiar with these ANTs: “He is looking at mybehind—he must think I’m too fat” and “She is gazing into my eyes—she isprobably thinking I look too old because I have crow’s-feet.”I have twenty-five years of education—mostly in how to diagnose, treat, and helppeople—and I can’t read anyone’s mind. I have no idea what they are thinkingunless they tell me. A glance in your direction doesn’t mean somebody is judgingthe way you look. He could be looking at your rear end because you just sat onsomething that stuck to your pants. Or she could be thinking what beautiful eyesyou have.9. Blame Of all the ANTs, this one is the worst. Blaming others for yourproblems and taking no responsibility for your own successes and failures istoxic thinking. You know the kind of thoughts I’m talking about: “It is yourfault I’m out of shape because you will not go with me to exercise;” “It is mymother’s fault I’m overweight because she cooks such fattening foods;” or “Ionly started smoking because you smoke, so it is your fault I have respiratoryproblems.”One of my patients was a young girl who spent her entire first session blamingother people for all her problems. I had her make a piggy bank and put all ofthe excuses she used in it. Every time she would blame someone, she would haveto put a quarter in the bank. At first, there were a lot of quarters in thebank. I told her that she and I could write a book together called 101 ReasonsWhy I’m Not Responsible for How My Life Turns Out. Shortly, she got the messageand gave up blaming others.Whenever you begin a sentence with “It is your fault …” it ruins your life.These ANTs make you a victim. And when you are a victim, you are powerless tochange your behavior. In order to have the best body possible, you have tochange your behavior, so kill the blame ANTs.ACTION STEPBeware of the blame ANTs. Quit blaming others and take responsibility for youractions. If you are smoking, it is because you made the choice to start, and youcan make the choice to quit.CHANGE YOUR THINKING, CHANGE YOUR BRAIN AND BODYWhen you learn to challenge and correct negative, lying thoughts, you take awaytheir power to control you and your body. Instead, by taking control of yourthinking, you also take control of your actions and behaviors so you can havethe body you want. By changing your thinking, you can make yourself thinner,healthier, and happier. Here is a concept I use with many of my patients to helpthem take charge of their thinking.Develop an ANTeater in your brain that can eat up all the negative thoughts thatcome into your head and mess up your efforts to have a better body. Teach yourANTeater to talk back to the pesky ANTs so you can free yourself from negativethoughts. Whenever you feel mad, sad, nervous, or frustrated, write out yourthoughts and the ANT species, then write down what your ANTeater would say tothat ANT to kill it. As soon as you write down the truth, it diffuses anynegative feelings, and you start to feel better. Look at the following chart forexamples of how to talk back to your ANTs.ANTSpeciesANTeaterI ate a cookie. Now my diet is ruined.All or nothingI enjoyed the cookie and will eat fewer calories at dinner to make up for it.I know I’m going to get Alzheimer’s disease.Fortune-tellingI don’t know that. If I take care of my brain health now, I may not get it.It is your fault.BlameI need to take responsibility for my own actions and behaviors.ANT THERAPY FOR A BETTER BODYThe concept of changing your thinking to change your behavior is rooted in aproven, brain-enhancing technique called cognitive therapy or therapy tocounteract your automatic negative thoughts. Used to help patients overcome allsorts of unwanted behaviors, cognitive therapy can also be beneficial in helpingyou get a better body. That is the premise of The Beck Diet Solution, a greatbook by Dr. Judith S. Beck. In this work, Beck shows how cognitive therapy canhelp with diet and weight loss by teaching you to “train your brain to thinklike a thin person.” The simple act of thinking the way a thin person thinkshelps you behave like a thin person. And that behavior is what will help youlose weight.THINK LIKE A THINNER PERSON“I went to a party last night and ate a lot of guacamole and chips; today, Iweigh one pound more. I will try to eat better today.”“I can’t resist Mrs. Field’s cookies. When I go to the mall, I will avoid thefood court so I’m not tempted to buy any.”“When I feel stressed, I will take a warm bath or walk around the block insteadof reaching for the candy bowl.”“I’m going to tell my mother how much I love her famous cheese soufflé but thatI won’t be eating it this time because I’m trying to watch my weight. That way,she will not be insulted and I will not feel guilty when I don’t have any at ourfamily dinner.”“Those bagels in the break room look really good, but I just ate breakfast soI’m not going to eat one.”ACTION STEPChange your thinking so you start thinking like a younger person, a more fitperson, a more energetic person, a healthier person, or a thin person. Yourthoughts will translate into actions, and those actions will cause your body totransform into what you have always wanted.“As a child, I was taught to clean my plate, so I’m going to put a smallerportion of food on my plate. [Or, I’m going to use smaller plates.]”THINK LIKE A MORE YOUTHFUL-LOOKING PERSON“Just because I’m going out to dinner does not mean I have to drink alcohol,which dehydrates my skin and makes it look dull.”“I’m going to avoid places where people are smoking because I don’t want to betempted to smoke.”“I’m not going to stay out really late because I want to look refreshed in themorning.”“It is just as easy to put on moisturizer that has sunscreen in it, and itprotects my skin from sun damage.”“No matter how old I am, I can always improve the appearance of my skin bytaking care of it.”“Instead of stressing out about work, I’m going to spend five minutesmeditating.”THINK LIKE A HEALTHIER PERSON“Getting good sleep is a priority for me because it helps keep me from gettingsick.”“I’m going to talk to my doctor about what I can do to prevent seriousillnesses.”“If I feel under the weather or think I might have a mental health problem, I’mgoing to seek help from a professional rather than wait for the condition toworsen.”“I always feel so much better after I exercise, so I’m going to get up and do iteven though I feel tired this morning.”“I like having a healthy body, and I want to keep it that way, so I’m going tostay away from sports that are not brain safe and play tennis or table tennisinstead.”THE WORK: A SIMPLE BUT EFFECTIVE WAY TO KILL ANTSOne of my favorite books, Loving What Is, comes from my friend Byron Katie. Inthis very wise book, Katie, as her friends call her, describes an amazingtransformation that took place in her own life. At the age of forty-three,Katie, who had spent the previous ten years of her life in a downward spiral ofrage, despair, and suicidal depression, woke up one morning to discover that allthose horrible emotions were gone. In their place were feelings of utter joy andhappiness. Katie’s great revelation, which came in 1986, was that it is not lifethat makes us feel depressed, angry, abandoned, and despairing; rather, it isour thoughts that make us feel that way. This insight led Katie to the notionthat our thoughts could just as easily make us feel happy, calm, connected, andjoyful.It also led her to realize that our minds and our thoughts affect our bodies.“The body is never our problem. Our problem is always a thought that weinnocently believe,” she wrote in her book On Health, Sickness, and Death. Inthe same book, she also wrote, “Bodies don’t crave, bodies don’t want, bodiesdon’t know, don’t care, don’t get hungry or thirsty. It is what that mindattaches—ice cream, alcohol, drugs, sex, money—that the body reflects. There areno physical addictions, only mental ones. Body follows mind. It doesn’t have achoice.”Katie wanted to share her revelation with others to help them end theirsuffering by changing their thinking. She developed a simple method ofinquiry—the Work—to question our thoughts. The Work is simple. It consists ofwriting down any bothersome, worrisome, or negative thoughts, then askingourselves four questions and doing a turnaround. The goal of the Work isn’tpie-in-the-sky positive thinking; it is accurate thinking. The four questionsare these: 1. Is it true? (Is the negative thought true?) 2. Can I absolutely know that it is true? 3. How do I react when I think that thought? 4. Who would I be without the thought? Or how would I feel if I didn’t have the thought?After you answer the four questions, you take your original thought and turn itaround to its opposite, and ask yourself whether the opposite of the originalthought that is causing your suffering is not true or even truer. Then turn thethought around and apply it to yourself (how does the opposite of the thoughtapply to me personally?). Then turn the thought around to the other person, ifthe thought involves another person (how does the opposite apply to the otherperson?).I have done the Work myself, and it helped me get through a very painful periodof grief. When I did the Work, I immediately felt better. I was more relaxed,less anxious, and more honest in dealing with my own thoughts and emotions. NowI always carry the four questions with me, and I use them a lot in my practiceand with my friends and family. Here are some examples of how to use the fourquestions to kill the ANTs that are keeping you from having a body you love.DO THE WORK FOR WEIGHT LOSSGina was hoping to shed twenty pounds before her wedding, so she changed herdiet three months before the big day. After the first two weeks, she lost a fewpounds and was feeling good about herself. But after the third week, she steppedon the scale and saw that she had gained a pound even though she was followingher nutrition plan. She thought to herself, “I will never lose the weight intime for my wedding.” Here is how she worked on that thought.Negative thought: “I will never lose weight in time for my wedding.”Question #1: Is it true that you will not lose weight in time for the wedding?“Yes,” she said.Question #2: Can you absolutely know that it is true that you will not lose theweight in time for the wedding?Initially she said yes, she would not lose the weight. Then she thought about itand said, “Well, maybe I will. I lost weight the first two weeks. Maybe this isjust a temporary setback, and I will lose a few more pounds next week.”Question #3: How do you feel when you have the thought “I will never lose weightin time for my wedding”?“I feel frustrated, and I feel like a failure. I’m afraid that I will be fat onmy wedding day, and that I won’t fit in my dress. I’m worried that people willnot think I’m a beautiful bride.”Question #4: Who would you be without the thought “I will never lose weight intime for my wedding”?She thought about it for a moment, then said, “I would just be happy that I’mgetting married.”Turnaround: What is the opposite thought of “I will never lose weight in timefor my wedding”?Gina thought about it and said that if she continued to follow her diet, “I willlose weight in time for my wedding.” Then she felt a renewed energy to keepwatching what she ate rather than giving up on her diet.DO THE WORK FOR BETTER SKINNegative thought: “I’m over fifty, so there is nothing I can do to preventwrinkles.”Question #1: Is it true that there is nothing you can do?“Yes, because I already have wrinkles.”Question #2: Can you absolutely know that it is true that being over fifty makesyou incapable of preventing wrinkles?“No. I mean, I already have some wrinkles, but new wrinkles could be prevented.”Question #3: How do you feel when you have the thought? “I feel sad, old, andunattractive.”Question #4: Who would you be or how would you feel without the thought? “Iwould feel like I have more control over how I look.”Turnaround: “There is something I can do to prevent wrinkles.”Next, find examples to support that thought. “I could stop smoking, try to getmore sleep, and start wearing sunscreen. That could help.”DO THE WORK FOR SUGAR ADDICTIONNegative thought: “I can’t get through the day without eating chocolate.”Question #1: Is that true?“Yes.”Question #2: Can you absolutely know that it is true? Would you die if you didnot eat chocolate one day?“No, of course I would not die.”Question #3: How does that thought make you feel?“It makes me feel bad, because I know that eating too much chocolate is makingme fat, and that makes me hate my body.”Question #4: Who would I be without that thought?“I would feel a whole lot better because I could lose some weight, which wouldimprove my self-esteem.”Turnaround: “I can get through the day without eating chocolate.”DO THE WORK FOR YOUR HEALTHNegative thought: “My dad had a heart attack at age sixty, so I know that I’mgoing to have one then, too.”Question #1: Is it true?“Yes, it is hereditary.”Question #2: Can you absolutely know that it is true?“No, I can’t. My dad smoked, never did any exercise, ate a terrible diet, andnever went to the doctor. I don’t smoke, and if I eat right, exercise, and takemedication to lower my cholesterol, I can probably prevent or at least delayheart disease.”Question #3: How do you feel when you have this thought?“I feel really stressed out and scared.”Question #4: How would you feel without the thought?“I wouldn’t be so worried, so I would probably be able to sleep better.”Turnaround: “I don’t know that I’m going to have a heart attack.”Is this thought true or truer than the original thought? “This thought is true.”At this point, if the turnaround does not make sense, and your original thoughtreally is true, you either have to let go of the thought and live with it or dosomething about it. The goal is not to delude yourself, but to be honest withyourself.DO THE WORK FOR YOUR MEMORYNegative thought: “My memory is awful. I’m sure I’m developing Alzheimer’sdisease.”Question #1: Is it true that your memory is that bad?“Yes.”Question #2: Can you absolutely know that it is true 100 percent of the time?“No, I remember most things, but I feel like I’m forgetting things more oftennow. Although I have been under a lot of stress lately, and that is when I tendto forget things.”Question #3: How do you feel when you have the thought?“I feel scared and worried that I won’t be able to take care of myself, I willhave to be put in a nursing home, and I will lose all my family and friends.”Question #4: How would you feel without the thought?“I would feel a lot better.”Turnaround: “My memory isn’t awful, and I’m not developing Alzheimer’s disease.”Is this true or truer than the original statement? “Probably. I should probablycheck with my doctor to test my memory.”HOW TO GET YOUR UNCONSCIOUS BRAIN TO WORK ON YOUR BODYYour brain is an amazingly powerful organ, and it can make happen what it sees.If it sees fear, your whole body will feel afraid. Seeing yourself as old, fat,wrinkled, or demented causes increased stress and cortisol production, whichwill affect your health, your weight, your skin, and your mind in a destructiveway. If your brain sees joy, your whole body will feel lighter, healthier, andhappier. Negative thoughts can make negative things happen, while positivethoughts can help you reach your health goals.Physicians have known for centuries that your mind and brain can play a crucialrole in your health. Until a hundred years ago, the history of medicaltherapeutics was largely that of the doctor-patient relationship and the“placebo effect” (placebos being inert substances that have no known physiologiceffect on the problem). Actually, most of the treatments by physicians in timespast would have been more harmful than beneficial to the patient if it weren’tfor the belief in the healing power of the physician. The benefits of theplacebo effect are determined by the expectations and hopes shared by thepatient and the doctor.Although a placebo is a substance that is considered pharmacologically inert, itis by no means “nothing.” It is a potent therapeutic tool—on average aboutone-half to two-thirds as powerful as morphine in relieving severe pain. It isnow recognized that one-third of the general population are placebo respondersin clinical situations relating to pain, whether the pain is from surgery, heartdisease, cancer, or headache. It is very clear that placebo responses are notsimply a result of the patient fooling or tricking himself out of the pain.Placebo administration can produce real physiologic changes. Some of thephysiologic pathways through which the placebo effects work have beenidentified.In a study done by a University of California research team, it was found thatadministering naloxone, a drug that neutralizes morphine, could actually blockthe placebo effect of pain relief in dental patients. From this study andothers, it has become clear that the belief in pain relief stimulates the bodyto secrete its own pain-relieving substance, called endorphins, which act in thesame manner as morphine except that they are much more potent. In a recentstudy, doctors at Houston’s Veterans Affairs Medical Center performedarthroscopic knee surgery on one group of patients with arthritis, scraping andrinsing their knee joints. On another group, the doctors made small cuts in thepatients’ knees to mimic the incisions of a real operation and then bandagedthem up. The pain relief reported by the two groups was identical. In a brainimaging study, researchers found that when a placebo worked for depressedpatients, brain function also changed in a positive way. Change your beliefs,change your brain, change your body.Tell your brain what you want and match your behavior to get it. If your mindtakes what it sees and makes it happen, it is critical to visualize what youwant and then match your behavior to get it. Too many people are thrown aroundby the whims of the day, rather than using their prefrontal cortex to focus onwhat they want and then following through on their goals.As successful athletes visualize their success before a game, you must do thesame thing to harness the power of your brain for your body. Too often, peoplewho see themselves as fat and sick actually get their unconscious mind tocollaborate on making them fat and sick. If you see yourself as fat, your brainwill continue to do what it takes to make you fat. If you see yourself ashealthy and trim, your brain will help you accomplish your goal for a betterbody.ACTION STEPTo harness the power of your brain in order to enhance your physical body andhealth, do these four things:1. Clearly define the body you want. Write it down.2. Spend a few minutes each day visualizing your healthy body.3. Put up pictures in your home or at work of when you were your healthiest.4. Ask yourself every day if your behavior is getting you the body you want.THE ANT SOLUTIONHappiness Robbers Happiness Boosters Distorted thinking Accuratethinking All or nothing Balanced thinking Always thinking Honesty andflexibility Focusing on the negative Focusing on the positive Thinking withyour feelings Thinking with logic Guilt beating Using “shoulds” onlywhen they serve you Labeling Avoid labeling self or others Fortune-telling Being curious about the future in a positive way Mind reading Askingfor clarification when needed Blaming Avoiding blaming self or others,taking responsibility for changing Never reflecting on your thinking Usingthe Work to question your own thoughts whenever you feel sad, mad, or nervousThinking like a fat (sick or old) person Thinking like a thin (healthy oryoung) person Visualizing failure Visualizing success"},{"pageContent":"14THE PASSION SOLUTIONMAKE LOVE TO RECHARGE YOUR BRAIN AND BODYSex… what else is free, fun, low calorie, and exercise?—BARBARA WILSON, M.D., NEUROLOGIST AND PAIN SPECIALISTThe symbol for love is a heart. “I love you with all my heart.” “I give my heartto you.” “My heart ACHES when you are gone.” How silly, because most of lovereally happens in the Jell-O–like mass of tissue between your ears. But it justdoesn’t sound very romantic to say: “I love you with all my brain.” “I give mybrain to you.” That sounds like a weird science experiment. Or, “My brain acheswhen you are gone.”It is your brain that is the organ of loving, learning, and behaving, and assuch, at about three pounds, your brain is the largest sex organ in your body.And in this case, size really does matter. Research clearly tells us that beingin a loving, healthy, affectionate relationship helps you be happier, livelonger, have a better body, and even help to protect you from depression andmemory problems. Having a healthy sex life is a key to having a better brain andbody.WHO WANTS TO LIVE TO A HUNDRED?In August 1982, during my internship year on the sterile surgical floor at theWalter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C., Jesse was discharged fromthe hospital. He had been admitted for an emergency hernia operation two weeksearlier and there had been some minor complications. I remember Jesse so vividlynow because he was one hundred years old but talked and acted like a man thirtyyears younger. Mentally, he seemed every bit as sharp as any patient I hadtalked to that year or since. He and I developed a special bond, because unlikethe surgery interns who spent a maximum of five minutes in his room each day, Ispent hours over the course of his hospitalization talking to him about hislife. The other interns were excited to learn about the latest operatingtechniques. I was interested in Jesse’s story, and I wanted to know aboutJesse’s secrets for longevity and happiness.Jesse had his one hundredth birthday in the hospital, and it was quite an event.His wife, actually his second one who was three decades younger, planned theevent with the nursing staff. There was great love, playfulness, and physicalaffection between Jesse and his wife. Clearly, they still had the “hots” foreach other.Just before his discharge from the hospital, he saw me at the nurses’ stationwriting notes. He enthusiastically waved me over to his room. His bags werepacked and he was dressed in a brown suit, a white shirt, and a blue beret. Helooked deeply into my eyes as he quietly asked me, “How long, Doc?”“How long what?” I answered.“How long before I can make love to my wife?”I paused and he continued in a hushed voice, “You want to know the secret tolive to a hundred, Doc? Never miss an opportunity to make love to your wife. Howlong should I wait?”A slow smile came over my face. “I think a week or so and you should be fine. Begentle at first.” Then I gave him a hug and said, “Thank you. You have given mehope for many years to come.”ACTION STEPIf you want to live longer, get sick less often, feel more joy, experience lesspain, and have better fertility, have more sex (preferably with a loving andcommitted partner).Science finally caught up to Jesse twenty-five years later. Now there is awealth of research connecting healthy sexual activity to longevity, as well asphysical and mental health. While there are many well-known ingredients to along life—good genes, a positive outlook, a curious mind, and exercise—frequentsexual activity is one of them too. In this chapter, I will illustrate the linkbetween sexual frequency, sexual enjoyment, longevity, and mental and physicalhealth.HEALING: SEX IS ONE OF THE BEST MEDICINESMany studies have investigated the relationship between healthy sexual activityand physical health. The potential dangers of sexual activity, includingsexually transmitted diseases and unplanned pregnancies, have been widelyreported, and rightly so. However, less publicized studies suggest thatthoughtful sexual activity with a committed partner improves well-being byenhancing longevity, immune system function, joy, pain management, and sexualand reproductive health. These studies illustrate that sexual activity may be apreventive measure against the two leading causes of death in the United States:heart disease and cancer. Below are some of the ways sex can improve yourhealth.LONGEVITYLearning how to enhance the largest sex organ in the body (the brain) and usingit well to intimately connect with others may add years to your life and islikely to make you much happier. Serious research on sexuality began in theUnited States in the 1950s by Alfred Kinsey. He reported that sex reducesstress, and that people who have fulfilling sex lives are less anxious, lessviolent, and less hostile. Current research bears this out, as physical touchincreases the hormone oxytocin, which boosts trust and lowers cortisol levels,the hormone of chronic stress.In a study done at Duke University, researchers followed 252 people overtwenty-five years to determine the lifestyle factors important in influencinglife span. Sexual frequency and past and present enjoyment of intercourse werethree of the factors studied. For men, frequency of intercourse was asignificant predictor of longevity. While frequency of intercourse was notpredictive of longevity for women, those who reported past enjoyment ofintercourse had greater longevity. This study suggested a positive associationbetween sexual intercourse, pleasure, and longevity.In 1976, research was published in Psychosomatic Medicine that concluded that aninability to reach orgasm may have a negative impact on women’s hearts. Only 24percent of women in the healthy control group reported sexual dissatisfaction,while 65 percent of the women who had heart attacks reported trouble with sex.In this study, the two most common causes of dissatisfaction in women were dueto impotence and premature ejaculation in their husbands. Sexual health is notjust an individual issue. It affects both parties’ satisfaction and overallhealth.ACTION STEPFor men, studies show that engaging in sex two, three, or more times per weekcan lower the risk for heart attack, stroke, and death.A Swedish study found increased risk of death in men who gave up sexualintercourse earlier in life. The research was done on four hundred elderly menand women. At age seventy, they were given a survey of their sexual activity andthen followed over time. Five years later, the death rates were significantlyhigher among the men who ceased sexual activity at earlier ages.A daring group of researchers from Queens University in Belfast, Ireland,included a question about sexual activity in a long-term study of health. Theauthors studied nearly a thousand men between the ages of forty-five andfifty-nine living in or near Caerphilly, Wales. They recorded the frequency ofsexual intercourse each week and within that month. The researchers divided themen into three groups: high orgasm frequency (those who had sex twice or more aweek), an intermediate group, and low orgasm frequency (those who reportedhaving sex less than monthly). The men were monitored again ten years later.Researchers found that the death rate from all causes for the least sexuallyactive men was twice as high as that of the most active group. The death rate inthe intermediate group was 1.6 times greater than that for the active group.Many questions come to mind with this type of study, such as “Is it the orgasmthat is healing? Or the touch and physical and emotional connection that comeswith intercourse? Does poor health decrease sexual activity? Do other factorssuch as lack of exercise, alcohol, and/or depression cause both poor health andless sexual activity?” The researchers found that the robustness of theirfindings persisted even after adjusting for differences in age, social class,smoking, blood pressure, and evidence of existing coronary heart disease at theinitial interview. This suggests a more likely protective role of sexualactivity.The researchers wrote, “The association between frequency of orgasm andmortality in the present study is at least—if not more—convincing onepidemiological and biological grounds than many of the associations reported inother studies and deserves further investigation to the same extent.Intervention programs could also be considered, perhaps based on the exciting,‘At least five a day’ campaign aimed at increasing fruit and vegetableconsumption—although the numerical imperative may have to be adjusted.”ACTION STEPLooking for a physical activity that burns calories, provides health benefits,and is a lot of fun? Sex is the answer.In a 2001 follow-up study, this same research group found that having sex threeor more times a week reduced the risk in males of having a heart attack orstroke by half. If a drug company came up with a medicine that performed aswell, their stock would soar through the roof on Wall Street. Coauthor of thestudy Shah Ebrahim, Ph.D., underscored the results by saying, “The relationshipfound between frequency of sexual intercourse and mortality is of considerablepublic interest.” There is truth to the saying that an apple a day keeps thedoctor away. It may also be true that an orgasm a day keeps the coroner away.WEIGHT LOSS, OVERALL FITNESSOne of the most compelling benefits of sex comes from studies of aerobicfitness. It has been estimated that the act of intercourse burns about 200calories, the equivalent of running vigorously for thirty minutes. Most couplesaverage about twenty-four minutes for lovemaking. During orgasm, both heart rateand blood pressure typically double, all under the influence of oxytocin.Muscular contractions during intercourse work the pelvis, thighs, buttocks,arms, neck, and thorax. Men’s Health magazine has gone so far as to call the bedthe single greatest piece of exercise equipment ever invented.MORE YOUTHFUL APPEARANCERegular orgasms can even help you look younger. According to research done byDavid Weeks, a clinical neuropsychologist at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital,making love three times a week in a stress-free relationship can make you lookten years younger. Dr. Weeks studied more than 3,500 men and women between theages of 18 and 102. He concluded that genetics were only 25 percent responsiblefor how young we look—the rest is due to behavior. In his study, a panel ofjudges viewed the participants through a one-way mirror and then guessed the ageof each subject. A group of men and women whose ages were underestimated byseven to twelve years were labeled superyoung. Among these “superyoung” people,one of the strongest correlates of youthful appearance was an active sex life.They reported having sex at least three times per week, in comparison with thecontrol group’s average of twice a week. The superyoung were also found to bemore comfortable and confident regarding their sexual identity.Dr. Weeks, whose findings are published in Superyoung: The Proven Way to StayYoung Forever, says this is partly because sexual activity in women helps totrigger the production of a human growth hormone that helps them maintain theiryouthful looks. Sexual activity also pumps oxygen around the body, boosting thecirculation and the flow of nutrients to the skin. Moreover, being in a sexualrelationship can in itself be a good incentive to look after your appearance andstay in shape.HIGHER YOUTH HORMONE LEVELS (DHEA, ESTROGEN, AND TESTOSTERONE)Dr. Winnifred Cutler, a specialist in behavioral endocrinology, reported thatwomen who enjoy regular sex had significantly higher levels of estrogen in theirblood than women experiencing either infrequent sex or no sex at all. Thebenefits of estrogen include a healthy cardiovascular system, lower badcholesterol, higher good cholesterol, increased bone density, and smoother skin.There is also growing evidence that estrogen is beneficial to brain function, asnoted earlier. (See Chapter 7 [Amen_9780307463593_epub_c07_r1.htm], “The HormoneSolution,” and Chapter 12 [Amen_9780307463593_epub_c12_r1.htm], “The MemorySolution.”)Another important hormone that seems to be affected by sexual activity is DHEA.Before orgasm, the level of DHEA spikes in the body to several times higher thannormal. DHEA is believed to improve brain function, balance the immune system,help maintain and repair tissue, promote healthy skin, and possibly improvecardiovascular health.Testosterone is increased through regular sexual activity. Testosterone can helpstrengthen bones and muscles, and is also beneficial to a healthy heart andbrain. The risk for Alzheimer’s disease is twice as high for people with lowertestosterone levels. Low testosterone levels are also associated with a lowlibido. From this connection one could imply that if you are not interested insex, your memory may be in jeopardy as well.BOOSTED IMMUNE FUNCTIONAccording to gynecologist Dr. Dudley Chapman, orgasms boost infection-fightingcells by up to 20 percent. Psychologists at Wilkes University in Pennsylvaniafound that students who had regular sexual activity had one-third higher levelsof immunoglobulin A (IgA), an antibody that boosts the immune system and canhelp fight colds and flu. In one study it was reported that women who performoral sex on their mates are less likely to suffer from preeclampsia, a conditionthat causes a dangerous spike in women’s blood pressure during pregnancy. Plus,sperm carries TGF beta, a molecule that can boost the activities of her naturalkiller cells, which attack the rogue cells that give rise to tumors.A study from the Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality conducted byDr. Ted McIlvenna looked at the sex lives of ninety thousand American adults andfound that sexually active people take fewer sick leaves and enjoy life more.POTENTIAL CANCER-FIGHTING AGENTA study conducted by Graham Giles from Australia concluded that the more oftenmen ejaculate between the ages of twenty and fifty, the less likely they are todevelop prostate cancer. A study published by the British Journal of UrologyInternational asserted that men in their twenties can reduce by one-third theirchance of getting prostate cancer by ejaculating more than five times a week.Researchers have suggested that sexual expression may lead to a decreased riskof cancer because of the increase in levels of oxytocin and DHEA, which areassociated with arousal and orgasm in women and men. A 1989 study foundincreased frequency of sexual activity correlated with a reduced incidence ofbreast cancer among women who had never had a child. The study examinedfifty-one French women who were diagnosed with breast cancer less than threemonths prior to the interview. They were matched with ninety-five controls. Ahigher risk of breast cancer also correlated with lack of a sex partner and raresexual intercourse, defined as less than once a month.BETTER SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIORResearch done by Dr. Winnifred Cutler indicated that women who have intercoursewith a male partner at least once a week are likely to have more regularmenstrual cycles than women who are celibate or who have infrequent sex. Insame-sex couples, women who engaged in sexual activity at least three times perweek also had more regular cycles. In her “White Paper for Planned Parenthood,”Dr. Cutler reported that sexual and reproductive health of both women and men isinfluenced by their sexual activity. She reports that regular sex can havepositive effects on reproductive health. Here are several examples.ACTION STEPBefore you opt for expensive fertility treatments, try having more sex.Fertility Frequent sexual activity may enhance fertility. Studies of menstrualcycle variability and frequency of intercourse have demonstrated that regularintimate sexual activity with a partner promotes fertility by regulatingmenstrual patterns.Menstrual cycle regularity A series of studies found that women who engaged inintercourse at least once a week had cycle lengths that were more regular thanthose of women who had sex sporadically or who were celibate.Relief of menstrual cramps Nine percent of 1,900 women stated that theymasturbated in the previous three months to relieve menstrual cramps.Pregnancy A review of fifty-nine studies that were written between the years1950 and 1996 concluded that sexual activity during pregnancy does not harm thefetus, as long as there are no other risk factors involved, such as sexuallytransmitted diseases. In addition, some research has shown that sexual activitythroughout pregnancy may serve as protection against early delivery, especiallyduring the third trimester (between the twenty-ninth and thirty-sixth weeks). Ofmore than 1,800 women, excluding those who could not have sex for medicalreasons, preterm delivery was significantly reduced in the women who hadintercourse late in their pregnancy.Healthy prostate The prostate gland is responsible for producing some of thesecretions in semen; sometimes the prostate becomes inflamed and painful(prostatitis). In single men who had prostatitis, over 30 percent whomasturbated more frequently reported marked or moderate improvement of theirsymptoms. In addition, there is a suggestion that frequent ejaculation may helpprevent chronic nonbacterial infections of the prostate.BETTER SLEEPSexual release can help people go to sleep. Orgasm causes a surge in oxytocinand endorphins that may act as a sedative. One study found that 32 percent of1,866 U.S. women who reported masturbating in the previous three months did soto help go to sleep. As most women know, men often go to sleep shortly afterhaving sex.PAIN RELIEFStudies have shown that orgasms can help treat some types of pain. Research byBeverly Whipple and Barry Komisaruk of Rutgers University, New Jersey, foundthat through regular orgasm women had higher pain thresholds when suffering fromconditions ranging from whiplash to arthritis. Immediately before orgasm, levelsof the hormone oxytocin surge to five times their normal level. This in turnreleases endorphins, which alleviate the pain. In women, sex also promotes theproduction of estrogen, which can reduce the pain of PMS.Dr. Whipple’s research identified the female G-spot, the vaginal “on switch” forfemale arousal, on the front inside wall of the vagina, opposite the clitoris.She showed that gentle pressure to this area raised pain thresholds by 40percent and that during orgasm women could tolerate up to 110 percent more pain.In brain imaging research to understand this finding, Dr. Whipple found thatduring peak arousal, the painkilling center deep in the brain is activated.Signals from this part of the brain give orders to the body to releaseendorphins and corticosteroids. These chemicals help to temporarily numb thepain from many different causes. Activating this region also has a calmingeffect and can reduce anxiety.MIGRAINE RELIEFResearch suggests that when your partner says, “Not tonight, honey, I have aheadache,” you can help her with a loving roll in the sack. A study from theSouthern Illinois University School of Medicine found that having an orgasmcould help alleviate the pain from migraines. Of the fifty-two migrainesufferers used in the study, sixteen reported considerable relief after anorgasm and another eight had their headaches completely gone. Since 2001, acouple of case studies reported that orgasm did help them with pain relief. Anearlier study of eighty-three women who suffered from migraine headaches showedthat orgasm resulted in at least some relief for more than half of them. Usingorgasm to help alleviate migraine pain is not as reliable as prescriptionmedications, but it does work much faster, is cheaper, has fewer side effects,and is more fun.TREATMENT OF DEPRESSIONOrgasms can also have an antidepressant effect. Orgasms cause intense increasedactivity in the deep limbic parts of the brain, which settle down after sex.Antidepressants tend to calm activity in the limbic parts of the brain as well.People who engaged in regular sexual activity experience less depression, andorgasm frequency may be one reason why.ACTION STEPIf you have symptoms of depression, regular sexual activity may help alleviatethem.When a man has an orgasm, an area in the limbic system, called themesodiencephalic junction, is activated. Cells in the region are known toproduce some of the pleasure chemicals discussed earlier. At the same time,researchers have shown that the amygdala, a fear center in the brain, becomesless active in men’s brains during sex. The region also is involved invigilance, so animals and people may need to shut down that part of the brain toavoid getting distracted during sex. Calming the fear center might also helpwith a man’s sense of commitment. Prostaglandins, fatty acids found in semen,are absorbed by the vagina and may have a role in modulating female hormones andmoods.Gordon Gallup, a psychologist at the State University of New York Albany, headeda study that found women whose male partners did not use condoms were lesssubject to depression than those whose partners did. One theory put forth wasthat prostaglandin, a hormone found in semen, may be absorbed in the femalegenital tract, thus modulating female hormones.Other research has indicated that high sexual activity is associated with lowerrisk and incidence of depression and suicide. A Canadian study that examined thecorrelation between sexuality and mental health found that celibacy wascorrelated with high scores on depression and suicidality indexes.IMPROVED SENSE OF SMELLAfter sex, production of the hormone prolactin surges. This, in turn, causesstem cells in the brain to develop new neurons in the brain’s olfactory bulb,its smell center, improving one’s sense of smell.THE KEY TO HEALTHRegular sexual contact, especially with a committed partner, helps to keep yourbody and brain healthy. Do not use excuses, such as you are too tired or toobusy for physical affection. Also, try to avoid spending too much time at workat the exclusion of social endeavors. A lack of relationships sets up humans tobe depressed or to seek pleasure through solitary sexual activities, such as onthe Internet, or to turn to drugs, alcohol, gambling, or other addictions, whichare not good for the brain. Men and women need touching, eye contact, and sexualconnection to stay healthy. When you feel loved, nurtured, cared for, supported,and intimate, you are much more likely to be happier and healthier. You have amuch lower risk of getting sick and, if you do, a much greater chance ofsurviving.HAPPINESSThere is happy news for people who have more activity in the bedroom than intheir bank accounts. After evaluating the levels of sexual activity andhappiness in sixteen thousand people, Dartmouth College economist DavidBlanchflower and Andrew Oswald of the University of Warwick in England foundthat sex so positively influenced happiness that they estimated increasingintercourse from once a month to once a week is equivalent to the happinessgenerated by getting an additional $50,000 in income for the average American.In addition, they reported that despite what most people think, people who makemore money do not necessarily have more sex. There was no difference, in theirstudy, between sexual frequency and income levels. The happiest people in thestudy were married people who had, on average, 30 percent more sex than singlefolks. The economists estimated that a lasting marriage equated to the happinessgenerated by an extra $100,000 annually, while divorce depleted an estimated$66,000 annually worth of happiness. Taking care of your marriage can save youlots of money.SUMMARY OF SOME OF THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF REGULAR SEXUAL CONTACT FOR WOMEN * More regular menstrual cycles * Lighter periods * Better memories * Better bladder control * Reduced stress * Increased youth-promoting hormone DHEA * Weight control—sex burns about 200 calories per half hour; yoga, 114; dancing (rock), 129; walking (3 mph), 153; weight training, 153. * More fertile menstrual cycles * Better moods * Pain relief * Fewer colds and flu * Staying in shape * Increased testosterone and estrogenSUMMARY OF SOME OF THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF REGULAR SEXUAL CONTACT FOR MEN * Increased heart rate variability (a sign of heart health and a calmer mind) * Improved heart cardiovascular function (three times a week decreases risk of heart attack or stroke by half) * Higher testosterone levels (stronger bones and muscles) * Improved prostate function * Improved sleepTREATING LOW LIBIDOAs you can see, scientific research demonstrates a positive correlation betweenregular sexual activity and physical and mental health. I gave a lecture on thistopic to the Samueli Women & Wellness Conference in Southern California and amarried woman came up to me afterward and said that she would rather be doinganything than having sex. She asked me what should she do, as she did not wantto die early.I replied, “There are many ways to stay healthy and live a long life, such as ahealthy diet, exercise, mental exercise, supplements, and having an optimisticoutlook, but I would hate to see you miss out on the added benefit of a healthysex life for you and your husband. Low libido is often associated with lowtestosterone levels, low estrogen levels, depression, a conflicted marriage, orpast emotional trauma. Finding and fixing the problem may give you manyrewards.”USE YOUR BRAIN TO IMPROVE YOUR BODY’S SEXUAL RESPONSEIn my book The Brain in Love, I wrote about Tantric sexual practices, and wasfascinated by the concept, which involves using the mind—the brain, that is—toenhance sexual response and intimacy. I wanted to experience it for myself andthought it would be a wonderful way to enhance my relationship with my wife,Tana. Finding someone whom my wife and I both trusted enough to discuss suchpersonal things took quite a bit of research. In the end, TJ Bartel, an advancedcertified Tantra educator, became our teacher. Our experience with him wasamazing and transformative. It deepened our relationship in ways we couldn’teven have imagined. TJ was such a wonderful teacher that I felt as if I had toshare his knowledge with everyone I knew.One of the basic beliefs of Tantra is that everybody has energy—in particular,sexual energy—within their body and that everybody has the potential to channelthat energy within the body and direct it to others. By using your brain, youcan learn to harness your sexual energy and circulate it throughout your body toheighten your body’s response, intensify the love-making experience, andincrease the healing power of sex.When I first heard about moving energy, I thought, “What the heck does thatmean? How do you move energy?” But there are many practices in both Eastern andWestern religions that practice this. Meditation is a way to move energy. Whatwe see in our brain imaging work is that when people pray or meditate, theydramatically move the energy in their brain to the most human, thoughtful partof the brain. I once did a brain imaging study with a professor from theUniversity of California, Irvine, on qigong, which is the practice of masteringyour energy within yourself and directing it to others in a healing way. Theresults were astounding. We found that the qigong master was able to directenergy at other people and immediately change their brainwave patterns andincrease blood flow to their brain.For most people, sexual activity is a time when they turn off their brain andfocus on the feelings in their body. But with Tantric sex, you use your brain tocontrol and enhance what your body is feeling for the ultimate brain-bodyconnection. If you would like to learn more about Tantric sex and how to movesexual energy, check out my book The Brain in Love or the six-audio CD set I didwith TJ Bartel called Create More Passion Tonight. They are both available atwww.amenclinics.com [http://www.amenclinics.com].SUPPLEMENTS THAT MAY INSPIRE PASSIONThe following supplements can fuel passion and increase your enjoyment of sexualactivity. For more information on these supplements, see Appendix C, “TheSupplement Solution,” or visit www.amenclinics.com [http://www.amenclinics.com]. * Fish oil is a wonderful supplement to enhance your love life. It helps with mood and joint pain, so you may be happier, less irritable, and subsequently feel more sexual, plus be more limber. * If you tend to be anxious and worried, 5-HTP can help to boost serotonin and give you more emotional freedom and energy to put toward your sex life. * If you tend to have low energy and feel negative, SAMe may help to boost your energy and mood, and it also helps with joint pain. * Ginkgo biloba boosts blood flow to all organs in the body. * Panax ginseng can increase energy, decrease stress, and improve endurance.SEXY FOODS TO TRY FOR MORE PASSION * Almonds enhance phenylethylamine (PEA), a chemical that boosts the alerting response in the brain that something fun is about to happen. * Apples sweeten the breath. * Asparagus, rich in vitamin E, is essential for hormone building. * Avocados have PEA, B6, and potassium. * Bananas contain the bromelain enzyme, which is believed to improve male libido. * Cabbage helps to increase circulation. * Celery contains androsterone, a hormone released by male sweat that turns women on. * Chili peppers have capsaicin, which stimulates nerve endings and raises heart rate. * Chocolate increases PEA and theobromine, a substance similar to caffeine. * Cheese actually contains more PEA than chocolate. * Eggs have B vitamins that help balance hormones. * Figs are high in amino acids that increase libido. * Garlic contains allicin, an ingredient that increases blood flow to the sexual organs. * Nutmeg significantly increases sexual activity in rats, so if you are married to a rat, it may be helpful. … * Oysters are high in zinc, which helps produce testosterone and dopamine for stimulation.THE PASSION SOLUTIONPassion Robbers Passion Boosters Any brain problems Effectively treating anybrain problems Lack of sleep Adequate sleep (at least seven hours) Hormonalfluctuations Balanced hormones Alcohol Freedom from alcohol DepressionJournaling when sad or anxious, treatment Negative thinking Kill the ANTs(automatic negative thoughts) Chronic pain Natural pain relief (SAMe, fish oil,5-HTP) Sexy scents for men: lavender, pumpkin pie, black licorice, doughnuts,orange, cheese pizza, roast beef, cinnamon buns Sexy scents for women: babypowder, cucumber, black licorice, lavender, pumpkin pie Scents for relaxation(for those who need calm before sex): sandalwood, marjoram, lemon, chamomile,bergamot Scents for stimulation (for those who need to be activated before sex):jasmine, ylang-ylang, rose, patchouli, peppermint, clove"},{"pageContent":"15THE BRAIN HEALTH SOLUTIONTREAT BRAIN DISORDERS TO PROTECT AGAINST PHYSICAL ILLNESSESHaving a great brain is essential to having a great body.Your brain and your body are totally connected to each other. Mental (brain)health illnesses, such as depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders,obsessive-compulsive disorders, schizophrenia, grief, post-traumatic stressdisorder, substance-abuse problems, eating disorders, and gambling addictionsall take a very real toll on your body and how you look and feel. Thesedisorders are intensely stressful, rob you of sleep, alter your appetite, andincrease your wrinkles and fat. It is essential to treat these brain healthproblems as early as possible so they do not make you look and feel old. In thischapter, I will give you a brief overview of the common mental health problemsand some ideas on when and how to seek help.MOOD DISORDERSDEPRESSIONDepressive disorders have been associated with heart disease, immune systemdysfunction, and Alzheimer’s disease. In Chapter 8[Amen_9780307463593_epub_c08_r1.htm], “The Heart Solution,” you saw howdepression lowers survival rates among heart attack patients. The same thingoccurs in cancer patients. A review of twenty-six studies involving more thannine thousand cancer patients revealed that death rates among those diagnosedwith minor or major depression were 39 percent higher than in those who weren’tdepressed. The physical toll of depressive disorders is easy to see on the facesand posture of those who suffer with them.Barbara, a fifty-two-year-old bookkeeper, wife, and mother of two, was referredto me because she was tired all the time. Her family physician ruled out thephysical causes of fatigue and thought she was overstressed. Additionally, shehad trouble concentrating at work and experienced difficulty sleeping. Her sexdrive was gone, her appetite was poor, and she had no interest in doing thingswith her family. Barbara would start to cry for no apparent reason, and she evenbegan to entertain desperate thoughts of suicide. Barbara was depressed.Depression is a series of common mental illnesses. Studies reveal that at anypoint in time, about 6 percent of the population will have a significantdepression. Only 20 to 25 percent of these people ever seek help. This isunfortunate, because depression is a very treatable problem.The following is a list of symptoms commonly associated with depression:Sad, blue, or gloomy moodLow energy, frequent fatigueLack of ability to feel pleasure in usually pleasurable activitiesIrritabilityPoor concentration, distractibility, or poor memorySuicidal thoughts, feelings of meaninglessnessFeelings of hopelessness, helplessness, guilt, and worthlessnessChanges in sleep, either poor sleep with frequent awakenings or increased sleepChanges in appetite, either marked decreased or increasedSocial withdrawalLow self-esteemIn evaluating all psychiatric problems, it is helpful to take a bio/psycho/social approach to understanding them.Biological factors There are several important biological factors to look for indepression.It is important to consider the family history. We know there is often a geneticlink to depression, and it often runs in families where there has been alcoholabuse.It is also important to evaluate patients from a medical point of view, as thereare a number of illnesses that can cause depression. These include thyroiddisease, infectious illnesses, cancer, and certain forms of anemia. A heartattack, stroke, or brain trauma can also leave a person vulnerable todepression.Periods of dramatic hormonal shifts (postpartum or menopause) often precipitateproblems with depression.Additionally, certain medications can cause depression. Most notable among theseare birth control pills, certain blood pressure or cardiac medications,steroids, and chronic pain-control medicines.In evaluating depression, it is essential to take a thorough alcohol and drugabuse history. Chronic alcohol or marijuana use often causes depression, whileamphetamine or cocaine withdrawal is often accompanied by serious suicidalthoughts.Psychological factors The psychological factors to look for in depressionincludeMajor losses, such as the death of a loved one; the breakup of a romanticrelationship; or the loss of a job, self-esteem, status, health, or purposeMultiple childhood traumas, such as physical or sexual abuseNegative thinking that erodes self-esteem and drives mood downLearned helplessness—the belief that no matter what you do, things won’t change.This comes from being exposed to environments where you are continuallyfrustrated from reaching your goals.Social factors The social factors or current life stresses to evaluate indepression includeMarital problemsFamily dysfunctionFinancial difficultiesWork-related problemsIn Barbara’s case, her physical examination was normal, but her mother hadperiods of depression, and she had an aunt who killed herself. Psychologically,she had a very critical father and subsequently was extremely self-criticalherself. Socially, her marriage had been difficult for the past several years,and she was often fighting with her teenage daughter.The best results in treating any emotional illness occur with abio/psycho/social approach. Barbara was placed on antidepressant supplements andlearned to be significantly less critical of herself. We also spent time workingon her marriage and her relationship with her teenage daughter. In ten weeks,she felt more energetic and was able to concentrate. Her mood was good. Sheslept well, and her appetite returned. She also got along better with her spouseand daughter.ACTION STEPDon’t ignore symptoms of depression. It can sabotage your efforts to get thebody you want.Depression is a very treatable illness. We have much better treatments than wedid in 1980. Early detection and treatment from a bio/psycho/social perspectiveis important to a full and complete recovery. From a biological standpoint, wethink of medication or supplements and proper diet and exercise. Exercise hasbeen found in some studies to be as effective as medication but cheaper and withfewer side effects (most side effects of exercise are positive). Psychotherapyhas also been found to be helpful in treating depression. The two best-studiedforms of psychotherapy for depression are cognitive therapy, which teachespatients to counteract the negative thoughts that invariably surface withdepression, and interpersonal psychotherapy, which teaches patients to have moreeffective relationships.In treating depression, it is often best to take a comprehensive approach thatincludes several or all of these methods. However, many people look solely toantidepressants to lift the symptoms of depression. The use of antidepressantmedication in the United States doubled from 1996 to 2005, according to a studyin the Archives of General Psychiatry. In 1996, about 13 million people (about 6percent of the population) were prescribed an antidepressant. That number soaredto 27 million people (more than 10 percent of the population) by 2005. The studyreported that less than 32 percent of the people being treated withantidepressants see a mental health professional for treatment. Instead, theyare receiving a prescription from a general practitioner. In addition, it foundthat the use of psychotherapy among people being treated with antidepressantshas decreased 10 percent.These trends concern me. Through our brain imaging work at the Amen Clinics, wehave identified seven different subtypes of depression, and each one requiresindividualized treatment. Prescribing antidepressants as a one-size-fits-alltreatment doesn’t work and could be dangerous for some people. In addition,psychotherapy is a proven technique that has been found helpful in the treatmentof depression. Plus, antidepressant medications come with a host of unwantedside effects. In many cases, I recommend trying natural therapies first,including getting daily exercise, practicing positive thinking, and taking fishoil supplements.BIPOLAR DISORDERAnother type of mood disorder is called bipolar disorder, where people cyclebetween two poles. There may be periods of depression that alternate withperiods of high, manic, irritable, or elated moods. Mania is categorized as astate distinct from one’s normal self, where a person has greater energy, racingthoughts, more impulsivity, a decreased need for sleep, and a sense ofgrandiosity. It is often associated with periods of hypersexuality,hyperreligiosity, or spending sprees. Sometimes it is also associated withhallucinations or delusions.In treating the depressive part of the cycle, both pharmaceutical and supplementantidepressants have been known to stimulate manic episodes. It is important tovigorously treat this disorder, as it has been associated with marital problems,substance abuse, and suicide. The stress that comes from marital strife and theeffects of alcohol or drug abuse can take a toll on your physical health andappearance.Here is a list of symptoms often associated with bipolar disorder: * Periods of abnormally elevated, depressed, or anxious mood * Periods of decreased need for sleep, feeling energetic on dramatically less sleep than usual * Periods of grandiose notions, ideas, or plans * Periods of increased talking or pressured speech * Periods of too many thoughts racing through the mind * Periods of markedly increased energy * Periods of poor judgment that leads to risk-taking behavior (separate from usual behavior) * Periods of inappropriate social behavior * Periods of irritability or aggression * Periods of delusional or psychotic thinkingBipolar disorder used to be called manic-depressive illness and is thought to bethe more classic form of this disorder. In recent years, a milder form of thedisorder called Bipolar II has been described that is associated with depressiveepisodes and milder “hypomanic” issues.The treatment for bipolar disorder, both I and II, is usually medication, suchas lithium or anticonvulsants such as Depakote or Lamictal. In recent years,there is literature to suggest that high doses of omega-3 fatty acids—found infish or flaxseed oil—can also be helpful.ANXIETY DISORDERSThere are four common types of anxiety disorders that can affect people’s brainsand bodies in a negative way: panic disorders, agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsivedisorders, and post-traumatic stress disorders. I will briefly discuss each ofthese and their treatments.PANIC DISORDERAll of a sudden, your heart starts to pound. You get this feeling of incredibledread. Your breathing rate goes faster. You start to sweat. Your muscles gettight, and your hands feel like ice. Your mind starts to race about everyterrible thing that could possibly happen, and you feel as though you are goingto lose your mind if you don’t get out of the current situation. You have justhad a panic attack. Panic attacks are one of the most common brain disorders,and they have a powerful effect on the body. It is estimated that 6 to 7 percentof adults will suffer from recurrent panic attacks at some point in their lives.They often begin in late adolescence or early adulthood but may spontaneouslyoccur later in life. If a person has three attacks in a three-week period,doctors make a diagnosis of a panic disorder.In a typical panic attack, a person has at least four of the following twelvesymptoms:Shortness of breathHeart poundingChest painChoking or smothering feelingsDizzinessTingling of hands or feetFeeling unrealHot or cold flashesSweatingFaintnessTrembling or shakingA fear of dying or going crazyWhen the panic attacks first start, many people end up in the emergency roombecause they think they are having a heart attack. Some people even end up beingadmitted to the hospital.Anticipation anxiety is one of the most difficult symptoms for a person who hasa panic disorder. These people are often extremely skilled at predicting theworst in situations. In fact, it is often the anticipation of a bad event thatbrings on a panic attack. For example, you are in the grocery store and worrythat you are going to have an anxiety attack and pass out on the floor. Then,you predict, everyone in the store will look at you and laugh. Pretty quickly,the symptoms begin. Sometimes a panic disorder can become so severe that aperson begins to avoid almost any situation outside of their house—a conditioncalled agoraphobia (see below).Panic attacks can occur for a variety of different reasons. Sometimes they arecaused by medical illnesses, such as hyperthyroidism, which is why it is alwaysimportant to have a physical examination and screening blood work. Sometimespanic attacks can be brought on by excessive caffeine intake or alcoholwithdrawal. Hormonal changes also seem to play a role. Panic attacks in womenare seen more frequently at the end of their menstrual cycle, after having ababy, or during menopause. Traumatic events from the past that somehow getunconsciously triggered can also precipitate a series of attacks. Commonly,there is a family history of panic attacks, alcohol abuse, or other mentalillnesses.On SPECT scans, we often see hyperactivity in the basal ganglia, or sometimestemporal lobe problems. Psychotherapy and the use of supplements, such as GABA,B6, magnesium, and kava kava, are my preferred treatments and work by balancingbrain function. Medications can be helpful. Unfortunately, the most helpfulmedications are also addictive, so care is needed.AGORAPHOBIAThe name agoraphobia comes from a Greek word that means “fear of themarketplace.” In behavioral terms, it is the fear of being alone in publicplaces. The underlying worry is that the person will lose control or becomeincapacitated, and no one will be there to help. People afflicted with thisphobia begin to avoid being in crowds, in stores, or on busy streets. They areoften afraid of being in tunnels, on bridges, in elevators, or on publictransportation. They usually insist that a family member or a friend accompanythem when they leave home. If the fear establishes a foothold in the person, itmay affect his or her whole life. Normal activities become increasinglyrestricted as the fears or avoidance behaviors dominate.ACTION STEPIf you have panic attacks, get a checkup. They can be caused by certain medicalconditions.ACTION STEPThe supplements 5-HTP and St. John’s wort increase serotonin and calm theanterior cingulate gyrus (the brain’s gear shifter) and may ease symptoms ofagoraphobia and OCD.Agoraphobic symptoms often begin in the late teen years or early twenties, but Ihave seen them start when a person is in their fifties or sixties. Often,without knowing what is wrong, people will try to medicate themselves withexcessive amounts of alcohol or drugs. This illness occurs more frequently inwomen, and many who have it experienced significant separation anxiety aschildren. Additionally, there may be a history of excessive anxiety, panicattacks, depression, or alcohol abuse in relatives.Agoraphobia often evolves out of panic attacks that seem to occur “out of theblue,” for no apparent reason. These attacks are so frightening that the personbegins to avoid any situation that may be in any way associated with the fear. Ithink these initial panic attacks are often triggered by unconscious events oranxieties from the past. For example, I once treated a patient who had beenraped as a teenager in a park late at night. When she was twenty-eight, she hadher first panic attack while walking late at night in a park with her husband.It was the park setting late at night that she associated with the fear of beingraped and which triggered the panic attack. Agoraphobia is a very frighteningillness to the patient and his or her family. With effective, earlyintervention, however, there is significant hope for recovery.The scan findings and treatment are similar to those for people with panicdisorder. The one difference is that people with agoraphobia often haveincreased anterior cingulate gyrus activity and get stuck in their fear ofhaving more panic attacks. Getting stuck in the fear often prevents them fromleaving home. Using medications, such as Prozac and Lexapro, or supplements,such as 5-HTP and St. John’s wort, is often helpful.OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDERThe hallmarks of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are recurrent thoughts thatseem outside a person’s control or compulsive behaviors that a person knows makeno sense, but he feels compelled to do anyway. The obsessive thoughts mayinvolve violence (such as killing one’s child), contamination (such as becominginfected by shaking hands), or doubt (such as the worry of having hurt someonein a traffic accident even though no such accident occurred). Many efforts aremade to suppress or resist these thoughts, but the more a person tries tocontrol them, the more powerful they can become.The most common compulsions involve hand-washing, counting, checking, andtouching. These behaviors are often performed according to certain rules in avery strict or rigid manner. For example, a person with a counting compulsionmay feel the need to count every crack on the pavement on their way to work orschool. What would be a five-minute walk for most people could turn into athree-or four-hour trip for the person with OCD. Many of these types ofbehaviors can stand in the way of your efforts to get a better body.They have an urgent internal sense of “I have to do it.” A part of theindividual generally recognizes the senselessness of the behavior and doesn’tget pleasure from carrying it out, although doing it often provides a release oftension. Over the years, I have treated many people with OCD, the youngest ofwhom was five years old. He had a checking compulsion and had to check the houselocks at night as many as twenty to thirty times before he could fall asleep.The oldest person I treated with this disorder was eighty-three. She hadobsessive sexual thoughts that made her feel dirty inside. It got to the pointwhere she would lock all her doors, draw all the window shades, turn off thelights, take the phone off the hook, and sit in the middle of a dark room tryingto catch the abhorrent sexual thoughts as they came into her mind.On SPECT studies, we often see excessive activity in the basal ganglia andanterior cingulate gyrus. Behavior therapy can be helpful and has been shown toimprove brain function. Using medications, such as Prozac and Lexapro, orsupplements, such as 5-HTP and St. John’s wort, to increase serotonin and calmthese parts of the brain is often helpful.POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDERJoanne, a thirty-four-year-old travel agent, was held up in her office atgunpoint by two men. Four or five times during the robbery, one of the men helda gun to her head and said he was going to kill her. She graphically imaginedher brain being splattered with blood against the wall. Near the end of thisfifteen-minute ordeal, they made her take off all her clothes. She picturedherself being brutally raped by them. They left without touching her, but lockedher in a closet.Since that time, her life had been thrown into turmoil. She felt tense and wasplagued by flashbacks and nightmares of the robbery. Her stomach was in knots,and she had a constant headache. Whenever she went out, she felt panicky. Shewas frustrated that she could not calm her body—her heart raced, she was shortof breath, and her hands were constantly cold and sweaty. She hated how shefelt, and she was angry about how her nice life had turned into a nightmare.What was most upsetting to her were the ways that the robbery affected hermarriage and her child. Her baby picked up the tension and was very fussy. Everytime she tried to make love with her husband, she began to cry and get images ofthe men raping her.Joanne had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a brain reaction to severetraumatic events such as a robbery, rape, car accident, earthquake, tornado, oreven a volcanic eruption. Her symptoms are classic for PTSD, especially theflashbacks and nightmares of the event.Perhaps the worst symptoms, however, come from the horrible thoughts about whatnever happened, such as seeing her brain splattered against the wall and beingraped. These thoughts were registered in her subconscious as fact, and until sheentered treatment, she was not able to recognize how much damage they had beendoing to her. For example, when she imagined that she was being raped, a part ofher began to believe that she actually was raped. The first time she had herperiod after the robbery she began to cry, because she was relieved she was notpregnant by robbers, even though they never touched her. A part of her evenbelieved she was dead, because she had so vividly pictured her own death. Asignificant portion of her treatment was geared to counteract these erroneoussubconscious conclusions.Without treatment, PTSD can literally ruin a person’s life. The most effectivetreatment is usually psychotherapy. One type of psychotherapy that I think worksespecially well for PTSD is called eye movement desensitization and reprocessing(EMDR). Depending on the severity of PTSD, certain types of medications andsupplements can also be helpful.DRUG AND ALCOHOL ADDICTION AND ABUSEMany people use alcohol or drugs to medicate underlying brain systems that aremisfiring. Downers, such as alcohol, marijuana, sedatives, and painkillers, areused to calm hyperactive brain systems. Uppers, such as cocaine andmethamphetamine, are used to stimulate underactive areas of the brain. Theproblem is that most of these substances are addictive and cause damage to thebrain and body. Sometimes the damage is permanent.Substance abuse has a serious negative impact on health. The list of healthproblems from alcohol and drugs fills volumes of books. Here are just some ofthe many physical effects of alcoholism:ACTION STEPGo through the following list of symptoms of excessive alcohol or drug use andcheck off those that apply to you. This will give you an idea if this area is aproblem for you or someone you know. * Increased risk for heart disease, stroke, and cancer * Liver inflammation, which can lead to cirrhosis * Erectile dysfunction * Stomach problems * Nutritional deficienciesIn addition, alcohol and drug use impair your memory and judgment, preventingyou from making the best decisions for your overall health and increasing thelikelihood of engaging in bad brain habits.Denial is frequently strong in substance abusers. The person with the problem isusually the last one to recognize that a problem exists. Alcohol-anddrug-related problems are similar in many ways. I have chosen to lump these twogroups together for simplicity.Note: Alcohol includes any beverage or medication that contains any alcohol—frombeer to wine to hard liquor, or even some cough preparations. Drugs include anymind-altering substances that produce stimulant, depressant, or euphoriceffects—amphetamines, barbiturates, marijuana, cocaine, heroin, PCP, and so on.LIST OF EXCESSIVE ALCOHOL-OR DRUG-USE SYMPTOMS * ___Increasing consumption of alcohol or drugs, whether on a regular or sporadic basis, with frequent and perhaps unintended episodes of intoxication * ___Use of drugs or alcohol as a means of handling problems * ___Obvious preoccupation with alcohol or drugs and the expressed need to have them * ___Gulping of drinks or using large quantities of drugs * ___The need for increasing quantities of alcohol or the drug to obtain the same “buzz” * ___Tendency toward making alibis and weak excuses for drinking or drug use * ___Needing to have others cover for you, either at work or at home * ___Refusal to concede what is obviously excessive consumption and expressing annoyance when the subject is mentioned * ___Frequent absenteeism from the job, especially if occurring in a pattern, such as following weekends and holidays (Monday-morning “flu”) * ___Repeated changes in jobs, particularly if to successively lower levels or employment in a capacity beneath ability, education, and background * ___Shabby appearance, poor hygiene, and behavior and social adjustment inconsistent with previous levels or expectations * ___Persistent vague body complaints without apparent cause, particularly those of trouble sleeping, abdominal problems, headaches, or loss of appetite * ___Multiple contacts with the health care system * ___Persistent marital problems, perhaps multiple marriages * ___History of arrests for intoxicated driving or disorderly conduct * ___Unusual anxiety or obvious moodiness * ___Withdrawal symptoms on stopping (tremors, feeling extremely anxious, craving drugs or alcohol, vomiting, etc.); an alcoholic or drug abuser has usually tried to stop many times but was unable to withstand the symptoms of withdrawal. * ___Hearing voices or seeing things that aren’t there is not uncommon. * ___Blackouts (times you cannot remember) * ___Memory impairment * ___Drinking or using drugs alone; early-morning use; secretive use * ___DENIAL in the face of an obvious problemIf you checked any of these symptoms, you or your loved one may be abusing drugsor alcohol.My favorite definition of an alcoholic or drug addict is anyone who has gotteninto trouble (legal, relational, or work related) while drinking or using drugs,then continues to use them. They did not learn from the previous experience. Arational person would realize that he or she has trouble handling the alcohol ordrugs and would stay away from them. Unfortunately, many people with theseproblems have to experience repeated failures because of the substance use, andthus hit “rock bottom” before treatment is sought.ACTION STEPIf you or a loved one is using drugs or alcohol excessively, first admit thatyou have a problem, then seek professional help.There has been a very helpful trend in medicine over the last ten years toclassify alcoholism and excessive drug use as illnesses, instead of morally weakbehavior. The American Medical Association, the World Health Organization, andmany other professional groups regard these as specific disease entities.Untreated, these diseases progress to serious physical complications that oftenlead to death. Here are some important facts you need to know about alcohol anddrug abuse: * Addictions often run in families. The more relatives a person has who are alcoholics or addicts, the more likely the person is or will become dependent on these chemicals. As a rule of thumb: one parent = 25 percent chance; two parents or one parent and one sibling = 50 percent chance; three or more family members = 75+ percent chance. * Alcoholism or drug addiction shortens life expectancy by an estimated ten to fifteen years. * Alcoholism and drug addictions occur in about fifteen million Americans. If this problem applies to you, you are not alone. * There is no typical person with alcoholism or drug addictions. These diseases affect people in all socioeconomic classes. * Drunken driving or driving under the influence of drugs is responsible for well over 50 percent of the highway traffic fatalities. * Alcoholism and drug addictions are treatable. Treatment for alcohol or drug abusers and their families is widely available today in all parts of the country.In treating substance abuse, it is important to recognize and treat anyunderlying cause of the problem, such as unrecognized depression, bipolardisorder, anxiety disorders, or ADD. New medications have been developed thathave been found helpful in alleviating withdrawal symptoms and decreasingcravings for the substances. Psychotherapy and support groups are often helpful.ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDERDo you often feel restless? Have trouble concentrating? Have trouble withimpulsiveness, either doing or saying things you wish you hadn’t? Do you fail tofinish many projects you start? Are you easily bored or quick to anger? If theanswer to most of these questions is yes, you might have attention deficitdisorder (ADD).ADD is the most common brain problem in children, affecting 5 to 10 percent ofthem in the United States, and one of the most common problems in adults. Themain symptoms of ADD are a short attention span, distractibility,disorganization, procrastination, and poor internal supervision. It is often,but not always, associated with impulsive behavior and hyperactivity orrestlessness. Until recently, most people thought that children outgrew thisdisorder during their teenage years. For many, this is false. While it is truethat the hyperactivity lessens over time, the other symptoms of impulsivity,distractibility, and a short attention span remain for most sufferers intoadulthood. Current research shows that 60 to 80 percent of ADD children neverfully outgrow this disorder.Over the years, I have seen thousands of children who had ADD. When I meet withtheir parents and take a good family history, I find that there is about an 80percent chance that at least one of the parents also had symptoms of ADD as achild and may, in fact, still be showing symptoms as an adult. Many of theparents were never diagnosed. Not infrequently, I learn of ADD in adults whenparents tell me that they have tried their child’s medication (not something Irecommend) and found it to be very helpful. They report it helped themconcentrate for longer periods of time, become more organized, and be lessimpulsive.Common symptoms of the adult form of ADD include poor organization and planning,procrastination, trouble listening carefully to directions, and excessivetraffic violations. Additionally, people with adult ADD are often late forappointments, frequently misplace things, may be quick to anger, and have poorfollow-through. There may also be frequent, impulsive job changes and poorfinancial management. Substance abuse, especially alcohol or amphetamines andcocaine, and low self-esteem are also common. There is often an inability tostick with diet and exercise programs.Many people do not recognize the seriousness of this disorder and just pass offthese kids and adults as lazy, defiant, or willful. Yet ADD is a seriousdisorder. Left untreated, it affects a person’s self-esteem, socialrelationships, ability to learn and work, and ability to be as healthy aspossible. Several studies have shown that ADD children use twice as many medicalservices as non-ADD kids, 52 percent of untreated adults abuse substances, andteens and adults with ADD have more traffic accidents.Many adults tell me that when they were children, they were in trouble all thetime and had a real sense that there was something very different about them.Even though many of the adults I treat with ADD are very bright, they arefrequently frustrated by not living up to their potential.From our research with SPECT scans, it is clear that ADD is a brain disorder,but not one simple disorder. I described six different types of ADD in my bookHealing ADD. The most common feature among the six types of ADD is decreasedactivity in the prefrontal cortex with a concentration task. This means that theharder a person tries, the less brain activity they have to work with. Manypeople with ADD self-medicate with stimulants, such as caffeine, nicotine,cocaine, or methamphetamine, to increase activity in the PFC. They also tend toself-medicate with conflict-seeking behavior. If they can get someone upset, ithelps to stimulate their brain. Of course, they have no idea that they do this.I call it unconscious, brain-driven behavior. But if you are around ADD peoplelong enough, you will see and feel the conflict-seeking behavior.ACTION STEPTo try to alleviate ADD symptoms naturally, exercise at an intense level everyday and eat a low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet.The best treatment for ADD depends on the type of ADD a person has. See my bookHealing ADD for a complete description of types and treatments. Sometimesmedications or supplements are helpful, but sometimes they can make things worseif they are not right. When correctly targeted, ADD is a highly treatabledisorder in both children and adults. Don’t let pride get in the way of gettingthe help you need. In order to get the body you want, you need a great brain andyou have to admit when your brain needs help.SEEKING PROFESSIONAL HELPEven after doing all of the brain-body–healthy strategies in this book, somepeople will still need to seek professional help. Some people will needpsychotherapy; some will need medication; others will need more directedguidance with supplements or other alternative treatments. In lecturing aroundthe world, I am frequently asked the following questions: When is it time to seea professional about my brain? What to do when a loved one is in denial aboutneeding help? How do I go about finding a competent professional?WHEN IS IT TIME TO SEE A PROFESSIONAL ABOUT MY BRAIN?This question is relatively easy to answer. People should seek professional helpfor themselves or a family member when their behaviors, feelings, thoughts, ormemory (all brain functions) interfere with their ability to reach theirpotential in their relationships, work, academics, or health. If you areexperiencing persistent relationship struggles (parent-child, sibling, friends,romantic), it is time to get help. If you have ongoing work or school problemsrelated to your memory, moods, actions, or thoughts, it is time to getprofessional help. If your impulsive behavior, poor choices, or anxiety arecausing consistent monetary problems or health problems, it is time to get help.Many people think they cannot afford to get professional help. I think it isusually much more costly to live with brain problems than it is to getappropriate help.Pride and denial can get in the way of seeking proper help. People want to bestrong and rely on themselves, but I am constantly reminded of the strength ittakes to make the decision to get help. Also, getting help should be looked atas a way to get your brain operating at its full capacity.Marian came to see me for mood swings and work-related problems. Even though shewas very competent, her behavior at work often caused problems with hercoworkers. When her boss suggested she see me, she resisted. There was nothingwrong with her, she thought, it was everyone else. One day, after exploding at acoworker, she realized it was, at least partly, her fault and agreed to come forhelp. She resisted because she did not want to be seen as weak or defective. Thebrain SPECT scan helped her to see that her brain needed to be balanced. Withthe appropriate help, she got better and didn’t have to suffer from mood swings,and she and her coworkers all suffered less stress as a result of herbetter-balanced brain.WHAT TO DO WHEN A LOVED ONE IS IN DENIAL ABOUT NEEDING HELPUnfortunately, the stigma associated with a “psychiatric illness” prevents manypeople from getting help. People do not want to be seen as crazy, stupid, ordefective and do not seek help until they (or their loved one) can no longertolerate the pain (at work, in their relationships, or within themselves). Mostpeople do not see psychiatric problems as brain problems, but rather asweak-character problems. Men are especially affected by denial.Here are several suggestions to help people who are unaware or unwilling to getthe help they need. Try the straightforward approach first (but with a new braintwist). Clearly tell the person what behaviors concern you, and explain to themthat the problems may be due to underlying brain patterns that can be easilytuned up. Tell them help may be available—help not to cure a defect but ratherhelp to optimize how their brain functions. Tell them you know they are tryingto do their best, but their behavior, thoughts, or feelings may be getting inthe way of their success (at work, in relationships, or within themselves).Emphasize better function, not defect.Give them information. Books, videos, and articles on the subjects you areconcerned about can be of tremendous help. Many people come to see us becausethey read a book, saw a video, or read an article. Good information can be verypersuasive, especially if it is presented in a positive, life-enhancing way.When a person remains resistant to help, even after you have beenstraightforward and given them good information, plant seeds. Plant ideas aboutgetting help and then water them regularly. Drop an idea, article, or otherinformation about the topic from time to time. If you talk too much aboutgetting help, people become resentful and to spite you won’t get help—especiallythe overfocused types. Be careful not to go overboard.Protect your relationship with the other person. People are more receptive topeople they trust than to people who nag and belittle them. Work on gaining theperson’s trust over the long run. It will make them more receptive to yoursuggestions. Do not make getting help the only thing that you talk about. Makesure you are interested in their whole lives, not just their potential medicalappointments.Give them new hope. Many people with these problems have tried to get help, andit did not work or it even made them worse. Educate them on new brain technologythat enables professionals to be more focused and more effective in treatmentefforts.There comes a time when you have to say enough is enough. If, over time, theother person refuses to get help, and his or her behavior has a negative impacton your life, you may have to separate yourself. Staying in a toxic relationshipis harmful to your health, and it often enables the other person to remain sickas well. Actually, I have seen that the threat or act of leaving motivatespeople to change, whether it is about drinking, drug use, or treating ADD.Threatening to leave is not the first approach I would take, but after time, itmay be the best approach. Realize you cannot force a person into treatmentunless they are dangerous to themselves, dangerous to others, or unable to carefor themselves. You can only do what you can do. Fortunately, there is a lotmore we can do today than even ten years ago.FINDING A COMPETENT PROFESSIONAL WHO USES THIS NEW BRAIN SCIENCE THINKINGAt Amen Clinics, Inc., we get many calls and e-mails a week from people all overthe world looking for competent professionals in their area who think in wayssimilar to the principles outlined in this book. Because our approach is on theedge of what is new in brain science, other professionals who know and practicethis information may be hard to find. However, finding the right professionalfor evaluation and treatment is critical to the healing process. The rightprofessional can have a very positive impact on your life. The wrongprofessional can make things worse.There are a number of steps to take in finding the best person to assist you.Get the best person you can find. Saving money up front may cost you in the longrun. The right help is not only cost effective but saves unnecessary pain andsuffering, so don’t rely on a person simply because they are on yourmanaged-care plan. That person may or may not be a good fit for you. Search forthe best. If he or she is on your insurance plan—great, but don’t let that bethe primary criteria. Once you get the names of competent professionals, checktheir credentials. Very few patients ever check a professional’s background.Board certification is a positive credential. To become board certified,physicians must pass additional written and oral tests. They have had todiscipline themselves to gain the skill and knowledge that was acceptable totheir colleagues. Don’t give too much weight to the medical school or graduateschool that the professional attended. I have worked with some doctors who wentto Yale or Harvard who did not have a clue on how to appropriately treatpatients, while other doctors from less prestigious schools were outstanding,forward thinking, and caring. Set up an interview with the professional to seewhether or not you want to work with him or her. Generally you have to pay fortheir time, but it is worth spending the money to get to know the people youwill rely on for help.Many professionals write articles or books or speak at meetings or local groups.If possible, read the work of or hear the professional speak. By doing so, youmay be able to get a feel for the kind of person they are and their ability tohelp you. Look for a person who is open-minded, up-to-date, and willing to trynew things. Look for a person who treats you with respect, who listens to yourquestions and responds to your needs. Look for a relationship that iscollaborative and respectful. I know it is hard to find a professional who meetsall of these criteria and who also has the right training in brain physiology,but these people can be found. Be persistent. The caregiver is essential tohealing.Make sure to get your brain tuned up and any brain problems treated in order tobe your best self, both physically and emotionally.THE BRAIN HEALTH SOLUTIONBrain Health Robbers Brain Health Boosters Depression Medication, supplements,exercise, enriched diet, psychotherapy Bipolar disorder Medication, supplements,fish oil Panic disorder Treating medical conditions, caffeine, eliminatingalcohol, balancing hormones, GABA, B6, magnesium, kava kavareducing AgoraphobiaMedications, supplements Obsessive-compulsive disorder Medication, behaviortherapy, supplements such as 5-HTP, St. John’s wort PTSD Psychotherapy, EMDR,supplements Alcohol/drug abuse Treating underlying conditions, psychotherapy,support groups, medication to ease withdrawal symptoms ADD Medication,supplements, intense exercise, low-carb/high-protein diet"},{"pageContent":"16CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR BODY, CHANGE OTHER PEOPLE’S BODIESHOW YOUR BRAIN INFLUENCES THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH OF OTHERSAttitudes are contagious. Are yours worth catching?—DENNIS AND WENDY MANNERINGMy father, who avoided doctors for most of his life, used to say “I give heartattacks, I don’t get them.” He prided himself on being fiercely independent, notletting anyone ever tell him what to do. He flourished his whole life, owning avery successful chain of grocery stores for more than fifty years, and he wasthe longtime chairman of the board of Unified Grocers, one of the largestindependent grocery wholesale companies in the world. Growing up with him as afather for me personally was a challenge. The “I give heart attacks, I don’t getthem” attitude was the opposite of my natural personality, which was more likemy mother’s father, of being a helper and peacemaker. I often found myself tensearound Dad yet still wanting to please him. The reactions in my body weredirectly connected to my dad’s brain.My dad was also the type of person who always said “No” to any question that wasasked.“Can I go here?”“No.”“Do you think I should do this?”“No.”“Would you like to go with me?”“No.”“Can I help you?”“No.”I remember when I was recruiting adults for one of our healthy studies, I askedhim to be scanned for us, his first response was, “No.” Actually, it took metwelve years of asking him to finally get a picture of his brain. When I saw it,the scan helped to explain a lot of frustration in my life. He had a lot ofactivity in the anterior cingulate gyrus, the brain’s gear shifter. People whohave too much activity in this part of the brain tend to be argumentative andreflexively say no. It can make their loved ones just a bit crazy. Seeing thescan helped me relax and know it wasn’t always me.BALANCE YOUR BRAIN, BE SEXIERLaura and I have been friends since childhood. She was a beautiful girl growingup and turned many heads of the boys we both knew. For some reason, unbeknownstto me, Laura never did it for me romantically. I adored her, but just not inthat way. Years later we continued to stay in touch and my feelings neverchanged.Then one day, her beauty radiated and I found myself drawn to her in a way thatwas very unusual. My heart beat faster when I was with her, my thoughts wanderedinto areas they had never wandered before. What was different? I wondered. Itall seemed weird. Then it became clear. She told me that she had suffered from alifelong anxiety disorder and that she finally found the strength to get ittreated. She was taking an antidepressant medication and a group of naturalsupplements, and she had been seeing a psychotherapist. Her anxiety was down andher level of happiness and joy were up.When Laura’s brain was changed, the look and appeal of her body changed as well,and subsequently, she changed my body’s reaction to her. Fortunately for me, myprefrontal cortex works well and I could just notice and enjoy the feelingwithout jeopardizing my marriage. This story highlights a critically importantpoint that extends the main theme of the book:When you change your brain,you change your body, and subsequentlyyou change other people’s bodies as well.Intuitively, we know this is true. * Take the angry boss at work. Many of his or her employees will experience physical stress symptoms as a result of the troubled behavior. I have seen this time and again among my patients. * When your wife or daughter is going through the worst part of her menstrual cycle, the levels of stress everyone in the family feels tend to increase. * When your husband is going through job stress, with the difficult boss mentioned above, you feel it as well. * Research tells us that mothers of children who have ADD or autism experience many stress symptoms and there is a higher incidence of depression and divorce in these families.One reason to take great care of your brain is that its health has a tremendousimpact on the health of those you love. People are contagious.OPTIMIZING YOURSELF TENDS TO ENHANCE THOSE AROUND YOUWhen Dr. Irwin Goldstein, an expert in sexual medicine, presented his researchfindings to a scientific meeting, he said: “It is rare for me to stand in frontof an audience and say, ‘This is a manuscript that has changed my life.’ Butthis one has done that.” The study, published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine,seemed obvious. The results showed that females in committed relationships withmen who were treated with an impotence drug (Levitra) had better sex. But thewomen didn’t just like sex better, they liked it better because their bodiesworked better. Lubrication was better. Orgasms were more intense. They lustedmore. The women’s bodies reacted as if they were receiving the drug. So a drugthey didn’t even take affected their bodies. “Her physiology is linked to his,”Goldstein says. “Men share problems with women, and the solutions. … It totallyintrigues me. I can change someone’s physiology without treating them. It is thewildest thing!” In fact, the better a man’s response to the drug, the better herresponse to him.“Entanglement” is a physics concept. Subatomic particles have “partners”—othersubatomic particles—with which they can be entangled, sometimes over greatdistances. If you change one particle, the change affects the other one withwhich it is entangled. Dr. Goldstein’s study is a strong indicator that humanscan be entangled. We change when we fall in love, we become one unit, at leastsexually. The two shall become one, as it says in the Bible. “There are no otherphysiologic abilities of men and women that are shared, and that is what is sofascinating about these data,” Goldstein says. He also says there is someevidence that when he successfully treats women suffering from dyspareunia, orpain with intercourse, their men get better erections and have more sexualsatisfaction. Goldstein suspects that male partners of women with low libidohave poorer erections and that if those women could be treated, the men wouldimprove too.Whether you know it or not, you have a significant impact on those around you.Taking care of your own brain allows you to take better care of those you love.When I was in my psychiatric residency program learning marriage and familytherapy, I often heard that it takes two people to change a relationship. Yearslater I found out that this “common sense” rule is actually wrong. It oftentakes just one person to change a relationship. Think with me. … I know I can gohome tonight and make my wife smile just by the comments I make, such as“Hi, honey, I missed you today.”“Hi, baby, is there anything I can do to help you tonight?”“Hi, sweetheart, you look great.”“Hello, my love, how was your day?”I also know I can make Tana scream at me. Particularly if I say thoughtlessthings like,“Hey, what did you do all day?”“Don’t you ever get anything done?”“Why do I have to do everything myself?”“Take that dress off, it looks terrible.”How my own brain works will have an important impact on how Tana’s brain andbody work. The same thing is true in your relationships. When you change yourbrain and change your body in a positive way, you will encourage the brains andbodies of those you love to work right as well.This phenomenon was one of the main reasons I became a psychiatrist. Unlikegiving people antibiotics or performing surgery, where you just fix theimmediate problem, I realized in medical school that if I helped my patientsfeel, think, and act better, it not only helped them become happier, moreeffective people, it also dramatically helped their interactions with theirspouses, their children, and even their grandchildren. I loved the possibilitiesof helping people across generations.Of course, when my father found out that I wanted to be a psychiatrist, he askedme why I didn’t want to be a real doctor. My body reacted in a stressed way, forfeeling I was disappointing him. I was smart enough to know it was my life andnot his, and I have loved nearly every day as a psychiatrist. Funny, many yearslater my dad has become one of my best referral sources. When one of hissupervisors was having family problems, he called me up and asked me to see him,because he didn’t want his valued employee to quit. With patience, even thetough brains can come around."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX A15 IMPORTANT NUMBERS I NEED TO KNOWHere are some important numbers you need to know in order to maintain a healthybrain and body.

Simple calculators are found online atwww.amenclinics.com/my-brain-health/online-tests-calculators/[http://www.amenclinics.com/my-brain-health/online-tests-calculators/].1. Body mass index (BMI). Weight in pounds × 703/height in inches22. Daily caloric needs to maintain current body weight. To find out your basiccalorie needs without exercise, which is referred to as your resting basalmetabolic rate (BMR), fill out the following equation: * Women: 655 + (4.35 × weight in pounds) + (4.7 × height in inches)-(4.7 × age in years) * Men: 66 + (6.23 × weight in pounds) + (12.7 × height in inches)-(6.8 × age in years)Take that number and multiply by it by the appropriate number below. * 1.2 if you are sedentary (little or no exercise) * 1.375 if you are lightly active (light exercise/sports 1–3 days a week) * 1.55 if you are moderately active (moderate exercise/sports 3–5 days a week) * 1.75 if you are very active (hard exercise/sports 6–7 days a week) * 1.9 if you are extra active (very hard exercise/sports and a physical job or strength training twice a day)3. Average daily calories you consume (don’t lie to yourself). It would be veryinstructive for you to keep a log.4. Desired weight. Set a realistic goal for your weight and match your behaviorto reach it.5. Number of fruits and vegetables you eat a day. Strive for between 7 and 10servings per day to lower your risk for cancer.6. Number of hours you sleep at night. Don’t fool yourself into thinking youneed only a few hours of sleep. Here are the average sleep requirements by ageaccording to the National Sleep Foundation and the National Institute ofNeurological Disorders and Stroke:Age Range Number of Hours of Sleep 1–3 years old 12–14 hours 3–5 years old 11–13hours 5–12 years old 10–11 hours 13–19 years old 9 hours Adults 7–8 hoursSeniors 7–8 hours7. Vitamin D level. Have your physician check your 25-hydroxy vitamin D level,and if it is low, get more sunshine and/or take a vitamin D supplement.Low = < 30Optimal = between 50 and 90High = > 908. Thyroid. Have your doctor check your free T3 and TSH levels to check forhypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism and treat as necessary to normalize.9. C-reactive protein. This is a measure of inflammation that your doctor cancheck with a simple blood test. Elevated inflammation is associated with anumber of diseases and conditions and should prompt you to eliminate bad brainhabits.10. Homocysteine level. This is another marker of inflammation.11. Hg A1C. This test shows your average blood sugar levels over two to threemonths and is used to diagnose diabetes and prediabetes. According to Lab TestsOnline, normal results for a nondiabetic person are in the range of 4 to 6percent. Numbers higher than that may indicate diabetes.12. Fasting blood sugar. This test usually requires that you fast for abouteight hours prior to having your blood drawn. It evaluates your blood sugarlevels solely for the day when you have your blood drawn. Here is what thelevels mean, according to the American Diabetes Association:Normal: 70–99 mg/dLPrediabetes: 100–125 mg/dLDiabetes: 126 mg/dL or higher13. Cholesterol. Make sure your doctor checks your total cholesterol level aswell as your HDL (good cholesterol), LDL (bad cholesterol), and triglycerides (aform of fat). According to the American Heart Association, optimal levels are asfollows:Total cholesterol: less than 200HDL: 60 or higherLDL: less than 100Triglycerides: less than 15014. Blood pressure. Have your doctor check your blood pressure at your yearlyphysical or more often if it is high.

For an expanded and a continually updatedversion of the questionnaire, go online atwww.amenclinics.com/my-brain-health/online-tests-calculators/cyb-questionnaire[http://www.amenclinics.com/my-brain-health/online-tests-calculators/cyb-questionnaire].Think of this tool as the beginning of optimizing the brain-body connection. Formany years Dr. Amen realized that not everyone is able to get a brain scan tocheck on the health of his or her brain. So, in order to bring the life-changinginformation that he has learned through his imaging work to the most people, hehas developed a series of questionnaires to help predict the areas of strengthsand vulnerabilities of the brain.A word of caution is in order. Self-report questionnaires have advantages andlimitations. They are quick and easy to score. On the other hand, people fillingthem out may portray themselves in a way they want to be perceived, resulting inself-report bias. For example, some people exaggerate their experience and markall of the symptoms as frequent, in essence saying, “I’m glad to have a realproblem so that I can get help, be sick, or have an excuse for the troubles Ihave.” Others are in total denial. They do not want to see any personal flawsand they do not check any symptoms as significantly problematic, in essencesaying, “I’m okay. There’s nothing wrong with me. Leave me alone.” Not allself-report bias is intentional. People may genuinely have difficultyrecognizing problems and expressing how they feel. Sometimes family members orfriends are better at evaluating a loved one’s level of functioning than aperson evaluating himself or herself. They may have noticed things that theirloved one hasn’t.Questionnaires of any sort should never be used as the only assessment tool. Usethis one as a catalyst to help you think, ask better questions, and get moreevaluation if needed. Always discuss any recommendations with your personalphysician or health-care provider, especially if you are taking any medications,such as for your heart, blood, or blood pressure, or for anxiety, depression, orpain.AMEN CLINICS ABBREVIATED BRAIN SYSTEMSQUESTIONNAIREPlease rate yourself on each of the symptoms listed below using the followingscale.[images/Amen_9780307463593_epub_039_r1.jpg] * ___1.

More and more, after nearly thirtyyears of being a psychiatrist, I find myself recommending natural treatments. Iam not opposed to medications and I have prescribed them for a long time, but Iwant you to use all of the tools available, especially if they are effective,less expensive, and have fewer side effects.One of the cases that got me interested specifically in natural treatmentsinvolved my own niece. When she was seven, my sister brought her to see me forproblems with moodiness and her temper. I tried her on a number of medicationswithout any success. My sister was calling me upset three times a week. I keptusing stronger and stronger medicines. But medications are not without risks andside effects, and when my niece started to gain weight I stopped them anddecided to try her on a group of natural supplements that I had heard about froma colleague.One day about four months later, I realized that I hadn’t heard anything from mysister in a long time. So I called her and said, “Hey, don’t you love meanymore? How’s my niece?”She said, “Danny, you cannot believe the difference in her. She is so muchbetter. She is calmer, more compliant, and she is getting straight A’s inschool.” The supplements have had long-term benefits for her without any sideeffects.PROS AND CONS OF SUPPLEMENTSOver time I began to wonder why I didn’t start with natural supplements and thenuse medicines if the supplements didn’t work. So, let’s talk about the pros andcons of using natural supplements to help the brain. To start, they are ofteneffective. They have dramatically fewer side effects than most prescriptionmedications and they are significantly less expensive. Plus, you never have totell an insurance company that you have taken them. As awful as it sounds,taking prescription medications can affect your insurability. I know many peoplewho have been denied or made to pay higher rates for insurance because they havetaken certain medications. If there are natural alternatives, they are worthconsidering.Yet natural supplements also have their own set of problems. Even though theytend to be less expensive than medications, they may be more expensive for youbecause they are usually not covered by insurance. Many people are unaware thatnatural supplements can have side effects and need to be thoughtfully used. Justbecause something is natural does not mean it is innocuous. Both arsenic andcyanide are natural, but that doesn’t mean they are good for you. For example,St. John’s wort, one of my favorite natural antidepressants, can cause sunsensitivity and it can also decrease the effectiveness of a number ofmedications such as birth control pills. Oh great! Get depressed, take St.John’s wort from the grocery store, now you are pregnant when you don’t want tobe. That may not be a good thing.One of the major concerns about natural supplements is the lack of qualitycontrol. There is variability and you need to find brands you trust. Anotherdisadvantage is that many people get their advice about supplements from theteenage clerk at the health food store, who may not have the best information.But, even when looking at the problems, the benefits of natural supplements makethem worth considering, especially if you can get thoughtful, research-basedinformation.Every day I personally take a handful of supplements that I know make asignificant difference in my life. They have changed the health of my brain, myenergy, and my lab values. Many physicians say that if you eat a balanced diet,you do not need supplements. I love what Dr. Mark Hyman wrote in his book TheUltraMind Solution: Fix Your Broken Brain by Healing Your Body First. He wrotethat if people “eat wild, fresh, organic, local, non-genetically modified foodgrown in virgin mineral-and nutrient-rich soils that has not been transportedacross vast distances and stored for months before being eaten … and work andlive outside, breathe only fresh unpolluted air, drink only pure, clean water,sleep nine hours a night, move their bodies every day, and are free from chronicstressors and exposure to environmental toxins,” then it is possible that theywill not need supplements. Because we live in a fast-paced society where we pickup food on the fly, skip meals, eat sugar-laden treats, buy processed foods, andeat foods that have been chemically treated, we could all use a little help froma multiple vitamin/mineral supplement.AMEN CLINIC SUPPLEMENTSAt the Amen Clinics we make our own line of supplements that have taken morethan a decade to develop. The reason that I developed this line was I wanted mypatients and my own family to have access to the highest-quality research-basedsupplements available. After I started recommending supplements to my patients,they would go to the supermarket, drugstore, or health food store and have somany choices that they did not know what or how to choose. Plus, there isvariability of quality in the supplements available. Another reason I developedmy own line was that the Amen Clinics see a high population of people who haveattention deficit disorder. I realized if they did not get their supplements asthey walked out the door, they would forget about it or procrastinate and nothave started them by their next appointment.Research shows the therapeutic benefit of using supplements in treating mild tomoderate depression, insomnia, and cognitive impairment. We strongly recommendthat when purchasing a supplement, you consult your health-care practitioner todetermine what dosage would be most effective for you. Our website(www.amenclinics.com [http://www.amenclinics.com]) contains links to thescientific literature on every product, so you, as a consumer, can be fullyinformed on the benefits and risks involved. Please remember that supplementscan have very powerful effects on the body and caution should be used whencombining them with prescription medications.Here is a list of our supplements and why I recommend them. They are problemfocused, evidenced based, and as high quality as possible, while still beingaffordable. * Dr. Amen’s Basic Brain Boost: This supplement contains a high-potency multiple vitamin/mineral supplement, plus nutrients targeted to enhance overall brain function. * Dr. Amen’s Omega Solution: High-quality fish oil that contains a balance between EPA and DHA. * Dr. Amen’s Brain and Memory Recovery Solution: Contains nutrients targeted to enhance memory and to encourage overall brain healing. * Dr. Amen’s Sleep Solution: Proper sleep is a critical component to a brain healthy program. In our formula we use several scientifically based ingredients to enhance restorative sleep. * Dr. Amen’s Craving Solution: This solution is formulated to decrease cravings by balancing blood sugar and decreasing compulsive behaviors. * Dr. Amen’s Serotonin Mood Solution: This formula is designed to enhance serotonin in the brain to promote a healthy mood. * Dr. Amen’s Focus and Energy Solution: This formula was designed to enhance focus and energy. * Dr. Amen’s SAMe Mood Solution: This formula is designed to enhance a positive mood and energy. * Dr. Amen’s GABA Calming Solution: This GABA-based formula was made to help lower anxiety and stress.DR.

Its function is to increaseenergy in the brain, which helps to enhance memory and concentration. ALC hasbeen most studied for its antiaging properties, and research supports the use ofacetyl-l-carnitine to slow the decline in cognition, mood, and daily functionthat occurs with the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.A major cause of aging is deterioration of the energy-producing components ofyour cells, resulting in reduced cellular activity, the accumulation of cellulardebris, and eventually cell death. ALC helps maintain cellular energy metabolismby assisting in the transport of fat through the cell membrane and into themitochondria within the cell, where fats are oxidized to produce the cellularenergy ATP.ALC is found in the mitochondria, where it helps maintain its energetics andlowers the increased oxidative stress associated with aging. ALC is absorbedinto the bloodstream efficiently and is effective at carrying fatty acids acrossthe membrane into the cell, where they are burned as energy and utilizedefficiently by the mitochondria. ALC also guards against oxidative damage. Betaamyloid is a principal component of senile plaques and is thought to be centralin Alzheimer’s disease. ALC appears to exert protective effects againstbeta-amyloid neurotoxicity and oxidative stress. In my practice, I have foundthat it can boost focus in ADD patients.The typical recommended adult dosage is 500 mg twice a day.ALPHA-LIPOIC ACID (ALA)FOR HORMONES (INSULIN), SKIN, CRAVINGS AND WILL POWERAlpha-lipoic acid is made naturally in the body and may protect against celldamage in a variety of conditions. There is strong evidence that alpha-lipoicacid may help treat type 2 diabetes and nerve damage. In a number of studies, ithas also been found to be helpful for skin issues. In 2003, researchers reportedin the British Journal of Dermatology that in a randomized, placebo-controlled,double-blind study, a cream containing 5 percent alpha-lipoic acid demonstratedsignificant improvement in facial skin aging. Alpha-lipoic acid also has verygood scientific evidence that it helps balance blood sugar, which can help withcravings.The typical recommended adult dose is 100 mg twice a day.ASHWAGANDHAFOR FOCUS AND ENERGY, STRESS, ANXIETY, FATIGUE, PASSIONAshwagandha (Withania somnifera, Indian ginseng, Indian winter cherry) is ashrub found in India, Nepal, and Pakistan that is commonly used for its sedatingproperties. The plant itself is an adaptogen, meaning it has the properties thatenable the body to better handle stress, anxiety, and fatigue. It helps torejuvenate and energize the nervous system in addition to increasing physicalendurance and restoring sexual health. It also has antioxidant,anti-inflammatory, and antiaging effects. It is well tolerated and few adverseeffects have been reported. Because ashwagandha may stimulate thyroid functionand it may cause a decrease in blood pressure or lower blood sugar, cautionshould be used when combining it with hypertensive and diabetic medications.We recommend 125 mg twice a day. (In capsule form, one can use 1–6 g daily.)B VITAMINSFOR CRAVING AND WILLPOWER, WEIGHT, STRESS, HEART, FOCUS AND ENERGY, ANXIETY,IMMUNE SYSTEMB vitamins play an integral role in the functioning of the nervous system andhelp the brain synthesize neurotransmitters that affect mood and thinking. Thismakes them especially effective in controlling stress. When you are faced withstressful situations or thoughts, the B vitamins are typically the first to bedepleted. If you have a B-vitamin deficiency, your ability to cope with stressand anxiety is lowered.Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) is a water-soluble vitamin essential in the metabolismof amino acids, glucose, and fatty acids and is important in the production ofneurotransmitters (serotonin, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and GABA). It isrequired by the nervous system and is needed for normal brain function as wellas DNA synthesis. It is hard to find a molecule in our bodies that doesn’t relyon vitamin B6, for its production. It’s involved in more than one hundredcrucial chemical reactions in our bodies.B6 is required for the production of hemoglobin, the compound in red blood cellsthat transports oxygen and carbon dioxide. It increases the amount of oxygencarried in our blood, helping overcome fatigue. It helps maintain a healthyimmune system and calms anxiety. B6 also helps in processing carbohydrates forenergy. Food sources of vitamin B6 include fortified cereals, beans, meat,poultry, fish, and some fruits and vegetables.Vitamin B3 (niacin) was first isolated in the laboratory in the 1930s duringresearch studies done on tobacco; hence niacin or “nicotinic acid.” Niacin isimportant in energy production. It plays an important role in converting fats,proteins, carbohydrates, and starches into energy you can use. It also helps toeliminate toxic chemicals from the body and has been shown to increase the levelof HDL (good cholesterol). Niacin helps to increase blood flow near the skin.Higher doses may cause skin flushing in some people, characterized by a red anditchy face and neck that lasts a few minutes. A form of niacin calledniacinamide causes little or no flushing. Food sources of niacin include meatand dairy products, leafy vegetables, broccoli, tomatoes, avocados, nuts, andwhole grains.One study showed that high homocysteine levels—associated with increased riskfor coronary artery disease, stroke, and dementia—could be treated with folicacid (1 mg), vitamin B12 (400 mcg), and vitamin B6 (10 mg). The typicalrecommended adult dosage is 100 percent of the B vitamins every day. Make sureyou take at least 400 mcg of folate and 500 mcg of B12 per day.CHOLINEFOR MEMORYCholine is a nutrient essential to the structure and function of all cells. Itis a precursor molecule involved in the synthesis of the neurotransmitteracetylcholine, which is important for normal brain function. Those deficient inacetylcholine may develop Alzheimer’s disease and dementia; therefore, cholinesupplementation may be helpful in preventing the onset of these neurologicaldisorders. Choline is also involved in producing the cell membrane phospholipidsphosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin. Considering that the breakdown of cellmembranes leads to neuronal death, replenishing these vital components of themembrane is a proactive step you can take to help prevent Alzheimer’s disease.Food sources of choline include egg yolk, liver, peanuts, fish, milk, andcauliflower. Generally, up to 3 g of choline daily is well tolerated, butpossible side effects may include nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, sweating, andhypotension.The recommended dosage is 300–1,200 mg daily.CHROMIUM PICOLINATEFOR CRAVING AND WILLPOWER, WEIGHT, HORMONES (INSULIN), SOME FORMS OF DEPRESSIONChromium picolinate is a nutritional supplement used to aid the body in theregulation of insulin, which enhances its ability to efficiently metabolizeglucose and fat. There is a strong link between depression, decreased insulinsensitivity, and diabetes. Supplementation with chromium picolinate has beenshown to effectively modulate carbohydrate cravings and appetite, which isbeneficial to managing both diabetes and depression.I often recommend chromium picolinate to help with insulin regulation and tocontrol carb cravings. In a well-designed study, 600 mcg of chromium picolinatewas beneficial for patients with atypical depression (the type of depressionwhere people gain weight, rather than lose weight), especially those withcarbohydrate cravings.The typical recommended adult dosage is 200–600 mcg a day.COCOANOXFOR CRAVING AND WILLPOWER, IMMUNE SYSTEM, AND HEARTCocoanox is a cocoa flavonoid from the cacao bean, which is derived from theTheobroma cacao tree. Cocoa flavonoids contain antioxidant, anti-inflammatory,and immune-stimulating effects. They function as a free-radical scavenger,binding to highly reactive molecules and neutralizing them to prevent celldamage. Cocoa flavonoids have been shown to promote heart health by inhibitingthe oxidation of LDL cholesterol, a step that commonly leads to atherosclerosis.It may lead to increased blood flow to the brain and lower blood pressure. Thepolyphenol profile of cocoanox is 45 percent.The recommended dosage is 8 mg twice a day.DHEAFOR WEIGHT, HORMONES (ADRENAL FATIGUE, TESTOSTERONE), DEPRESSION, PASSIONDHEA is one of the most abundant hormones in the body, second only tocholesterol. DHEA, if low, is an important supplement to counteract adrenalfatigue. According to the NaturalStandard.com [http://NaturalStandard.com]website, there is good scientific evidence supporting the use of DHEA in thetreatment of adrenal insufficiency, depression, and obesity. Supplementing withDHEA has good scientific evidence that it is helpful for weight loss in certainpatients. It is usually well tolerated. Acne and facial hair are common sideeffects, as it increases the body’s testosterone levels. To avoid getting acneor facial hair, many doctors prescribe a metabolite of DHEA called 7-keto-DHEA;it is more expensive, but if acne and facial hair are an issue, it is worth it.The main worry about DHEA by some professionals is that it will partly convertitself into sex hormones such as testosterone and estrogens. This seems to be anobvious advantage for healthy people, looking to combat age-associated hormonaldecline. Unfortunately, this means advising people who are at risk forhormonally dependent cancers (prostate, breast, ovarian) against taking DHEA.For these, 7-keto-DHEA is a good solution.DHEA supplementation is not recommended for children, adolescents, or pregnantor nursing women. Androgenic effects including acne, hair loss, and a deepeningof the voice have been reported in women. If this occurs, discontinue DHEAimmediately.The typical recommended adult dosage is 25–50 mg daily. DHEA is banned by theInternational Olympic Committee, the National Collegiate Athletic Association,the NFL, and other sports organizations for its performance-enhancingproperties.DL-PHENYLALANINEFOR CRAVING AND WILLPOWER, WEIGHT, FOCUS AND ENERGY, SKIN, DEPRESSIONThis is an essential amino acid (cannot be produced by the body) and thus mustbe obtained through the diet. Phenylalanine is used in different biochemicalprocesses to produce the neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine, andepinephrine. There is evidence that phenylalanine can increase mental alertnessand release hormones affecting appetite. There have been reports thatL-phenylalanine can promote high blood pressure in those predisposed tohypertension. Monitoring in the first few months on phenylalanine can detectblood pressure increases in the minority of people who will have this symptom.Phenylalanine can promote the cell division of existing malignant melanomacells. If you have melanoma, or any other form of cancer for that matter, avoidphenylalanine. Persons who have PKU (phenylke-tonuria) cannot use phenylalanine.This includes those born with a genetic deficiency that prevents them frommetabolizing phenylalanine.There is also good scientific evidence that phenylalanine may be helpful forvitiligo, a chronic and relatively common skin disorder that causesdepigmentation in patches of skin. It occurs when the cells responsible for skinpigmentation die or become unable to function.The typical recommended starting dose for adults is 500 mg a day, slowly workingup to 1,500 mg a day.DMAEFOR SKIN, MEMORY, ADDAlso known as deanol, DMAE is an analog of the B vitamin choline. DMAE is aprecursor of the neurotransmitter of acetylcholine, and it has strong effects onthe central nervous system. DMAE is commonly used to increase the capacity ofneurons in the brain and is also thought to have antiaging properties. OftenDMAE is used to treat children with attention deficit disorder (ADD) because itis known to decrease aggression and to increase attention span and memoryabilities.DMAE’s antiaging effects have recently been demonstrated in a placebo-controlledtrial. In this study, a 3 percent DMAE facial gel was applied daily for sixteenweeks. Deanol-infused topical gel was found to be safe and effective in themitigation of forehead wrinkles and fine lines around the eyes. It also improvedlip shape, fullness, and the overall appearance of skin. When treatment stopped,the effects were not reversed. The possible benefits of DMAE in dermatologyinclude anti-inflammatory effects, increases in skin firmness, and improvementsin facial muscle tone. There were few adverse effects compared to placebotreatment, and DMAE use was shown to be safe for up to a year. There are alsoreports that lipofuscin (age spots) can be decreased by DMAE use.The typical recommended adult dosage of DMAE is 300–500 mg daily.FISH OILFOR CRAVINGS AND WILLPOWER, WEIGHT, NUTRITION, SKIN, HORMONES, HEART, FOCUS ANDENERGY, EXERCISE, IMMUNE SYSTEM, SEX, DEPRESSION, BIPOLAR DISORDERFish oil, a great source of omega-3 fatty acids, has been the focus of manyresearch studies. The two most studied fish oils are eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). DHA is a vital component of cell membranes,especially in the brain and retina. DHA is critical for normal brain developmentin fetuses and infants and for the maintenance of normal brain functionthroughout life. DHA appears to be a major factor in the fluidity andflexibility of brain cell membranes, and it could play a major role in how wethink and feel.Fish oil appears to have mood-stabilizing properties when used in the treatmentof bipolar disorder. On SPECT scans, bipolar disorder shows overall increasedactivity in the brain, and EPA and DHA tend to calm down these overactive brainsignals.Fish oil has been found to have many positive effects on health in general aswell. It lowers triglyceride levels and has anti-inflammatory, antiarrhythmic,immune-enhancing, and nerve-cell-stabilizing properties. In addition, it helpsto maintain normal blood flow, as it lowers the body’s ability to form clots.In a landmark study published in the journal Lancet, researchers followed morethan eleven thousand subjects who had suffered a heart attack within threemonths of entering the trial. The trial, which lasted forty-two months, found areduction in risk for cardiac death in the subjects who took fish oil andvitamin E. It is believed that the antiarrhythmic effect of the fish oil wasresponsible for the lowered risk. The study suggests that up to twenty lives perthousand post-heart attack patients could be saved by consuming daily doses ofless than 1 g of EPA and DHA. As I always say, what’s good for your heart isgood for your brain.A number of studies report that taking fish oil and boosting omega-3 fatty acidshelps to raise heart rate variability (HRV), which is good for both brain andheart health. There is also strong scientific evidence that omega-3 fatty acidsmay reduce high cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood, decrease the risk ofsudden cardiac death, and decrease blood pressure. Other studies have shown thatfish oil can help reduce joint pain and stiffness in rheumatoid arthritissufferers.Fish oil is often helpful for your skin. It has anti-inflammatory properties,helps depression, and improves heart function—all things that will help yourskin look younger and more vibrant. It may help ease symptoms associated withhormonal changes, such as during perimenopause and menopause. Fish oil may alsoimprove focus and concentration in people with ADD. For over-focused orobsessive ADD symptoms, include more DHA; for inattentive or low-energy ADDsymptoms, include more EPA. Most people do best on a combination of DHA and EPA.The typical dosage of fish oil is 1–2 g a day for prevention and 4 to 6 g a dayto treat illness. I often recommend 2–4 g a day for adults.FLAXSEED OILFOR HORMONES (PERIMENOPAUSE, MENOPAUSE)Like fish oil, flaxseed oil is a rich source of essential fatty acids and hasbeen found to ease symptoms associated with perimenopause and menopause.Vegetarians may prefer to take flaxseed oil rather than fish oil.The typical recommended adult dosage is 1,000 mg (1 g) up to twice a day (7.2 gof flaxseed oil is equivalent to 1 g of fish oil).GABAFOR CRAVING AND WILLPOWER, WEIGHT, STRESS, ANXIETY, SOME FORMS OF DEPRESSIONGamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an amino acid that also functions as aneurotransmitter in the brain. GABA is reported in the herbal literature to workin much the same way as antianxiety drugs and anticonvulsants. It helpsstabilize nerve cells by decreasing their tendency to fire erratically orexcessively. This means it has a calming effect for people who struggle withtemper, irritability, and anxiety, whether these symptoms relate to anxiety orto temporal lobe disturbance.The typical recommended adult dosage ranges from 100 to 1,500 mg daily foradults and from 50 to 750 mg daily for children. For best effect, GABA should betaken in two or three doses a day.GINKGO BILOBAFOR MEMORY, FOCUS AND ENERGY, PASSIONThe prettiest brains I have seen are those on ginkgo. Ginkgo biloba, from theChinese ginkgo tree, is a powerful antioxidant that is best known for itsability to enhance circulation, memory, and concentration. Consider takingginkgo if you suffer from low energy or decreased concentration.The best-studied form of ginkgo biloba is a special extract called EGB 761,which has been studied in blood-vessel disease, clotting disorders, depression,and Alzheimer’s disease. A 2000 comparison of all the published,placebo-controlled studies longer than six months for ginkgo biloba extract, EGB761, versus Cognex, Aricept, and Exelon showed they all had similar benefits formild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease patients.The most widely publicized U.S. study of ginkgo biloba appeared in the Journalof the American Medical Association in 1997 and was conducted by Dr. P. L. LeBars and colleagues from the New York Institute for Medical Research. EGB 761was used to assess the efficacy and safety in Alzheimer’s disease and vasculardementia. It was a fifty-two-week, multicenter study with patients who had mildto severe symptoms. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with EGB 761(120 mg per day) or placebo. Progress was monitored at twelve, twenty-six, andfifty-two weeks, and 202 patients finished the study. At the end of the study,the authors concluded that EGB was safe and appears capable of stabilizing and,in a substantial number of cases, improving the cognitive performance and thesocial functioning of demented patients for six months to one year. Althoughmodest, the changes induced by EGB were objectively measured and were ofsufficient magnitude to be recognized by the caregivers.Consider taking ginkgo if you are at risk for memory problems or stroke, or ifyou suffer from low energy or decreased concentration. There is a small risk ofbleeding in the body, and the dosages of other blood-thinning agents being takenmay sometimes need to be reduced.The typical adult dose is 60–120 mg twice daily.GLYCINEFOR CRAVING AND WILLPOWER, OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDERGlycine is also an inhibitory neurotransmitter, which means it calms brainactivity. It is an important protein in the brain, and recent studies havedemonstrated its effectiveness in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorderand in reducing pain.The typical adult dose is 500 mg daily.GRAPE SEED EXTRACTFOR SKIN, HEART, MEMORYGrape seed extract comes from grape seeds that are waste products of the wineand grape juice industry. These seeds contain flavonoids and oligomericproanthocyanidins (OPCs). Grape seed extract is known as a powerful antioxidant.Studies have shown that the antioxidant power of OPCs is twenty times greaterthan vitamin E and fifty times greater than vitamin C. Extensive researchsuggests that grape seed extract is beneficial in many areas of health becauseof its antioxidant effect to bond with collagen, promoting youthful skin,elasticity, and flexibility.Other studies have shown that proanthocyanidins help to protect the body fromsun damage; to improve vision; to improve flexibility in joints, arteries, andbody tissues such as the heart; and to improve blood circulation bystrengthening capillaries, arteries, and veins. There is strong scientificevidence it helps with skin edema, venous insufficiency, and varicose veins.It is also often found in products used to enhance brain function. In a 2009study, grape seed extract was found to decrease beta-amyloid plaque formation,the plaques commonly associated with Alzheimer’s disease, by more than one-thirdin the brains of mice with Alzheimer’s disease.The typical adult dose of grape seed extract is 50–100 mg daily.GREEN TEA LEAF EXTRACTFOR FOCUS AND ENERGY, WEIGHT, HEART, ANXIETY, IMMUNE SYSTEMMade from the dried leaves of Camellia sinensis, green tea leaf extract is anevergreen shrub. It has been used as a remedy for many ailments, includinganxiety, cancer prevention, and cardiovascular health, for the prevention ofcold and flu, and for weight loss. The green tea component epigallocatechingallate (EGCG) is a potent free-radical scavenger. Included in the extract isL-theanine, which has been scientifically proven to bring the brain into analpha wave state, which means it induces relaxation and reduces feelings ofanxiety but also increased concentration and energy.The typical adult dose is 200–300 mg of green tea leaf extract capsules dailyfor cancer prevention and possible effects on weight loss. Up to three cups aday of green tea can be consumed for health benefits, but caution should be usedwith pregnant women as green tea does contain caffeine.5-HTPFOR CRAVING AND WILLPOWER, WEIGHT, HORMONES (ADRENAL FATIGUE, PMS, LEPTIN ANDGHRELIN), SLEEP, STRESS, EXERCISE, SEX, INSOMNIA, BRAIN DISORDERS (AGORAPHOBIA,OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER)The amino acid 5-HTP is a building block for serotonin, and using thissupplement is another way to increase cerebral serotonin, which may help controlstress and improve sleep. There are several reasons why 5-HTP may be a bettersleep aid than L-tryptophan. It is a step closer than L-tryptophan in theserotonin production pathway, is more widely available than L-tryptophan, and ismore easily taken up in the brain. Seventy percent of 5-HTP is taken up into thebrain, compared to only 3 percent of L-tryptophan. In addition, 5-HTP is aboutfive to ten times more powerful than L-tryptophan. A number of double-blindstudies have shown 5-HTP is as effective as antidepressant medication. In myexperience, I have found it to be very helpful for some people as a sleep aid.5-HTP boosts serotonin levels in the brain and helps to calm anterior cingulategyrus hyperactivity (greasing the cingulate, if you will, to help with shiftingof attention). For people who can’t seem to turn off their brains at bedtime, orwho have anxious thoughts that keep them awake, 5-HTP may help. The most commonside effect of 5-HTP is an upset stomach, although it is usually very mild. Toavoid an upset stomach, start by taking small doses of 5-HTP and graduallyincrease the dosage as you get used to it. Taking it with food can also help.Because 5-HTP increases serotonin, you should not take it with other medicationsthat increase serotonin, such as St. John’s wort, L-tryptophan, or prescribedantidepressants, unless you are closely supervised by your physician.The typical adult dose of 5-HTP is 50–100 mg two or three times daily with orwithout food.HUPERZINE AFOR MEMORYHuperzine A is a remarkable compound that has been studied in China for nearlytwenty years. It appears to work by increasing the availability ofacetylcholine, a major memory neurotransmitter in the brain, and preventing celldamage from excitotoxins. It has been shown to be effective in improvingpatients who suffered cognitive impairment due to several different types ofdementia, including Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia. Since 1991, ithas been studied as a treatment for the prevention of Alzheimer’s disease andcan be considered safe to use as an alternative or adjunct to medication in thetreatment of AD.Huperzine A has also been found to help learning and memory in teenagers.Researchers divided thirty-four pairs of junior high school students complainingof memory problems into a huperzine A group and a placebo control group. Thehuperzine A group was given two (50 mcg) capsules of huperzine A twice a day,while the placebo group was given two capsules of placebo (starch and lactoseinside) twice a day for four weeks. At the end of the trial, the huperzine Agroup’s memory abilities were significantly superior to those of the placebogroup. Those with seizure disorders, cardiac arrhythmias, asthma, or irritablebowel syndrome should avoid huperzine A. Possible side effects includegastrointestinal effects, dizziness, blurred vision, slow heart rate,arrhythmias, seizures, and increased urination. Use of huperzine A withacetylcholinesterase inhibitors or cholinergic drugs may produce additiveeffects, so caution should be used.The typical adult dose is 50–100 mcg twice a day and 200–400 mcg daily ifcognitive impairment is already noted.INOSITOLFOR CRAVING AND WILLPOWER, WEIGHTInositol is a sugar that is considered part of the B vitamin family. It is anatural chemical found in the brain that is reported to help neurons useserotonin more efficiently. It is important in the maintenance of cellmembranes, the breakdown of fat, hair growth, and the regulation of estrogen andinsulin. Preliminary studies demonstrate its efficacy in treating those withobsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, anxiety, depression, and otherpsychiatric disorders. It also functions to neutralize free-radical activity,thereby protecting neurons and promoting brain health. There is good scientificevidence showing that it also helps with weight loss.The typical adult dose is 500 mg twice a day. Scientific studies have shown12–18 g of inositol daily has beneficial effects in the treatment of depression,anxiety, panic disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder.IODINEFOR WEIGHT, HORMONES (THYROID), FOCUS, AND ENERGYIodine is a mineral found mainly in the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland usesiodine to produce other hormones within the body. Weight gain, fatigue, and anintolerance of cold are symptoms of an iodine deficiency.The typical adult dose is 150 mg a day.KAVA KAVAFOR HORMONES (LEPTIN AND GHRELIN), SLEEP, PANIC DISORDERA search of the medical literature on kava kava supplementation found seventeenstudies for anxiety and insomnia on approximately 1,400 patients. Of theseventeen studies, fifteen were positive. In my experience, kava kava can helpwith sleep and can have a calming effect on anxiety and irritability. It canalso help with weight loss, by balancing the appetite hormones leptin andghrelin, which are regulated during sleep.Several years ago I went through a painful time of grief. For the first time inmy life, I experienced panic attacks and had trouble sleeping. Of all thesupplements I tried, kava kava helped me the most. Kava kava is recommended bysome alternative-medicine practitioners to promote healthy sleep, calm anxiety,and reduce the physical and emotional effects of stress. Kava kava is thought towork by enhancing the production of GABA in the brain. It comes from the root ofa South Pacific pepper tree and is widely used as a social and ceremonial drinkin the Pacific Islands. The herb is so widely used that it is thought to be, inpart, responsible for the laid-back island lifestyle.Kava kava works quickly and is well suited for short-term sleeping problems,such as when you can’t sleep the night before a big test or presentation. It isassociated with minimal morning-after effects, leaving people feeling rested andalert after waking. My patients have reported the following relief after takingkava kava: being relaxed without feeling drugged, less muscle tension, a senseof peace and contentment, increased sociability, and an initial alertnessfollowed by a feeling of drowsiness.It is not the type of supplement, like fish oil, that you should take every day.At most use it for three weeks, then take a week off. Kava kava use on a dailybasis may harm the liver. Kava kava has known adverse interactions with alcohol,barbiturates, MAO inhibitor antidepressants, benzodiazepines, othertranquilizers and sleeping pills, anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents includingaspirin, antipsychotics, drugs used for treating Parkinson’s disease, and drugsthat suppress the central nervous system. Kava kava can exacerbate Parkinson’sdisease and increase muscle weakness and twitching. Women who are pregnant orbreastfeeding should not take kava kava. Do not take kava kava if you are goingto drive.The typical adult dose is 150–300 mg one to three times daily as needed foranxiety or nervousness, or just at bedtime for sleep, standardized to contain 30to 70 percent kavalactones. Most clinical trials have used the German kavaextract WS 1490.L-GLUTAMINEFOR CRAVING AND WILLPOWERL-glutamine is an amino acid that is important in the synthesis of theexcitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and the inhibitor neurotransmitter GABA.It is also a nutrient for the brain, as it is used for energy if the brain doesnot have enough glucose to function. Supplemental glutamine has been used in thetreatment of ADD, anxiety, and depression. It has been shown to decreasecarbohydrate cravings.The typical adult dose is 500 mg three to four times a day.L-THEANINEFOR CRAVING AND WILLPOWER, STRESS, FOCUS AND ENERGY, ANXIETY, SOME FORMS OFDEPRESSIONL-theanine is an amino acid mainly found naturally in the green tea plant. Ithas been shown to penetrate the brain and produce significant increases in theneurotransmitters serotonin and/or dopamine concentrations. These findings ledto recent studies investigating the possibility that L-theanine might inducerelaxation and relieve emotional stress. When researchers tested the effects ofL-theanine on a small group of volunteers, they found that it resulted insignificantly increased production of alpha brain-wave activity, which theyviewed as an index of increased relaxation. Pregnant women and nursing mothersshould avoid L-theanine supplements.The typical adult dose is between 50 and 200 mg, as necessary. L-theanine isavailable in some green tea preparations. The amino acid constitutes between 1percent and 2 percent of the dry weight of green tea leaves.L-TRYPTOPHANFOR CRAVING AND WILLPOWER, WEIGHT, HORMONES (LEPTIN AND GHRELIN), SLEEP,EXERCISEL-tryptophan is an amino acid building block for serotonin, and takingL-tryptophan supplements increases cerebral serotonin. Serotonin is aneurotransmitter that plays an important role in sleep as well as a number ofother functions. L-tryptophan is a naturally occurring amino acid found in milk,meat, and eggs. It is very helpful for some patients in improving sleep,decreasing aggressiveness, and stabilizing mood. The high doses of L-tryptophanfound in turkey may explain why we get sleepy after devouring a big Thanksgivingmeal.L-tryptophan was taken off the market more than a decade ago because acontaminated batch from one manufacturer caused a rare blood disease and anumber of deaths. L-tryptophan itself actually had nothing to do with thesedeaths. L-tryptophan was reapproved by the Food and Drug Administration severalyears ago and is currently available again. One of the problems with dietaryL-tryptophan is that a significant portion of it does not enter the brain, butrather is used to make proteins and vitamin B3. This necessitates taking largeamounts of tryptophan. Scientific evidence also shows that L-tryptophan can helppeople lose weight.The typical adult dose is 1,000–3,000 mg taken at bedtime.L-TYROSINEFOR CRAVING AND WILLPOWER, WEIGHT, FOCUS AND ENERGYThis amino acid is important in the synthesis of brain neurotransmitters. It isthe precursor to the brain neurotransmitters (epinephrine, norepinephrine, anddopamine), which are critical for balancing mood and energy. It is also helpfulin the process of producing thyroid hormones, which are important in metabolismand energy production. A sluggish thyroid can have significant effects on brainhealth. The beneficial effect of tyrosine supplementation is that an efficientlyfunctioning thyroid will not only result in a better-functioning brain, but willalso help in weight loss.Tyrosine supplementation has been shown to improve cognitive performance underperiods of stress and fatigue. Stress tends to deplete the neurotransmitternorepinephrine, and tyrosine is the amino acid building block to replenish it.Tyrosine should not be taken with MAO and tricyclic antidepressants, when acancerous melanoma is present, with a history of cancerous melanoma, or withelevated blood pressure.The typical adult dose is 500–1,500 mg two to three times a day. It is besttaken on an empty stomach with water or juice.MAGNESIUMFOR CRAVING AND WILLPOWER, WEIGHT, FOCUS AND ENERGY, ANXIETY, PANIC DISORDERMagnesium, needed for more than three hundred biochemical reactions in the body,is a mineral that is essential to good health. It has been shown to be helpfulin calming anxiety and balancing the brain’s pleasure centers, which can helpreduce cravings. Magnesium is also important in energy production and assists incalcium and potassium uptake in the body. A deficiency in magnesium can lead toirritability and nervousness. Supplementing the body with magnesium can helpwith mood and muscle weakness. In combination with vitamin B6, it has been shownto reduce the hyperactivity seen in children with ADD.The typical adult dose is 400–1,000 mg daily, divided into three doses. It isbest to take with calcium, as these minerals work synergistically. Magnesium isusually half of your total calcium intake.MELATONINFOR HORMONES (FEMALE HORMONES, LEPTIN AND GHRELIN), SLEEPMelatonin is a hormone made in the brain that helps regulate other hormones andmaintains the body’s sleep cycle. Darkness stimulates the production ofmelatonin, while light decreases its activity. Exposure to too much light in theevening or too little light during the day can disrupt the production ofmelatonin. Jet lag, shift work, and poor vision are some of the conditions thatcan disrupt melatonin production. Some researchers think that being exposed tolow-frequency electromagnetic fields (from common household appliances) maydisrupt melatonin levels.Research suggests that taking melatonin may help sleep patterns in shift workersor those with poor vision. One study found that melatonin helps prevent jet lag,particularly in people who cross five or more time zones. Melatonin has beenfound to be more effective than placebo in decreasing the time required to fallasleep, increasing the number of hours sleeping, and improving alertness.Melatonin may be helpful for children with learning disabilities who suffer frominsomnia. And although taking melatonin does not help the primary symptoms ofADD, it does seem to help the sleep disturbances common in these children.One study of postmenopausal women found that melatonin improved depression andanxiety. Studies of people with depression and panic disorder have shown lowlevels of melatonin. People who suffer winter blues or seasonal affectivedisorder (SAD) also have lower-than-normal melatonin levels. Melatonin causes asurge in the neurotransmitter serotonin, which may help explain why it ishelpful in both sleep and depression.Melatonin is also involved in the production of female hormones and influencesmenstrual cycles. Researchers also consider melatonin levels to be involved inaging. Melatonin levels are highest when we are children and diminish with age.The lower levels of melatonin may help explain why older adults tend to get lesssleep.Melatonin is a strong antioxidant, and there is some evidence that it may helpstrengthen the immune system. It has also been shown to have powerfulneuroprotective effects both as an antioxidant and in the prevention of plaqueformation as observed in Alzheimer’s disease. The benefit to taking melatonin asopposed to other sleep aids is that it is both safe and nonaddictive.The best approach for dosing melatonin is to begin with very low doses. Inchildren, start with 0.3 mg a day and raise it slowly. In adults, start with 1mg an hour before bedtime. You can increase it to 6 mg.MULTIVITAMINSFOR NUTRITION, SKIN, IMMUNE SYSTEMI recommend taking a daily multiple vitamin/ mineral complex to all of mypatients. Studies have reported that they help prevent chronic illness. TheAmerican Medical Association recommends a daily vitamin for everybody because ithelps prevent chronic illness. In addition, people with weight-management issuesoften are not eating healthful diets and have vitamin and nutrient deficiencies.N-ACETYL-CYSTEINEFOR CRAVING AND WILLPOWERNAC is an amino acid that is needed to produce glutathione, a very powerfulantioxidant. NAC binds to and removes dangerous toxic elements within the cells,making it a molecule critical to brain health. NAC is used by the liver and thelymphocytes to detoxify chemicals and other poisons. In addition, NAC is avasodilator, working to relax blood vessels and allow for more oxygen deliverywithin the body. Recently, NAC has been studied as a treatment for drugaddiction, as it functions to restore levels of the excitatory neurotransmitterglutamate in the reward center of the brain. Studies have shown that NACsupplementation can be effective in the treatment of OCD, depression in thosewith bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. New scientific research supports theefficacy of NAC for the reduction of cocaine cravings. It may also be helpful inreducing food cravings.The typical adult dose is 600–1,200 mg twice a day.PANAX GINSENGFOR WEIGHT, STRESS, MEMORY, EXERCISE, HORMONES (INSULIN), FOCUS AND ENERGY,ANTIAGING, IMMUNE SYSTEM, PASSIONThis is considered to be a rejuvenation herb. Research supports that it is anantioxidant that protects cells from the free-radical damage associated withaging as well as boosting energy levels. Ginseng also has research suggesting ithelps to increase endurance and stamina and improve the immune system.Panax ginseng is a plant with fleshy roots that typically grows in coolerclimates—such as the northern hemisphere of eastern Asia, Korea, and Russia—andis used in the treatment of weakness and fatigue. The active components areginsenosides (2.6 to 6.6 percent of the dry weight of the root), which alsoregulate blood glucose and blood pressure. Ginsenosides are unique to Panaxspecies and are believed to be responsible for its antioxidant,anti-inflammatory, and immunostimulant properties. Ginsenosides have also beenfound to reduce food intake, fat composition, and serum leptin levels, whichhelps with weight loss. Panax ginseng is considered an adaptogen, meaning thatit aids the body’s ability to handle stress. It has also been shown to improvecognitive performance in healthy adults and those with dementia, and it has beenshown to improve physical performance during endurance exercise. Clinicalstudies support the use of Panax ginseng as a way to maintain blood glucose andinsulin levels in type 2 diabetes and as a treatment for erectile dysfunction.Yet it is most widely known as a stimulant that promotes energy, improvescirculation, and speeds recovery after illness.Panax ginseng is well tolerated, but caution should be used when taking warfarin(Coumadin), as its effects can be additive. Ginseng may cause hypoglycemicactivity, so caution should be used when taking it with insulin or medicationsfor hypoglycemia. Side effects include insomnia, nausea, diarrhea, euphoria,headaches, and issues with regulating blood pressure.The typical adult dose is 200 mg a day of the standardized extract, containing 4to 7 percent of ginsenosides.PHOSPHATIDYLSERINE (PS)FOR WEIGHT, HORMONES (ADRENAL FATIGUE), MEMORYPhosphatidylserine (PS) is a naturally occurring nutrient that is found in foodssuch as fish, green leafy vegetables, soy products, and rice. PS is a componentof cell membranes. As we age, these membranes change in composition. There arereports of the potential of PS to help improve age-related declines in memory,learning, verbal skills, and concentration. PS is essential to brain health bymaintaining neurons and neuronal networks so that the brain can continue to formand retain memories.PET studies of patients who have taken PS show that it produces a generalincrease in metabolic activity in the brain. In the largest multicenter study todate of phosphatidylserine and Alzheimer’s disease, 142 subjects aged forty toeighty were given 200 mg of phosphatidylserine per day or placebo over athree-month period. Those treated with phosphatidylserine exhibited improvementon several items on the scales normally used to assess Alzheimer’s status. Thedifferences between placebo and experimental groups were small but statisticallysignificant.The types of symptoms that improved in placebo-controlled studies of cognitiveimpairment or dementia include loss of interest, reduced activities, socialisolation, anxiety, memory, concentration, and recall. Milder stages ofimpairment tend to respond to PS better than more severe stages. With regard todepression in elderly individuals, Dr. M. Maggioni and colleagues studied theeffects of oral PS (300 mg/day) versus placebo and noted significantimprovements in mood, memory, and motivation after thirty days of PS treatment.Phosphatidylserine can also be helpful for adrenal fatigue.The typical adult dose is 100–300 mg a day.PRIMROSE OILFOR HORMONES (PERIMENOPAUSE, MENOPAUSE)Evening primrose is a native North American plant that is also found in otherareas of the world. Primrose oil contains gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), an omega-6essential fatty acid that may alleviate perimenopausal and menopausal symptoms.The typical adult dose is 1,000 mg (1 g) up to three times daily.RESVERATROLFOR CRAVING AND WILLPOWER, WEIGHT, HEART, IMMUNE SYSTEM, ANTICANCER PROPERTIESResveratrol is a phytoalexin, or a chemical that is produced by plants inresponse to injury or infection. Resveratrol has been shown to have verypowerful anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and cardioprotective effects and may beimportant in extending life span. Resveratrol can be found in red wine, grapeskins, chocolate, peanuts, and mulberries. Red wine contains more resveratrolthan white wine because it is made from the grape skins, which contain 50–100mcg resveratrol, while white wine is made only from the juice of the grape,which contains no resveratrol. Scientific studies show that mice given theequivalent of 20 mg of resveratrol per day had significant changes in genesinvolved in the antiaging process. In addition, it has been shown to reduceamyloid plaque formation, which suggests that resveratrol may be a powerful allyin the fight against Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. Side effects ofresveratrol include diarrhea, anxiety, and thinning of the blood. Pregnant womenand nursing mothers should avoid the use of resveratrol supplements. Cautionshould be used when taking it with anticoagulant, antihypertensive, andantidiabetic medication.Recommended dosage is 15 mg twice a day. One glass of red wine is the equivalentof 600–700 mcg, so supplementation is advised in the long run to obtain the mostbrain-healthy effect. Resveratrol lasts nine hours in the body, so a small dosetaken twice a day will maintain the beneficial effects of this powerfulantioxidant.RHODIOLAFOR FOCUS AND ENERGY, STRESS, IMMUNE SYSTEM, DEPRESSION, PASSIONRhodiola is an herb that is grown at high altitudes in Asia and Europe.Traditionally, it has been used to fight fatigue, improve memory, and increaseattention span. Research has found that it does indeed help prevent fatigue. Inaddition, scientific evidence points to an ability to fuel sexual energy, boostimmunity, and ease depression.The typical adult dose is 200–600 mg daily for the treatment of fatigue anddepression, and it is best taken on an empty stomach. Rhodiola should be takenearly in the day, as it may interfere with sleep and it should not be used inindividuals with bipolar disorder or those taking hypertensive or hypoglycemicmedications.SAGEFOR MEMORYNaturalStandard.com [http://NaturalStandard.com] gives the common herb sage itshighest “A level” scientific evidence rating for cognitive improvement. It citesresearch that has demonstrated that sage can improve memory, confirmingcenturies-old theories. In the seventeenth century, noted herbalist NicholasCulpeper wrote that the herb sage could “heal” the memory while “warming andquickening the senses.”Culpeper wasn’t the only herbalist (and certainly not the first) to recognizethat sage can help improve memory. Now—centuries later—scientists believe theyknow why. An enzyme called acetylcholinesterase (AChE) breaks down a chemicalcalled acetylcholine, which is typically deficient in Alzheimer’s patients.Researchers from the Medical Plant Research Centre (MPRC) at the Universities ofNewcastle and Northumbria in the United Kingdom have shown that sage inhibitsAChE.A study conducted by researchers at MPRC demonstrates the possible results ofinhibiting AChE. Researchers gave forty-four subjects either sage oil capsulesor placebo capsules containing sunflower oil and then conducted word-recalltests. The group that received sage oil turned in significantly better testresults than subjects who took placebo. However, researchers say that furthertests are needed to fully determine just how far-reaching sage’s effect onmemory may be.The typical adult dose for improved mood, alertness, and cognitive performanceis 300–600 mg daily of dried sage leaf capsules. Sage can also be used as anessential oil in doses of 25–50 mcL (microliters). Sage should be usedcautiously in those with hypertension or those who have seizure disorders.SAMEFOR CRAVING AND WILLPOWER, WEIGHT, FOCUS AND ENERGY, SLEEP, ADD, PASSIONS-adenosyl-methionine (SAMe) is involved in the production of severalneurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, epinephrine) and helps the brain tofunction properly. The brain normally manufactures all the SAMe it needs fromthe amino acid methionine. When a person is depressed, the synthesis of SAMefrom methionine is impaired. People who have a certain type of ADD that islinked with depression may experience an improvement in focus when taking SAMe.SAMe is also involved in the production of the sleep hormone melatonin and hasbeen found to improve sleep quality. It has also been found to suppress appetiteand reduce joint inflammation and pain.The typical adult dose is 200–400 mg two to four times a day.SATIEREALFOR CRAVING AND WILLPOWER, WEIGHT, SLEEP, STRESS, DEPRESSION, AND MOODSatiereal is a patented product made from the extract of saffron (Crocussativus) and has been shown to have powerful antidepressant effects. Saffron isgrown in Iran, Greece, Spain, and Italy and traditionally has been used to easethe digestion of spicy food, to soothe an irritated stomach, and to treatdepression. The active ingredients of satiereal include safranal, picrocrocine,and crocine, which work synergistically to help with satiety and to help curbthe compulsive desire to eat. Like SSRIs, satiereal works by preventing there-uptake of serotonin, thereby improving mood and well-being. It differs inthat a small amount is potent, and it has been shown to be a successfulweight-loss aid by reducing appetite and sugar cravings. In clinical trials,satiereal has been shown to be well tolerated with few adverse side effects. Therecommended dosage is 100 mg twice a day.SELENIUMFOR HORMONES (THYROID)Selenium is a mineral found in some foods, water, and soil. Selenium hasantioxidant properties that help the body prevent damage from free radicals.This mineral regulates thyroid function, strengthens the immune system, andhelps prevent heart disease.The typical adult dose is 80–200 mcg.ST. JOHN’S WORTFOR CRAVING AND WILLPOWER, WEIGHT, STRESS, AGORAPHOBIA, DEPRESSION,OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDERSaint John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) is a plant located in the subtropicalregions of North America, Europe, Asia, India, and China and has been used forcenturies in the treatment of mood disorders and depression. The biologicallyactive ingredient in Saint John’s wort is hypericin, which functions to inhibitthe reuptake of various neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, GABA,and glutamate. The mechanism of action for the supplement St. John’s wort issimilar to that found in popular antidepressants, including Prozac, Paxil, andZoloft. These drugs and the herb work to maintain elevated levels of serotonin,which has a mood-enhancing effect.Stress depletes the brain of serotonin. St. John’s wort combats that and mayactually be the most potent of all the supplements at increasing serotoninavailability in the brain. I have seen dramatic improvement for many of mypatients on St. John’s wort and have SPECT scan studies of patients before andafter treatment with St. John’s wort that document its effectiveness. St. John’swort decreases anterior cingulate gyrus hyperactivity (which can make you rigidand stressed out when things don’t go your way) for many patients and decreasesmoodiness.An unfortunate side effect is that it can also decrease prefrontal cortexactivity. One of the women in the study said, “I’m happier, but I’m dingier.” Wealso don’t start people with temporal lobe symptoms (anger, epilepsy, memory,hallucinations, and so on) on St. John’s wort without first stabilizing thetemporal lobes with anticonvulsant medication. An important note is that it hasbeen found to decrease the effectiveness of other drugs, including birth controlpills.The typical dose is 300 mg a day for children, 300 mg twice a day for teens, and600 mg in the morning and 300 mg at night for adults. Sometimes, the dose may beslowly increased to 1,800 mg for adults. It is important that the preparation ofSt. John’s wort contains 0.3 percent hypericin, one of the active ingredients ofSt. John’s wort.VALERIANFOR HORMONES (LEPTIN AND GHRELIN), SLEEP, STRESSMany patients find valerian to be remarkably helpful as a sleeping aid andstress-relief aid. Valerian is a well-recognized herb with antianxietyproperties that is used as a mild tranquilizer, sedative, and muscle relaxant.There are about 150 species of valerian widely distributed in temperate regionsof the world. The active ingredient is found in a foul-smelling oil produced inthe root of the plant. Throughout history, people have turned to valerian forits unique properties. The ancient Roman physician Galen wrote about the virtuesof valerian; in the Middle Ages, medical literature used the term “All Heal” todescribe the herb; and valerian has long been a staple of Chinese and Indianmedicine. In the United States, valerian was commonly used prior to thedevelopment of modern pharmaceuticals.This centuries-old treatment for insomnia has also been helpful for symptoms ofnervousness, stress, and pain. And it has been found to decrease seizurefrequency in epileptic patients. Studies have shown valerian to be helpful formany types of anxiety disorders and for people with performance anxiety andthose who get stressed in daily situations like traffic. Valerian appears towork by enhancing the activity of the calming neurotransmitter, GABA.Unlike prescription tranquilizers, valerian has a much lower potential foraddiction and has been used to help people who are trying to decrease their useof prescription tranquilizers or sleeping pills. (Anyone using prescriptionsleeping pills or tranquilizers should decrease or stop their use only under thesupervision of a physician.) It may take two to three weeks to start feeling theeffects of valerian, so it isn’t the best sleep aid for short-term use, such aswhen you have jet lag. It is better suited for long-term use and has been foundto improve deep sleep, which leaves you feeling more rested in the morning.Valerian should not be taken in combination with alcohol, barbiturates, orbenzodiazepines, and it is not recommended for use during pregnancy orbreastfeeding.Since valerian promotes sleep, it may also help balance leptin and ghrelin, theappetite hormones that are regulated during sleep.Valerian is available in capsules, tablets, liquids, tinctures, extracts, andteas. Most extracts are standardized to 0.8 percent valeric acids. The typicalrecommended adult dosage is 150 to 450 mg in capsules or teas. For children therecommended dosage is 50–100 mg.VINPOCETINEFOR MEMORYVinpocetine has been shown in a number of studies to help memory, especially forpeople who are at risk for heart disease or strokes. It also helps lower highhomocysteine levels, which are dangerous to your heart and brain. Vinpocetine isderived from an extract of the common periwinkle plant (Vinca minor) and is usedin Europe, Japan, and Mexico as a pharmaceutical agent for the treatment ofblood-vessel disease in the brain and cognitive disorders. In the United States,it is available as a dietary supplement. It is sometimes called a nootropic,meaning cognition enhancer, from the Greek noos for “mind.” Vinpocetineselectively widens arteries and capillaries, increasing blood flow to the brain.It also combats accumulation of platelets in the blood, improving circulation.Because of these properties, vinpocetine was first used in the treatment ofcerebrovascular disorders and acute memory loss due to late-life dementia. Butit also has a beneficial effect upon memory problems associated with normalaging.There is evidence that vinpocetine may be useful for a wide variety of brainproblems. A 1976 study found that vinpocetine immediately increased circulationin fifty people with abnormal blood flow. After one month of taking moderatedoses of vinpocetine, patients showed improvement on memorization tests. After aprolonged period of vinpocetine treatment, cognitive impairment diminishedsignificantly or disappeared altogether in many of the patients. A 1987 study ofelderly patients with chronic cerebral dysfunction found that patients who tookvinpocetine performed better on psychological evaluations after the ninety-daytrial period than did those who received a placebo.More recent studies have shown that vinpocetine reduces neural damage andprotects against oxidative damage from harmful beta-amyloid buildup. In amulticenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study lasting sixteen weeks, 203patients described as having mild to moderate memory problems, including primarydementia, were treated with varying doses of vinpocetine or placebo. Significantimprovement was achieved in the vinpocetine-treated group as measured by “globalimprovement” and cognitive performance scales. Three 10 mg doses daily were aseffective as or more effective than three 20 mg doses daily. Similarly goodresults were found in another double-blind clinical trial testing vinpocetineversus placebo in elderly patients with blood vessel and central nervous systemdegenerative disorders. Some preliminary research suggests that vinpocetine mayalso have some protective effects in both sight and hearing.Reported adverse reactions include nausea, dizziness, insomnia, drowsiness, drymouth, transient hypotension, transient fast heart rate, pressure headaches, andfacial flushing. Slight reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressurewith prolonged use of vinpocetine have been reported, as well as slightreductions in blood sugar levels.The typical adult dose is 10 mg a day.VITAMIN DFOR NUTRITION, WEIGHT, SKIN, HEART, MEMORY, IMMUNE SYSTEM, DEPRESSION, BIPOLARDISORDERVitamin D, also known as the sunshine vitamin, is an essential vitamin for brainhealth, mood, memory, and skin. While classified as a vitamin, it is a steroidhormone vital to health. Low levels of vitamin D have been implicated indepression, bipolar disorder, and memory problems, including Alzheimer’sdisease. One study in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease found that vitamin D3,a form of vitamin D, may stimulate the immune system to rid the brain of betaamyloid, an abnormal protein that is believed to be a major cause of Alzheimer’sdisease. Vitamin D activates receptors on neurons in regions important in theregulation of behavior, and it protects the brain by acting in an antioxidantand anti-inflammatory capacity. Other benefits of vitamin D supplementationinclude reducing the risk of bone diseases and fractures, improved muscularfunction, improved metabolic and cardiovascular function, and increasedprotection from diabetes and cancer. Adequate vitamin D levels are essential forensuring normal calcium absorption and maintenance of healthy calcium plasmalevels. Scientists now feel that supplementation with vitamin D is critical tohelping maintain healthy bone remodeling as we age. There is also strongscientific evidence that vitamin D can be helpful for psoriasis, and vitamin D3appears to control skin cell growth.Unfortunately, vitamin D deficiencies are becoming more and more common, in partbecause we are spending more time indoors and using more sunscreen. Americansover the age of fifty, those living at higher latitudes, those who are obese,and children and teens are at increased risk for vitamin D deficiency. In fact,seven out of ten kids are lacking in the nutrient. A pair of studies in thejournal Pediatrics found that 7.6 million kids had a vitamin D deficiency and50.8 million had insufficient amounts.The American Academy of Pediatrics recently increased their recommendations forchildren to 400 IUs a day. I recommend that children and adults get theirvitamin D levels checked to see what their specific needs should be. My levelswere low when they were tested, and I live in Southern California and am anactive person. I found that I need to take 5,000 IUs a day. The blood test iscalled 25-hydroxy vitamin D level. The current scientific literature recognizesthat 400 IU daily is well below the physiological needs of most individuals andsuggests 2,000 IU of vitamin D daily for the prevention of cancer, heartdisease, and osteoporosis.ZINCFOR FOCUS AND ENERGY, ADD, PASSIONZinc is an essential mineral found in many foods, such as red meat, poultry,beans, nuts, and whole grains. Zinc activates more than one hundred differentenzymes in the body, and daily supplementation is important because the bodydoes not store extra zinc. It is involved in numerous bodily processes,including cell division, prostate health, immune function, and wound healing.Zinc deficiency has been linked to mental lethargy. There is good scientificevidence that it may be helpful for children with hyperactivity and impulsivity.Zinc also helps produce testosterone and dopamine for a healthy libido and hasbeen effective in the treatment of eczema and psoriasis, so it is a supplementimportant in the maintenance of beautiful skin.The typical adult dosage is 25–80 mg daily, not to exceed 100 mg. Zinc is besttaken with food or juice, as it may result in a feeling of nausea on an emptystomach."},{"pageContent":"NOTE ON REFERENCES AND FURTHER READINGThe information in Change Your Brain, Change Your Body is based on more than sixhundred sources, including scientific studies, books, interviews with medicalexperts, statistics from government agencies and health organizations, and otherreliable resources.
