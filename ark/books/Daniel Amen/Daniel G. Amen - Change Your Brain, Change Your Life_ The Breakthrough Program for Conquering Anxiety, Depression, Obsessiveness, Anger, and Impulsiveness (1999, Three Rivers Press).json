We have seen adults, teenagers, and children as young as three years old who suffered with depression, anxiety problems, aggression, attention deficit disorder, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-trau- matic stress disorder. Using the new imaging technology, these patients and their families were able to “see” the underlying brain prob- lems that were driving their emotional and behavioral symptoms. Rather than blame themselves for having a weak character or a “menta l i l l ness,” t hey were able to more clea rly"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"understand the origins of their struggles and get the right help with more targeted, more effective treatment. All of us at the clinic have been so incredibly gratifi ed to fi nd that the book has had such a positive impact on people’s lives. Three experi- ences from our clinic highlight how helpful this book has already been to many, many people, and how it might help you as well. In early February 1999, I was sitting at my imaging computer screen reading brain scans when Dr. George Lewis, one of the psychia- trists in my clinic, brought in a patient who had fl own in from the Midwest to meet me. The man, in his late fi fties, introduced him- self to me with tears in his eyes. On January 14, he’d decided to kill himself. He’d been feeling very depressed, unable to get along with anyone, and hobbled by a terrible tem- per. And he had no hope that things would change, despite seeing a psychiatrist and tak- ing medication. He was lying in bed contemplating the best way to commit sui- cide when by coincidence his girlfriend turned on the To d ay show while I happened to be on, discussing my book. He watched me explain the brain scans of a person diag- xii Introduction to the Paperback Edition"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"nosed with depression and anger. He heard me say that there was hope for people who suffered from these problems, that many “psychological problems” are in reality brain problems, and that through new imaging techniques we can see many of them and create more targeted and effective treat- ments. This patient went out and bought the book, did the checklists, and discovered that he probably had a left temporal lobe problem (which is where his anger came from), a deep limbic system problem (causing his depres- sion), and a prefrontal cortex problem (which gave him attentional and impulse control problems). He decided to come to my clinic on his own. As part of our evaluation we ordered a brain SPECT study. He had predicted his own scan perfectly. He had very poor activity in his left temporal lobe, too much activity in his deep limbic system, and poor prefrontal cortex activity. We often see this scan in patients who have clinical symptoms of depression, anger, suicidal behavior, and attentional problems. Dr. Lewis put him on a combination of medi- cations and followed him closely over the telephone. Within three weeks, this man had Introduction to the Paperback Edition xiii"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"dramatically improved. He no longer had sui- cidal thoughts, his mood was more positive, and his mind felt sharper and more focused. He told Dr. Lewis that we had saved his life. In early March we heard from an Israeli woman who had bought the book in the United States while on holiday. She’d suffered her whole life from angry outbursts, cyclic depression, and attention problems. After reading the book and completing the check- lists, she predicted she had a left temporal lobe problem, a limbic problem, and a prefrontal cortex problem. Doctors in Israel had told her to get counseling, and she’d already spent vast amounts of money with no benefi t. She came to our clinic and saw Dr. Brian Goldman, who ordered a SPECT study to evaluate her brain function. Her scan was very close to what she predicted. Dr. Goldman started her on a med- ication regimen, along with other brain-based strategies described in this book. He then communicated with her regularly on the tele- phone and through e-mail. Within weeks, she reported feeling calmer, in better control of her temper, and more focused. All the coun- seling in the world would do her little good until her brain worked right. xiv Introduction to the Paperback Edition"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" Several months later I was lecturing at a teachers conference in the Northwest. A woman came up to me after one of my ses- sions and told me how much she’d enjoyed my book. She said that before she’d read it, she hadn’t really believed in mental illness. She thought that people who suffered from depression, anxiety, or obsessions were just weak-willed. The book allowed her to see people who suffer from these problems in a different light. Shortly after she fi nished the book, her daughter called home from col- lege. The daughter said that she was feeling depressed and had suicidal thoughts. Before she had read the book, the mother told me, she would have told her daughter to snap out of it, to go to church and pray harder. Having read the book, she suspected that her daughter had a cingulate problem and helped her fi nd a physician to evaluate her. Her daughter was diagnosed with obsessive- compulsive disorder, placed on medication, and made “a 180 degree” improvement. The mother told me she was grateful for the new information that helped her daughter heal and kept her from being mistreated out of ignorance. Introduction to the Paperback Edition xv"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" When I fi rst started talking about our brain imaging work in scientific circles, we were severely criticized by many people. “What do you mean, you can see mental illness? You must be crazy if you think that a functional brain imaging study has anything to say about family dynamics!” Yet, the critics are being quieted. What I talk about in this book works. In 1998 I published fi ve peer-reviewed profes- sional medical articles on brain SPECT imaging in psychiatry. I was honored by being asked to coauthor the chapter on functional brain imaging in the Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry , one of the most respected psychiat- ric texts in the world. In the spring of 1999, I was invited by the nuclear medicine commu- nity to give lectures at their meetings. I felt very honored when Dr. Dennis Patton, the historian for the Society of Nuclear Medicine, introduced me at one of these meetings by saying that I was a pioneer in the brain imag- ing fi eld and people would read my work for years to come. There is no question in my mind that the most gratifying part of our research and clini- cal work is seeing people become more effective, more loving, and more capable by xvi Introduction to the Paperback Edition"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"gaining more access to their own brain func- tion.

It is the hardware of your very essence as a human being. You cannot be who you really want to be unless your brain works right. How your brain works determines how happy you are, how effective you feel, and how well you inter- act with others. Your brain patterns help you (or hurt you) with your marriage, parenting skills, work, and religious beliefs, along with your experiences of pleasure and pain. If you are anxious, depressed, obsessive-compulsive, prone to anger, or easily distracted, you prob- ably believe these problems are “all in your"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"head.” In other words, you believe your prob- lem is purely psychological. However, research that I and others have done shows that the problems are related to the physiology of the brain—and the good news is that we have proof that you can change that physiology. You can fi x what’s wrong for many problems. Until very recently, scientists could only speculate about the brain’s role in our person- ality and decision-making skills. We did not have advanced tools to look at the functioning of the brain and thus made many false assump- tions about its impact on our lives. With the advent of sophisticated brain-imaging tech- niques, we are now answering questions about the brain’s role in behavior at a phenomenal pace, questions that have practical applicabil- ity to your life, from relationships at home and at work to understanding what makes you a unique being. I have been involved in brain-imaging research for the past ten years. I fi rst began studying the brain with sophisticated quanti- tative EEG (brain wave) studies, and in the last eight years I’ve used a nuclear medicine brain study called SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography), which mea- 4 Introduction"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"sures cerebral blood flow and metabolic activity patterns. These last ten years have been both exhilarating and frustrating. They have been exhilarating because through these studies we now have visual evidence of brain patterns that correlate with behavior, such as tendencies toward depression, anxiety, dis- tractability, obsessiveness, and violence. This physical evidence of phenomena mostly thought of as purely “psychological” in origin has revolutionized the way others and I prac- tice psychiatric medicine. We can now show patients and their families the physical “brain” evidence of problems, helping them to be more accepting and compliant with treatment. We have more information to make more effective treatment decisions with complex cases than ever before. And we use the information from this research to educate the public on the effects of drug abuse, head injuries, and even “negative thinking” on the brain. This has been truly an amazing time. It has also been a frustrating time because dissemination of these new insights has been slower than I would like. There is natural resistance in the scientifi c community to dra- matic shifts in thinking. Once a scientist Introduction 5"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"uncovers new information, it needs to go through a peer review process that can take years. I’m pleased that the brain-imaging work I and others have pioneered is continuing to gain acceptance from the medical and scien- tific community. In the meantime, the knowledge gained from this research is help- ing people across North America. It can help you too. SEEING IS BELIEVING I was not a brain-imaging researcher by design. After medical school at Oral Roberts Univer- sity in Tulsa, Oklahoma, I did my psychiatric internship and residency at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. I always believed that there was a strong connection between spiritual health and mental health. Nothing in my training dissuaded me from that idea, but little did I know that the connec- tion could go both ways. I then did a fellowship in child and adolescent psychiatry in Hono- lulu, Hawaii, where I learned how stressful early beginnings could set up lifelong prob- lems. In Hawaii I began to write about applying mental health principles to everyday life (in 6 Introduction"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"relationships, at work, and within ourselves). I wanted to teach large groups of people how to be more effective day to day. On the basis of my work, I was selected as a fellow in the pres- tigious Group for Advancement of Psychiatry and received a research award from the Amer- ican Psychiatric Association. In 1986, I wrote a program titled Breaking Through: How to Be Effective Every Single Day of Your Life , about identifying and overcoming behaviors that hold people back from success. The program has been extremely helpful for thousands of readers, yet many people needed more. As I worked with groups across the country and patients in my practice, using the principles in the program, many would expe- rience very positive changes (within themselves, their relationships, and their work), but others didn’t seem to get the help they needed. These “resistant” cases were very frustrating to me. I continually asked myself, what was the difference between the people who benefi ted from the program and those who didn’t? Were some people ready to change and others not? Were some people just resistant to change because of deep-rooted psychological reasons? Was the program good Introduction 7"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"for only certain personality types and not oth- ers? I searched for answers. When the answer hit me, the course I had set for my life changed. In 1990, I was working in a psychiatric hos- pital in Fairfield, California (forty miles northeast of San Francisco). I was the director of the dual-diagnosis treatment unit (caring for people with both substance abuse and psy- chiatric problems) and saw other patients as well. One day at grand rounds, I heard Dr. Jack Paldi, a local nuclear medicine physician, give a lecture on brain SPECT imaging. SPECT studies are nuclear medicine studies that measure blood fl ow and activity levels in the brain. Dr. Paldi showed “functional” brain images of people who had problems with dementia, depression, schizophrenia, and head injuries and compared them with the images of normal brains. I wondered if the brain were the missing piece of the puzzle in my resistant patients. Perhaps, I hypothesized, the people who were struggling had brains that could not “run” the new programs I was trying to give them, much like a computer cannot run sophisticated software unless it has enough speed and memory. One of the 8 Introduction"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"things that amazed me about Dr. Paldi’s lec- ture was that he showed brain images before and after treatment. Treatment with medica- tion actually changed the physical functioning of the brain! I wanted to know more. The same week Dr. Paldi gave the lecture, Alan Zametkin, M.D., from the National Institutes of Health published an article in the New England Journal of Medicine on the use of PET (positron emission tomography) studies, in adults with attention defi cit disorder (ADD). Since ADD was one of my specialties, the article really caught my interest. Dr. Zamet- kin demonstrated that when adults with ADD try to concentrate, there is decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex, rather than the expected increase seen in normal “control” adults. Here was physical evidence of a prob- lem many people thought was psychological! A third event that week helped me integrate what I’d learned: I met Sally. Sally, a forty-year-old woman, had been hospitalized under my care for depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideas. In my clinical interview with her, I discovered that she had many adult ADD symptoms (such as a short attention span, distractibility, disorganization, Introduction 9"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"and restlessness). She had a son with ADD (a frequent tip to diagnosing ADD in adults). Despite her IQ of 140, she had never fi nished college, and she was employed below her abil- ity as a laboratory technician. I decided to order a SPECT study on Sally. Sally’s studies were abnormal. At rest, she had good overall brain activity, especially in the prefrontal cor- tex. But when she was asked to perform math problems (an exercise to challenge her ability to concentrate), she had marked decreased activity across her whole brain, especially in the prefrontal cortex! With that information, I placed her on a low dose of Ritalin (methyl- phenidate), a brain stimulant used to treat ADD in children and adults. She had a won- derful response. Her mood was better, she was less anxious, and she could concentrate for longer periods of time. She eventually went back to school and fi nished her degree. No longer did she think of herself as an under- achiever, but rather as someone who needs treatment for a medical problem. Seeing the SPECT pictures was very powerful for Sally. She said, “Having ADD is not my fault. It’s a medical problem, just like someone who needs glasses.” Sally’s experience led me to believe 10 Introduction"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"that SPECT might have a powerful applica- tion in decreasing the stigma many patients feel when they are diagnosed with emotional, learning, or behavior problems. Sally could see that the problem wasn’t “all in her head.” The scan and her response to medication changed her whole perception of herself.

Many patients, previously “treatment failures,” began to get better when I identifi ed through SPECT the part of their brain that wasn’t working and targeted treat- ment to that area. After that series of events in 1990, my colleagues and I began to do clinical research with SPECT on a wide variety of patients. Our research confi rmed the work of others and expanded the body of knowledge in new directions, especially in the areas of violence, obsessiveness, and “diffi cult person- ality temperaments.”  In doing this research, I have seen with my own eyes the brain SPECT patterns that show abnormalities that interfere with behavior. These brain abnormalities sabotage my patients’ efforts to improve their lives and send interrupt signals to the changes they try to make. I have seen how correcting (normalizing) abnormal brain function can change people’s lives, even their very souls . Person after person who had previously been a treatment failure began to improve through prescriptions targeted at optimizing the brain’s physical functioning. This was such a simple concept: When your brain work right, so can you. When your brain 12 Introduction"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"doesn’t work right, neither can you . The implica- tion was profound: Various parts of the brain infl uence our behavior. Using SPECT stud- ies, I was more effective at pinpointing trouble spots and providing more appropriate inter- ventions. Seeing these scans caused me to challenge many of my basic beliefs about peo- ple, character, free will, and good and evil that had been ingrained in me as a Catholic schoolboy. When the physical functioning of the brain was optimized through the use of medica- tions, nutrition, and targeted psychological exercises, people who had previously been unable to change developed a capacity for new skills and behaviors. They developed more access to productive brain activity and more ability to make changes (even though they had always had the will to change). A major shift occurred in my thinking, uncovering new pos- sibilities for the patients who had been “left behind.” Over the next eight years, I conducted more than fi ve thousand brain studies. The lessons from the brain taught me that without opti- mal brain function, it is hard to be successful in any aspect of life, whether it is in relation- Introduction 13"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"ships, work, schooling, feelings about yourself, or even your feelings about God—no matter how hard you try. Indeed, the first step to being successful is to understand and opti- mize the working patterns of the brain. By enhancing the physical functioning of the brain I also enhance my patients’ potential for success in every area of their lives. First, opti- mize the hardware and circuitry of the brain; then put in new programs. The brain-imaging work provided insights that have revolution- ized the way I understand and treat patients. These insights are the foundation of this book. I am one of only a handful of psychiatrists in the world who are licensed in nuclear brain imaging. Currently, I am the medical director of a large neuropsychiatric clinic in northern California, forty miles northeast of San Fran- cisco. My clinic sees approximately eight hundred patients a month for evaluation and treatment. We see patients from around the globe, and we are recognized as experts in the fi elds of attention defi cit disorder, learning disabilities, head trauma, violence, and obses- sive-compulsive disorder. Even though I am a rarity among psychiatrists, I believe what I do 14 Introduction"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"will be more commonplace in the years to come. It is just too helpful and too exciting to be confi ned to only a few clinics. FOCUS OF THE BOOK The purpose of this book is to explain how the brain works, what happens when things go wrong, and how to optimize brain function. You will be introduced to fi ve of the brain sys- tems that are most intimately involved with our behavior and make up much of what is uniquely human. You’ll learn that the deep limbic system , at the center of the brain, is the bonding and mood control center. Being connected to oth- ers is essential to humanity, yet when this part of the brain is off kilter, people struggle with moodiness and negativity. You’ll learn how certain smells and clear thinking soothe the activity in this part of the brain, and why spending time with positive people is essential to deep limbic health. The basal ganglia , large structures deep within the brain, control the body’s idling speed. When this part of the brain works too hard, anxiety, panic, fearfulness, and confl ict Introduction 15"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"avoidance are often the result. As I describe in the book, I inherited overactive basal gan- glia, which leave me vulnerable to anxiety and nervousness. I know personally that anx- iety is no fun and will give you plenty of ideas on how to settle down this part of the brain. When it is underactive, people often struggle with concentration and fi ne motor control problems. The prefrontal cortex , at the front tip of the brain, is your supervisor, the part of the brain that helps you stay focused, make plans, control impulses, and make good (or bad) decisions. When this part of the brain is underactive, people have problems supervis- ing themselves and also have significant problems with attention span, focus, organi- zation, and follow-through. Learning how to activate the prefrontal cortex in a positive way leads to better internal supervision. The cingulate (pronounced sing-u-lat ), a part of the brain that runs longitudinally through the middle part of the frontal lobes, is the part of the brain I call your “gear shifter.” It allows you to shift attention from thought to thought and between behaviors. When this part of the brain is overactive, people have 16 Introduction"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"problems getting stuck in certain loops of thoughts or behaviors. Understanding its function will help you deal with repetitive worries. Dealing with worry, rigidity, and “overfocused” behavior in yourself or others will be easier after reading this book. Lastly, the temporal lobes, underneath the temples and behind the eyes, are involved with memory, understanding language, facial recognition, and temper control. When there are problems, especially in the left temporal lobe, people are more prone to temper fl are- ups, rapid mood shifts, and memory and learning problems. Optimizing this part of the brain may help you experience inner peace for the fi rst time in your life. It is important to note that none of these brain systems exists in a vacuum. They are intricately interconnected. Whenever you affect one system, you’re likely to affect the others as well. Also, some brain researchers would separate the systems differently than I lay them out in this book, placing the cingu- late system and deep temporal lobes within the limbic system. I am presenting the system we use in my clinic, which has worked so well for our patients. Introduction 17"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" Presenting and defi ning these fi ve terms— prefrontal cortex, cingulate system, deep limbic system, basal ganglia, and temporal lobes—is about as technical as the book gets. Mastering these systems will give you a whole new view about why you do what you do and what you can do about it. After I describe each brain system, I’ll offer targeted behavioral, cognitive, medicinal, and nutritional prescriptions to optimize its func- tion. These prescriptions are practical, simple, and effective. They are based on my experi- ence with more than sixty thousand patient visits to my clinic over the past ten years, as well as the experiences and research of my colleagues. Some people might wonder if readers should be the ones identifying and changing brain problems. My answer is an emphatic yes! I believe it benefi ts almost everyone to know as much about how his or her own brain works as possible. Most of the problems discussed in this book, such as moodiness, anxiety, irrita- bility, infl exibility, and worrying, are faced by large numbers of the population. Most do not require professional help, but rather effective, brain-based prescriptions to optimize the 18 Introduction"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"brain’s effectiveness. Since the brain controls our behavior, optimizing its function can help nearly anyone’s ability to be more effective in life. This book will also make it clear that if your ability to function in everyday life is signifi - cantly impaired (at school, at work, or in relationships), it is important to seek appro- priate help from a competent professional. Letting problems fester untreated can ruin a life. But given the fact that there are over 250 different kinds of psychological therapies available in the United States, seeking the right help can be complicated and downright confusing. In this book I will provide guid- ance and resources on how to seek appropriate help when it’s needed. Researching the brain has been my greatest personal challenge. In 1993, when I first started to talk at medical meetings about the discoveries we were making at our clinic, some colleagues severely criticized us, saying we could not infer behavioral patterns from brain patterns. Their lack of enthusiasm over this exciting technology bothered me, but it did not dissuade me from work. What I was see- ing in the brain was real and changed the lives Introduction 19"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"of many patients. But I did not like the adver- sarial environment of those meetings and decided to keep a low profi le, expecting others would do the research. Then nine-year-old Andrew came into my clinic. Andrew is a very special child. He is my godson and nephew. Until about a year and a half before he came to my clinic as a patient, he had been happy and active. But then his personality changed. He appeared depressed. He had serious aggressive outbursts and he complained to his mother of suicidal and homicidal thoughts (very abnormal for a nine- ye a r - old). He d r ew pic t u r e s of h i m sel f h a n g i n g from a tree. He drew pictures of himself shoot- ing other children. When he attacked a little girl on the baseball fi eld for no particular rea- son, his mother called me late at night in tears. I told Sherrie to bring Andrew to see me the next day. His parents drove straight to my clinic, which was eight hours from their home in Southern California. As I sat with Andrew’s parents and then with Andrew I knew something wasn’t right. I had never seen him look so angry or so sad. He had no explanations for his behavior. He did not report any form of abuse. Other chil- 20 Introduction"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"dren were not bullying him. There was no family history of serious psychiatric illnesses. He had not sustained a recent head injury. Unlike in most clinical situations, I knew fi rst- hand that he had a wonderful family. Andrew’s parents were loving, caring, pleasant people. What was the matter? The vast majority of my psychiatric col- leagues would have placed Andrew on some sort of medication and had him see a coun- selor for psychotherapy. Having performed more than one thousand SPECT studies by that time, I fi rst wanted a picture of Andrew’s brain. I wanted to know what we were dealing with. But with the hostility from my colleagues fresh in my mind, I wondered whether Andrew’s problem wasn’t completely psycho- logical. Perhaps there was a family problem that I just didn’t know about. Maybe Andrew was acting out because his older brother was a “perfect” child who did well in school and was very athletic. Maybe Andrew had these thoughts and behaviors to ward off feelings of insecurity related to being the second son in a Lebanese family (I had personal knowledge of this scenario). Maybe Andrew wanted to feel powerful and these behaviors were associated Introduction 21"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"with issues of control. Then logic took over my mind. Nine-year-old children do not nor- mally think about suicide or homicide. I needed to scan his brain. If it was normal, then we would look further for underlying emotional problems. I went with Andrew to the imaging center and held his hand while he had the study per- formed. Andrew sat in a chair while the technician placed a small intravenous needle in his arm. Several minutes later a very small dose of a radioisotope was injected through the needle while Andrew played a concentra- tion game on a laptop computer. Shortly thereafter, the needle was taken out of his arm and he went into the imaging room next door. He climbed onto the SPECT table and lay on his back. The imaging camera took fifteen minutes to rotate slowly around his head. As his brain appeared on the computer screen, I thought there had been a mistake in perform- ing the procedure. Andrew had no left temporal lobe! Upon quick examination of the complete study, I realized the quality of the scan was fi ne. He was indeed missing his left temporal lobe. Did he have a cyst, a tumor, a prior stroke? A part of me felt scared for him 22 Introduction"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"as I was looking at the monitor. Another part of me felt relieved that we had some explana- tion for his aggressive behavior. My research and the research of others had implicated the left temporal lobe in aggression. The next day Andrew had an MRI (an anatomical brain study) which showed a cyst (a fl uid-fi lled sac) about the size of a golf ball occupying the space where his left temporal lobe should have been. I knew the cyst had to be removed.

That day I called Andrew’s pediatrician and informed him of the clinical situation and brain fi ndings. I told him to fi nd the best person pos- sible to take this thing out of Andrew’s head. He contacted three pediatric neurologists. All of them said that Andrew’s negative behavior was probably not in any way related to the cyst in his brain and they would not recommend operating on him until he had “real symptoms.” When the pediatrician relayed this informa- tion, I became furious. Real symptoms! I had a child with homicidal and suicidal thoughts who was losing control over his behavior and attack- ing people. I contacted a pediatric neurologist in San Francisco, who told me the same thing. I then called a friend of mine at Harvard Med- ical School, also a pediatric neurologist, who told me yet again the same thing. She even used the words “real symptoms.” I practically jumped down her throat; how more real could Andrew’s symptoms be? “Oh, Dr. Amen,” the neurologist replied, “when I say ‘real symp- toms,’ I mean symptoms like seizures or speech problems.” Could the medical profession really not connect the brain to behavior? I was 24 Introduction"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"appalled! But I wasn’t going to wait until this child killed himself or someone else. I called pediatric neurosurgeon Jorge Lazareff at UCLA and told him about Andrew. He told me that he had operated on three other chil- dren with left temporal lobe cysts who had all been aggressive. He wondered if it was related. Thankfully, after evaluating Andrew, he agreed to remove the cyst. When Andrew woke up from the surgery, he smiled at his mother. It was the fi rst time in a year that he had smiled. His aggressive thoughts were gone, and his temperament changed back to that of the sweet child he had been before the age of seven. Andrew was lucky. He had someone who loved him paying attention to his brain when his behavior was off. With this very personal experience in my heart, I decided that I had to share our SPECT work with a larger audience, no matter how much criticism came my way. There were too many children, teenagers, and adults like Andrew who had clear brain abnormalities whom society was just writing off as bad human beings. Now, only a few years later, the situation has come full circle. I have presented the Introduction 25"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"information in this book to thousands of med- ical and mental health professionals across North America: in medical schools, at national medical meetings, and even at the prestigious National Institutes of Health. I have published much of this research in chapters in medical books and in journal articles. In 1996 I was invited to give the State of the Art Lecture in Medicine to the Society of Developmental Pediatrics. Clearly there is much more research to do, but many of my colleagues are begin- ning to see that this work can change our understanding of why people do what they do and give guidance for a new way of thinking about and healing people hurting from detect- able and correctable brain abnormalities. This book will teach you that human behav- ior is more complex than society’s damning labels would have us believe. We are far too quick to attribute people’s actions to a bad character when the source of their actions may not be their choice at all, but a problem with brain physiology. One teenage boy, for exam- ple, who was brought in to see me for both suicidal and violent tendencies, had a tempo- ral lobe problem that responded positively to antiseizure medication. He was not a “bad 26 Introduction"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"kid” after all. As he told his mother later, “I always wanted to be polite, but my brain wouldn’t let me.” How many “bad kids” sit- t i ng i n juven i le ha l l wou ld prove to be per fec t ly nice people with the right treatment? Some- times people aren’t being loving, industrious, cheerful, peaceful, obedient, or kind not because they wouldn’t like to be, but because something is wrong with their brain, some- thing that is potentially fi xable. When a person gets treatment that doesn’t work, either because the diagnosis is wrong or the operating theory of the therapist is out- d ate d , t h i n g s g e t wo r s e . Pe o ple wo nde r, “ W h at is wrong with me? Am I not trying hard enough? Am I not good enough? Am I not meant to be happy or well? I am even a failure at getting help for myself.” I have found that most people indeed want to be better. When they struggle, it is most often not for a lack of trying, thinking, or motivation. For many people, we as professionals just didn’t have the right answers. Until recently, scientists had no sophisti- cated tools for evaluating a working brain. Standard brain MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans and CAT (computerized axial Introduction 27"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"tomography) scans, available since the 1970s, are anatomical studies, and although they can evaluate what a brain looks like physically, they cannot provide information on how well the brain works. EEGs (electroencephalo- grams) help in some cases by measuring electrical activity in the brain, but this infor- mation provides little sophisticated information on the workings of the deep structures in the brain. SPECT studies, on the other hand, show ver y n icely what happens i n va r ious pa r ts of the brain when you try to activate them. With this tool, I and my colleagues around the country have been able to correlate over- and under-functioning of different brain parts with certain abnormal behaviors in patients. Also available at this time are two other sophisticated brain studies that are also very useful for studying brain function, functional MRI (fMRI) and PET (positron emission tomography). Each one has its advantages and disadvantages. At this time, in my opinion, due to cost, ease of use, and availability, SPECT is our diagnostic tool of choice. It is important to note that having an abnor- mal SPECT scan is not an excuse for “bad behavior.” SPECT adds to our knowledge 28 Introduction"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"about and understanding of behavior, but it does not provide all the answers. Many people who have diffi culties in their brains never do anything harmful or destructive to others. These scans need to be interpreted in the con- text of each clinical situation. Not all scientists will agree with every fi nd- ing in this book. The information here is based largely on extensive clinical experience and research. The Brain Imaging Division of the Amen Clinic for Behavioral Medicine has done more brain SPECT studies for psychiat- ric reasons than any other clinic I know of in the world. Experience is one of the best teach- ers in medicine. Second, I have had the privilege of working closely with a nuclear medicine physician, Jack Paldi, who has a pas- sion for applying his knowledge to psychiatry. Third, we have had the use of one of the best SPECT cameras available, which provides more and better information than older cam- eras. The purpose of this book is not to encourage readers to go out and get their brains scanned. You don’t need a SPECT scan to benefi t from this book. In fact, if you go to a medical center that has little expe- Introduction 29"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"rience with SPECT, the results are not likely to mean much to your doctor. My goal is to help explain a wide variety of human behav- iors, both aberrant and normal, by showing the images of the brain that SPECT provides. These images make it plain that many prob- lems long thought of as psychiatric in nature—depression, panic disorders, atten- tion defi cit disorders—are actually medical problems that can be treated using a medical model, along with the traditional psychologi- cal and sociological models. I hope that by providing new insights into how the brain works, you’ll gain a deeper understanding of your own feelings and behavior and the feel- ings and behaviors of others. And I hope you’ll use the specifi c brain-based “prescriptions” to optimize the patterns in the brain to help you be more effective in your day-to-day life. 30 Introduction"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"31 1 For Those Who Have Eyes, Let Them See: Images into the Mind What is SPECT? An acronym for s ingle p hoton e mission c omputerized t omography, it is a sophisticated nuclear medicine study that “looks” directly at cerebral blood fl ow and indirectly at brain activity (or metabolism). In this study, a radioactive isotope (which, as we will see, is akin to myriad beacons of energy or light) is bound to a substance that is readily taken up by the cells in the brain. A s m a l l a mou nt of t h i s c omp ou nd i s i nj e c te d into the patient’s vein, where it runs through the bloodstream and is taken up by certain receptor sites in the brain. The radiation expo- sure is similar to that of a head CT or an abdominal X ray. The patient then lies on a table for about fi fteen minutes while a SPECT “gamma” camera rotates slowly around his"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"32 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE head. The camera has special crystals that detect where the compound (signaled by the radioisotope acting like a beacon of light) has gone. A supercomputer then reconstructs off line images of brain activity levels. The ele- gant brain snapshots that result offer us a sophisticated blood flow/metabolism brain map. With these maps, physicians have been able to identify certain patterns of brain activ- ity that correlate with psychiatric and neurological illnesses. SPECT studies belong to a branch of medi- cine called nuclear medicine. Nuclear (refers to the nucleus of an unstable or radioactive atom) medicine uses radioactively tagged compounds (radiopharmaceuticals). The unstable atoms emit gamma rays as they decay, with each gamma ray acting like a beacon of light. Scientists can detect those gamma rays with fi lm or special crystals and can record an accumulation of the number of beacons that have decayed in each area of the brain. These unstable atoms are essentially tracking devices—they track which cells are most active and have the most blood fl ow and those that are least active and have the least blood fl ow. SPECT studies actually show which parts of"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" Images into the Mind 33 the brain are activated when we concentrate, laugh, sing, cry, visualize, or perform other functions. Nuclear medicine studies measure the phys- iological functioning of the body, and they can be used to diagnose a multitude of medical conditions: heart disease, certain forms of infection, the spread of cancer, and bone and thyroid disease. My own area of expertise in nuclear medicine, the brain, uses SPECT studies to help in the diagnosis of head trauma, dementia, atypical or unresponsive mood dis- orders, strokes, seizures, the impact of drug abuse on brain function, and atypical or unre- sponsive aggressive behavior. During the late ’70s and ’80s SPECT stud- ies were replaced in many cases by the sophisticated anatomical CAT and later MRI studies. The resolution of those studies was far superior to SPECT’s in delineating tumors, cysts, and blood clots. In fact, they nearly eliminated the use of SPECT studies alto- gether. Yet despite their clarity, CAT scans and MRIs could offer only images of a static brain and its anatomy; they gave little or no information on the activity in a working brain. It was analogous to looking at the parts of a"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"34 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE car’s engine without being able to turn it on. In the last decade, it has become increasingly recognized that many neurological and psy- chiatric disorders are not disorders of the brain’s anatomy, but problems in how it func- tions. Two technological advancements have encouraged the use, once again, of SPECT studies. Initially, the SPECT cameras were single-headed, and they took a long time— up to an hour—to scan a person’s brain. People had trouble holding still that long, and the images were fuzzy, hard to read (earning nuclear medicine the nickname “unclear medicine”), and did not give much information about the functioning deep within the brain. Then multiheaded cameras were developed that could image the brain much faster and with enhanced resolution. The advancement of computer technology also allowed for improved data acquisition from the multiheaded systems. The higher- resolution SPECT studies of today can see into the deeper areas of the brain with far greater clarity and show what CAT scans and MRIs cannot—how the brain actually functions."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" Images into the Mind 35 SPECT studies can be displayed in a vari- ety of different ways. Traditionally the brain is examined in three different planes: horizon- tally (cut from top to bottom), coronally (cut from front to back), and sagittally (cut from side to side). What do physicians see when they look at a SPECT study? We examine it for symmetry and activity levels, indicated by shades of color (in different color scales selected depending on the physician’s prefer- ence, including gray scales), and compare it to what we know a normal brain looks like.

One kind is a 3-D surface image, looking at the blood fl ow of the brain’s cortical sur- face. These images are helpful for picking up areas of good activity as well as underactive areas. They are helpful when investigating, for instance, strokes, brain trauma, and the effects of drug abuse. A normal 3-D surface scan shows good, full, symmetrical activity across the brain’s cortical surface. The 3-D active brain image compares average brain activity to the hottest 15 percent of activity. These images are helpful for pick-"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"36 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE ing up areas of overactivity, as seen, for instance, in active seizures, obsessive-com- pulsive disorder, anxiety problems, and certain forms of depression. A normal 3-D active scan shows increased activity (seen by the light color) in the back of the brain (the cerebellum and visual or occipital cortex) and average activity everywhere else (shown by the back- ground grid). Physicians are usually alerted that some- thing is wrong in one of three ways: they see too much activity in a certain area; they see too little activity in a certain area; or they see asymmetrical areas of activity that ought to be symmetrical. In the rest of the book, I will go into greater detail about how this remarkable technology has touched people’s lives. For now, however, I will simply offer a sample of fi ve common ways in which SPECT studies are utilized in medicine. 1. To mak e ea r ly i n t e r v e n t i o n p o ss i b l e .

Suspecting a stroke, the emergency room physician ordered a brain SPECT study that showed a hole of activity in her left frontal lobe caused by a clot that had choked off the blood supply to this part of the brain. From this information, it was clear that Ellen had had a stroke, and her doctors were able to take measures to limit the extent of the damage. CAT scans are generally not abnor- mal until twenty-four hours after a stroke.

To evaluate the patient accurately so that future illness can be prevented . Nancy was a fi fty- nine-year-old woman suffering from severe depression that had been nonresponsive to treatment. She was admitted to a psychiatric hospital, where a SPECT study was done to evaluate her condition. Since she had not experienced any symptoms that would point to this, I was surprised to see that she had had two large strokes. Nearly immediately her nonresponsive depression made more sense to me. Sixty percent of the people who have frontal lobe strokes experience severe depres- sion within a year.

He felt the stroke had come from a blood clot and placed her on blood-thinning medication to prevent further strokes. 3. To help the physician elicit understanding and compassion from the patient’s family . When Frank, a wealthy, well-educated man, entered his seventies, he began to grow forgetful. At fi rst it was over small things, but as time went on, the lapses of memory progressed to the point where he often forgot essential facts of his life: where he lived, his wife’s name, and even his own name. His wife and chil- dren, not understanding his change in behavior, were annoyed with his absent- mindedness and often angry at him for it. Frank’s SPECT study showed a marked sup- pression across the entire brain, but especially in the frontal lobes, parietal lobes, and tem- poral lobes. This was a classic Alzheimer’s disease pattern. By showing the family these images and pointing out the physiological cause of Frank’s forgetfulness in living images, I helped them understand that he"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" Images into the Mind 41 was not trying to be annoying, but had a serious medical problem. Consequently, instead of blaming him for his memory lapses, Frank’s family began to show compassion toward him, and they devel- oped strategies to deal more effectively with the problems of living with a person who has Alzheimer’s disease. In addition, I placed Frank on new treatments for Alzheimer’s dis- ease that seemed to slow the progression of the illness.

To differentiate between two problems with similar symptoms . I fi rst met Margaret when she was sixty-eight years old. Her appearance was ragged and unkempt. She lived alone, and her family was worried because she appeared to have symptoms of serious dementia. They fi nally admitted her to the psychiatric hospital where I worked after she nearly burned the house down by leaving a stove burner on. When I consulted with the family, I also found out that Margaret often forgot the names of her own children and frequently got lost when driving her car. Her driving habits deterio- rated to the point where the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) had to take away her license after four minor accidents in a six- month period. At the time when Margaret’s family saw me, some members had had enough and were ready to put her into a supervised living situation. Other family members, how- ever, were against the idea and wanted her hospitalized for further evaluation. While at fi rst glance it may have appeared that Margaret was suffering from Alzheimer’s disease, the results of her SPECT study showed full activity in her parietal and tempo- ral lobes. If she had Alzheimer’s, there should"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" Images into the Mind 43 have been evidence of decreased blood fl ow in those areas. Instead, the only abnormal activ- ity shown on Margaret’s SPECT was in the deep limbic system at the center of the brain, where the activity was increased. Often, this is a fi nding in people suffering from depression. Sometimes in the elderly it can be diffi cult to distinguish between Alzheimer’s disease and depression because the symptoms can be sim- ilar. Yet with pseudodementia (depression masquerading as dementia), a person may appear demented, yet not be at all. This is an important distinction, because a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease would lead to prescribing a set of coping strategies to the family and possibly new medications, whereas a diagnosis of some form of depression would lead to pre- scribing an aggressive treatment of antidepressant medication for the patient along with psychotherapy. The results of Margaret’s SPECT study convinced me that she should try the antide- pressant Wellbutrin (bupropion). After three weeks, she was talkative, well groomed, and eager to socialize with the other patients. After a month in the hospital she was released to go home. Before discharge she asked if I would"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"44 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE write a letter to the DMV to help her get her driver’s license back. Since I drive on the same highways she does, I was a bit hesitant. I told her that if in six months she remained improved and she was compliant with treat- ment, I would write to the DMV for her. Six months later she remained markedly improved. I repeated her SPECT study.

Her husband, far from being supportive, angrily denied that his wife was suffering from serious cognitive problems. Yet during the evaluation process it was clear that Betty had severe memory problems; she did not know where she lived, her phone number, or her hus- band’s name. I ordered a SPECT study that showed a dent in the right side of Betty’s fron- tal lobe. It was obvious to me that she had at some point suffered a signifi cant head injury. When I asked her about it, all she could do was look down and cry; she could not give me details of the event. When I asked her sister, she reported that Betty and her husband had a stormy relationship and that he was abusive toward her. Sometimes he would grab her by the hair and slam her head into the wall. The sister wanted Betty to go to the police, but Betty had said it would only make things worse. Shortly after Betty was hospitalized, her husband began pressuring me to send her home. He kept protesting that there was noth- ing wrong with her, yet I knew that Betty needed to be removed from her home envi- ronment, so I contacted Adult Protective Services.

At that moment, I would have rather been without clothes than without the covering of my skull. I was relieved to see very good activity in nearly all of my brain.

It was working too hard. Of note, my mother (who tends to be a bit anxious) and my aunt (who has been clinically diagnosed with a panic dis- order) both had the same pattern (increased activity in the right side of the basal ganglia).

Here are four more examples that highlight the con- nection between the brain and behavior. On three separate occasions, Michelle, a thirty- five-year-old nurse, left her husband. Each time she left him within the ten days before the onset of her menstrual period. The third time her irritability, anger, and irrational behavior escalated to the point where she attacked him with a knife over a minor dis- agreement. The next morning, her husband was on the phone to my offi ce. When I fi rst met Michelle, it was several days after her menstrual period had started and things had signifi cantly settled down. The severe temper outbursts were usually over by the third day after her period started. In my office, she appeared to be a gentle, soft-spoken woman.

Because her actions were so serious, I decided to perform two brain SPECT studies on her.

My colleagues and I have observed that left- side brain problems often correspond with a tendency toward signifi cant irritability, even violence. On Michelle’s brain study before the onset of her period, her deep limbic system (the mood control center) near the center of her brain was signifi cantly overactive, espe- cially on the left side. This “focal” deep limbic fi nding (on one side as opposed to both sides) often correlates with cyclical tendencies toward depression and irritability. There was a dramatic change in her second scan taken eleven days later when Michelle was feeling better. The deep limbic system was normal! Contrary to the beliefs of some naysayers, PMS, or premenstrual syndrome, is real. Women with PMS are not imagining things; the chemistry of their brain is genuinely altered and produces reactions they cannot control. The deep limbic system has a higher density of estrogen receptors than other parts of the brain, making it more vulnerable, in some women, to the estrogen changes that occur at puberty, before the onset of menses, after a baby is born,"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"54 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE or during menopause. Sometimes these changes can produce dramatic effects. For women like Michelle, PMS can be debilitating or even dan- gerous—and thus we must pay attention to it.

During the worst time, there are fi ght- ing and alienation. I often prescribe an antiseizure medication called Depakote (divalproex) for people who have cyclic mood disorders like manic-depres- sive disorder. Because Michelle’s SPECT fi ndings showed an area of focal intensity in the left side of her deep limbic system (a fi nd- ing I often see in someone who has a cyclic mood disorder), I put her on Depakote. It evened out her moods very nicely. We tried taking her off the Depakote after nine months, but her symptoms returned quickly.

Two days later Brian pulled out a third tooth. His mother started to worry when she saw Brian tugging at a tooth she knew wasn’t loose. She told him that the tooth fairy doesn’t come if you pull out your own teeth. She told him not to do it anymore. There was no tooth fairy that night. Over the next month, however, Brian couldn’t get the thought of the tooth fairy out of his head and he pulled out three more teeth. His mother brought him to me for an evaluation. In Brian’s family there was a history of alco- hol abuse, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Behavioral interventions were not successful in keeping Brian’s hands out of his mouth. Additionally Brian was oppositional and had trouble at school. The teacher said he “always got stuck on certain thoughts” and could not pay attention to his classwork. After several months, individual therapy was not progressing. I ordered a brain SPECT study to better understand the functional pattern of Brian’s brain.

Ten-year-old Wendy was talking too much in class, not fi nishing her work, and fre- quently distracted. Seven-year-old Charles was often out of his seat, aggressive with the other boys, off task, poorly organized, and seemingly loved to be in the middle of trouble. The teach- ers had been telling the parents, Bob and Betsy, to seek help for Charles since preschool. Dur- ing the evaluation, the parents told me they had a solid marriage with little confl ict. The children were both diagnosed with a condition known as attention defi cit disorder (ADD), a genetic, neurobiological disorder that affects approximately 5 percent of chil- dren in the United States. It is characterized by a short attention span, distractibility, disor- ganization, and often, although not always, hyperactivity and impulse-control problems.

After several weeks, Wendy had a very posi- tive response to treatment. She was doing better in school, she got her homework done more quickly and accurately, and she was better able to manage her behavior in the classroom. Charles was a different story. He continued to have problems with his behavior at school and home; nothing seemed to help. During several individual sessions with Charles, I found that he was under severe stress. Despite what his parents had initially told me about themselves, they fought nearly every night and he was very worried they would get divorced. Charles told me about the yelling matches, slamming doors, and threats of leaving. “I can’t think of doing my schoolwork when I’m so worried about my mom and dad getting a divorce.” I discussed this information with his parents. They readily agreed that there was a lot of tension between them, but they didn’t think it had anything to do with the children’s problems. They had no idea how much it was bothering Charles. They agreed to come for marriage counseling once a week."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"60 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE I have two couches in my offi ce. I can tell a lot about a couple by where they sit. If they sit on the same couch there is a willingness to be close, less so if they are on different couches.

I fi nd it satisfying to see couples and families become closer and more loving. I help them clarify their goals in the relationship and teach them the skills they need to reach those goals. Working with Bob and Betsy, however, was anything but fun. The fury between them was often so intense that others in my clinic knew when they were in my offi ce. For nearly nine months they talked about divorce at every session. Despite the therapy, they fought nearly every night. I wondered what kept them together. Without clear structure and interventions from me, the sessions would take on a pattern. After they told me about the traumatic fi ghts of the week, Betsy would bring up an issue from the past and go over and over and over it, despite my attempts to encourage her in a more con- structive direction.

Bob, on the other hand, never really seemed to pay attention. As soon as Betsy started to talk, he would look away, as if he were off in some distant place. I found myself frequently having to bring him back to the therapy session. When he entered the conversation, it was often with some snide remark. Then his attention would wander again. He reminded me of a hit-and-run driver: Cause a problem, then leave the scene. After nine months of “marital therapy” going nowhere, Charles was getting worse. One day after seeing him for an individual session, I called his parents into my offi ce. “Look,” I said, “both of you are trying really hard to make this work. Yet it is not working. The tension at home is damaging your kids, especially Charles. Either you should get an amicable divorce and give yourselves and these kids some peace, or let me scan your brains and see if I’m not missing a biological piece to your marriage puzzle.” They agreed to get the set of brain studies.

In fact, I was irritated with myself that I hadn’t done it earlier. The cin- gulate part of Betsy’s brain was extremely overactive, causing her to be unable to shift her attention and to become tenaciously locked on to certain thoughts or ideas.

This meant that the harder he tried to pay attention to Betsy, the more his attention wandered. He often sought confl ict as a way to stimulate his own brain. Bob’s symptoms and his brain study clearly indi- cated he had ADD like his kids (ADD is usually a genetic disorder). It was now clear to me that this couple’s problems existed, at least in part, on a biologi- cal level. I needed to optimize their brain biology if the therapy was going to do any good at all. I placed Betsy on Prozac (fl uox- etine). Prozac, like Zoloft, decreases overactivity of the cingulate and allows people to shift their attention more freely between topics and become less stuck on thoughts and behaviors. I think of these medications as “lubricants” for the brain’s shifting mecha- nism. I put Bob on Ritalin, which is a stimulant medication that helps children and adults with ADD concentrate, stay on task, and be less impulsive.

Willie Willie was the kind of guy who got along with everyone. An A student, he had a college schol- arship waiting for him, and his future seemed altogether promising—until his head collided with the dashboard when his car accidentally hit a guardrail. Although Willie felt dazed, he seemed to be okay by the next day. Three months later he got into another accident when he swerved to avoid hitting a dog that had run out into the street.

In the months that followed, however, Willie found that the “minor concussion” was wreaking havoc with his life. Normally a friendly person, he found himself suddenly losing his temper at the smallest things. His whole attitude and demeanor began to change. Where he had once been patient, he now had a short fuse. Where he had once been amiable and calm, he was now always angry. His irrita- bility and constant fl ares of temper began to alienate his friends and family. The brunt of his anger came to rest on his college roommate and strangely began to cen- ter around food. Inexplicably, Willie’s appetite was changing. In just three months, he had put on seventy pounds, and he was hungry all the time. He seemed to be devouring every morsel of food in the house. When his room- mate fi nally got fed up with Willie eating all the groceries and asked Willie to eat only the food he bought himself, Willie felt that by depriving him of the food needed, his room- mate was trying to hurt him. Willie was consumed with negative, paranoid thoughts about this person who was “trying to take the food out of his mouth.” In his mind, the only way to protect himself against this enemy was"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":" Carving Knives and Tooth Fairies 67 to hurt the enemy. One afternoon he took a huge meat cleaver and a butcher knife and waited at the front door for the man who used to be his friend. “He was going to be instanta- neously dissolved,” Willie later told me. Yet even as he was gripped by paranoia, some part of Willie’s mind was still sane. He saw himself, as if from above, standing behind the door and holding these weapons. He knew he was out of control and that he had to stop himself before it was too late. He went to the telephone and called a friend, who gave him my telephone number, and the immediate cri- sis was averted. Willie described for me his two accidents and the severity of his personality changes. I immediately ordered a brain study. As I expected, the study showed abnormalities. Two areas were working too hard: One was in his left temporal lobe, where dysfunction is often associated with paranoia and violence. The second was the top, middle section of the frontal lobes (cingulate area), again, the part of the brain that allows a person to shift atten- tion freely from one thing to another.

Your brain creates your world—a radical statement about ordinary thinking. Yet it is your brain that perceives and experiences. Everything begins and ends in the brain. How our brains work determines the very quality of our lives: how happy we will be, how well we’ll get along with others, how successful we will be in our profession. The brain likely infl u- ences how close or how distant we feel from God. The patterns of our brain predispose what kind of husband or wife we will be, whether we will fail in school, be irritable with our children, or have the ambition to strive toward our goals.

When behavior becomes abnormal, however, as in the cases mentioned above, often there is something the matter with the patterns in the body’s computer—the brain. These case his- tories demonstrate that the actual physical patterns of our brain have a dramatic impact on how we think, feel, and behave from moment to moment . Only recently have we discovered how to recognize those patterns and how to treat them with both behavioral and medical pre- scriptions. Unfortunately, there are many professionals who lack sophisticated information on how the brain actually works. They believe the behavior of their patients is primarily the result of environmental stress or conditioning and do not consider the possibility that it may be based on abnormal brain physiology.

It freed them from the stereotypical behavior and actions dictated by the brain stem, found in the older “reptilian” brain. The subsequent evolution of the surrounding cerebral cortex in higher animals, especially humans, gave us the capacity for problem solving, planning, organization, and rational thought. Yet in order for these functions to have an effect in the world, one must have passion, emotion, and the desire to make something happen.

When it is heated up, or overactive, negativity can take over. This fi nd- ing actually surprised my colleagues at the clinic and me at fi rst. We thought that excessive activ- ity in the part of the brain that controlled emotion might correlate with enhanced feelings of all kinds, not solely negative ones. Yet we noticed, again and again, that when this area was overactive on SPECT, it correlated with the subject’s depression and negativity. It seems that when the deep limbic system is infl amed, pain- ful emotional shading results. New research on depression from other laboratories around the world has borne this out. The emotional shading provided by the deep limbic system is the fi lter through which you interpret the events of the day. It colors events depending on your emotional state of mind. When you are sad (with an overactive deep limbic system), you are likely to interpret neutral events through a negative fi lter. For example, if you have a neutral or even positive conversation with someone whose deep limbic system is overactive or “negatively set,” he or she is likely to interpret the conversation in a negative way. When this part of the brain is “cool” or functions properly, a neutral or posi-"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":" Looking Into Love and Depression 75 tive interpretation of events is more likely to occur. Emotional tagging of events is critical to survival.

As mentioned, in our study of PMS within fi ve to ten days before the onset of menstrua- tion, the deep limbic system becomes infl amed or more active with the drop in hormones. This deep limbic activation colors events in a more negative way. A friend’s wife has a fairly severe case of PMS. He tells me that during the fi rst week of her cycle, she looks at him with love and affection, and almost anything he does seems to be right. She is more loving and affectionate. Ten days before her period, things are dramatically different. She doesn’t want to be touched. She “has a different look,” which he describes as a combination of a scowl and a “don’t mess with me” look. Little he does is right. She emotionally colors most events in a negative way. Then, a few days after her cycle starts, she’s back to being more positive, loving, and affectionate. The deep limbic system, along with the deep temporal lobes, has also been reported to be involved in storing highly charged emotional memories, both positive and negative. If you have been traumatized by a dramatic event, such as being in a car accident or watching your"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":" Looking Into Love and Depression 77 house burn down, or if you have been abused by a parent or a spouse, the emotional compo- nent of the memory is stored in the deep limbic system of the brain. And if you have won the lottery, graduated magna cum laude, or watched your child’s birth, those emotional memories are stored here as well. The total experience of our emotional memories is responsible, in part, for the emotional tone of our mind. The more stable, positive experiences we have, the more positive we are likely to feel; the more trauma in our lives, the more emotionally set we become in a negative way. These emotional memories are intimately involved in the emo- tional tagging we impose on the day’s events. The deep limbic system also affects motiva- tion and drive. It helps get you going in the morning and encourages you to move through- out the day. Overactivity in this area, in our experience, is associated with lowered motiva- tion and drive, which is often seen in depression. The deep limbic system, especially the hypothalamus, controls the sleep and appetite cycles of the body. Healthy sleep and appetite are essential to maintaining a proper internal milieu. Both of these components are often a problem with limbic abnormalities."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"78 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE The deep limbic structures are also inti- mately involved with bonding and social connectedness. When the deep limbic system of animals is damaged, they do not properly bond with their young. In one study of rats, when the deep limbic structures were dam- aged, mothers would not feed and nurture the young but would drag them around the cage as if they were inanimate objects. The deep limbic system affects the bonding mechanism that enables you to connect socially with other people; your ability to do this successfully in turn influences your moods. We are social animals. When we are bonded to people in a positive way, we feel better about ourselves and our lives. T his capacit y to bond then plays a signifi cant role in the tone and quality of our moods. The deep limbic system also directly pro- cesses the sense of smell. The olfactory system is the only one of the fi ve sensory systems that goes from the sensory organ to directly where it is processed in the brain. The messages from all the other senses (sight, hearing, touch, and taste) are sent to a “relay station” before they are sent to their fi nal destination in dif- ferent parts of the brain. Because your sense"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":" Looking Into Love and Depression 79 of smell goes directly to the deep limbic sys- tem, it is easy to see why smells can have such a powerful impact on our feeling states. The multibillion-dollar perfume and deodorant industries count on this fact: beautiful smells evoke pleasant feelings and draw people toward you; unpleasant smells repel them. I learned about the limbic-smell connection fi rsthand when I was sixteen years old and dating the woman who became my wife. She was a good Catholic girl. As a typical hot- blooded teenager, I was extremely interested in physical affection. One night I ran out of after shave and borrowed my brother’s Eng- lish Leather. When I picked her up for our date, I noticed a difference. I had a car with a bench seat in front. Usually she sat in the part of the seat nearest to the passenger door. That night she sat in the middle part, next to me. She took my hand before I reached for hers. She came close to me before I moved toward her. She was cuddlier and more affectionate than before. Needless to say, from then on English Leather was the only scent I wore. Bonding, smells, sexuality, and the deep limbic system are intimately connected. Napo- leon once wrote to Josephine to ask her not to"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"80 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE bathe for two weeks before he came home from a battle. He wanted her scent to be pow- erful, because it excited him sexually. It is likely that positive, sexual smells cool the lim- bic system and intensify our mood for love. Deep limbic overactivity, often associated with depression, frequently results in decreased sexual interest. For many years, I have hypoth- esized that decreased sexual activity is associated with increased deep limbic activity and more vulnerability to depression. I studied this phenomenon in an adult male who had problems with depression and increased activity in his deep limbic systems on SPECT. I asked him to make passionate love with his wife. I then rescanned him within an hour. His limbic activity was sig- nificantly decreased. Orgasm has been described as a mini-seizure of the limbic sys- tem and tends to release or lessen deep limbic activity. Sexuality is good for the bonded human brain.

Two people may decide to have sex “just for the fun of it,” yet something is occurring on another level they might not have decided on at all: Sex is enhancing an emotional bond between them whether they want it or not. One person, often the woman, is bound to form an attach- ment and will be hurt when a casual affair ends. One reason it is usually the woman who is hurt most is that the female limbic system is larger than the male’s. One likely consequence is that she will become more limbically connected. I once treated a patient named Renee who had a high sex drive. She was not sexually sat- isfi ed by her husband. For years, other men flirted with her and she remained faithful, until one day she decided, out of pure frustra- tion, to have an affair with a coworker. From the outset, they agreed that they were going to have friendly sex, just for fun, just for the plea- sure, and in the fi rst two months that seemed to work. Then Renee felt herself wanting to see him more often. She tried to get him to meet with her twice a week instead of once a week, as they had originally agreed. Instead of responding positively, her lover pulled away."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"82 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE The more attached she became, the more detached he became. Although Renee and her lover had been on the same wavelength in the beginning, in the end she had changed and he hadn’t, and she felt used. It is important to understand how your body and psyche work. In this case, Renee would have been wise to realize that her limbic system was not quite as open to casual sex as she wanted to be. She would have been better off to stay with her husband and work things out sexually with him, rather than to pick a casual acquaintance for a sexual liaison. As mentioned above, current research has demonstrated that females, on average, have a larger deep limbic system than males. This gives females several advantages and disad- vantages. Because of their larger deep limbic brain, women are more in touch with their feelings, and they are generally better able to express their feelings than men. They have an increased ability to bond and be con- nected to others (which is why women are the primary caretakers of children—there is no society on earth where men are primary care- takers of children).

Having a larger deep limbic system leaves a female somewhat more susceptible to depression, especially at times of signifi cant hormonal changes such as the onset of puberty, before menses, after the birth of a child, and at menopause. Women attempt suicide three times more often than men. Yet men’s sui- cide attempts are sucessful three times more often than women’s, in part because they use more violent means (women tend to use over- doses with pills while men tend to either shoot or hang themselves), and men are gen- erally less connected to others than are women. Disconnection from others increases the risk of completed suicides. The deep limbic system, especially the hypothalamus at the base of the brain, is responsible for translating our emotional state into physical feelings of relaxation or tension.

The back half of the hypothalamus sends stimulating or fear signals to the body through the sympathetic nervous system. The back half of the hypo-"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"84 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE thalamus, when stimulated, is responsible for the fi ght-or-fl ight response, a primitive state that gets us ready to fi ght or fl ee when we are threatened or scared. This “hardwired response” happens immediately upon activa- tion, such as seeing or experiencing an emotional or physical threat: The heart beats faster, breathing rate and blood pressure increases, the hands and feet become cooler to shunt blood from the extremities to the big muscles (to fi ght or run away), and the pupils dilate (to see better). This deep limbic transla- tion of emotion is powerful and immediate. It happens with overt physical threats and also with more covert emotional threats. This part of the brain is intimately connected to the pre- frontal cortex and seems to acts as a switching station between running on emotion (the deep limbic system) and rational thought and prob- lem solving using our cortex. When the limbic system is turned on, emotions tend to take over. When it is cooled down, more activation is possible in the cortex.

Since the sleep and appetite centers are in the deep limbic system, disruption can lead to changes, which may mean an inclination toward too much or too little of either. For example, in typical depressive episodes people have been known to lose their appetites and to have trouble sleeping despite being chroni- cally tired, and yet in atypical depression they will sleep and eat excessively. There are three problems caused by abnor- malities of the deep limbic system that warrant their own sections: bonding disruption, mood disorders, and PMS. BONDING DISRUPTION Bonding and limbic problems often go hand in hand. One of the most fundamental bonds in the human universe is the mother-infant bond. Hormonal changes shortly after child- birth, however, can cause limbic or emotional problems in the mother. They are called the “baby blues” when they are mild, and postpar- tum depression or psychosis when they are severe. When these problems arise, the deep"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":" Looking Into Love and Depression 87 limbic system of the mother’s brain shows abnormal activity. (The phenomenon has been detected in animals as well as humans.) In turn, signifi cant bonding problems may occur. The mother may emotionally withdraw from the baby, preventing the baby from developing normally. Babies who experience “failure to thrive,” for instance, or who have low weight or delayed development, often have mothers who are unattached emotionally. In such cases, the abnormal activity of the mother’s deep limbic system causes develop- mental problems for the baby. Conversely, problems in the deep limbic system can be caused by outside events that disrupt the human bonding process. This can occur at any stage in life. Here are three of the most common. Death The death of a parent, spouse, or child causes intense sadness and grief. In these familial relationships, there is often a tight neurochem- ical bond (from the myriad of stored emotional memories and experiences). When it is broken, the activity of the deep limbic system is dis-"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"88 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE rupted. Many who experience grief say the pain actually feels physical. This sensation is not imaginary. Grief often activates the pain centers in the brain, which are housed near the deep limbic system. It is interesting to note that the people who had a good relationship with the person who died often heal their grief much more easily than those whose relationship with the deceased was fi lled with turmoil, bitterness, or disappointment. The reason is that a posi- tive relationship is associated with good memories, and remembering and reprocess- ing these memories helps in the healing process. When people who had a bad relation- ship think back on it, they have to relive the pain. In their mind, they are still trying to fi x what was wrong, to heal the wound, but they can’t. In addition, the guilt they carry with them impairs the healing process. Donna is a case in point. Donna and her mother had had a stormy relationship, fi ghting constantly over things that seemed insignificant in and of themselves. Yet in spite of their problems, the year after her mother’s death was the hardest of Donna’s life. Her husband could not under- stand the force of her grief; all he had ever"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":" Looking Into Love and Depression 89 heard her do was complain that her mother was selfi sh and uninterested in her. What he failed to understand was that Donna had to grieve not only over her mother’s death, but also over the fact that now she would never have the mother-daughter bond she had always wanted. Death had ended all her hopes. Losing a spouse or lover is traumatic in a different way from losing any other loved one. Once you have made love with a person on a regular basis, death can be extraordinarily painful because the deep limbic connection has been broken. The spouse has become part of the chemical bond of that part of the brain, and it takes time for that bond to dissolve. Your deep limbic system misses the person’s touch, voice, and smell. Deep limbic connection doesn’t depend only on sexual intimacy. Another often-over- looked “deep limbic loss” is the loss of a family pet. Many people become as attached to their pets as they do to the signifi cant people in their lives. Pets often give unconditional love and connect with our innermost caring selves. I have often felt that holding one of my cats or petting my dog during a scan would have a"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"90 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE positive “limbic cooling” effect. Unfortu- nately, while I was writing this chapter my dog, Samantha, died of cancer. The sadness in my family was great, with many tears, espe- cially from my daughters and wife. We all had problems sleeping, no one felt like eating, and a ny t h i ng t hat rem i nded us of Sa ma nt ha wou ld quickly bring up tears and feelings of intense sadness and loss. I have known some pet own- ers who became so depressed after a pet died that they felt suicidal and even paranoid. Appreciating this signifi cant grief is often nec- essary to healing. Divorce Divorce can be a source of the most severe kind of stress it is possible for a human being to experience. For many, it actually causes more anguish to lose a spouse through divorce than it does through death. As stated above, people who are “limbically connected” have a very powerful bond, and I believe this phe- nomenon may be one of the major reasons women cannot leave abusive men. They have had their children with these men, shared their beds and their homes with them. To break that"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":" Looking Into Love and Depression 91 bond, which is at the core of their brain, causes a severe rupture that can make the woman feel fragmented, as if she were not quite whole without the man. She may be plagued by sleep and appetite problems, depression, irritability, and social isolation. I once treated a woman who was married to a controlling, angry man whom she could never please. On the day he told her he was leaving her for another woman (causing her a severe limbic injury), she became so depressed that she put her head in the oven and turned on the gas. Fortunately she was rescued and taken to the hospital. It wasn’t until her deep limbic system began to heal and she could feel her own autonomy that she realized she didn’t even like her husband, and in any case, it certainly wasn’t worth kill- ing herself over a man who cheated on her. Even the one who initiates a separation suffers distress and often goes through a period of depression, because the “chemical limbic bonds” break for everyone involved in the separation. The one who is walking out the door may fail to realize this and not antic- ipate the grief period that will likely follow. For some, divorce is so devastating that it can trigger enormous anger and vengefulness. In"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"92 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE fact, I have never seen two people more cruel to each other than those going through a messy divorce. They lose all sense of fairness and rationality and do everything possible to hurt each other. What ignites such negative responses? Breaking the chemical connection activates the deep limbic system. People become not only depressed and negative but also oversensitive, taking every little thing the wrong way. Anger quickly follows. They know they have to separate, and uncon- sciously they use the anger and aggression as a way to do it. The Empty Nest Syndrome When children leave home, parents often feel intensely sad and bereft. Many lose their appe- tites and have trouble sleeping. Something is missing. This may be confusing because the parents remember how arduous it was strug- gling through the growing pains of their offsprings’ adolescence, and they assumed it would be a relief when the teenagers were fi nally out of the house and off to their own lives. (It has been suggested that the discor- dant nature of the parent-child relationship"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":" Looking Into Love and Depression 93 during adolescence may be nature’s way of helping parents and teens make the transition from the close bond of childhood to the total independence of young adulthood.) Yet no matter how difficult those adolescent years were for both sides, a tremendous bond still exists, and breaking it is stressful. I once treated a man who developed a clini- cal depression after his only daughter left home for college. Even though he was happily married, enjoyed his work, and was otherwise healthy, he felt sad, cried easily, had trouble sleeping, became more irritable, and had con- centration problems—all symptoms of depression. Another woman I treated whose two sons went off to college one year after the other became so depressed and felt so lonely and unimportant that she resorted to having an affair as a way to deal with her pain. She lost her marriage over the affair, became sui- cidal, and almost lost her life. DEPRESSION Lack of bonding and depression are often related. People who are depressed often do not feel like being around others and consequently"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"94 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE isolate themselves. The social isolation tends to perpetuate itself: The more isolated a per- son becomes, the less bonding activity occurs. This worsens the depression and increases the likelihood of further isolation. Depression is known to be caused by a deficit of certain neurochemicals or neu- rotransmitters, especially norepinephrine and serotonin. In my experience, this defi cit can cause increased metabolism or infl ammation in the deep limbic system, which in turn causes many of the problems associated with depression. You may have noticed in this chapter how, along with all the other symp- toms of deep limbic system disruption, depression seems to be a common factor. Because the deep limbic system is intimately tied to moods, when it is overactive the ensu- ing problems with depression snowball and affect all the other deep limbic system functions. Ariel came to see me because she had been experiencing symptoms of depression for over two years. She was tired, suffered from sleep- lessness and negative thinking, had no motivation, and had begun to have suicidal"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":" Looking Into Love and Depression 95 thoughts. The symptom that was most diffi - cult for her husband, however, was her complete loss of interest in sex. He was ready to leave her because he thought she wasn’t interested in him anymore as a man. Why else, he thought, had it been such a long time since she had wanted to touch him? After I had her brain scanned, I was not surprised to fi nd that her deep limbic system was on double time. Giving this information to her husband was a powerful tool in helping him to view the situation objectively: His wife was neglecting him not because she didn’t like him but because something was off balance in the chemistry of her brain. Most important of all, the problem was rectifi able. Increased activity in the deep limbic sys- tem is part of a pattern that is often responsive to antidepressants, but sometimes people are averse to being put on medication. Ariel was one of them. She had gotten caught up in the media blitz of 1991, when the hair-raising topic of the news and the talk shows was that Prozac was a dangerous drug that could cause criminally aberrant behavior. It was even reported that it could cause you to kill"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"96 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE your mother! I believe this sensationalism was completely irresponsible, especially since it scared many people who suffered from depression, a very treatable illness, and pre- vented some of them from seeking the help they needed. The fact that medication can cause side effects should not be a blanket deterrent to its use; in many, many cases, the pluses far outweigh the minuses. If you are skeptical about this, consider the following fact: People on antidepressants may experi- ence constipation or an upset stomach, but suicide (often the result of untreated depres- sion) is the eighth leading cause of death in the United States. Ariel decided against the use of medication. She followed the deep limbic prescriptions (behavioral changes that affect the chemistry of the brain) offered in the next chapter, which I developed specifically to treat depression. Through them she was successful in overcom- ing her depression. However, the nonmedication prescriptions do not work for everyone and some people may need medication. Let me emphasize the point: Depression is treatable. Please seek help from a qualifi ed professional if you are suffering. Help is out there for you."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":" Looking Into Love and Depression 97 Leigh Anne Here is another example of deep limbic dys- function. Leigh Anne came to see me fi fteen months after the birth of her fi rst child.

But her condition did not improve. Her depression progressed to the point where she became unable to care for her daughter. Desperate to function as the good mother she wanted to be to her child, she came to see me. After diagnosing her with major depression I placed her on Prozac and began seeing her in psychotherapy. Her symptoms remitted after several weeks, and after several months Leigh Anne wanted to discontinue treatment. She associated taking Prozac with a course of action for “a depressed person.” She did not want to see herself in that light or be stigma- tized by that label. For several months after stopping she had no adverse reaction. Then her symptoms returned.

However, with certain medications, like Prozac, a minimum period of treatment is necessary before it can successfully be terminated. If a depressed patient is willing to stay on the medication for long enough, about two years in this case (the time period varies from person to person), there is a greater chance that it can be discon- tinued with no return of symptoms. MANIC-DEPRESSIVE DISORDER Sarah Sarah was fi fty-three years old when she was admitted to the hospital under my care. The month before, her family had had her commit- ted to another psychiatric hospital for delusional thinking and bizarre behavior—she had actu- ally ripped out all the electrical wiring in her home because she heard voices coming from the walls. In addition to the above symptoms, she was barely getting any sleep, her thoughts raced wildly, and she was irritable. Her doctor had diagnosed manic-depressive disorder (a cyclical mood disorder) and placed her on lith-"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"100 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE ium (an antimanic medication) and an antianxiety medication. After responding well, she was sent home. But Sarah, like Leigh Anne, did not want to believe that anything was wrong with her, and she stopped taking both medica- tions. Her position was actually fortified by some members of her family who openly told her she didn’t need pills, that doctors prescribe them only to force patients into numerous fol- low-up visits. Yet their advice was ill advised, for within weeks of stopping the treatment, Sarah’s bizarre behavior returned. This was when her family brought her to the hospital where I worked. When I first saw Sarah, she was extremely paranoid. Believing that everyone was trying to hurt her, she was always looking for ways to escape from the hospital. Again her thoughts were delusional; she believed she had special powers and that others were trying to take them from her. At times, she also appeared very “spacy.” In an attempt to understand what was going on with her for myself, and to con- vince her that at least part of her problems were biological, I ordered a SPECT study. Carrying this out did not prove easy. Our clinic tried to scan her on three separate occa- sions. The fi rst two times she ripped out the"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":" Looking Into Love and Depression 101 intravenous line, saying we were trying to poi- son her. The third time was a success because her sister stayed with her and calmed her down by talking her through the experience. While the study revealed an overall increase in activ- ity in the deep limbic system, I found more intensity on the left side of her scan (focal increased deep limbic uptake) and a markedly patchy upt a ke ac ross t he cor tex. I n ot her words, some areas showed increased activity and some showed decreased. My experience told me that cyclic mood disorders often correlate with focal areas of increased activity in the deep limbic system specifi cally as well as a patchy uptake across the surface of the brain in general.  For Sarah’s family, this was powerful evi- dence that her problems were biological, so that when she refused medication, they were now willing to encourage her to take it. After she accepted their advice, her behavior nor- malized again. Once I knew she was feeling better, more in control, I showed her the brain studies.

Although Sar- ah’s new study showed a vast improvement from her earlier one, I still noticed an area of increased activity in the left temporal lobe, and Sarah was still complaining of symptoms of spaciness. I changed her medication to Depakote, which is primarily used as an anti- seizure medication but has also been used for Sarah’s Manic-Depression—Affected Brain 3-D top-down active view Note patchy uptake throughout the cortex."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":" Looking Into Love and Depression 103 manic-depressive disorder. Not only did her psychotic symptoms remain in remission, but the spaciness disappeared as well. Five years later, a small dose of Depakote helps Sarah lead a normal life. Sarah’s case illustrates one of the most clinically signifi cant problems in people diag- nosed with manic-depressive illness. This disorder is usually quite responsive to medi- cation. The problem is that when people affl icted by the disorder improve, many feel so normal they do not believe they ever had a problem to begin with. It is diffi cult for peo- ple to accept that they have to keep taking medication when they think they no longer have a problem. Yet as we have seen, prema- turely stopping medication actually increases the chances of relapsing. Through the use of brain studies I have been able to decrease the relapse rate of my patients by demonstrating graphically the biological nature of their dis- orders and the need to treat them as such—a great asset in encouraging patients to coop- erate in their own healing. In addition to that, brain studies have helped me persuade patients to stop blaming themselves for their symptoms."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"104 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE PMS In the last chapter I discussed Michelle’s case of clear (and dangerous) PMS. It was a deep limbic problem. Over the past years we have scanned many women with PMS just before the onset of their period, during the most dif- fi cult time of their cycle, and then again a week after the onset of their period. Most often when PMS is present we see dramatic differences between the scans. When a woman feels good, her deep limbic system is calm and cool. When she feels bad right before her period, her deep limbic system most often is hot! I have seen two PMS patterns, clinically and on SPECT, that respond to different treatments. One pattern is focal increased deep limbic activity that correlates with cyclic mood changes. Hotter activity on the left side of the deep limbic system is often associated with anger, irritability, and expressed negative emotion. Increased activ- ity on the right side of the deep limbic system is often associated with sadness, emotional withdrawal, anxiety, and repressed negative emotion. Left-side abnormalities are more a"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":" Looking Into Love and Depression 105 problem for people with whom the woman interacts (because of her outwardly directed anger and irritability), while right-side over- activity is more an internal problem.

These medications tend to even out moods, calm inner tension, decrease irritability, and help people feel more com- fortable in their own skin. The second PMS pattern that I have noted is increased deep limbic activity in conjunc- tion with increased cingulate gyrus activity. The cingulate, as we will see, is the part of the brain associated with shifting attention. Women with this pattern often complain of increased sadness, worrying, repetitive nega- tive thoughts and verbalizations (nagging), and cognitive infl exibility. This pattern usu- ally responds much better to medications that enhance serotonin availability in the brain, such as Zoloft, Paxil (paroxetine), or Prozac (see cingulate medications in chapter 10, “Cingulate System Prescriptions”)."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"106 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE DEEP LIMBIC CHECKLIST Please read this list of behaviors and rate your- self (or the person you are evaluating) on each behavior listed.

The following prescriptions, geared toward"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":" Enhancing Positive Thought Patterns 109 healing deep limbic system problems, are based on my own personal clinical experience with patients, as well as general knowledge about how the mind/body works. DL PRESCRIPTION 1: KILL THE ANTS Our overall state of mind has a certain tone or fl avor based largely on the types of thoughts we think. When the deep limbic system is overac- tive, it sets the mind’s filter on “negative.” People who are depressed have one dispiriting thought following another. When they look at the past, they feel regret. When they look at the future, they feel anxiety and pessimism. In the present moment, they’re bound to fi nd some- thing unsatisfactory. The lens through which they see themselves, others, and the world has a dim grayness. They are suffering from automatic negative thoughts , or ANTs. ANTs are cynical, gloomy, and complaining thoughts that just seem to keep marching in all by themselves. ANTs can cause people to be depressed and fatalistic. “I know I won’t pass that test on Tuesday.” This kind of thinking makes for a self-fulfi lling prophecy: If someone has already"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"110 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE convinced himself that he won’t pass, he prob- ably won’t study very hard and he won’t pass the test. If you are depressed all the time, you don’t expect good things to happen, so you don’t try very hard to make them happen. The internal distress caused by melancholy think- ing can make you behave in ways that alienate others, thus causing you to isolate yourself further. On the other hand, positive thoughts and a positive attitude will help you radiate a sense of well-being, making it easier for others to connect with you. Positive thoughts will also help you be more effective in your life. As you can see, what goes on in your mind all day long can determine whether your behavior is self-defeating or self-promoting. Here are some other examples of typical ANTs: “You never listen to me.” “Just because we had a good year in business doesn’t mean anything.” “You don’t like me.” “This situation is not going to work out. I know something bad will happen.” “I feel as though you don’t care about me.” “I should have done much better. I’m a failure.”"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":" Enhancing Positive Thought Patterns 111 “You’re arrogant.” “You’re late because you don’t care.” “It’s your fault.” Healing the deep limbic system requires healing moment-to-moment thought patterns. Unfortunately, there is no formal place where we are taught to think much about our thoughts or to challenge the notions that go through our head, even though our thoughts are always with us. Most people do not under- stand how important thoughts are and leave the development of thought patterns to chance. Did you know that every thought you have sends electrical signals throughout your brain? Thoughts have actual physical properties. They are real! They have signifi cant infl uence on every cell in your body. When your mind is burdened with many negative thoughts, it affects your deep limbic system and causes deep limbic problems (irritability, moodiness, depression, etc.). Teaching yourself to control and direct thoughts in a positive way is one of the most effective ways to feel better. Here are the actual step-by-step “thinking” principles that I use in my psychotherapy practice to help my patients heal their deep limbic systems."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"112 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE STEP 1 Realize that your thoughts are real: You have a thought . Your brain releases chemicals . An electrical transmission goes across your brain . You become aware of what you’re thinking . Thoughts are real, and they have a real impact on how you feel and how you behave. STEP 2 Notice how negative thoughts affect your body . Every time you have an angry thought, an unkind thought, a sad thought, or a cranky thought, your brain releases chemicals that make your body feel bad (and activate your deep limbic system). Think about the last time you were mad. How did your body feel? When most people are angry, their muscles become tense, their hearts beat faster, their hands start to sweat, and they may even begin to feel a little dizzy. Your body reacts to every negative thought you have. Mark George, M.D., from the National Institute of Mental Health, demonstrated this • • • •"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":" Enhancing Positive Thought Patterns 113 phenomenon in an elegant study of brain function. He studied the activity of the brain in ten normal women under three different conditions: when they were thinking happy thoughts, neutral thoughts, and sad thoughts. During the happy thoughts, the women dem- onstrated a cooling of the deep limbic system. During the sad thoughts, he noticed a signifi - cant increase in deep limbic system activity—powerful evidence that your thoughts matter! STEP 3 Notice how positive thoughts affect your body . Every time you have a good thought, a happy thought, a hopeful thought, or a kind thought, your brain releases chemicals that make your body feel good (and cool your deep limbic system). Think about the last time you had a really happy thought. How did your body feel? When most people are happy, their muscles relax, their hearts beat more slowly, their hands become dry, and they breathe more slowly. Your body also reacts to your good thoughts."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"114 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE STEP 4 Notice how your body reacts to every thought you have . We know from polygraphs or lie detector tests, too, that your body reacts to your thoughts. During a lie detector test, a person is hooked up to equipment t hat measu res ha nd temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, breathing rate, muscle tension, and how much the hands sweat. The tester asks questions, like “Did you steal that car?” If the person did steal the car, his body is likely to exhibit a “stress” response. His hands get colder, his heart goes faster, his blood pressure goes up, his breathing gets faster, his muscles get tight, and his hands sweat more. The reactions take place almost immedi- ately, whether he says anything or not. Remember, the deep limbic system is respon- sible for translating our emotional state into physical feelings of relaxation or tension. Now the opposite is also true. If the subject did not steal the car, it is likely that his body will experience a “relaxation” response. His hands will become warmer, his heart rate will"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":" Enhancing Positive Thought Patterns 115 slow, his blood pressure will go down, his breathing will become slower and deeper, his muscles will relax, and his hands will become drier. Again, almost immediately, his body has reacted to his thoughts. This happens not only when you’re asked about telling the truth— your body reacts to every thought you have, whether about work, friends, family, or any- thing else. STEP 5 Think of bad thoughts as pollution . Thoughts are very powerful. They can make your mind and your body feel good, or they can make you feel bad. Every cell in your body is affected by every thought you have. That is why when people get emotionally upset, they frequently develop physical symptoms, such as headaches or stomachaches. Some physi- cians think that people who have a lot of negative thoughts are more likely to get can- cer. If you can think about good things, you will feel better. A negative thought is like pollution to your system. Just as pollution in the Los Angeles"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"116 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE Basin affects everyone who goes outside, so, too, do negative thoughts pollute your deep limbic system, your mind, and your body. STEP 6 Understand that your automatic thoughts don’t always tell the truth . Unless you think about your thoughts, they are automatic; “they just happen.” But even if your thoughts just happen, they are not neces- sarily correct. Your thoughts do not always tell the whole truth. Sometimes they even lie to you. I once treated a college student who thought he was stupid because he didn’t do well on tests. When his IQ was tested, how- ever, we discovered that he was close to a genius! You don’t have to believe every thought that goes through your head. It’s important to think about your thoughts to see if they help you or hurt you. Unfortunately, if you never challenge your thoughts, you just “believe them” as if they were true. STEP 7 Talk back to ANTs ."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":" Enhancing Positive Thought Patterns 117 You can train your thoughts to be positive and hopeful, or you can allow them to be neg- ative and upset you. Once you learn about your thoughts, you can choose to think good thoughts and feel better, or you can choose to think bad thoughts and feel lousy. That’s right, it’s up to you! You can learn how to change your thoughts, and you can learn to change the way you feel. One way to learn how to change your thoughts is to notice them when they are neg- ative and talk back to them, as I’ll explain below. When you just think a negative thought without challenging it, your mind believes it and your body reacts to it. When you correct negative thoughts, you take away their power over you. STEP 8 Exterminate the ANTs . Think of these negative thoughts that invade your mind like ants that bother you at a picnic. One negative thought, like one ant at a picnic, is not a big problem.

Whenever you notice these automatic negative thoughts, or ANTs, you need to crush them or they’ll ruin your relationships, your self-esteem, and your personal power. One way to crush these ANTs is to write them down and talk back to them. For example, if you catch yourself think- ing, “My husband never listens to me,” write it down. Then write down a rational response, something like “He’s not listening to me now, maybe he’s distracted by something else. He often listens to me.” When you write down negative thoughts and talk back to them, you take away their power and help yourself feel better. Some people tell me they have trouble talking back to these negative thoughts because they feel that they are lying to themselves. Ini- tially they believe that the thoughts that go through their mind are the truth. Remember, thoughts sometimes lie to you. It’s important to check them out before you just believe them! Here are nine different ways that your thoughts lie to you to make situations seem worse t han t hey really are. T hink of t hese nine ways as different species or types of ANTs. When you can identify the type of ANT, you"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":" Enhancing Positive Thought Patterns 119 begin to take away the power it has over you. I have designated some of these ANTs as red, because they are particularly harmful. Notice and exterminate ANTs whenever possible. ANT 1: “Always/never” thinking . This hap- pens when you think something that happened will “always” repeat itself, or that you’ll “never” get what you want. For example, if your partner is irritable and she gets upset, you might think to yourself, “She’s always yelling at me,” even though in reality she yells only once in a while. But just the thought “She’s always yelling at me” is so negative that it makes you feel sad and upset. It activates your limbic system. All-or-nothing words like always, never, no one, every one, every time, everything are usually wrong. Here are some examples of “always/never” thinking: “He’s always putting me down.” “No one will ever call me.” “I’ll never get a raise.” “Everyone takes advantage of me.” “You turn away every time I touch you.” “My children never listen to me.” “Always/never thinking” ANTs are very common. If you catch yourself thinking in these absolutes, stop and make yourself recall"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"120 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE examples that disprove your all-or-nothing attitude. ANT 2 (red ant): Focusing on the negative . This occurs when your thoughts refl ect only the bad in a situation and ignore any of the good. For example, I have treated several pro- fessional speakers for depression. After their presentations, they had the audience fi ll out an evaluation form. If one hundred forms were returned and two of them were terrible but ninety were outstanding, which ones do you think the speakers focused on? Only the nega- tive ones! I taught them to focus on the ones they liked a lot more than the ones they didn’t like. It’s important to learn from others, but in a balanced, positive way. Your deep limbic system can learn a powerful lesson from Eleanor Porter’s book Pollyanna . In the book, Pollyanna went to live with her aunt after her missionary parents died. Even though she had lost her parents, she was able to help many “negative people” with her attitude. She introduced them to the “Glad Game,” looking for things to be glad about in any situation. Her father had taught her this game after she experi- enced a disappointment. She had always wanted a doll, but her parents never had enough money"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":" Enhancing Positive Thought Patterns 121 to buy it for her. Her father sent a request for a secondhand doll to his missionary sponsors. By mistake, they sent her a pair of crutches. “What is there to be glad about crutches?” they thought. Then they decided they could be glad because they didn’t have to use them. This very simple game changed the attitudes and lives of many people in the book. Pollyanna especially affected the minister. Before she came to town he preached hellfi re and damnation, and he did not seem to be very happy. Pollyanna told him that her father said that the Bible had eight hundred “Glad Passages,” and that if God mentioned being glad that many times, it must be because He wants us to think that way. Focusing solely on the negative in situations will make you feel bad. Playing the Glad Game—looking for the positive—will help you feel better. I’m not sug- gesting you view the world through rose-colored glasses, only that you actively seek to fi nd the positive to give more balance and optimism to a world you experience too often as negative. ANT 3 (red ant): Fortune-telling . This is where you predict the worst possible outcome to a sit- uation. For example, before you discuss an important issue with your partner, you predict that he or she won’t be interested in what you"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"122 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE have to say. Just having this thought will make you feel tense. I call fortune-telling a red ANT because when you predict bad things, you help make them happen. Say you are driving home from work and you predict that the house will be a wreck and no one will be interested in see- ing you. By the time you get home you’re waiting for a fi ght. When you see one thing out of place or no one comes running to the door, you’re more likely to explode and ruin the rest of the evening. Fortune-telling ANTs really hurt your chances for feeling good. Remind yourself that if you could see the future, you’d be a lottery billionaire by now. ANT 4 (red ant): Mind reading . This hap- pens when you believe that you know what other people are thinking even when they haven’t told you. Mind reading is a common cause of trouble between people. I tell people, “Please don’t read my mind, I have enough trouble reading it myself!” You know that you are mind reading when you have thoughts such as “She’s mad at me.” “He doesn’t like me.” “They were talking about me.” I tell people that a negative look from someone else may mean nothing more than that he or she is constipated! You can’t read anyone else’s"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":" Enhancing Positive Thought Patterns 123 mind. You never know what others are really thinking unless they tell you. Even in intimate relationships, you cannot read your partner’s mind. When there are things you don’t under- stand, ask about them to clarify them. Stay away from mind-reading ANTs. They are very infectious. ANT 5: Thinking with your feelings . This occurs when you believe your negative feelings without ever questioning them. You tell your- self, “I feel this way, so it must be so.” Feelings are very complex and often based on powerful memories from the past. Feelings sometimes lie to you. Feelings are not always about truth. They are just feelings. But many people believe their feelings even though they have no evi- dence for them. “Thinking with your feelings” thoughts usually start with the words “I feel.” For example: “I feel as if you don’t love me.” “I feel stupid.” “I feel like a failure.” “I feel nobody will ever trust me.” Whenever you have a strong negative feeling, check it out. Look for the evidence behind the feeling. Do you have real reasons to feel that way? Or are your feelings based on events or things from the past? What’s true, and what’s just a feeling?"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"124 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE ANT 6: Guilt beating . Guilt is not a helpful emotion, especially for your deep limbic sys- tem. In fact, guilt often causes you to do things you don’t want to do. Guilt beatings happen when you think with words like should, must, ought , or have to . Here are some examples: “I ought to spend more time at home.” “I must spend more time with my kids.” “I should have sex more often.” “I have to organize my office.” Because of human nature, whenever we think that we must do something, no matter what it is, we often don’t want to do it. It is better to replace “guilt beatings” with phrases like “I want to do...” “It fits with my goals to do...” “It would be helpful to do...” So in the examples above, it would be helpful to change those phrases to “I want to spend more time at home.” “It’s in our best interests for my kids and me to spend more time together.” “I want to please my spouse by making won- derful love with him (or her) because he (or she) is important to me.” “It’s in my best interest to organize my offi ce.” Guilt isn’t productive. Get rid of this unnecessary emo- tional turbulence that holds you back from achieving the goals you want."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":" Enhancing Positive Thought Patterns 125 ANT 7: Labeling . Whenever you attach a negative label to yourself or to someone else, you stop your ability to take a clear look at the situation. Some examples of negative labels are “jerk,” “frigid,” “arrogant,” and “irre- sponsible.” Negative labels are very harmful, because whenever you call yourself or some- one else a jerk or arrogant, you lump that person in your mind with all of the “jerks” or “arrogant people” that you’ve ever known and you become unable to deal with him reason- ably as a unique individual. Stay away from negative labels. ANT 8: Personalizing . Personalizing occurs when you invest innocuous events with per- sonal meaning: “My boss didn’t talk to me this morning. She must be mad at me.” Or “My son got into an accident with the car. I should have spent more time teaching him to drive. It must be my fault.” There are many other reasons for others’ behavior besides the negative explanations an abnormal limbic sys- tem picks out. For example, your boss may not have talked to you because she was preoc- cupied, upset, or in a hurry. You never fully know why people do what they do. Try not to personalize the behavior of others."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"126 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE ANT 9 (the most poisonous red ant): Blaming . Blame is very harmful. When you blame something or someone else for the problems in your life, you become a passive victim of circumstances and you make it very diffi cult to do anything to change your situation. Many relationships are ruined by people who blame their partners when things go wrong. They take little responsibility for their problems. When something goes wrong at home or at work, they try to fi nd someone to blame. They rarely admit their own problems. Typically, you’ll hear from them statements like: “It wasn’t my fault that...” “That wouldn’t have happened if you had...” “How was I supposed to know...” “It’s your fault that...” The bottom-line thinking in the “blame game” goes something like this: “If only you had done something differently, I wouldn’t be in the predicament I’m in. It’s your fault, and I’m not responsible.” Whenever you blame someone else for the problems in your life, you become powerless to change anything. The “blame game” hurts your personal sense of power.

When a nega- tive thought goes unchallenged, your mind believes it and your body reacts to it. ANTs have an illogical logic. By bringing them into the open and examining them on a conscious level, you can see for yourself how little sense it really makes to think these kinds of things to yourself.

If you spend a lot of time with negative people, the same thing will happen. You may walk into a room in a buoy- ant mood, but before long their ANTs are going to rub off on you. Their ANTs will hang out with your ANTs and mate! That’s not what you want—so surround yourself with positive people as much as possible. Look at your life as it is now. What kind of people are around you? Do they believe in you and make you feel good about yourself, or are they constantly putting you down and deni- grating your ideas, hopes, and dreams? List the ten people you spend the most time with. Make a note of how much they support you and the ways in which you would like to be supported more. In my second year of college I got the bright idea that I wanted to go to medical school. I was on the speech team, and one day I told my speech coach about my dream to become a physician. The fi rst thing out of her mouth was that she had a brother at Michigan State who hadn’t made it into medical school. “And,” she added, “he was much smarter than you are.” The message was clear: You don’t have a chance. Making a big decision like that"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"134 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE was hard enough to do with encouragement; the disheartening comment from the coach was a blow to my confi dence I did not need. I went home w it h my spi r its considerably da mp - ened. Later that evening when I told my father what had happened, he just shook his head and said, “Listen, you can do whatever you put your mind to. And if I were you, I wouldn’t spend much time with that coach.” If you think of life as an obstacle course, it is easy to see that the fewer obstacles in the road, the better. Negative people present unnecessary obstacles for you to overcome because you have to push your will to succeed over their doubts and objections and cyni- cism. Spending time with people who believe you’ll never really amount to anything will dampen your enthusiasm for pursuing your goals and make it diffi cult to move through life in the direction you want to go. On the other hand, people who instill confi dence in you with a cando attitude, people whose spir- its are uplifting, will help breathe life into your plans and dreams. It cannot be overemphasized how conta- gious the attitudes of others are and how much hidden infl uence they can exert. The"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":" Enhancing Positive Thought Patterns 135 reason so many people feel good about attending a positive-thinking seminar is that they have been in a room full of people who were all reaffi rming the best in one another. But let one of those people go home and walk into a house where someone makes fun of his efforts and says he’s wasting his time and will never get anywhere anyway, and watch how fast the positive efforts of the seminar wear off! When you spend a lot of time with people, you bond with them in certain ways, and as I mentioned earlier, the moods and thoughts of others directly affect your deep limbic system. If you go out with someone for dinner and after the fi rst half hour you’re beginning to feel bad about yourself, and then you remem- ber that you always feel bad about yourself when you have dinner with this person, you are not imagining it; your deep limbic system is ac t ua l ly bei ng a f fec ted by h i m or her. Decid- ing that you don’t want to spend time with people who are going to have an adverse effect on you doesn’t mean you have to blame them for the way they are. It simply means that you have the right to choose a better life for yourself."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"136 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE I believe that limbic bonding is one of the key principles behind the success of support groups like Alcoholics Anonymous. For years, clinicians have known that one of the best ways to help people with serious prob- lems like alcoholism is to get them to connect with others who have the same problem. By seeing how others have learned from their experiences and gotten through tough times in positive ways, alcoholics can fi nd the way out of their own plight. While gaining infor- mation about their disease is helpful, forming new relationships and connections with oth- ers may be the critical link in the chain of recovery. The same can be said about people with other diseases, such as cancer. Stanford psychiatrist David Spiegel demonstrated the effectiveness of support groups for women with breast cancer. Those who participated in a support group had survival rates signifi - cantly higher than those who didn’t. How our deep limbic system functions is essential to life itself.

So important is the bonding between children and parents that it overrides other factors traditionally linked to problem behavior, such as living in a single-parent home or spending less time with a child. The article concluded that the degree of connec- tion (limbic bonding) that teenagers feel with parents and teachers is the most important determinant of whether they will engage in risky sexual activity, substance abuse, violence, or suicidal behavior. A study published in USA Today in the late 1980s reported that “on average, parents spend less than seven minutes a week talking with their children.” It is not possible to"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"138 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE “limbically bond” and have much of a rela- tionship in such little time. Children need actual physical time with their parents. Think about the times your parents spent positive one-on-one time with you. Did that make you feel important, special? Some parents complain that their children are too busy or are not interested in spending time with them. When this happens, I recom- mend that parents force the issue with their kids, telling them that they’re important to them and that they need to spend time with them. Of course, the way in which you spend time with them is critical. If you spend the time lecturing or interrogating them, neither of you will fi nd it very enjoyable and both of you will look for ways to avoid contact in the future. Here is an exercise that I’ve found extremely powerful in improving the quality of time you have with your child. The exer- cise is called “special time.” Special time works. It will improve the quality of your relationship with your child in a very short period of time. Here are the directions for special time."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":" Enhancing Positive Thought Patterns 139 1. Spend twenty minutes a day with the child doing something that he or she would like to do. It’s important to approach the child in a posi- tive way and say something like “I feel we have not had enough time together and you’re impor- tant to me. Let’s spend some special time togeth- er every day. What would you like to do?” It’s important to remember that the purpose of this time is to build the limbic bond and relationship with your child. Keep it as positive as possible . 2. During special time there are to be no pa- rental commands, no questions, and no direc- tions. This is very important. This is a time to build the relationship, not discipline difficult be- havior. If, for example, you’re playing a game and the child starts to cheat, you can reframe her behavior. You can say something like “I see you’ve changed the rules of the game, and I’ll play by your rules.” Remember, the goal of spe- cial time is to improve the relationship between you and your child, not to teach. Of course, at other times, if the child cheats it is important to deal straightforwardly with it . 3. Notice as many positive behaviors as you can. Noticing the good is much more effective in shaping behavior than noticing the bad . 4. Do much more listening than talking ."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"140 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE I once received a phone call from a friend of mine who complained that his eighteen- month-old daughter did not want anything to do with him when he came home from work.

I told him that it prob- ably meant he wasn’t spending enough time with his daughter and that if he did special time with his daughter she would become much more open and affectionate with him. My friend took my advice. He spent twenty minutes a day doing something that his daugh- ter chose (usually playing with blocks in her room). He spent the time listening to her and feeding back what he heard her say. Within three weeks, his daughter’s behavior dramati- cally changed. Whenever my friend would come home from work, his daughter would run to hug him, and she would hang on his leg all evening.

In one large study in which patients were treated for major depression, the National Institutes of Health compared three approaches: antidepressant medication, cogni- tive therapy (similar to my ANT therapy), and interpersonal psychotherapy (enhancing rela- tionship skills). Researchers were surprised to fi nd that each of the treatments was equally effective in treating depression; many people in the medical community think that the ben- efi ts of medication far outweigh the benefi ts of therapy. Not surprising was the fact that com- bining all three treatments had an even more powerful effect. So not only were pharmaceu- ticals and professional therapists helpful, but patients played a signifi cant role in helping each other. How you get along with other peo- ple can either help or hurt your limbic system! The better you get along with those around you, the better you will feel."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"142 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE I teach my patients the following ten rela- tional principles to help keep their deep limbic systems (and the limbic systems of those they love) healthy and rewarding: 1. Take responsibility for keeping the rela- tionship strong. Don’t be a person who blames his or her partner or friends for the relation- ship problems. Take responsibility for the relationship and look for what you can do to improve it. You’ll feel empowered, and the relationship is likely to improve almost imme- diately. 2. Never take the relationship for granted. In order for relationships to be special, they need constant nurturing. Relationships suffer when they get put low on the priority list of time and attention. Focusing on what you want in a relationship is essential to making it happen. 3. Protect your relationship. A surefi re way to doom a relationship is to discount, belittle, or degrade the other person. Protect your relationships by building up the other person. 4. Assume the best. Whenever there is a question of motivation or intention, assume"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":" Enhancing Positive Thought Patterns 143 the best about the other person. This will help his or her behavior to actually be more positive. 5. Keep the relationship fresh. When rela- tionships become stale or boring, they become vulnerable to erosion. Stay away from “the same old thing” by looking for new and differ- ent ways to add life to your relationships. 6. Notice the good. It’s very easy to notice what you do not like about a relationship. That’s almost our nature. It takes real effort to notice what you like. When you spend more time noticing the positive aspects of the rela- tionship, you’re more likely to see an increase in positive behavior. 7. Communicate clearly. I’m convinced most of the fi ghts people have stem from some form of miscommunication. Take time to really listen and understand what other people say to you. Don’t react to what you think peo- ple mean; ask them what they mean and then formulate a response. 8. Maintain and protect trust. So many relationships fall apart after there has been a major violation of trust, such as an affair or other form of dishonesty. Often hurts in the present, even minor ones, remind us of major"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"144 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE traumas in the past and we blow them way out of proportion. Once a violation of trust has occurred, try to understand why it happened. 9. Deal with diffi cult issues. Whenever you give in to another person to avoid a fi ght, you give away a little of your power. If you do this over time, you give away a lot of power and begin to resent the relationship. Avoiding confl ict in the short run often has devastating long-term effects. In a fi rm but kind way, stick up for what you think is right. It will help keep the relationship balanced. 10. Make time for each other. In our busy lives, time is often the fi rst thing to suffer in our important relationships. Relationships require real time in order to function. Many couples who both work and have children often fi nd themselves growing further apart because they have no time together. When they do spend time together, they often realize how much they really do like each other. Mak- ing your special relationships a “time investment” will pay dividends for years to come."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":" Enhancing Positive Thought Patterns 145 DL PRESCRIPTION 6: RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF PHYSICAL CONTACT The deep limbic system not only is involved in emotional bonding, it is also involved in physi- cal bonding. Actual physical touching is essential to good health. It would probably surprise some people to know that there are couples who can go for ten years and longer without touching each other. I have seen them in my practice, and they invariably show such deep limbic system problems as irritability and depression. It is only after I help them correct their nontouching behavior that their depres- sive symptoms improve. Physical connection is also a critical ele- ment in the parent-infant bonding process. The caressing, kissing, sweet words, and eye contact from the mother and father give the baby the pleasure, love, trust, and security it needs to develop healthy deep limbic path- ways. Then a bond or connectedness between the parents and the baby can begin to grow. Without love and affection, the baby does not develop appropriate deep limbic connected-"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"146 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE ness and thus never learns to trust or connect. He feels lonely and insecure, and becomes irritable and unresponsive. Touch is critical to life itself. In a barbaric thirteenth-century experiment, German Emperor Frederick II wanted to know what language and words children would speak if they were raised without hearing any words at all. He took a number of infants from their homes and put them with people who fed them but had strict instructions not to touch, cuddle, or talk to them. The babies never spoke a word. They all died before they could speak. Even though the language experiment was a failure, it resulted in an important discovery: Touch is essential to life. Salimbene, a historian of the time, wrote of the experiment in 1248, “They could not live without petting.” This power- ful fi nding has been rediscovered over and over, most recently in the early 1990s in Romania, where thousands of warehoused infants went without touch for sometimes years at a time. PET studies (similar to SPECT studies) of a number of these deprived infants have shown marked overall decreased activity across the whole brain."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":" Enhancing Positive Thought Patterns 147 Bonding is a two-way street. A naturally unresponsive baby may inadvertently receive less love from its parents. The mother and father, misreading their baby’s naturally reserved behavior, may feel hurt and rejected and therefore less encouraged to lavish care and affection on their child. A classic exam- ple of this problem is illustrated by autistic children. Psychiatrists used to label the mothers of autistic children “cold”; they believed the mother’s lack of responsiveness caused the autism. In recent times, however, it has been shown in numerous research studies that autism is biological and pre- ceded any relationship. The mothers of autistic children in their studies started out warm, but actually became more reserved when they did not get positive feedback from their children. The kind of love that is criti- cal to making the parent-infant bond work is reciprocal. Love between adults is similar. For proper bonding to occur, couples need to hold and kiss each other, say sweet words, and make affectionate eye contact. It is not enough for one side to give and the other to passively receive. Physical manifestations of love need"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"148 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE to be reciprocated or the other partner feels hurt and rejected, which ultimately causes the bond to erode. Intimate relationships require physical love in order to fl ourish. The entire relationship cannot consist of two people sitting in their respective corners having a lively conversation about the stock market (even if they both adore the stock market). An intimate relationship is missing something essential for human beings if there is not enough physical contact. With- out that element, eventually love will sour, causing one person to withdraw and perhaps look for love elsewhere. Reporting in a Life magazine cover story on touch, writers George Howe Colt and Anne Hollister cite numerous incidents of the healing power of touch: “Studies have shown massage to have positive effects on conditions from colic to hyperactivity to dia- betes to migraines, in fact, every malady TRI [Touch Research Institute, in Miami, Flor- ida] has studied thus far.” They report that “Massage, it seems, helps asthmatics breathe easier, boosts immune function in HIV-posi- tive patients, improves autistic children’s ability to concentrate, lowers anxiety in"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":" Enhancing Positive Thought Patterns 149 depressed adolescents, and reduces appre- hension in burn victims about to undergo debridement....Even in the elderly, elders exhibited less depression, lower stress hor- mones, and less loneliness. They had fewer doctor visits, drank less coffee, and made more social phone calls.” Touch is essential to our humanity. Yet, in our standoffish, litigious society, touch is becoming less and less frequent. Touch your children, your spouse, your loved ones regu- larly. Giving and receiving massages on a regular basis will enhance limbic health and limbic bonding. DL PRESCRIPTION 7: SURROUND YOURSELF WITH GREAT SMELLS Your deep limbic system is the part of your brain that directly processes your sense of smell. That is why perfumes and wonderful- smelling soaps are attractive and unpleasant body odors are repellent. In the British journal The Lancet , a study was reported on the bene- fi ts of aromatherapy using the oil from lavender flowers. When used properly, lavender oil"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"150 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE aroma helped people to feel less stressed and less depressed. It also enhanced sleep. In aro- matherapy, special fragrances are used in a steam machine, in the bath, on the pillow, and in potpourris. These fragrances can have an appreciable effect on people’s moods. How- ever, there is a difference between ingesting the substance and smelling it. When you ingest something, it goes to the stomach and is pro- cessed by the digestive system. (Moreover, many essential oils, including lavender, are dangerous if ingested.) A smell, however, acti- vates the olfactory nerves, which go directly to the deep limbic system. Consider cinnamon, used for cooking in a number of countries throughout the world. Being of Lebanese descent, my mother used to put cinnamon in many dishes she would bring to the table, including stuffed grape leaves, one of my favorites. When I recently told her that the scent of cooked cinnamon is considered a natural aphrodisiac for men, she put her hand on her forehead and said, “That’s why I have seven kids, your father would never leave me alone.” Many people have noticed that certain smells sometimes bring up very strong, clear"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":" Enhancing Positive Thought Patterns 151 memories, as if the whole feeling and sense of the original event were coming back to them. There is a good reason for that: Smell and memory are processed in the same area of the brain. Because smells activate neurocircuits in the deep limbic system, they bring about a more complete recall of events, which gives one access to details of the past with great clarity. Smells have an effect on moods. The right smells likely cool the deep limbic system. Pleasing fragrances are like an anti-infl amma- tory. By surrounding yourself with fl owers, sweet fragrances, and other pleasant smells, you affect the working of your brain in a pow- erful and positive way. DL PRESCRIPTION 8: BUILD A LIBRARY OF WONDERFUL MEMORIES Because the deep limbic system stores highly charged emotional memories, some of the memories are bound to be disturbing. One common tool for therapists has been to get clients to scan the past for negative memories so they can reprocess them. Unfortunately"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"152 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE this form of treatment can be misguided, especially for people who are truly depressed. Depressed people have selective memories. They tend to recall only things that are con- sistent with their mood. Because they have infl amed deep limbic systems, their mood is negative, and everything they remember is negative. The whole process of recollection makes their lives look like one long bad dream and convinces them that they are justifi ed in being depressed. Therapists sometimes rec- ognize this tendency in clients and interpret it to mean that the patient is somehow invested in being miserable. But there is another explanation that has to do with how the mind/body works. Whenever you remember a particular event, your brain releases chemicals similar to those released when you originally input impres- sions of the event. Consequently, remembering brings back a similar mood and feelings. If the memory is of your puppy getting hit by a car, it will put you in a melancholy mood. People whose bonding with their parents was tenta- tive at best, or who had a lot of painful childhood experiences, already have a chemi- cal imprint on the brain that is negative. They"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":" Enhancing Positive Thought Patterns 153 will tend to take in new events in a negative way. Whenever someone looks at them the wrong way, it triggers the same chemical pat- terns in the brain that are common to their early experience. They also tend to dismiss someone smiling at them and not see it as a positive expression because positive informa- tion is not consistent with their experience. This pattern is diffi cult to change because it sets up a whole way of viewing life: The early patterns continually predispose the people toward taking things in such a way as to prove to themselves that they live in a negative uni- verse. To change the pattern, they actually have to change their brain chemistry by remembering positive things. By calling up pleasant memories, they can tune in to mental states that are healthier. The brain then takes on the same chemical patterns that were inputted at the time the healthy events occurred. Because doing this is such a healing process, I encourage those who have lost a loved one to practice it. When someone dies, recalling the fi ghts and the power struggles keeps the pain going because it sets up a nega- tive mood that is self-perpetuating. By continually remembering the bad things, the"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"154 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE emotional fi lter gets set to actually keep out the good memories. This tends to focus us on the unfi nished business instead of the real love that we shared for many years. For those of us who do not have to battle depression on a daily basis, we may still fi nd ourselves in states more negative than our lives actually warrant. When unfortunate things do happen, we might go on thinking about them for longer than is helpful to solve the problem. In order to balance the bad memo- ries and heal the deep limbic part of our brain, it is important to remember the times of our life that were charged with positive emotions. Make a list of the ten happiest times in you r life. Descr ibe t hem for you rself i n detail, using as many of the fi ve senses as possible. What colors do you remember? What smells were in the air? Was there music? Try to make the picture come alive. In a metaphorical sense you are going through the library shelves of daily experience and looking for the right book.

Encouraging affi rm- ing thoughts in yourself—in other words, by recalling your partner’s caress, how he or she was helpful to you this week, a look or gesture that was particularly touching—will tune you in to a positive feeling, which in turn will dis- pose you to act lovingly. It might remind you to call your wife during the day, or to remem- ber what special gift you could give your husband on his birthday that will make him especially happy, or help both of you be sup- portive when times are tough. DL PRESCRIPTION 9: CONSIDER LIMBIC MEDICATIONS Clinical depression, manic-depressive disorder, and severe PMS are more diffi cult problems than the garden variety most people experience in the form of bad moods. The deep limbic pre- scriptions I have mentioned so far may not be effective enough to help the more seriously affected person live a happy, functional life. For complete healing to take place, the addition of antidepressant medication or appropriate herbal treatment may be needed. A sure sign that the"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"156 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE prescribed medications are really treating the depression is that the deep limbic system activ- ity normalizes. Whenever limbic activity normalizes, there is a corresponding decrease in the patient’s symptoms. In recent years, new antidepressants have entered the market that have a wider applica- tion and often have fewer side effects than the original antidepressants. Some of the new pharmaceuticals have the additional benefi t of affecting the subclinical patterns the rest of us are more likely to experience at some time in our lives, such as moodiness and negativity. The appendix contains information on cur- rent antidepressant medications that include the brand name, generic name, and dosage range. In treating clinical depression, it is important to use enough medication for a long enough period of time. Often, antidepressants take from two to four weeks to become effec- tive. It is essential to work closely with your doctor on this; stopping medication suddenly can have serious repercussions. Saint-John’s-wort is an herbal treatment that has also been shown to have a positive impact on depression and a cooling infl uence on deep limbic structures. It has been used in Europe"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":" Enhancing Positive Thought Patterns 157 for many years and it is the most commonly prescribed antidepressant with the fewest side effects. For adults I recommend 500 milligrams two times a day of Saint-John’s-wort, contain- ing 0.3% hypericin. Even though Saint-John’s-wort has fewer side effects than traditional antidepressants, it is not without side effects altogether. Some people become sun-sensitive and become more easily sun- burned. Some get acne. Also, I had one patient who developed a seriously slow heart rate after taking it for a month. I believe if you are taking Saint-John’s-wort for depression, you should do it under the supervision of a psychiatrist. For the best results with all my patients, however, I often combine the use of medica- tions with the deep limbic prescriptions described in this chapter. DL PRESCRIPTION 10: TRY PHYSICAL EXERCISE Physical exercise can be very healing to the deep limbic system. It releases endorphins that induce a sense of well-being.

Think about what blood fl ow and nourishment do for the rest of your body. A body that is constricted or emaciated doesn’t feel good. The same is true for the brain. Good blood fl ow resets the deep limbic system to a healthy level, which in turn favorably affects the person’s mood. People who exercise regularly report a gen- eral sense of well-being that those who lead a sedentary lifestyle do not experience. They have increased energy and a healthy appetite, they sleep more soundly and are usually in a better mood. Over the years I have found it u s e f u l t o p r e s c r i b e p h y s i c a l e x e r c i s e t o d e p r e s s e d patients. This is even more important for peo- ple who are unable to tolerate antidepressant medication. Instead of taking medication, some are able to treat themselves, under their doc- tor’s supervision, with a program of strenuous exercise, which makes them feel just as good as something from the pharmacy. In the fast pace of modern life—long work hours, rush-hour commutes, two-parent working families—it is important to remem- ber how essential exercise and personal care are to good health; don’t let them be left out."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":" Enhancing Positive Thought Patterns 159 Technology has worked against us in some ways because many of the advances in the past twenty years have reduced and even elimi- nated physical activity and exertion from our daily lives. In the movie L.A. Story , Steve Martin runs out of his house, jumps in his car, drives ten yards to his neighbor’s house, hops back out, and knocks at his neighbor’s door. A bit of an exaggeration, perhaps, but think of how many times we could walk to the neigh- borhood store to get a newspaper but instead decide to save time and drive. This inactive lifestyle is causing our bodies to lose their effi - ciency; in other words, they don’t burn fat as they should. Experts in nutrition, physiology, and medicine all agree that a program of phys- ical exertion on a continuing basis is required to maintain low body fat, a strong and healthy heart, and well-toned muscles. A good exercise program will pay limbic dividends as well: 1. Exercise gives you more energy and keeps you from feeling lethargic. 2.

Tryptophan is the precursor to the neurotransmitter serotonin, which has been found to be low in many depressed patients. Tryptophan is a relatively small amino acid, and it often has to compete with larger amino acids to cross the blood channels into the brain. With exercise, the muscles of the body utilize the larger amino acids and decrease the competition for tryptophan to enter the brain. Exercise makes you feel better. A lot of people grumble and complain when they’re told to get more exercise. They fi nd exercise time-consuming and boring. My advice is to keep trying different activities until you fi nd the one that suits you. Find out what you like best. But make sure you get some form of regular workout (walking, run- ning, cycling) on a daily basis, and an aerobic workout (which increases your heart rate and the f low of oxygen to your muscles) three times a week for at least twenty minutes a shot."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":" Enhancing Positive Thought Patterns 161 Many people make the mistake of thinking that the sport they play as a hobby fulfi lls their exercise quota, yet the truth is that it depends on the sport. I once treated an obese man by outlining a nutrition and exercise program for him. Several weeks into it, he complained he wasn’t losing any weight. When I asked what kind of workout he was getting, he told me he played two whole rounds of golf a week. I had to point out to him that walking around a golf course would not give him the level of activity he needed because it wasn’t continuous—a golfer has to keep stopping to hit the ball. With a surprised look on his face, he said, “Wait a minute, Doc. I don’t walk and stop to hit the ball. I get out of the cart, hit the ball, and then get back in the cart. That’s a lot of activity, hopping in and out of that cart!” DL PRESCRIPTION 11: WATCH YOUR LIMBIC NUTRITION Over the past decade there has been signifi cant research on food, nutrients, and depression. The results surprise many people. We have been inundated by nutritional experts and news reporters who tell us we should eat low-fat, high-"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"162 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE carbohydrate diets. “Low fat” is everywhere. Unfortunately, low fat is not the complete answer. In two studies in the American Journal of Psychiatry , men who had the highest suicide rates had the lowest cholesterol levels. Our deep limbic system needs fat in order to operate prop- erly. Certainly, some fats are better for us than others, such as the omega-3 fatty acids found most prevalently in fi sh. Protein is also essential to a healthy “deep limbic diet.” Proteins are the building blocks of brain neurotransmitters. Low levels of dopamine, serotonin, and norepineph- rine have all been implicated in depression and mood disorders. It is essential to eat enough protein in balanced amounts with fats and car- bohydrates. Too much protein for some people may actually restrict the amount of “brain pro- teins” that cross into the brain. Not enough protein will leave you with a brain protein defi - cit. The richest sources of protein are lean fi sh, cheese, beans, and nuts. Low serotonin levels are often associated with worrying, moodiness, emotional rigidity, and irritability (a combination of deep limbic and cingulate problems). To enhance serotonin levels, eat balanced meals with complex carbo- hydrate snacks (such as whole-grain crackers or"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":" Enhancing Positive Thought Patterns 163 bread). Exercise can be a tremendous help along with nutritional supplementation. The amino acid l-tryptophan, which was recently reapproved by the Food and Drug Administra- tion, is an option. L-tryptophan is a naturally occurring amino acid found in milk, meat, and eggs. I have found it very helpful for patients to improve sleep, decrease aggressiveness, and improve mood control. In addition, it does not have side effects, which gives it a real advantage over the antidepressants. L-tryptophan was taken off the market a number of years ago because one contaminated batch from one manufacturer caused a rare disease and a num- ber of deaths. The l-tryptophan itself actually had nothing to do with the deaths. I recom- mend l-tryptophan in doses of 1,000—3,000 milligrams taken at bedtime. There have been some recent studies with inositol, from the B vitamin family, which you can get from a health food store. In doses of 12—20 milligrams a day it has been shown to decrease moodiness and depression. Check with your doctor before tak- ing these or any other supplements.

To enhance norepinephrine and dopamine levels, it is better to have protein snacks (such as meat, eggs, or cheese) and to avoid simple carbohydrates, such as bread, pasta, cakes, and candy. Also, I often have my patients take natural amino acids such as tyro- sine (1,000—1,500 milligrams a day) for energy, focus, and impulsivity control, and dl- phenylalanine (400 milligrams three times a day on an empty stomach) for moodiness and irritability.

The basal ganglia allow for a smooth integration of emotions, thoughts, and physical movement, and when there is too much input, they tend to lock up. A patient of mine was badly burned in a motorcycle acci- dent in San Francisco. As he lay burning on the ground, people stood nearby, frozen with fear, unable to move to help him. For years he was confounded by their actions, wondering why no one had moved to help him. “Didn’t they care? Was I not worth trying to help?” he wondered. For years this man lived with both the physical pain from the accident and the emotional pain of feeling that others did not care enough to help him. He was relieved to learn a new interpretation of the situation: The intensity of emotion caused by the fi ery accident had overwhelmed the onlookers’ basal ganglia and they had become unable to move, even though most of them probably wanted to help.  When the basal ganglia are overactive (as we have seen in the case of people with anxi- ety tendencies or disorders), people are more likely to be overwhelmed by stressful situa- tions and have a tendency to freeze or become immobile (in thoughts or actions). When their"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"168 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE basal ganglia are underactive (as we have seen in people who have attention defi cit disorder [ADD]), often a stressful situation moves them to action. People with ADD are fre- quently the first ones on the scene of an accident, and they respond to stressful situa- tions without fear. I know, for example, that one of my friends who has ADD is a lot quicker at responding to crises than I am (as men- tioned in chapter 2, I have naturally overactive basal ganglia). I remember one situation where we were leaving a restaurant and paying the bill at the counter when the lady in front of us suddenly fell to the ground. My friend quickly went to her aid while I stood there frozen by the intensity of the situation. And I had medi- cal training; my friend did not! I used to feel guilty about not moving quickly in those situ- ations, but it has helped to learn that my brain just doesn’t permit me to do so. The activity in my basal ganglia makes it harder to move quickly in anxiety-provoking situations. Shifting and smoothing fi ne motor behavior is another basal ganglia function and is essen- tial to handwriting and motor coordination. Again, let’s use the example of attention defi cit disorder. Many children and adults with ADD"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":" Looking Into Anxiety and Fear 169 have very poor handwriting. The act of hand- writing is diffi cult and often stressful for them. Their writing may be choppy or sloppy. In fact, many teens and adults with ADD print instead of writing in cursive. They fi nd printing easier because it is not a smooth, continuous motor movement, but rather a start-and-stop motor activity. Many people with ADD also complain that they have trouble getting their thoughts out of their head and onto paper, a term called fi nger agnosia (the fi ngers cannot tell what the brain is thinking). We know that the medica- tions that help ADD, such as the psychostimulants Ritalin, Dexedrine, or Adder- all, work by enhancing the production of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the basal gan- Tommy, age fourteen, handwriting, no medication Tommy’s handwriting after ADD diagnosis and treatment with stimulant medication"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"170 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE glia. These medications sometimes improve handwriting and enhance a person’s ability to get his or her thoughts onto paper to an amaz- ing extent. In addition, many people with ADD say that their overall motor coordination is improved by these medications. Here is an example from one of my patients. Another clue about the motor control func- tions of the basal ganglia comes from the understanding of two other illnesses, Parkin- son’s disease (PD) and Tourette’s syndrome (TS). PD is caused by a defi ciency of dopa- mine within the basal ganglia system. It is characterized by a “pill rolling” hand tremor, muscle rigidity, cogwheeling (jerking, stop- and-start movements when trying to rotate a joint), loss of agility, loss of facial expression, and slow movements. Often, giving persons dopamine-enhancing drugs, such as l-dopa, signifi cantly alleviates these symptoms, allow- ing smoother motor movements. The basal ganglia are also involved in suppressing unwanted motor activity. When there are abnormalities in this part of the brain, people are more at risk for Tourette’s syndrome, which is a combination of motor and vocal tics (more on TS later in the chapter)."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":" Looking Into Anxiety and Fear 171 In our brain-imaging work, we have seen that the basal ganglia must also be involved in setting the body’s “idle,” or anxiety, level. Overactive basal ganglia are often associated with anxiety, tension, increased awareness, and heightened fear. Underactive basal gan- glia can cause problems with motivation, energy, and get-up-and-go. Interestingly, some of the most highly moti- vated individuals we have scanned, such as company CEOs, have significant increased activity in this part of the brain. We theorize that some people can use this increased activity in the form of motivation to become “movers” in society. My mother, for example, who like me has increased activity in this part of the brain, does tend to be a bit anxious, but she is a woman on the go. She plays golf four or fi ve times a week, raised seven children without appearing stressed, and is always up “doing something” for other people. I believe that using the increased energy and drive from increased basal ganglia activity helps ward off anxiety. Another interesting fi nding about this part of the brain is that the basal ganglia are likely involved in the pleasure control loops of the brain. One brain-imaging study performed by"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"172 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE Nora Volkow’s group at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York, looked at where cocaine and Ritalin work in the brain. Both were taken up mostly by the basal ganglia. Cocaine is an addictive sub- stance; Ritalin, in doses prescribed for ADD, is not. The study clearly showed why. Cocaine is a powerful enhancer of dopamine availabil- ity in the brain, and it has both very fast uptake and clearance from the brain. It comes on strong in a powerful wave, and then it’s gone. The user gets a high high, and when it’s gone, he or she wants more. In contrast, while Rit- Bill’s Love-Affected Brain 3-D underside active view Note increased right and left basal ganglia activity (arrows)."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":" Looking Into Anxiety and Fear 173 alin also increases the availability of dopamine to the basal ganglia, its effects are less power- ful and it clears from the brain at a much slower rate. Dr. Volkow’s group postulated that activation of the basal ganglia by cocaine perpetuates the compulsive desire for the drug. Ritalin, on the other hand, enhances motivation, focus, and follow-through, but does not give users a high or an intense desire to use more (unless at much higher doses than clinically prescribed). In fact, one the biggest clinical problems I have with teenagers who have ADD is that they forget to take their medication. Intense romantic love can also have a cocainelike effect on the brain, robustly releasing dopamine in the basal ganglia. Love has real physical effects. I had the opportu- nity to scan a close friend, Bill, shortly after he had met a new woman. He was head over heels for her. After their third date, when they spent the day at the beach in each oth- er’s arms, my friend came by my offi ce to tell me about his newfound love. He was so happy he almost seemed to have a drug high. By coincidence, while Bill was talking, my nuclear technician came into my offi ce and"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"174 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE told me we had an extra dose of the isotope and could do another scan if I had someone who needed one. Since I had an earlier scan of Bill’s brain as part of our normal control group, I decided we’d scan him again and get a look at the brain of new love. To my amaze- ment, his brain looked as if he had just taken a lot of cocaine. The activity in both the right and left basal ganglia was very intense, almost to the point of resembling seizure activity. Love has real effects on the brain, as power- ful as addictive drugs.

Almost all of the patients we have treated with panic disorder whom we’ve scanned had heightened basal ganglia activity. Here’s an example of panic disorder. Gary Gary came to see me about eight years ago. He had fi rst gone to his doctor complaining of back pain. The doctor examined Gary’s back and found a tender spot over his kidneys. He asked Gary to get a kidney X ray. As soon as the doctor asked him to get this X ray, Gary’s thoughts took off: “The doctor is going to fi nd out I have cancer.” (Notice the leap in logic!)

Then Gary had a panic attack. His heart began to race. His hands became ice cold. He started to hyper- ventilate. And he broke out in a heavy sweat. He turned to the doctor and said, “I can’t have that X ray.” Bewildered, the doctor replied, “What do you mean? You came to see me to get help. I need this X ray, so I can fi gure out...” Gary said, “No, you don’t understand! I can’t have the X ray!” The doctor found my number, called me, and said, “Daniel, please help me with this guy.” As Gary told me this story, I knew that he had a lifelong panic disorder. Gary was also an expert at predicting the worst, which was driving his panic symptoms. In treating Gary, I taught him the Basal Ganglia Prescriptions given in Chapter 6. I even went with him to have the kidney X rays because it was important to have it done quickly. I hypnotized him, enabling him to be calm through the procedure. He did wonder- fully. He breathed in a relaxed way, and he went through the procedure without any prob-"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":" Looking Into Anxiety and Fear 177 lems—until the X-ray technician came back into the room with a worried look on his face and asked Gary which side of his body was giving him pain. Gary grabbed his chest and looked at me like “You SOB! I knew you were lying to me about this! I’m going to die!” I patted him on the leg and said, “Look, Gary, before you die, let me take a look at the X ray” (psychiatrists are also medical doctors). As I looked at his X ray I could see that Gary had a big kidney stone, which can be terribly pain- ful—but kidney stones don’t usually kill anybody! Gary’s basal ganglia, which were working too hard, put him through tremen- dous emotional pain by causing him to predict the worst possible outcome to situations. Basal ganglia anxiety can make pain worse. As Gary became more anxious about his pain, the anxiety signals caused his muscles to con- tract; the smooth muscles in the ureter (the tube from the kidneys to the bladder) con- tracted, clamping down on the stone and intensifying the pain.

Marsha Marsha, a critical care nurse, was forced into treatment by her husband. She was thirty-six years old when she fi rst began experiencing panic attacks. She was in a grocery store when all of a sudden she felt dizzy and short of breath, with a racing heart and a terrible sense of impending doom. She left her cart in the store and ran to her car, where she cried for over an hour. After her fi rst episode, the panic attacks increased in frequency to the point where she stopped going out of her house, fearing that she’d have an attack and be unable to get help.

Mood stabilizers, such as lithium, Tegretol, or Depakote, can be helpful in decreasing the irritability and calming down focal “hot” areas in the brain. I placed Mark on Depakote. Almost immediately, his head- aches disappeared and he began to feel calmer.

Nearly every day for thirteen months of the war, he had had to be “on alert” in order to avoid being shot. Through the years, he had never had the chance to learn how to reset his brain back to normal. The medication and therapy allowed him to relax and feel, for the fi rst time in twenty-fi ve years, that he had truly left the war zone. CONFLICT AVOIDANCE Anxiety is, by defi nition, very uncomfortable. Thus, people who are anxious tend to avoid any situations that make them more uncom- fortable, especially dealing with conflict. People who have basal ganglia problems tend to be frozen by confl ict and consequently do what they can to avoid it.

For years Loren wouldn’t talk about the things in his marriage that made him unhappy. He would just hold them in until he fi nally exploded.

Being very bright, she advanced quickly until she got to a position in which she had to deal with high-powered men who were competitive and accustomed to con- fl ict and confrontation. Betsy reacted to these men by becoming quiet and deferential. She looked for ways to please them, in order to avoid the anxiety that she perceived would overwhelm her if open confl ict were to occur.

Betsy initially came to see me for a severe panic disorder that prevented her from driv- ing. Her husband and friends had to drive her everywhere because she was afraid she’d have a panic attack. In treatment, I taught her how to deal with confl ict. I taught her how to face these men and not run away from them. Subsequently she began to speak up in meetings and stand up for her positions in the company. Upper management began to pay attention to her in a positive way. It’s very important to learn ways to soothe your basal ganglia. Otherwise, the anxiety and programming from the past will rule your life. TOURETTE’S SYNDROME (TS) TS is a very interesting disorder that provides the bridge between the basal ganglia and two seemingly opposite disorders, attention defi cit disorder (ADD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). TS is characterized by motor and vocal tics lasting more than a year. Motor"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"186 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE tics are involuntary physical movements such as eye blinking, head jerking, shoulder shrug- ging, and arm or leg jerking. Vocal tics typically involve making involuntary noises such as coughing, puffing, blowing, barking, and sometimes swearing (coprolalia). TS runs in families and may be associated with several genetic abnormalities found in the dopamine family of genes. SPECT studies of TS patients, by my clinic and others, have found abnormal- ities in the basal ganglia of the brain. One of the most fascinating aspects of TS is its high association with both ADD and OCD. It is estimated that 60 percent of people with TS have ADD and 50 percent have OCD. On the surface it would appear that these are oppos- ing disorders. People with ADD have trouble paying attention, while people with OCD pay too much attention to their negative thoughts (obsessions) or behaviors (compulsions). In looking further at patients with both ADD and OCD, I have found a high association of each disease in their family histories. So, for exam- ple, people with ADD often have relatives with OCD-like features and people with OCD have people in their families with ADD. There is even a subtype of ADD that has been termed"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":" Looking Into Anxiety and Fear 187 overfocused ADD; affected people have symp- toms of both inattention and overfocus. A crash course in the neurotransmitters (chemical messengers that help the brain to function) dopamine and serotonin is neces- sary here. In the brain there tends to be a balancing mechanism between dopamine and serotonin. This balance tends to be tipped in the basal ganglia. Dopamine is involved with motor movements, motiva- tion, attention span, and setting the body’s idle speed. Serotonin is more involved with mood control, shifting attention, and cogni- tive fl exibility. When something happens in the brain to raise dopamine levels, serotonin becomes less effective; and when serotonin levels are raised, dopamine becomes less effective. For example, when I give someone a psychostimulant to treat ADD, it works by effectively raising the availability of dopa- mine in the basal ganglia. This helps with focus, follow-through, and motivation. If I give him too much, he may become obses- sive, moody, and infl exible (symptoms of too little serotonin). Likewise, if I give someone who has ADD a medication that enhances serotonin availability in the brain, such as"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"188 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE Prozac (a selective serotonin reuptake inhib- itor), his ADD symptoms are likely to become worse, but he won’t care that they are worse and will also show lowered moti- vation. Since the basal ganglia are involved with dopamine production (low in A DD) and shif t- ing and suppressing motor movements (lack of smoothness or cogwheeling may result in tics) and have been found to be overactive in OCD (in conjunction with the cingulate gyrus), the basal ganglia are likely signifi cantly involved in all three of these disorders. Block- ing dopamine with certain antipsychotic medications, such as Haldol (haloperidol) and Orap (pimozide), helps to suppress tics but makes ADD symptoms worse. Psychostimu- lants, such as Ritalin (methylphenidate), Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine), or Adderall (a combination of amphetamine salts), help ADD symptoms but have a variable effect on tics (they may make them better or worse). In addition, as mentioned, psychostimulants tend to exacerbate OCD symptoms and cause people to focus more on the thoughts or behaviors that bother them. An interference mechanism in the basal ganglia is likely to be"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":" Looking Into Anxiety and Fear 189 part of the picture, upsetting the dopamine- serotonin balance in the brain. FINE MOTOR PROBLEMS As discussed earlier, fi ne motor problems are often associated with basal ganglia abnormali- ties. We discussed handwriting problems earlier in this chapter. Another interesting connection probably related to basal ganglia activity is the development of fi ne motor tremors when we become anxious. When I lecture in front of an audience, I don’t hold papers in my hands because the paper may start to rattle or shake in response to anxiety I feel. When the basal ganglia are overactive, we are more at risk for increased muscle tone or tremors. In my prac- tice I have often prescribed the medication propranolol to calm the tremors musicians get during a performance. Increased muscle tension related to overac- tive basal ganglia activity is often associated with headaches. I have noticed that a number of people with resistant headaches have intense focal areas of increased activity in the basal gan- glia. This seems to occur with both muscle contraction headaches (often described as a"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"190 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE pain in the back of the neck or as a tight band around the forehead) and migraines (usually one-sided throbbing headaches that may be preceded by a visual aura or other warning phe- nomena). Interestingly, often anticonvulsant medication such as Depakote or Teg retol, which decreases areas of overactivity in the brain, is helpful in decreasing some types of headaches. LOW AND HIGH MOTIVATION As mentioned, motivation tends to be low in dopamine-defi cient states, such as ADD. Inter- estingly, when serotonin levels are raised too high, decreased motivation also becomes a problem. Physicians know that when they overshoot the dose of serotonin-enhancing antidepressants (such as Prozac [fl uoxetine], Zoloft [sertraline], Paxil [paroxetine], or Luvox [fl uvoxamine]), lowered motivation is often the result. Many people have told me they stopped these medications because they stopped doing things that were important to their business or home life. One CEO told me he had stopped taking Zoloft because he wasn’t keeping up with his paperwork and he really didn’t care. “That’s not like me,” he said."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":" Looking Into Anxiety and Fear 191 Heightened dopamine or basal ganglia states may also cause increased or even exces- sive motivation. As I mentioned earlier, we found that many CEOs of corporations have enhanced basal ganglia activity. They also tend to work excessive hours. In fact, week- ends tend to be the hardest time for these people. During the week, they charge through each day, getting things done. On the week- end, during unstructured time, they often complain of feeling restless, anxious, and out of sorts. Relaxation is foreign to them. In fact, it is downright uncomfortable. Workaholics may be made in the basal ganglia. Their inter- nal idle speed, or energy level, doesn’t allow them to rest. Of course, there is a positive cor- relate. Many of the people in society who make things happen are driven by basal ganglia that keep them working for long periods of time. BASAL GANGLIA CHECKLIST Here is a basal ganglia system checklist.

Remember, the basal gan- glia are involved with integrating feelings and movement, shifting and smoothing motor behavior, setting the body’s idle speed or anx- iety level, modulating motivation, and driving feelings of pleasure and ecstasy.

Learning to overcome"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":" Mastering Fear 195 the tendency toward pessimistic predictions is very helpful in healing this part of the brain. Through the years, I have met many people who tell me that they’re pessimists. They say that if they expect the worst to happen in a situ- ation, they will never be disappointed. Even though they may never be disappointed, they are likely to die earlier. The constant stress from negative predictions lowers immune system effectiveness and increases the risk of becoming ill. Your thoughts affect every cell in your body. Learning how to kill the fortune-telling ANTs that go through your mind is essential to effectively dealing with the anxiety gener- ated in this part of the brain. Whenever you feel anxious or tense, try the following steps. STEP 1 Write down the event that is causing you anxi- ety, for example, having to get up in front of people to give a speech. STEP 2 Notice and write down the automatic thoughts that come into your mind. Odds are, when you are anxious, your thoughts are predicting a"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"196 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE negative outcome to a situation. Common anxiety-provoking thoughts include “They will think I’m stupid. Others will laugh at me. I will stumble on my words. I will shake and look nervous.” STEP 3 Label or identify the thought as a fortune-tell- ing ANT. Often, just naming the thought can help take away its power. STEP 4 Talk back to the automatic negative thought and “kill the ANT.” Write down a response to defuse the negative thought. In this example, write something like “Odds are they won’t laugh and I’ll do a good job. If they do laugh, I’ll laugh with them. I know that speaking in public is nerve-racking for many people, and probably some people will feel empathy for me if I’m nervous.” Do not accept every thought that comes into your mind.

You do not have to believe every thought that comes into your mind. You can learn to change this pattern and help your basal gan- glia cool down by predicting the best things. BG PRESCRIPTION 2: USE GUIDED IMAGERY It is important to set (or reset) your basal gan- glia to a relaxed, healthy level. This is best done by a regimen of daily relaxation. Taking twenty to thirty minutes a day to train relaxation into your body will have many benefi cial effects, including decreasing anxiety, lowering blood pressure, lowering tension and pain in the muscles, and improving your temperament around others. Guided imagery is a wonderful technique to use on a daily basis. Instructions: Find a quiet place where you can go and be alone for twenty to thirty minutes every day. Sit in a comfortable chair (you can lie down if you won’t fall asleep) and train your mind to be quiet. In your mind’s eye, choose your own special haven. I ask my patients, “If you could go anywhere in the world to feel relaxed and content, where would you go?”"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"198 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE Imagine your special place with all of your senses.

Breathe slowly, calmly, deeply. Enjoy your minivacation. BG PRESCRIPTION 3: TRY DIAPHRAGMATIC BREATHING Breathe slowly and deeply, mostly with your belly . This is one of the main exercises I teach my patients who have panic disorders. I actually write out a panic plan for them to carry with them.

The purpose of breathing is to get oxygen from the air into your body and to blow off waste products such as carbon diox- ide. Every cell in your body needs oxygen in order to function. Brain cells are particularly sensitive to oxygen, as they start to die within four minutes when they are deprived of it. Slight changes in oxygen content in the brain can alter the way a person feels and behaves. When a person gets angry, his or her breath- ing pattern changes almost immediately. Breathing becomes shallower and signifi cantly faster. This breathing pattern is ineffi cient, and the oxygen content in the angry person’s blood is lowered. Subsequently there is less oxygen available to a person’s brain and he or she may become more irritable, impulsive, confused, and prone to negative behavior (such as yelling, threatening, or hitting another person). Learn to breathe properly . Try this exercise: Sit in a chair. Get comfortable. Close your eyes. Put one hand on your chest and one hand on your belly. Then, for several minutes, feel the rhythm of your breathing."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"200 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE Do you breathe mostly with your chest? Mostly with your belly? Or with both your chest and belly? The way you breathe has a huge impact on how you feel moment by moment. Have you ever watched a baby breathe? Or a puppy? They breathe almost exclusively with their bellies. They move their upper chest very little in breathing. Yet most adults breathe almost totally from the upper part of their chest. To correct this negative breathing pattern, I teach my patients to become experts at breath- ing slowly and deeply, mostly with their bellies. In my offi ce, I have some very sophisticated biofeedback equipment that uses strain gauges to measure breathing activity. I place one gauge around a person’s chest and a second one around his or her belly. The biofeedback equipment measures the movement of the chest and belly as the person breathes in and out. If you expand your belly (using the dia- phragm muscles there) when you breathe in, it allows room for your lungs to infl ate down- ward, increasing the amount of air available to your body. I teach my patients to breathe with their bellies by watching their pattern on the computer screen. In about a half hour’s time,"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":" Mastering Fear 201 most people can learn how to change their breathing patterns, which relaxes them and gives them better control over how they feel and behave. If you do not have access to sophisticated biofeedback equipment, lie on your back and place a small book on your belly. When you breathe in, make the book go up, and when you breathe out, make the book go down. Shifting the center of breathing lower in your body will help you feel more relaxed and in better control of yourself. Practice this dia- phragmatic breathing for fi ve or ten minutes a day to settle down your basal ganglia. This has been one of the most helpful exer- cises for me personally. When I fi rst learned how to breathe diaphragmatically, I discov- ered that my baseline breathing rate was twenty-four breaths a minute and I breathed mostly with my upper chest. I had spent ten years in the military, being taught to stick my chest out and suck my gut in (the opposite of what is good for breathing). Quickly I learned how to quiet my breathing and help it be more effi cient. Not only did it help my feelings of anxiety, it also helped me feel more settled overall.

I also use it, in conjunc- tion with self-hypnosis, to help me sleep when I feel stressed. My current baseline breathing rate is less than ten times a minute. BG PRESCRIPTION 4: TRY MEDITATION/SELF-HYPNOSIS There are many forms of meditation. They often involve diaphragmatic breathing and guided imagery. Herbert Benson, M.D., in his classic book, The Relaxation Response , describes how he had his patients focus on one word, and do nothing but that for a period of time each day. If other thoughts started to distract them, they were to train their mind to refocus on that one word. He reported startling results from this simple exercise: His patients had sig- nificant decreases in blood pressure and muscle tension. Self-hypnosis taps into a natural “basal ganglia soothing” power source that most people do not even know exists. It is found within you, within your ability to focus your concentration. Many people do not under- stand that hypnosis is a natural phenomenon."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":" Mastering Fear 203 It is an altered state we frequently go into and out of. Some natural examples of hypnosis include “highway hypnosis,” in which our sense of time and consciousness becomes altered. Have you ever taken a long trip and not remembered a town you drove through? Or has a period of a couple of hours passed in what seemed like only twenty or thirty min- utes? Time distortion is a common trait of hypnotic states. Have you ever become so engrossed in a good book or a good movie that two hours rushed by in what seemed like minutes? We become so focused that we enter a hypnotic state. As you might imagine, because I have natu- rally overactive basal ganglia with a tendency toward anxiety, my medical internship year pro- duced only more anxiety. When I worked on the cardiac intensive care unit, I had a lot of trouble getting to sleep at night because I was so anx- ious over the condition of the patients under my care. Being tired the next day didn’t help mat- ters much. I had learned hypnosis as a medical student, and even used it with the nursing staff to help them stop smoking and lose weight. I hadn’t thought of using it on myself. Besides, I rationalized, I wasn’t really very hypnotizable."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"204 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE Late one evening, one of my patients had prob- lems getting to sleep. He requested a sleeping pill. I thought it might be a better idea to use hypnosis to help him sleep. He was agreeable, and it worked quickly. When I made rounds the next morning, the patient asked me what he was going to do that night when I wasn’t on call. I taught him self-hypnosis and came up with sev- eral sleep prescriptions. It then dawned on me to use self-hypnosis on myself. I learned that self-hypnosis, like most things, is a skill that gets better with practice. I got to the point where I could put myself to sleep in less than one minute through a simple self-hypnotic technique. Good sleep also helps calm anxiety. Sleep deprivation makes everything worse. Here are the easy self-hypnotic steps I use personally. Set aside two to three ten-minute periods the fi rst day and just go through the following six steps.

Repeat the deep breath and slowly exhale three times. With each breath in, feel your chest and belly rise and imagine breathing in peace and calmness. With each breath out, feel your chest and belly relax and blow out all the tension, all the things getting in the way of your relaxing. By this time, you’ll notice a calm come over you.

STEP 5 After your whole body feels relaxed, imagine yourself at the top of an escalator. Step on the escalator and ride down, slowly counting back- wards from twenty.

Imagine it with all of your senses for several minutes. This is where the fun starts. After you’ve gone through the relaxation steps and have imagined yourself in your haven, your mind is ripe for change. Begin to experience yourself as you want to be—not as you currently are but as you want to be. Plan on spending at least twenty min- utes a day on this refueling, life-changing exercise. You’ll be amazed at the results. During each session, choose an idea, ideal, or feeling state to focus on. Stay with the idea, ideal, or feeling state until you can imagine yourself engulfed in it.

Did you know that one of the most common fears in America is the fear of public speaking? I have had a number of patients tell me that they failed a class in college because they refused to get up in front of the class and give a speech. That fear was based on how they felt others would judge them or their presentation. Those who have a fear of public speaking often tell themselves that people in the crowd will silently mock them or think bad things about them. The truth is, however, that probably some of the people in the audience aren’t even listening to their presentation because they are thinking about their anxiety over their own presentation or about their own personal prob- lems.

Many people are so afraid of conflict with others that they do everything they can to avoid any turmoil. This “confl ict phobia” actually sets up relationships for more turmoil rather than less. Here are four typical scenarios of people who fear confl ict: 1. In an attempt to be a “loving parent,” Sara fi nds herself always giving in to her four- year-old son’s temper tantrums. She is frustrated by how much the tantrums have increased in frequency over the past year. She now feels powerless and gives in just to keep the peace."},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":" Mastering Fear 213 2. Billy, a ten-year-old boy, was bullied by a bigger ten-year-old named Ryan. Ryan threat- ened to hurt Billy if he didn’t give him his lunch money. To avoid being hurt, Billy spent the year terrifi ed by Ryan. 3. Kelly found herself feeling very distant from her husband, Carl. She felt that he always tried to control her and treated her like a child. He would complain about how much money she spent, what she wore, and who her friends were. Even though this really bothered Kelly, she said little because she didn’t want to fi ght. However, she found that her interest in sex was nonexistent, she often felt tired and irri- table, and she preferred to spend her free time with her friends rather than with Carl. 4. Bill worked as the foreman for Chet’s company for six years. Over the past four years, Chet had become increasingly critical of Bill and belittled him in front of others.

In order to have any personal power in a relationship, we must be willing to stand up for ourselves and for what we know is right. This does not mean we have to be mean or nasty; there are rational and kind ways to be fi rm. But fi rmness is essential.

Sara needs to make a rule that whenever her son throws a tantrum to get his way, he will not get what he wants, period. No excep- tions . By giving in to his tantrums, Sara has taught her son to throw them, which not only hurts his relationship with his mother but will also teach him to be overdemanding with oth- ers and will hurt his ability to relate socially to others.

By giving in to the bully, Billy taught Ryan that his intimidating behavior was okay. Standing up to him early, even if it meant being beaten up, would have been better than spending a whole year in pain. Almost all bul- lies pick on people who won’t fi ght back. They use intimidation and are rarely interested in real confl ict. 3. Kelly made a strategic mistake by avoid- ing confl ict early in her relationship with Carl.

Nervous- ness, chronic stress, panic attacks, and muscle tension often respond to medications when the other techniques are ineffective. There are fi ve classes of medication helpful in treating anxiety. Benzodiazepines are common antianxiety medications that have been available for many years.

On the negative side, long- term use can cause addiction. In the panic plan I discussed earlier, I often prescribe Xanax as a short-term antianxiety medication to use in conjunction with the other basal gan- glia prescriptions. BuSpar (buspirone) is often very effective in treating long-term anxiety. It also has the benefi t of not being addictive. On the negative side, it takes a few weeks to be effective and it must be taken all of the time to be effective. It has been shown to have a calming effect on aggressive behavior. Certain antidepressants, such as Tofranil (imipramine) and the MAO inhibitor Nardil (phenelzine), are especially helpful for people who have panic disorders. I have found these medications to be helpful in patients who have both limbic system and basal ganglia problems. Focal basal ganglia abnormalities, like focal limbic system changes, are often helped with nerve-stabilizing medications, such as lithium, Tegretol, or Depakote.

BG PRESCRIPTION 8: WATCH YOUR BASAL GANGLIA NUTRITION As mentioned in the Deep Limbic System Prescriptions chapter, what you eat has an important effect on how you feel. If your symp- toms refl ect heightened basal ganglia activity and anxiety, you’ll do better with a balanced diet that does not allow you to get too hungry during the day. Hypoglycemic episodes make anxiety much worse. If you have low basal gan- glia activity and low motivation, you will likely do better with a high-protein, low-carbohy- drate diet to give yourself more energy during the day.

It occupies the front third of the brain, underneath the forehead. It is often divided into three sections: the dorsal lateral section (on the outside surface of the pfc), the inferior orbital section (on the front undersur- face of the brain), and the cingulate gyrus (which runs through the middle of the frontal lobes). The cingulate gyrus, often considered to be part of the limbic system, will be covered in its own chapter. The dorsal lateral and inferior orbital gyrus are often termed the executive control center of the brain and will be discussed together in this chapter. When necessary, I’ll distinguish what is known about their functions. Overall, the pfc is the part of the brain that watches, supervises, guides, directs, and focuses your behavior. It supervises “executive functions,” governing abilities such as time management, judgment, impulse control, planning, organization, and critical thinking. Our ability as a species to think, plan ahead, use time wisely, and communicate with others is heavily infl uenced by this part of the brain. The pfc is responsible for behaviors that are necessary for you to be goal-directed, socially responsible, and effective."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"224 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE North Carolina neuropsychiatrist Thomas Gualtieri succinctly summarized the human functions of the pfc as “the capacity to formu- late goals, to make plans for their execution, to carry them out in an effective way, and to change course and improvise in the face of obstacles or failure, and to do so successfully, in the absence of external direction or structure . The capacity of the individual to generate goals and to achieve them is considered to be an essential aspect of a mature and effective per- sonality. It is not a social convention or an artifact of culture. It is hard wired in the con- struction of the prefrontal cortex and its connections.” * The pfc (especially the inferior orbital pfc) helps you think about what you say or do before you say or do it. For example, if you are having a disagreement with your spouse and you have good pfc function, you are more likely to give a thoughtful response that helps the situation. If you have poor pfc function, you are more likely to do or say something that will make the situation worse. The pfc helps you problem-solve, see ahead of a situa- tion, and, through experience, choose among *John Ratey, M.D., ed., The Neuropsychiatry of Personality Disorders (Cambridge, Mass.: Blackwell Science, 1995), p. 153."},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":" Looking Into Inattention and Impulsivity 225 the most helpful alternatives. Playing a game such as chess effectively requires good pfc function. This is also the part of the brain that helps you learn from mistakes. Good pfc function doesn’t mean that you won’t make mistakes. Rather, it generally means that you won’t make the same mistake over and over. You are able to learn from the past and apply its lessons. For example, a student with good pfc function is likely to learn that if he or she starts a long-term project early, there is more time for research and less anxiety over getting it done. A student with decreased pfc function doesn’t learn from past frustra- tions and may tend to put everything off until the last minute. Poor pfc function tends to appear in people who have trouble learning from experience. They tend to make repetitive mistakes. Their actions are based not on experience, but rather on the moment, and on their immediate wants and needs. The pfc (especially the dorsolateral pfc) is also involved with sustaining attention span.

Attention span is required for short-term memory and learning. The pfc, through its many connections within the brain, helps you keep on task and allows you to stay with a project until it is fi nished. The pfc actually sends quieting signals to the lim- bic and sensory parts of the brain when you need to focus, and decreases the distracting input from other brain areas. When the pfc is underactive, you become more distractible (this will be discussed in detail under atten- tion defi cit disorder, below). The pfc (especially the dorsolateral pfc) is also the part of the brain that allows you to feel and express emotions; to feel happiness, sadness, joy, and love. It is different from the more primitive limbic system. Even though the limbic system controls mood and libido, the prefrontal cortex is able to translate the workings of the limbic system into recogniz- able feelings, emotions, and words, such as love, passion, or hate. Underactivity or dam- age in this part of the brain often leads to a decreased ability to express thoughts and feelings. Thoughtfulness and impulse control are heavily infl uenced by the pfc. The ability to"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":" Looking Into Inattention and Impulsivity 227 think through the consequences of behav- ior—choosing a good mate, interacting with customers, dealing with diffi cult children, spending money, driving on the freeway—is essential to effective living, in nearly every aspect of human life.

It sends inhibitory messages that help keep it under control. It helps you “use your head along with your emotions.” When there is damage or underactivity in this part of the brain, especially on the left side, the pfc can- Left Frontal Lobe Stroke 3-D side surface view 3-D underside surface view Notice large hole of activity in left frontal lobe."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"228 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE not appropriately inhibit the limbic system, causing an increased vulnerability to depres- sion if the limbic system becomes overactive. A classic example of this problem occurs in people who have had left frontal lobe strokes. Sixty percent of patients with these strokes develop a major depression within a year. When scientists scan the prefrontal cortex with neuroimaging studies like SPECT, they often do two studies, one in a resting state and a second during a concentration task. In eval- uating brain function, it is important to look at a working brain. When the normal brain is challenged by a concentration task, such as math problems or sorting cards, the pfc activ- ity increases.

In a similar way, social situations require con- centration, impulse control, and dealing with uncertainty. Pfc deactivation often causes a person’s mind to “go blank” in con- versation, which naturally causes discomfort in social situations. When men have problems in this part of the brain, their emotions are often unavailable to them and their partners complain that they do not share their feelings. This can cause serious problems in a relationship.

As I’ve mentioned, when people with ADD try to con- centrate, pfc activity decreases rather than increasing as it does in the normal brains of control group subjects. As such, people with ADD show many of the symptoms discussed in this chapter, such as poor internal supervi- sion, short attention span, distractibility, disorganization, hyperactivity (although only half the people with ADD are hyperactive), impulse control problems, diffi culty learning from past errors, lack of forethought, and pro- crastination.

Here are some of the common characteris- tics of ADD that clearly relate this disorder to the pfc. The Harder You Try, the Worse It Gets Research has shown that the more people with ADD try to concentrate, the worse things get for them. The activity in the pfc actually turns down, rather than turning up. When a parent, teacher, supervisor, or manager puts more pres- sure on a person with ADD to perform, he or she often becomes less effective. Too frequently when this happens the parent, teacher, or boss interprets this decreased performance as willful misconduct, and serious problems arise. One man with ADD whom I treat told me that when- ever his boss puts intense pressure on him to do a better job, his performance becomes much worse, even though he really tries to do better. While it is true that almost all of us perform bet- ter with praise, I’ve found that it is essential for people with ADD. When the boss encourages him to do better in a positive way, he becomes"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":" Looking Into Inattention and Impulsivity 233 more productive. In parenting, teaching, super- vising, or managing someone with ADD, it is much more effective to use praise and encour- agement, rather than pressure. People with ADD do best in environments that are highly interesting or stimulating and relatively relaxed. Short Attention Span A short attention span is the hallmark of this disorder. People with ADD have trouble sus- taining attention and effort over prolonged periods of time. Their attention tends to wan- der and they are frequently off task, thinking about or doing things other than the task at hand. Yet one of the things that often fools inex- perienced clinicians assessing this disorder is that people with ADD do not have a short attention span for everything. Often, people with ADD can pay attention just fi ne to things that are new, novel, highly stimulating, interest- ing, or frightening. These things provide enough intrinsic stimulation that they activate the pfc so the person can focus and concentrate. A child with ADD might do very well in a one- on-one situation and completely fall apart in a classroom of thirty children. My son with ADD,"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"234 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE for example, used to take four hours to do half an hour’s worth of homework, frequently get- ting off task. Yet if you gave him a car stereo magazine, he would quickly read it from cover to cover and remember every little detail in it. People with ADD have long-standing problems paying attention to regular, routine, everyday matters such as homework, schoolwork, chores, or paperwork. The mundane is terrible for them, and it is not a choice. They need excite- ment and interest to kick in their pfc function. Many adult couples tell me that in the beginning of their relationship, the partner with adult ADD could pay attention to the other person for hours. The stimulation of new love helped him or her focus. But as the “newness” and excitement of the relationship began to fade (as it does in nearly all relation- ships), the person with ADD had a much harder time paying attention, and his or her ability to listen faltered. Distractibility As mentioned above, the pfc sends inhibitory signals to other areas of the brain, quieting intake from the environment so that you can"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":" Looking Into Inattention and Impulsivity 235 concentrate. When the pfc is underactive, it doesn’t adequately dampen the sensory parts of the brain, and too many stimuli bombard the brain as a result. Distractibility is evident in many different settings for the person with ADD. In class, during meetings, or while lis- tening to a partner, the person with ADD tends to notice other things going on and has trouble staying focused on the issue at hand. People with ADD tend to look around the room, drift off, appear bored, forget where the conversation is going, and interrupt with extra- neous information. Their distractibility and short attention span may also cause them to take much longer to complete their work. Impulsivity Lack of impulse control gets many ADD people into hot water. They may say inap- propriate things to parents, friends, teachers, supervisors, other employees, or customers. I once had a patient who had been fi red from thirteen jobs because he had trouble con- trolling what he said. Even though he really wanted to keep several of the jobs, he would just blurt out what he was thinking before he"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"236 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE had a chance to process the thought. Poorly thought-out decisions also relate to impul- sivity. Rather than thinking a problem through, many ADD people want an imme- diate solution and act without the necessary forethought. In a similar vein, impulsivity causes these people to have trouble going through the established channels at work. They often go right to the top to solve prob- lems, rather than working through the system. This may cause resentment from coworkers and immediate supervisors. Impulsivity may also lead to such problem behaviors as lying (saying the fi rst thing that comes into your mind), stealing, having affairs, and excessive spending. I have treated many ADD people who have suffered with the shame and guilt of these behaviors. In my lectures I often ask the audience, “How many people here are married?” A large percentage of the audience raises their hands. I then ask, “Is it helpful for you to say every- thing you think in your marriage?” The audience laughs, because they know the answer. “Of course not,” I continue. “Rela- tionships require tact. Yet because of impulsivity and a lack of forethought, many"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":" Looking Into Inattention and Impulsivity 237 people with ADD say the first thing that comes to mind. And instead of apologizing for saying something hurtful, many ADD people will justify why they said the hurtful remark, only making the situation worse. An impul- sive comment can ruin a nice evening, a weekend, even a whole marriage.” Confl ict Seeking Many people with ADD unconsciously seek confl ict as a way to stimulate their own pfc. They do not know they do it. They do not plan to do it. They deny that they do it. And yet they do it just the same. The relative lack of activity and stimulation to the pfc craves more activity. Hyperactivity, restlessness, and hum- ming are common forms of self-stimulation. Another way I have seen people with ADD “try to turn on their brains” is by causing tur- moil. If they can get their parents or spouses to be emotionally intense or yell at them, that might increase activity in their frontal lobes and help them to feel more tuned in. Again, this is not a conscious phenomenon. But it seems that many ADD people become addicted to the turmoil."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"238 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE I once treated a man who would quietly stand behind a corner in his house and jump out and scare his wife when she walked by. He liked the charge he got out of her screams. Unfortunately for his wife, she developed an irregular heart rhythm because of the repeti- tive scares. I have also treated many adults and children with ADD who seemed driven to get their pets upset by playing rough with or teasing them. The parents of children with ADD com- monly report that the kids are experts at upsetting them. One mother told me that when she wakes up in the morning, she prom- ises herself that she won’t yell at or get upset with her eight-year-old son. Yet invariably by the time he is off to school, there have been at least three fi ghts and both of them feel terri- ble. When I explained the child’s unconscious need for stimulation to the mother, she stopped yelling at him. When parents stop providing the negative stimulation (yelling, spanking, lecturing, etc.), these children decrease the negative behaviors.

Another self-stimulating behavior common in people with ADD is worrying or focusing on problems. The emotional turmoil gener- ated by worrying or being upset produces stress chemicals that keep the brain active. I once treated a women who had depression and ADD. She started each session by telling me she was going to kill herself. She noted that this would make me anxious and seemed to enjoy telling me the gruesome details of how she would do it. After about a year of listening to her, I fi nally fi gured out that she wasn’t really going to kill herself, she was using my reaction as a source of stimulation for her. After getting to know her well, I told her, “Stop talking about suicide. I do not believe you’ll kill yourself. You love your four chil- dren, and I can’t believe you would ever abandon them. I think you use this talk as a way to keep things stirred up. Without know- ing, your ADD causes you to play the game of ‘Let’s have a problem.’ This ruins any joy you could have in your life.” Initially, she was very upset with me (another source of confl ict, I told her), but she trusted me enough to at least"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"240 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE look at the behavior. Decreasing her need for turmoil became the major focus of psycho- therapy. A signifi cant problem with using anger, emotional turmoil, and negative emotion for self-stimulation is damage to the immune system. The high levels of adrenaline pro- duced by confl ict-driven behavior decrease the immune system’s effectiveness and increase vulnerability to illness. I have seen evidence of this deficiency over and over with the connection between ADD and chronic infections, and in the increased inci- dence of fi bromyalgia, chronic muscle pain thought to be associated with immune defi - ciency. As noted, many folks with ADD tend to be in constant turmoil with one or more people, at home, work, or school. They seem to uncon- sciously choose people who are vulnerable and pick verbal battles with them. Many mothers of children with ADD have told me that they feel like running away from home.

Witzelsucht is a term in the neuropsychiatric literature that characterizes “an addiction to making bad jokes.” It was fi rst described in patients who had frontal lobe brain tumors, especially on the right side. Disorganization Disorganization is another hallmark of ADD. It includes disorganization of physical space, such as rooms, desks, book bags, fi ling cabi- nets, and closets, as well as disorganization of time. Often when you look at work areas of people with ADD, it is a wonder they can work there at all. They tend to have many piles of “stuff ”; paperwork is often hard for them to keep straight; and they seem to have a fi ling system that only they can fi gure out (and then only on good days).

Imagine what their"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"242 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE neighbors thought! They also tend to lose track of time, which contributes to lateness. Start Many Projects, but Finish Few The energy and enthusiasm of people with ADD often push them to start many projects. Unfor- tunately, their distractibility and short attention span impair their ability to complete them. One radio station manager told me that he had started over thirty special projects the year before but completed only a handful. He told me, “I’m always going to get back to them, but I get new ideas that get in the way.” I also treat a college professor who told me that the year before he saw me he had started three hundred different projects. His wife fi nished the thought by telling me he had completed only three. Moodiness and Negative Thinking Many people with ADD tend to be moody, irritable, and negative. Since the pfc is under- active, it cannot fully temper the limbic system, which becomes overactive, leading to mood control issues. In another subtle way, as men- tioned, many people with ADD worry or"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":" Looking Into Inattention and Impulsivity 243 become overfocused on negative thoughts as a form of self-stimulation. If they cannot seek turmoil from others in the environment, they seek it within themselves. They often have a “sky is falling” attitude that distances them from others.

We now know that most people with ADD do not outgrow the symptoms of this disorder and that it frequently occurs in girls and women. It is estimated that ADD affects seventeen million Americans.

From the time he had been in kindergarten, he had had problems staying in his seat; he had been restless, distractible, dis- organized, and labeled as an underachiever. Kent’s father requested that we do a brain SPECT study to look at his brain. He wanted to make sure Kent wasn’t just looking for another excuse as to why he was failing in life. Kent’s brain SPECT study at rest was normal. When Kent tried to concentrate, however, the prefrontal cortex of his brain turned off. After the results of the clinical examination and brain SPECT studies, I put Kent on Adderall, a stimulant medication that is used to treat symptoms of ADD. Kent had a remark- able response.

I wish I could have those years back.” I have one man in my practice who has ten businesses because that’s what he needs in order to keep himself turned on! When the brain is underactive, it’s uncomfortable. Unconsciously, people learn how to turn it on, by confl ict, coffee or cigarettes (both mild stimulants), anger, a fast-paced life, or highly stimulating physical activities, such as bungee jumping. (Bungee jumpers need to be screened for this problem!) ADD in the Family Many psychiatric disorders are now thought to have signifi cant genetic infl uences. ADD is no exception.

While I was writing up his history, Paul told me about bouts of depression that had been treated with Prozac in the past with little ben- efit. Paul’s brain SPECT study showed increased activity in his limbic system (consis- tent with depression) and deactivation of his prefrontal cortex during a concentration task (consistent with ADD). He had a wonderful response to a combination of an antidepres- sant and a stimulant medication. He fi nished college and got the kind of job he wanted. When Paul’s mother, Pam, saw his good response to treatment, she came to see me for herself. As a child, she had had trouble learn- ing. Even though she was very artistic, she had little motivation for school and her teachers labeled her as an underachiever.

Four months later, she passed the National Teacher’s Exam. With two successes in the family, the mother then sent her teenage daughter, Karen, to see me. Like her brother, Karen was a bright child who had underachieved in school. At the time she came to see me, she lived in Los Angeles and was enrolled in a broadcast journalism course.

Several years earlier she had been treated for alcohol and amphetamine abuse. She said that the alcohol settled her restlessness and the amphetamines helped her to concentrate. Karen’s brain SPECT studies were very similar to her brother’s and moth- er’s. Once on medication, she was amazed at the difference.

The most reluctant member of the family to see me was the father, Tim—even though Pam, Paul, and Karen told him that he should. He said, “There’s nothing wrong with me; look at how successful I am.” But his family knew different. Even though Tim owned a successful grocery store, he was reclusive and distant. He got tired early in the day, was easily distracted, and had a scat- tered approach to work. His success at work was due in part to his good employees, who made his ideas happen. He also had trouble learning new games, such as cards, which caused him to avoid certain social situations. Tim enjoyed high-stimulation activities, such as riding motorcycles, even at the age of fi fty-fi ve. Looking back, Tim had done poorly in high school. He had barely gotten through college even though he had a very high IQ. He had tended to drift from job to job until he was able to buy the grocery store. Tim’s wife fi nally convinced him to see me.

During our fi rst session, Tim told me that he couldn’t possibly have ADD because he was a success in business. But the more ques- tions I asked him about his past, the more lights went on in his mind. His childhood nickname had been “Speedy.” He often hadn’t done his homework. He had often been dis- tracted or bored in school. His energy was gone by the end of the morning. When I asked about his organization at work, he replied that her name was Elsa, his assistant. At the end of the interview, I commented, “If you really do have ADD, I wonder how successful you could be given what you’ve already accomplished.” Tim’s brain SPECT studies showed the clas- sic pattern for ADD. When he tried to concentrate, the prefrontal cortex of his brain turned off, rather than on. When I told him this, it really sank in. “Maybe that’s why it is hard for me to learn games. When I’m in a social situation and I’m pressed to learn or respond, I just freeze up. So I avoid these situ- ations.” Tim had a remarkable response to Ritalin.

In fact, they both said they couldn’t believe that their relationship could be so good, after all the years of distance and hurt. PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS Psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia, affect a person’s ability to distinguish reality from fantasy. These disorders are complex and involve several brain areas, but at least in part, the neurotransmitter abnormalities cause decreased prefrontal cortex activity. Schizophrenia is a chronic, long-standing disorder characterized by delusions, halluci- nations, and distorted thinking. When I fi rst started ordering SPECT studies on schizo- phrenic patients, I began to understand why they distorted incoming information. The following case is a good example. Julie Julie was forty-eight years old when we met. She had a history of hospitalizations for para- noid thinking, hearing voices, and delusional"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"252 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE thinking. Her main delusion centered around being assaulted by someone who put an elec- trical probe inside her head that “blasted her with electricity.” She had been on multiple medication trials without success. Due to her lack of responsiveness to standard treatments, I ordered a brain SPECT study. In a sense, Julie was right. She was being blasted with electricity (note the multiple hot spots across her brain), but because she had such poor prefrontal cortex activity, she was unable to process the physiological nature of her illness and developed delusions to explain the pain she experienced. With the informa- Julie’s Schizophrenia-Affected Brain front 3-D left-side surface view Note markedly decreased prefrontal activity (arrow) and multiple hot spots across the cortex."},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":" Looking Into Inattention and Impulsivity 253 tion from the SPECT study, Julie was placed on a high therapeutic dose of Depakote, which lessened her pain and anxiety. For the fi rst time, she was willing to entertain the possibil- ity that her symptoms were the result of abnormal brain activity rather than an outside attack. A repeat SPECT study eight months later showed a marked decrease in the hot spots in her brain along with subsequent increased activity in her prefrontal cortex. Derrick Derrick, a thirteen-year-old boy, was brought to see me because he was severely anxious. He was displaying psychotic symptoms, feeling that other children were talking about him behind his back and that they were out to embarrass him in front of his whole school. He started to avoid all contact with his peer group. He would hide in the middle of clothes racks at the mall if he saw people he knew, for fear that they might laugh at him or talk about him to others. He was petrifi ed by his thoughts and stopped going to school. He even seriously entertained the idea of suicide. He had crying spells, sleeplessness, and intense anxiety. He"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"254 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE wasn’t able to rationally discuss any of these feelings. I saw him for months in psychother- apy and tried him on several antidepressant and antipsychotic medications without a ther- apeutic response. A SPECT scan was done when he was off all medication to help us understand what was going on. Derrick’s SPECT study showed marked decreased activity in his prefrontal cortex at rest, a common fi nding in psychotic disorders. It is also a fi nding in some psychotic depres- sions. The study led me to try alternative medications that were more effective. Within two months there was a dramatic clinical improvement in his condition. His mood was better, he had no suicidal thoughts, he was less sensitive to others, and he was more able to entertain alternatives to his distorted thoughts. Seven months later, he was much more like a normal teenager. A repeated SPECT study performed six months later showed normalization of his prefrontal cortex activity.

They were able to respond in a more understanding and helpful manner, lowering the level of stress at home. HEAD INJURIES Due to its location, the pfc is especially sus- ceptible to head injury. Many people do not fully understand how head injuries, sometimes even “minor” ones in which no loss of con- sciousness occurs, can alter a person’s character and ability to learn. This is particularly true when the head injury occurs in the brain’s executive director, or pfc. Your brain is very soft. Your skull is very hard. Your brain sits in a closed space that has many sharp edges. Unfor- tunately for the pfc, the inferior orbital cortex sits on top of several sharp, bony ridges, and the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex lies just beneath the place where many blows to the head occur. It is important to note that many people for- get they’ve had a signifi cant head injury in their lifetime. In our clinic we ask patients several times whether or not they have had a"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"256 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE signifi cant head injury. Our intake paperwork asks the question “Have you ever had a head injury?” The historian, who gathers patients’ histories before they see the physician, asks them again about head injuries. The computer testing we have patients complete asks a third time about head injuries. If I see no, no, no to the question of head injuries, I’ll ask again. If I get a fourth no, I will then say, “Are you sure? Have you ever fallen out of a tree, fallen off a fence, or dove into a shallow pool?” I am constantly amazed at how many people remember head injuries that they’d long for- gotten or felt were too insignificant to remember. One patient, when asked the ques- tion for the fi fth time, put his hand on his forehead and said, “Oh yeah! When I was fi ve years old, I fell out of a second-story window.” Likewise, I have had other patients forget they went through windshields, fell out of moving vehicles, or were knocked unconscious when they fell off their bicycles. Head injuries are very important. I often tell my patients that their brain is more sophisti- cated than any computer we can think of designing. You can’t drop a computer without the potential of causing serious damage. In the"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":" Looking Into Inattention and Impulsivity 257 same way, the brain is fragile, and if trauma occurs in sensitive parts of the brain, it has the potential to alter one’s ability to function. Phineas P. Gage provided scientists with an extreme example of pfc dysfunction second- ary to a head injury. This was one of the fi rst cases in the medical literature about the out- come of prefrontal cortex damage. In 1848, at the age of twenty-fi ve, Gage was an up-and- coming railroad construction foreman in Vermont working for the Rutland and Burl- ington Railroad. His job involved using a long tamping iron to ignite explosives to forge a path for the railroad. One day a horrible acci- dent occurred; the explosion sent the tamping iron, which was 1.25 inches in diameter, 3.5 feet long, and weighed 13.5 pounds, through the front part of Gage’s skull. It went through his left eye, through the left prefrontal cortex, and out the top front part of his skull, leaving a circular 3.5-inch opening, destroying his left prefrontal cortex and surrounding areas of the brain. Initially the interest in the case was due to Gage’s survival, which was called “unprec- edented in surgical history.” Later, in 1868, his physician turned his attention to the per- sonality changes in Gage. Before the accident,"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"258 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE Gage had been an honest, reliable, deliberate person and a good worker. After the accident, even though he did not appear to suffer any intellectual impairment, he was described as childish, capricious, and obstinate, showed poor judgment, used profane language, and was inconsiderate of others. In short, his phy- sician concluded that “Gage was no longer Gage.” In many ways, the pfc contains our ability to be ourselves. Zachary The two following cases provide modern-day examples similar to that of Gage. Zachary, age ten, was a fun-loving, active boy who was loving, sweet, and eager to please. He did well in kindergarten and was liked by the other children. One summer, between kindergarten and fi rst grade, Zachary was rid- ing in the front seat of a car with his mother on a trip to his grandparents’ house. All of a sudden a drunk driver swerved into their lane, causing Zachary’s mother to quickly jerk the car to the side of the road. She lost control, and the car hit a tree. Zachary’s mother’s leg was broken in the accident, and Zachary,"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":" Looking Into Inattention and Impulsivity 259 thankfully restrained by a seat belt, hit his head against the side window. He was uncon- scious, but only for about ten minutes. About six weeks later, Zachary began to change. He exhibited aggressive behavior, breaking his own toys and hurting his younger brother. He began swearing, blurted out state- ments at inappropriate times, and interrupted frequently. He became rude, contrary, argu- mentative, and confl ict-seeking. He lost his friends at school the next year because he said things that hurt their feelings. He started to tease the two cats at home, so much so that Zachary’s Trauma-Affected Brain 3-D front-on surface view Note markedly decreased activity in the left pfc."},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"260 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE they started to avoid him whenever he came into the house. Six months after the accident, his mother knew that something was seriously wrong. She took him to a counselor, who thought the problem was psychological, a result of the accident. The counselor thought that Zachary and his mother were too close and developed strategies to help Zachary become more independent. That only seemed to make things worse. After two years of coun- seling, which didn’t seem to help much, the mother consulted Zachary’s pediatrician. He diagnosed Zachary with ADD and put him on Ritalin. But that didn’t help very much either. In fact, it only seemed to make him more aggressive. When Zachary was brought to see me at age nine, I thought he might have a chronic post-concussive syndrome, secondary to the accident. His brain SPECT study revealed marked decreased activity in the left pfc and decreased activity in the left occipital cortex, indicating both a front and back injury (common in head injuries). In addition, there was decreased activity in his left temporal lobe. Given this constellation of fi ndings, I put Zachary on a combination of medication (an anticonvulsant, to stabilize his aggressive-"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":" Looking Into Inattention and Impulsivity 261 ness and help his temporal lobe function, and amantadine [Symmetrel] to help with focus, concentration, and impulse control). He was also placed in a special class at school and given cognitive retraining exercises. Over the next several months, his behavior began to improve. Tim Tim, age fi fteen, was a high school sophomore. From his early youth he had exhibited severe conduct problems. He was hyperactive, impul- sive, moody, and frequently angry, especially whenever someone would tell him no. His temper fl ared quickly, often over minor or triv- ial incidents. He had already been arrested for shoplifting, he frequently cut school, and he was defi ant and abusive toward his parents. He did not get along with other teens at school and seemed to “never fi t in.” He smoked a pack of cigarettes a day and frequently used marijuana and cocaine. He had already been in one treatment program and was on his way to a second when his parents brought him to our clinic. He had tried numerous medications without success."},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"262 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE His brain SPECT study showed one of the most severe cases of damage to the left pre- frontal cortex that I have ever seen.

Otherwise, legal authorities may have to impose external supervision in some form of a contained setting, basically through no fault of Tim’s.

As such, it is essential in helping you reach your goals. To review, the prefrontal cortex is involved with concentration, attention span, judgment, impulse control, and critical thinking. It controls your ability to look at situ- ations, organize your thoughts, plan what you want to do, and carry out your plans. Healing this part of the brain requires the development of a concept I call “total focus.” PFC PRESCRIPTION 1: DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN CLEAR FOCUS (THE ONE-PAGE MIRACLE) Developing an ability to stay totally focused will help guide your thoughts and behavior and give you an “auxiliary prefrontal cortex.”"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":" Becoming Focused 267 It will help strengthen the conscious part of your mind. In order to be successful in the world, we need to have clearly defi ned goals. Specifi cally, we need to know who we are and what we want to accomplish in our relationships, at work, and within ourselves. When we know what we want, we are more likely to change our behavior to get it. Being goal-directed helps keep our behavior on track. When I first mention goal setting to my patients, they generally look at me with blank stares or mutter something vague about a career or money. Goal setting is not for some far-off dream. It is for now, and it is very spe- cifi c. Making goals that you can focus on daily will make a big difference in your life. I have my patients, whether they are six or seventy-fi ve years old, do a goal-setting exer- cise I developed called the One-Page Miracle (OPM). In studying successful children and adults, I have found that the one thing they have in common is a sense of personal respon- sibility and clear goals. The One-Page Miracle will help guide nearly all of your thoughts, words, and actions. I’ve seen this exercise quickly focus and change many people."},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"268 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE Here’s how to develop your own OPM. Take one sheet of paper and clearly write out your major goals. Use the following main headings: Relationships, Work, Money, and Myself. Under “Relationships,” write the subheadings spouse/lover, children, extended family, and friends. Under “Work,” write current and future work goals, and include a section on how you want to get along with your employer. Under “Money,” write your current and future financial goals. Under “Myself,” write out body, mind, spirit, and interests. Next to each subheading, clearly write out what’s important to you in that area; write what you want, not what you don’t want. Be positive and write in the fi rst person. Keep a copy with you for several days so you can work on it over time. After you fi nish the initial draft (you’ll want to update it frequently), place this piece of paper where you can see it every day, such as in your briefcase, on your refrigerator, by your bed, or on the bathroom mirror. In that way, every day you can focus your eyes on what’s important to you. This makes it easier for you to supervise yourself and to match your behavior to get what you want. Your life will become more conscious,"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":" Becoming Focused 269 and you will spend your energy on goals that are important to you. I separate the areas of relationships, work, money, and self in order to encourage a more balanced approach to life.

Here is an actual example of an OPM I did with one of my patients who had a prefrontal cortex injury. Jarred was married with three children, and he was an attorney in private practice. Since the injury he had had signifi - cant impulse control problems and spent excessive time at work, which were the reasons he came to see me.

As I mentioned, many people with pfc challenges, especially people with ADD, tend to be confl ict-driven as a way to “turn on” pre- frontal cortex activity. Unfortunately, this behavior has many negative side effects, espe- cially on relationships and immune system functioning. Focusing on what you like about your life and on what you like about others is a powerful way to keep your prefrontal cortex healthy. To that end, I collect penguins. I have six hundred of them in my offi ce, everything that you could imagine in penguin, including a penguin weather vane, penguin clocks, pens, pencils, puppets, dolls, watches, ties, a pen- guin sewing kit, a penguin vacuum cleaner, and even a pair of penguin boxer shorts given to me by a nine-year-old patient.

When my son was seven years old, I took him to a marine life educa- tional and entertainment park for the day. We went to the killer whale show, the dolphin show, and finally the penguin show. The penguin’s name was Fat Freddie. He did amazing things: He jumped off a twenty-foot diving board; he bowled with his nose; he counted with his fl ippers; he even jumped through a hoop of fi re. I had my arm around my son, enjoying the show, when the trainer asked Freddie to get something. Freddie went and got it, and he brought it right back. I thought, “Whoa, I ask this kid to get some- thing for me, and he wants to have a discussion with me for twenty minutes, and then he doesn’t want to do it!” I knew my son was smarter than this penguin. I went up to the trainer afterward and asked, “How did you get Freddie to do all these really neat things?” The trainer looked at my son, and then she looked at me and said, “Unlike parents, whenever Freddie does anything like what I want him to do, I notice him!

Since that day, I have tried hard to notice my son’s good acts and fair attempts (although I don’t toss him a fi sh, since he doesn’t care for them) and to down- play his mistakes. We’re both better people for it. I collect penguins as a way to remind myself to notice the good things about the people in my life a lot more than the bad things. This has been so helpful for me as well as for many of my patients. It is often necessary to have something that reminds us of this prescrip- tion. It’s not natural for most of us to notice what we like about our life or what we like about others, especially if we unconsciously use turmoil to stimulate our prefrontal cor- tex.

Seven years ago I met Jamie, a fourteen-year-old teenager who was admitted to the hospital after a sui- cide attempt. She had tried to kill herself because she was doing so poorly in school and couldn’t keep up academically with her friends. On the night of her suicide attempt, she had a terrible fi ght with her mother, who berated her poor performance in school. Jamie had a family history of depression on her father’s side, and her mother had many ADD symptoms (although her mother refused to be evaluated and treated for it). Jamie felt sad and had a tendency to look at the nega- tive side of things. She was also disorganized, had lifelong trouble focusing on her school- work, and was impulsive. She was diagnosed with depression and ADD. Jamie’s SPECT study showed decreased pfc activity and increased limbic activity. I started her on medication (which over time became a com- bination of Prozac and Ritalin) and began seeing her in psychotherapy. Over several months, Jamie’s condition significantly"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":" Becoming Focused 277 improved. Her mood was better. School was easier for her. She had better frustration tol- erance and impulse control. Our initial weekly visits after leaving the hospital turned into every two weeks and then monthly by the end of the fi rst year. She maintained good stabil- ity, except for one area of her life: She continued to fi ght with her mother. Two years after I began seeing Jamie, she came into my offi ce and burst into tears. “I just can’t stand my mother,” she started the session. “All she does is pick on me and try to get me upset. I know you’ve told me not to react to her, but I can’t help it. She knows every button on my body.” As she fi nished telling me about her latest fight with her mother, she looked around my office and asked, “Dr. Amen, how come a grown man collects penguins?” A bit amazed, I asked, “You’ve just noticed the penguins? After two years?” I then told her the story about Fat Freddie. Then I taught her about the concept of behavioral shaping , what the trainer had done to get Fat Freddie to be a star performer. I told her, “Let me teach you how to shape the behavior of your mother.

And every time your mother is appropriate with you, listens to you, and is helpful to you, I want you to put your arms around her and tell her how much you love and appreciate her.” Jamie said she would try her best. When she came back a month later, she told me that she had had the best month she had ever had with her mother. Her mother had yelled at her only once, and she hadn’t reacted. And she had given her mother a lot of hugs. “I think I get what you’re teaching me, Dr. Amen,” she said with a smile. “I have power to help things or make things worse. Even though I’m not responsible for how my mom acts, I have a big infl uence on the situation.” I was proud of Jamie. She had learned that by focusing on what she liked about her mother a lot more than on what she didn’t like, she could have a positive impact on a negative situation. I taught her not to be a victim of her mother, but to use her own positive power in the situation."},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":" Becoming Focused 279 PFC PRESCRIPTION 3: HAVE MEANING, PURPOSE, STIMULATION, AND EXCITEMENT IN YOUR LIFE Meaning, purpose, stimulation, and excite- ment in your life help prevent shutdown and encourage you to focus by activating your pre- frontal cortex.

People with ADD often struggle with routine, mundane activities. However, when they are engaged in interesting, exciting, stim- ulating tasks, they often excel. A very important prescription I give my patients is to ensure that they have positive meaning and stimulation in their lives, whether it is in their work, their relationships, or their spirituality. It can make all the difference between success and chronic failure. A man with ADD in a boring job he dislikes is likely to need more medication to be effective.

You are a loving husband and father, you have a successful business that gives jobs to lots of people, and you care about others. Maybe what you have is a paperwork disability.

PFC PRESCRIPTION 6: CONSIDER BRAIN-WAVE BIOFEEDBACK TRAINING I’ve discussed ADD as primarily a problem in the prefrontal cortex. Medication is the cor- nerstone of the “biological” treatments for ADD, but it is not the only biological treat- ment. Over the past fi fteen years, researchers including Joel Lubar, Ph.D., of the University of Tennessee, have demonstrated the effective- ness of a powerful adjunctive tool in the treatment of ADD and other prefrontal cortex problems: brain-wave or EEG biofeedback. Biofeedback in general is a treatment tech- nique that utilizes instruments to measure physiological responses in a person’s body (such as hand temperature, sweat gland activity, breathing rates, heart rates, blood pressure, and brain-wave patterns). The instruments feed the information on these body systems to the patient, who can then learn how to change them. In brain-wave biofeedback, we measure the level of brainwave activity throughout the brain."},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":" Becoming Focused 285 There are fi ve types of brain-wave patterns: delta brain waves (1–4 cycles per second): very slow brain waves, occurring mostly during sleep; theta brain waves (5–7 cycles per second): slow brain waves, occurring during daydreaming, relaxation, and twilight states; alpha brain waves (8–12 cycles per second): brain waves occurring during relaxed states; SMR (sensorimotor rhythm) brain waves (12–15 cycles per second): brain waves occur- ring during states of focused relaxation; beta brain waves (13–24 cycles per second): fast brain waves occurring during concentra- tion or mental work states . In evaluating more than six thousand chil- dren with ADD, Dr. Lubar found that the basic problem with these children is that they lack the ability to maintain “beta” concentration states for sustained periods of time. He also found that these children have excessive “theta” day- dreaming brain-wave activity. Dr. Lubar found that through the use of EEG biofeedback, chil- dren could be taught to increase the amount of “beta” brain waves and decrease the amount of “theta,” or daydreaming, brain waves. The basic biofeedback technique teaches children to play games with their minds.

With my clinic’s EEG biofeedback equipment, for example, a child sits in front of a computer monitor and watches a game screen. If he increases the “beta” activity or decreases the “theta” activity, the game con- tinues. The game stops, however, when the player is unable to maintain the desired brain-wave state. Children fi nd the screens fun, and we gradually shape their brain-wave pattern to a more normal one. From the research, we know that this treatment tech- nique is not an overnight cure. Children often have to practice this form of biofeed- back for between one and two years. In my experience with EEG biofeedback and ADD, many people are able to improve their reading skills and decrease their need for medication. Also, EEG biofeedback has helped to decrease impulsivity and aggressiveness. It is a powerful tool, in part because the patient becomes part of the treatment process by tak- ing more control over his own physiological processes. The use of brain-wave biofeedback is con- sidered controversial by some clinicians and"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":" Becoming Focused 287 researchers. More research needs to be done and published in order to demonstrate its effectiveness. Also, in some circles, EEG bio- feedback has been oversold. Some clinics have advertised the ability to cure ADD with bio- feedback, without the use of medication. Unfortunately, overselling this treatment tech- nique has hurt its credibility. Still, in my clinical experience, I fi nd EEG biofeedback to be a powerful and exciting treatment with a developing future. PFC PRESCRIPTION 7: TRY AUDIOVISUAL STIMULATION A treatment similar to EEG biofeedback is called audiovisual stimulation. This technique was developed by psychologists Harold Russell, Ph.D., and John Carter, Ph.D., at the University of Texas in Galveston. Both Dr. Russell and Dr. Carter were involved in the development of treatment of ADD children with EEG biofeed- back. They wanted to develop a treatment technique that could become widely available to children who needed it. Based on a concept termed entrainment , in which brain waves tend to pick up the rhythm"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"288 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE in the environment, they developed special glasses and headphones that fl ash lights and sounds at a person at specifi c frequencies to help the brain “tune in” and become more focused. Patients wear these glasses for twenty to thirty minutes a day. I have tried this treatment on a number of patients with some encouraging results. One patient who developed tics on both Ritalin and Dexedrine tried the glasses for a month. His ADD symptoms signifi cantly improved. When he went off the audiovisual stimula- tor, his symptoms returned. The symptoms again subsided when he retried the treat- ment. I believe that audiovisual stimulation tech- niques show promise for the future, but more research is needed. PFC PRESCRIPTION 8: DON’T BE ANOTHER PERSON’S STIMULANT As mentioned, many people with prefrontal cortex problems tend to be confl ict-seeking to stimulate their brain. It is critical for you to not feed the turmoil, but rather to starve it."},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":" Becoming Focused 289 The more someone with this pattern unknow- ingly tries to upset or anger you, the more you need to be quiet, calm, and steady. I teach par- ents of ADD children to stop yelling. The more they yell and increase the emotional intensity in the family, the more the children seek tur- moil. I also teach siblings and spouses to maintain a low voice and a calm demeanor. The harder the person with ADD tries to esca- late the situation, the less intense the respondent should be. It is fascinating how this prescription works. In general, the conflict-seeking people are used to being able to get you upset. They have mastered all your emotional buttons, and they push them with regularity. When you begin to deny them the drama and adrenaline rush (by being less reactive and calmer in stressful situ- ations), they initially react very negatively, almost as if they are going through a drug withdrawal. In fact, when you fi rst become calmer they may even get worse in the short term. Stick with it, and they’ll improve in the long term.

For a year, I kept a log of what my ADD adult patients told me about the effectiveness of their medication. The following are some of their comments. “I experienced an increased awareness of the world around me. I saw the hills for the fi rst time when driving to work. I saw the bay when I crossed over the bridge.

Can you believe I’m tak- ing a stimulant and it calms me down?” “I used to be the kind of person who would go walking by myself in downtown Detroit at two A . M . Now on the medication I would never do something so stupid. Before, I just wouldn’t think about the consequences.” “Now I can give talks in front of groups. Before, my mind would always go blank. I organized my life around not speaking in public. Now my brain feels calmer, clearer.” “I’m not as intimidated by others as I used to be.” “My husband may not be as happy as before I was on medication. Now I can think, and he doesn’t win all of the arguments.

When they gain access to their prefrontal cortex, it is often amazing at how much more effective they can be. Several “stimulating” antidepressants are also helpful in ADD. Norpramin (desipramine) and Tofranil (imipramine) increase the neu- rotransmitter norepinephrine and are especially helpful for people with ADD and anxiety or depressive symptoms. Wellbutrin (bupropion) increases the neurotransmitter dopamine and is often helpful for people with ADD and depres- sion or low energy. Effexor (venlafaxine) increases the neurotransmitters serotonin, nor- epinephrine, and, in higher doses, dopamine, and is most helpful for people with ADD who overfocus or are obsessive.

For years I have recommended a high-protein, low-carbo- hydrate diet that is relatively low in fat to my"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":" Becoming Focused 295 patients with ADD. This diet has a stabilizing effect on blood sugar levels and helps both with energy level and concentration. Unfortu- nately, the great American diet is fi lled with refi ned carbohydrates, which have a negative impact on dopamine levels in the brain and concentration. With both parents working out- side the home, there is less time to prepare healthy meals, and fast-food meals have become more the norm. The breakfast of today typically consists of foods that are high in sim- ple carbohydrates, such as frozen waffl es or pancakes, Pop Tarts, muffi ns, pastry, cereal. Sausage and eggs have gone by the wayside in many homes because of the lack of time and the perception that fat is bad for us. Even though it is important to be careful with fat intake, the breakfast of old is not such a bad idea for people with ADD or other dopamine- defi cient states. The major sources of protein I recommend include lean meats, eggs, low-fat cheeses, nuts, and legumes. These are best mixed with a healthy portion of vegetables. An ideal breakfast is an omelet with low-fat cheese and lean meat, such as chicken. An ideal lunch is a tuna, chicken, or fresh fi sh salad,"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"296 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE with mixed vegetables. An ideal dinner con- tains more carbohydrates for balance with lean meat and vegetables. Eliminating sim- ple sugars (such as cakes, candy, ice cream, pastries) and simple carbohydrates that are readily broken down to sugar (such as bread, pasta, rice, potatoes) will have a positive impact on energy level and cognition. This diet is helpful in raising dopamine levels in the brain. It is important to note, however, that this diet is not ideal for people with cin- gulate or overfocus issues, which usually stem from a relative defi ciency of serotonin. Serotonin and dopamine levels tend to coun- terbalance each other; whenever serotonin is raised, dopamine tends to be lowered and vice versa. Nutritional supplements can also have a positive effect on brain dopamine levels and help with focus and energy. I often have my pat ient s t a ke a combi n at ion of t y rosi ne (50 0 – 1,500 milligrams two to three times a day); OPC (oligomeric procyanidius) grape seed or pine bark; found in health food stores (1 milligram per pound of body weight); and gingko biloba (60–120 milligrams twice a"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":" Becoming Focused 297 day).

Feelings of safety and security have also been attributed to this part of the brain. In my experience, the term that best relates to this part of the brain is cognitive fl exibility . Cognitive fl exibility defi nes a person’s abil- ity to go with the fl ow, adapt to change, deal successfully with new problems. Many situa- tions in life demand cognitive fl exibility. For example, when you start a new job, you need to learn a new system of doing things. Even if you did something another way at a previous job, learning how to shift to please a new boss or adapt to a new system is critical to job suc- cess. Junior high school students need cognitive fl exibility in order to be successful in school. In seventh grade, many students begin having various teachers throughout the day. It is necessary to shift learning styles in order to adapt to the different styles of the teachers. Flexibility is also important in friendships. What works in a friendship with one person may not be at all effective with someone else.

When it is working properly, we are more able to roll with the cir- cumstances of the day. When it is impaired or overactive, cognitive fl exibility is diminished. Along with shifting attention, we have seen that cooperation is also infl uenced by this part of the brain. When the cingulate works effectively, it’s easy to shift into coop- The Cingulate Gyrus cingulate gyrus 3-D side active view 3-D top-down active view 3-D front-on active view"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"302 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE erative modes of behavior. People with cingulate problems have diffi culty shifting attention and get stuck in ineffective behav- ior patterns. The cingulate system has also been impli- cated (along with the other aspects of the pfc) in “future-oriented thinking,” such as plan- ning and goal setting. When this part of the brain works well, it is easier to plan and set reasonable goals. On the negative side, diffi - culties in this part of the brain can cause a person to perceive fearful situations where there are none, predict negative events, and feel very unsafe in the world. Seeing options is crucial to adaptable behav- ior. In my profession, adaptable physicians readily utilize new ideas and technology (after a scientifi c basis is developed), and they are open to give their patients the latest informa- tion on what is new and exciting. Physicians who have cingulate problems (I have scanned many) tend to be rigid, do things the way they have always been done, and be autocratic (“Do it my way if you want me to treat you”).

Even though I don’t want to have the thought anymore, it just keeps coming back.” The clinical problems associated with the cingulate will be discussed shortly.

WORRYING Even though we all worry at times (and some worry is necessary to keep us working or study-"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":" Looking Into Worry and Obsessiveness 305 ing in school), people who have an overactive cingulate may have integrated chronic worry- ing into their personality. They may worry to the point of causing emotional and physical harm to themselves. Whenever repetitive nega- tive concerns circle through the mind, it can cause tension, stress, stomachaches, head- aches, and irritability. Chronically expressing worries often irritates others and makes a per- son seem less powerful and perhaps even less mature. At a dinner party, an old friend of mine who is also a physician complained that his wife worried “all the time.” “She worries for the whole family,” he told me. “It upsets me and the children. Her constant worry seems to be associated with her chronic headaches and irritability. How do I help her relax so that she won’t get so upset about the little things in life?” he queried. I had known my friend’s wife for many years.

Members of her family, which she had discussed with me on several occasions, did have clinical prob-"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"306 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE lems (such as alcoholism, drug abuse, and compulsive behaviors) associated with the cin- gulate system. HOLDING ON TO HURTS Holding tightly on to hurts from the past can cause serious problems in a person’s life. I once treated a woman who was very angry with her husband. On a trip to Hawaii, her husband had allowed his eyes to wander toward some of the scantily dressed women on the beach at Waikiki. The wife had become irate. She felt he had been unfaithful to her with his eyes. Her anger had ruined the whole trip, and she continued to bring up the inci- dent years later. Another cingulate example occurred in a newly blended family. Don married Laura, who had a three-year-old son, Aaron. Laura and Aaron had been living with her parents. Shortly after the wedding Don, Laura, and Aaron went to visit Laura’s parents. During the visit Aaron asked for a second bowl of ice cream. Don told him no because it might ruin his dinner. Laura’s parents undermined Don’s new authority in front of the little boy by say-"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":" Looking Into Worry and Obsessiveness 307 ing he could have the second helping of ice cream. Frustrated, Don tried to discuss the issue. The grandparents told him he was being silly. What did he know, they thought, he was new to fatherhood. When Don tried further to talk to them, they just dismissed him. The grandparents, unable to let go of the incident, refused to even speak to Don or Laura for the next eighteen months. Many family cutoffs are due to excessive cingulate activity. COGNITIVE INFLEXIBILITY Cognitive infl exibility, the inability to roll with the ups and downs of everyday life, is at the root of most cingulate problems. A friend’s six-year-old daughter, Kimmy, provides a per- fect example of cognitive inflexibility. Her older sister was instructed by her mother to get Kimmy ready to go out for the day. The older sister picked out a shirt and pair of pants for Kimmy. Kimmy complained that the shirt and pants looked stupid. She had the same complaint for the next three outfi ts that her sister chose for her. Kimmy wanted to wear a sundress (it was February and cold outside). She cried and cried to get her way. Nothing"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"308 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE else would do. Once she got the idea of the sundress in her head, she couldn’t shift away from it. In couples counseling through the years, I have frequently heard another example of cog- nitive infl exibility: the need to do something now . Not five minutes from now, but now ! Here’s a fairly common scenario: A wife asks her husband to get some clothes out of the dryer and put the clothes from the washer into the dryer. He asks her to wait a few minutes because he’s watching the end of a basketball game. She becomes irate and says that it needs to be done now . They get into a fi ght. She doesn’t feel comfortable until the chore is fi n- ished. He feels intruded upon, pushed around, and generally degraded. The need to do it now can cause some serious relational problems. Of course, if the husband said he would help, then didn’t, we could understand her need to have it done now. There are many more everyday examples of trouble shifting attention or cognitive infl exi- bility. Here’s a short list: Only eating specifi c foods, being unwilling to try new tastes Having to keep a room a certain way • •"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":" Looking Into Worry and Obsessiveness 309 Having to make love the same way every time (or avoiding love-making because of feeling uncomfortable about the messiness that is in- volved with it) Becoming upset if the plans for the evening change at the last minute Having to do things a certain way at work, even if it’s not in the business’s best interest (e.g., not being fl exible enough to meet an im- portant customer’s needs) Making other family members do chores such as the dishes in a certain way (this often al- ienates others and they become less willing to help) Cognitive inflexibility can insidiously destroy happiness, joy, and intimacy. THE AUTOMATIC NO Because they have problems shifting attention, many people with cingulate overactivity become stuck on the word no. No seems to be the first word they say, without ever really thinking about whether or not no is even in their best interest. One of my patients told me about his father. Whenever my patient would ask his father for something, such as permis- • • • •"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"310 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE sion to borrow the car, the father would automatically say no. The children in the fam- ily all knew that if they wanted something from their father, he would fi rst say no to them, and then a week or two later he would think about the request and sometimes change his mind. “No” was always his fi rst response. I have had several employees who clearly had cingulate problems. Frequently they would be uncooperative and fi nd ways not to do what was asked of them. They seemed to frequently argue with requests and tell me why things couldn’t be done, rather than con- structively try to solve problems. When partners have cingulate problems, they often get the opposite of what they want. One man told me that whenever he wanted to make love with his wife, he had to act as if he really didn’t want to make love. He said, “If I would ask her directly, she would say no ninety-nine out of one hundred times. If I would lock our bedroom door at night [a sign that he wanted to be intimate with her], she would automatically become tense and say she wasn’t interested.

ROAD RAGE Something happens to many people when they get behind the wheel of a car; a territorial ani- mal comes growling to the surface. Cingulate people tend to be the worst.

I have one patient, a very bright, successful professional, who on several occasions chased other drivers who had cut him off and on two occasions got out of the car and bashed their windows in with a baseball bat he kept in the car. After the sec- ond incident, he came to see me. He said, “If I don’t get help for this, I’m sure I’ll end up in jail.” His cingulate gyrus was markedly overac- tive, causing him to get locked into the negative thoughts and subsequently be less able to con- trol his frustration.

She was distant from her family and locked into the private hell of obsessive-com- pulsive disorder. She cleaned her house for hours every night after work. She screamed at her husband and children when anything was out of place. She would become espe- cially hysterical if she saw a piece of hair on the fl oor, and she was often at the sink wash- ing her hands. She also made her husband and children wash their hands more than ten times a day. She stopped making love to her husband because she couldn’t stand the feel- ing of being messy.

At fi rst, her husband was very skeptical about the biological nature of her illness. Gail’s brain SPECT study showed marked increased activity in the cin- gulate system, demonstrating that she really did have trouble shifting her attention. With this information, I placed Gail on Zoloft. Within six weeks, she had signifi cantly relaxed, her ritualistic behavior had dimin- ished, and she stopped making her kids wash their hands every time they turned around. Her husband couldn’t believe the change. Gail was more like the woman he had married. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) affects somewhere between two and four mil- lion people in the United States. This disorder, almost without exception, dramatically impairs a person’s functioning and often affects the whole family. OCD is often unno- ticed by people in the outside world, but not by those who live with the obsessive-compul- sive person. The hallmarks of this disorder are obses- sions (recurrent disgusting or frightening thoughts) or compulsions (behaviors that a"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":" Looking Into Worry and Obsessiveness 315 person knows make no sense but feels com- pelled to do anyway). The obsessive thoughts are usually senseless and repugnant. They may involve repetitive thoughts of violence (such as killing one’s child), contamination (such as becoming infected by shaking hands), or doubt (such as having hurt someone in a traffi c accident, even though no such accident occurred). The more a person tries to control them, the more powerful they become. The most common compulsions involve hand washing, counting, checking, and touch- ing. These behaviors are often performed according to certain rules in a very strict or rigid manner. For example, a person with a counting compulsion may feel the need to count every crack on the pavement on the way to work or school. What would be a fi ve-min- ute walk for most people could turn into a three-or four-hour trip for a person with obsessive-compulsive disorder. A part of the individual generally recognizes the senseless- ness of the behavior and doesn’t get pleasure from carrying it out, although doing it often provides a release of tension. The intensity of OCD varies widely. Some people have mild versions, where, for exam-"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"316 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE ple, they have to make the house perfect before they go on vacation or they spend the vacation worrying about the condition of the house. The more serious forms can cause a person to be housebound for years. I once treated an eighty-three-year-old woman who had obsessive sexual thoughts that made her feel dirty inside. It got to the point where she would lock all her doors, draw the shades, turn off the lights, take the phone off the hook, and sit in the middle of a dark room, trying to stop the abhorrent sexual thoughts as they came into her mind. Her life became paralyzed by this behavior, and she needed to be hospitalized. Exciting research in the past few years has shown a biological pattern associated with OCD. Brain SPECT studies have shown increased blood fl ow in the cingulate system, along with increased activity in the basal gan- glia (often the anxiety component of the problem). Like most forms of psychiatric illness, part of effective treatment for OCD often involves medication. At this writing, there are eight “antiobsessive medications” and more on the way. The current medications that have shown"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":" Looking Into Worry and Obsessiveness 317 effectiveness with OCD are Anafranil (clo- mipramine), Prozac (fluoxetine), Zoloft (sertraline), Paxil (paroxetine), Effexor (venla- faxine), Serzone (nefazodone), Remeron (mirtazapine), and Luvox (fluvoxamine). These medications have provided many pat ie nt s w it h pr ofou nd r el ief f r om OC D s y mp - toms. In addition, behavior therapy is often helpful. The patient is gradually exposed to the situa- tions most likely to bring out the rituals and habits. The therapist teaches the patient thought- stopping techniques and strongly encourages him or her to face his or her worst fear (for exam- ple, by persuading a patient with a fear of dirt or contamination to play in the mud). OCD SPECTRUM DISORDERS There is a group of disorders that have been recently labeled obsessive-compulsive spec- trum disorders. People with these disorders get stuck on unwanted, repetitive thoughts and cannot get them out of their minds unless they act in a specifi c manner. According to psychia- trist Ronald Pies, postulated OCD spectrum disorders include: trichotillomania (pulling"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"318 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE out one’s own hair), onychophagia (nail bit- ing), Tourette’s syndrome (involuntary motor and vocal tics), kleptomania, body dysmorphic disorder (feeling that a part of the body is excessively ugly), hypochondria, autism, com- pulsive shopping, pathological gambling, chronic pain, addictive disorders, and eating disorders. I would also add oppositional defi - ant disorder. A sample of repetitive thoughts that signifi - cantly interfere with behavior might include: Chronic pain: “I hurt! I hurt! I hurt!” Eating disorders, such as anorexia and bulimia: “I’m too fat! I’m too fat! I’m too fat!” despite rational evidence to the contrary . Addictive disorders: “I need a drink! I need a drink!” Pathological gambling: “Next time I’ll win! Next time I’ll win! Next time I’ll win!” Compulsive shopping: “I need to buy this one thing! I need to buy this one thing! I need to buy this one thing!” Oppositional defi ant disorder: “No I won’t! No I won’t! You can’t make me!” In 1991, Susan Swedo, M.D., at the National Institutes of Mental Health in Bethesda, Maryland, hypothesized that patients with • • • • • •"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":" Looking Into Worry and Obsessiveness 319 trichotillomania would exhibit the same brain imaging as those with OCD. At rest, these patients exhibited a different brain pattern. Yet when these patients were treated with the antiobsessive antidepressant Anafranil, there was decreased activity in the cingulate aspect of the frontal lobes, which has also been found with successful treatment of OCD with anti- obsessive antidepressants. Here are several case examples from my own practice to illustrate OCD spectrum dis- orders. CHRONIC PAIN Stewart Stewart, a forty-year-old roofer, had hurt his back ten years earlier when he fell off a roof. He had undergone six back operations but remained in constant pain. He was essentially bedridden and about to lose his family because all he could think about was the pain. The threat of losing his family catalyzed him to get a psychiatric evaluation. His SPECT revealed marked overactivity in the cingulate system. He was placed on 200 milligrams of Anafranil per day. After fi ve weeks, he reported that his"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"320 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE back still hurt, but he was much less focused on the pain. He was able to get out of bed and start back to school. Other researchers have also reported several cases of intractable pain that were responsive to treatment with antiob- sessive medications. EATING DISORDERS Leslie Twenty-year-old Leslie suffered from bulimia for three years. She got to the point where she was using laxatives several times a day in increasing doses, along with exercising for two to three hours a day. Her binges were also becoming more frequent. When she sought treatment, she felt totally out of control. Dur- ing her initial evaluation, she said she knew her behavior was abnormal and she hated it. However, when she got the urge to eat, she felt she had to give in to it, and afterward she could not get the thoughts of being overweight out of her head. She had a maternal aunt who had been diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder.

With this information, she was placed in an eating disorders group and given Prozac (an antiobsessive antidepressant). Over the next three months, she improved markedly, to the point where she was eating normally, not taking any laxatives at all, and exercising less than an hour a day. In 1992, the Prozac Bulimia Nervosa Col- laborative Study Group reported that daily therapy with 60 milligrams of Prozac signifi - cantly decreased the frequency of binge eating and self-induced vomiting. In the medical lit- erature Prozac has been reported to decrease activity in the cingulate in obsessive-compul- sive patients. DRUG OR ALCOHOL ADDICTION Joshua Joshua began using drugs and alcohol at the age of twelve. When his parents fi nally caught on to his drug abuse at the age of sixteen, Joshua reported that he had used LSD more than a hundred times and he was drinking a pint of whiskey a day. He said that he was"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"322 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE unable to stop, even though he had wanted to many times. When his parents brought him in for evaluation, it was revealed that there was a strong history of drug and alcohol abuse on both sides of his family, even though neither of his parents drank alcohol or abused drugs. After his SPECT study revealed signifi cant overactivity in the cingulate system, Joshua was placed on Zoloft in addition to his indi- vidual and support group therapy. He reported that he still had periodic cravings for the substances, but that he could avoid them more easily with the behavioral tech- niques he learned. He was able to get the thoughts about drugs and alcohol out of his head. PATHOLOGICAL GAMBLING Many people enjoy gambling. They feel happy when they win, discouraged when they lose. And they realize that gambling is a game of chance, like many things in life. Some people, however, become addicted to gambling and it can ruin every aspect of their lives. Pathologi- cal gambling is defined by the American Psychiatric Association as persistent and recur-"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":" Looking Into Worry and Obsessiveness 323 rent maladaptive gambling behavior that disrupts personal, family, or vocational pur- suits. Pathological gambling usually starts with an important “big win.” The high from the win gets “stuck” in a gambler’s head, and he or she begins to chase it, even to the point of self- destruction. Adam Adam came to our offi ce out of desperation. His wife had just left him, and he had seen an attorney to discuss fi ling for bankruptcy. His gambling had gotten out of control. He was a successful entrepreneur who had worked hard at starting his own business, but in the few years before he came to see me he had begun neglecting his business to spend more of his time at the racetrack and drive back and forth to Reno and Lake Tahoe. In our fi rst session he told me, “I feel compelled to gamble. I know it is ruining my life, but it seems I have to place a bet or the tension just builds and builds. Before I started losing everything, I knew I could win. It was all I thought about!” Adam came come from an alcoholic home; both his"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"324 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE father and paternal grandfather were alco- holics. Even though Adam himself had never had a problem with alcohol, he clearly had an addiction. Explaining the cingulate sys- tem to Adam was helpful. He could identify many people in his family who had problems shifting attention. “You should see our fam- ily gatherings,” he told me. “Someone is always mad at someone else. People in my family can hold grudges for years and years.” In addition to going to Gamblers Anony- mous and psychotherapy, Adam took a small daily dose of Prozac to help him shift away from the obsessive thoughts about gambling. Eventually he was able to reconnect with his wife and rebuild his business. COMPULSIVE SPENDING Compulsive shopping is another manifestation of problems in the cingulate system. Compul- sive shoppers get high from the pursuit and purchase of goods. They spend inordinate amounts of time thinking about shopping activities. This addiction can ruin their fi nan- cial status and their relationships and have a negative impact on their work."},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":" Looking Into Worry and Obsessiveness 325 Jill Jill worked as the offi ce manager for a big law fi rm in San Francisco. Before work, during her lunch hours, and after work she found herself drawn to the stores at Union Square, near her offi ce. She felt a rush of internal excitement as she picked out clothes for herself and her fam- ily members. She also enjoyed buying presents for others, even if they were just acquaintances. It was the act of shopping that was important. Even though she knew she shouldn’t be spend- ing the money, it felt too good to stop. She and her husband had many fi ghts over the money she spent during her shopping sprees. She began embezzling money from work. She took care of the company checkbook and began to write and cash checks to fi ctitious vendors in order to cover her personal debt. When a busi- ness audit almost found her out, she stopped. But her addiction didn’t. Her husband fi nally divorced her when he uncovered credit card debt in the amount of thirty thousand dollars. Ashamed, scared, and depressed, Jill entered treatment.

Her SPECT study revealed a markedly overactive cingulate system. When she got locked into a train of thought or behav- ior (spending) she had real problems shifting away from it. Zoloft (an antiobsessive antide- pressant) was helpful for her as part of the healing process. OPPOSITIONAL DEFIANT DISORDER Oppositional defi ant disorder (ODD) is con- sidered a behavioral disorder of children and teenagers who are negativistic, hostile, defi ant, and contrary. They tend to be argumentative, are easily annoyed, and lose their temper often, especially when they do not get their way. These children are chronically uncooperative. They tend to say no even when saying yes is clearly in their own best interest. The question I ask parents to help me diagnose this disorder is “How many times out of ten when you ask this child to do something will he (or she) do it the first time without arguing or fighting?” Most children will comply seven to eight times out of ten without a problem. For most ODD children the answer is usually three or fewer; for many of them it is zero."},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":" Looking Into Worry and Obsessiveness 327 David I fi rst met David when he was seven years old. He came into my offi ce with his mother. He was wearing typically dirty shoes, and the min- ute he sat down, he put his feet up on my navy-blue leather couch. His mother, embar- rassed by his rudeness, took his feet off the couch. He put them back on the couch. She took them off. He put them back on again. Looking angry, she took them off again. Right away, he put them back on and she took them off. I was watching the cingulate of the mother/ son pair in action. David had to have his feet on the couch, mostly because his mother didn’t want them on the couch (he also probably wanted to see what would happen if he irri- tated me). His mother couldn’t stand the fact that he wouldn’t listen to her, and she had to have his feet off the couch. Seeing the mother/ son cingulate in action, I knew that many of their problems probably stemmed from an inability to shift attention and to hold their own positions. To confi rm my suspicions about David, I said ten innocuous things, such as “The weather is good today...Don’t you think California is nice? [he was from out of state]..."},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"328 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE I like your outfi t” and so on. David argued with eight of the ten things I said. “The weather is awful...I hate California...My mother made me wear this stupid outfi t...” With an incredu- lous look on her face, David’s mother argued with him: “This is beautiful weather...Yester- day you said you wanted to live in California...This is your favorite outfit...” Further conversation with his mother sug- gested we had a generational cingulate problem. When I fi rst suggested a connection between cingulate overactivity and oppositional defi - ant disorder, many of my colleagues did not take me seriously. How could ODD, which is an externalizing behavior disorder, be related to OCD, an internal anxiety disorder? After seeing this pattern over years it makes perfect sense to me. These children cannot shift their attention. They get stuck on No, No way, Never, You can’t make me do it . They often have “cingulate parents,” and many of them have a family history of OCD and other cingulate problems. One of the most interesting fi ndings among the patients we studied was that mothers or"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":" Looking Into Worry and Obsessiveness 329 fathers who had obsessive thoughts, compul- sive behaviors, or infl exible personality styles tended to have children with ODD. We stud- ied eleven cases that exhibited this parent-child pattern and obtained brain SPECT studies on both the parent and the child. In nine out of the eleven, both the par- ent’s and the child’s brain SPECT study revealed increased cingulate activity. Both a biological explanation for this fi nding and behavioral etiology can be entertained. One can postulate that the fi nding of increased cingulate activity (biological component) can cause parents to have problems shifting atten- tion and become stuck on thoughts or behaviors and cause them to be infl exible, while the child’s inability to shift attention causes his behavior to appear oppositional. It is also possible that the parent’s rigid style causes the child to react in an oppositional way (the behavioral part) as a way to gain independence and autonomy, which induces the subsequent SPECT fi nding. As mentioned above, it has been observed that the brain SPECT abnormalities in the cingulate normalize with effective treatment.

STRESS OFTEN INCREASES ACTIVITY IN THE CINGULATE SYSTEM In many children and teenagers with ODD, I obtain both rest and concentration SPECT studies. Interestingly, in about half of the cases, I see a further increase in cingulate activity when these patients try to concen- trate. Clinically, I fi nd that this correlates with those oppositional children and teens who get worse (“more stuck”) under pressure or when they are pushed to comply with certain requests. I have seen this occur frequently on an adolescent treatment unit. Some of these teens would become so “stuck” that they refused to comply with the staff requests and ended up on restriction or even, in some cases, in restraints because they could not shift their attention in order to behave more appropriately. It can be particularly bad if a cingulate teen meets up with a cingulate nurse who cannot back off a little to let the situa- tion defuse."},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"332 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE Ken and Katie Ken’s family illustrates the problems an overac- tive cingulate can cause. His wife and two daughters came to his offi ce to pick him up and go out to dinner. His youngest daughter, Katie, smiled when she saw him and gave him a big hug. As they were going to drive in two separate cars, Ken said to her, “Come on, Katie, ride with me in my car.” Katie had been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder, and she was often oppositional with Ken. He wanted to spend some extra time with her on the way to the restaurant. As soon as he said, “Come with me,” she said, “No. I don’t want to.” Ken’s feel- ings were a little hurt. He replied, “Come on, Katie, I want to be with you.” She said, “ No! I’m going with Mommy.” Not one to give up easily, Ken physically picked her up and put her in the car. She yelled, screamed, and cried half- way to the restaurant (real quality time). All of a sudden she stopped crying, dried her eyes, and said, “I’m sorry, Daddy. I really wanted to go with you.” When he had pushed Katie to go with him, her brain locked. She got stuck on her fi rst reaction and became unable to think about what she actually wanted to do."},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":" Looking Into Worry and Obsessiveness 333 Katie’s SPECT study showed increased activity in the cingulate system. All of Ken’s children are grandchildren of alcoholics. I have seen a signifi cant connection between a family history of alcoholism and increased activity in the cingulate system. Given that children and teens with ODD tend to “lock up” cognitively when they are pushed to comply, I have found behavioral techniques, such as giving options and distrac- tion, more effective in obtaining compliance. When you give oppositional children or teens an option as to when they might do something, they tend to be less likely to get stuck on “No, I won’t do it.” When they are stuck on a negative thought or behavior, I have found it helpful to distract them for a bit and then come back to the issue at hand later. Ken would have been better at getting Katie to go with him in the car if he had given her a choice rather than just tell- ing her she was going to go with him.

Brain SPECT stud- ies were obtained on a mother and two of her children.

She suffered from signifi cant irritability, crying spells, sleeplessness, lack of appetite and weight loss, problems concentrating, and diffi culty in managing her children. Her con- dition was brought to a crisis with suicidal behavior when she separated from her hus- band. She was initially seen by another psychiatrist and started on an antidepressant, which had little effect. I started to see her in psychotherapy and placed her on a different antidepressant. It had a positive effect, and she did well. After several months, she decided that she “should be stronger than the depres- sion” and took herself off the medication.

I asked her more pointed questions to see if she had obsessivecompulsive disorder. Although she denied it at the initial evalua- tion, in fact she was perfectionistic at home and had repetitive negative thoughts. She tear- fully remarked, “You mean my husband was right when he thought it was strange that I had to have all the shirts in the drawer but- toned a certain way and put just so in the drawer or I would become very upset?” Celina then reported rituals that her eight- year-old daughter, Laura, would perform before entering a new room, such as running a finger under her nose and licking her lips. Laura also had a locking compulsion. Every time someone left the house, she would be right behind, locking the door. Imagine how irritated her brother and sister were because"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"336 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE they could never go out of the house to play without being locked out! I was also seeing Celina’s ten-year-old son, Samuel, for attention deficit disorder and oppositional defi ant disorder. Samuel’s ADD symptoms did not respond to Ritalin, Dexe- drine, or Cylert (stimulants used to treat ADD). Celina reported that once Samuel got a thought in his mind, he was unable to let it go. He would follow her around the house for two and a half hours asking her the same ques- tions she had already answered. Samuel was also one of the most negative, hostile children I had ever met. Even though his mother was depressed, he defi ed her, yelled at his sisters, and seemed to do whatever he could to make the turmoil in the home worse. Brain SPECT studies were done on both children to see if there might be a genetic com- ponent to their problems and/or a similar response to treatment. Interestingly, both of them also showed increased cingulate activity. Neither of the children had limbic system fi nd- ings or showed evidence of clinical depression. Based on the SPECT and clinical informa- tion, Celina was placed on Prozac (which has been shown to normalize or calm cingulate"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":" Looking Into Worry and Obsessiveness 337 hyperactivity) to decrease her depression and help lessen her obsessive thinking and com- pulsive behaviors. She had a dramatically positive response and reported that she was no longer bothered when things weren’t “just so.” The scan also convinced her that her con- dition was at least, in part, biological and not her fault or the result of a weak will, which encouraged her to take her medication for a longer period of time. Additionally, Samuel was started on Prozac and had a similarly positive response. His behavior became much less oppositional, and his school performance dramatically improved. He made the honor roll for the fi rst time in his life and was placed in the gifted-and-talented program the following year.

Healing this part of the mind involves training the mind to see options and new ideas. Throughout this book I have written about the use of medications in healing the brain.

I gave him the task of writing down the times he was stuck on these negative thoughts about work. They occurred every several hours. The ANT-killing exercise (see chapter 4) was help- ful for him, but it didn’t completely prevent these thoughts from circling in his head. His homework became distraction.

Listen to music that makes you feel positive . Take a walk . Do a chore . Play with a pet . Do structured meditation . Focus on a word and do not allow any other thoughts to enter your mind (imagine a broom that sweeps out all other thoughts) .

Use the time during the deep breath to ask yourself whether you really want to deny your partner. Is it in your best interest to say no and con- tinue doing what you’re doing, or is it in your best interest to get close to your partner? The automatic no has ruined many relationships. Take enough time to ask yourself if saying no is really what you want to say.

After you write out a thought that has “gotten stuck,” generate a list of things you can do about it and things you can’t do about it. For example, if you are worried about a situation at work, such as whether you’ll get a promo- tion, do the following: 1. Write out the thought: “I’m worried about whether or not I’ll get the promotion at work.” 2. Make a list of the things you can do about the worry: “I can do the best job I can at work.” “I will continue to be reliable, hardworking, and creative.” “I will make sure the boss knows I desire the promotion.” “In a confi dent (not bragging) way, I will make sure the boss knows about my contribu- tions to the company.” 3.

Finding someone to discuss the worries, fears, or repetitive behaviors with can be very helpful. Often just talking about feeling stuck will open new options. Through the years, I have used men- tors to help me through some of the problems I’ve had to face. Others can be a “sounding board,” helping you to see options and offer- ing reality checks.

The attack on my work caused me a lot of anxiety and sleepless nights. (Remem- ber, I have right basal ganglia overactivity, and I have a strong tendency to avoid confl ict and confrontation.) I sought the advice of a close friend who had seen the development of my work and who had referred to me many patients who had benefi ted from this technology. When I told him about the attack on my work, he smiled. He wondered why I had expected anything different. He said, “People who say things that differ from the norm used to get burned at the stake. The more controversial, the more of a nerve you’re striking in the established com- munity.” When he said “What else would you expect?” it suggested a new way to interpret what had happened. I could look differently at the behavior of these other researchers. (In fact, one of the most vocal detractors of my work himself published research fi ndings a year later confi rming what I had seen clini- cally.)

Take ten minutes, take ten hours, take ten days! If you distract yourself from a lose-lose situation, you’re often able to come back later and work it out. I learned long ago not to try to argue with people who have cingulate system problems. When another person is “stuck” on a thought or behavior, logical reasoning usually won’t work. One of the best techniques I’ve found to deal with those who get stuck is as follows: I will briefl y make the point I want to make.

Often, when we come back to the issue, the other person has a more open mind to the sit- uation. Here’s an example. Jackie came to see me about marital prob- lems. Her husband traveled and was unable to attend many of the sessions. In the individual sessions, I saw that Jackie frequently became locked into her position and left little room for alternative explanations of behavior. Her hus- ba nd said t hat she wou ld go on a nd on for hou r s and not listen to anything he said. As I realized this was her pattern, I used the brief “attack and retreat” model I described.

She said that she was a very good listener. I didn’t argue with her, but went on to something else for a while. The next session, Jackie talked about listening more to her husband.

I teach parents to get out of struggles with their teenagers by briefl y making their points and moving on to other topics. For important issues, come back to them at later times. One of the best marital suggestions I give couples, which I also mentioned in chapter 8, is “Go to the bathroom.” When you can see that your partner is beginning to get into cin- gulate territory and is starting to go over the same point again and again, excuse yourself and say you have to go to the bathroom. Few people will argue with you when nature calls, and it is often helpful just to take a break. If the cingulate problem in the other person seems particularly strong, take a big book with you and settle in for a lengthier stay. CG PRESCRIPTION 7: TRY MAKING PARADOXICAL REQUESTS Remember “reverse psychology”? It works with cingulate folks. But you need to be sly about it. In “reverse psychology,” you basically ask for the opposite of what you want. When"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"352 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE you want a kiss from a naturally oppositional two-year-old, say, “I don’t want a kiss.” The next moment the child is begging to give you a kiss. When you want someone to help you with a chore, say, “You probably wouldn’t want to help me with this chore.” Family therapists have developed whole paradoxical treatment prescriptions to deal with resistant couples. The therapists bet on the couple’s resistance to suggestions. For example, if the couple is having problems spending time together and fi nding time for sex, the therapist would tell them not to spend any time together and defi - nitely not to have sex. Many couples fi nd that after the paradoxical suggestions they start to spend more time together and make love more regularly and passionately than they have in years. Paradoxical suggestions and interventions have been used as therapeutic prescriptions by psychotherapists for many years. These inter- ventions have gone under many names, such as antisuggestion, negative pr actice, paradoxical inten- tion, confusion technique, declaring hopelessness, restraining change, prescribing a relapse , and ther- apeutic double blind . Basically, they all involve suggesting the opposite of the desired response."},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":" Getting Unstuck 353 A common paradoxical suggestion is given to people who have trouble sleeping: “Stay awake as long as possible when going to bed.” In treat- ing male patients who could not urinate in public rest rooms because of anxiety, psycholo- gists L.

Turner told them they should go to public rest rooms and go through the entire procedure of urinating (stand in front of the urinal, unzip their pants, and take out their penis), but refrain from uri- nating. With repeated trials, the men were able to overcome their fear of urinating in public. It is my contention that these tactics probably work best on cingulate clients. Whenever you want a cingulate person to do something for you, it is best to make it look as if it is his or her idea. If you ask for many things directly, you are likely to be disap- pointed. Ask for the person’s input. Get his or her feedback. Here are some examples: If you want someone to meet you for dinner, it is often best to ask what time is good for him or her as opposed to telling him or her to meet you at a certain time .

Remember, oppositional children often become rigid or stuck in negative behavior patterns. Effectively intervening with them can make a signifi cant difference in their lives. The fi rst prescription is to know when to distract their attention in order to break the loops of thoughts or behav- iors that cause them to be oppositional.

Josh One prescription I use is having the parent read from a favorite book when the child begins to get stuck or locked into a negative thought or behavior. For example, eight- year-old Josh got stuck on being afraid of going to school. Before school he would com- plain of headaches, stomachaches, and anything else he thought his mother would accept to keep him home from school. When she caught on to his ploy, she would try to make him go to school anyway. When that happened, the little boy would scream, cry, throw tantrums, and threaten to run away from home. As the problem escalated, she brought Josh to see me. Not only was he anx- ious about school, his behavior was typically oppositional. The fi rst intervention was to tell Josh in no uncertain terms that he was going to school! It was the law. It was good for him. And if we allowed him to stay home"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"356 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE from school, he would become more afraid of it and would actually become “frozen by his fears.” To help him, on mornings when he felt as if he couldn’t go to school or he was worried about school, his mom or dad would distract him from his bad thoughts. Josh was very interested in insects. He had many beloved books about insects. When Josh became upset, his parents would read to him about a new insect and try to make it as interesting as possible. If Josh still gave his parents a problem about going to school, then he had to spend the day sitting on his bed without watching television or being able to go out to play. If he was too sick to go to school, then he was too sick to do anything else. Before this intervention Josh had prob- lems eight mornings out of ten. After the fi rst month, Josh’s problems in the morning diminished to two mornings out of ten. By the third month, the problem was eliminated. Both parts of the intervention were crucial to its success. His parents had to let Josh know clearly that his fearful, oppositional behavior would not get him anything positive. The parents would not be bullied. He was going to school, or he would have to sit on his bed"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":" Getting Unstuck 357 all day long (no secondary gain by being sick). Second, the parents used distraction to help Josh shift his attention away from his fears that got stuck. It is essential that parents assert their ulti- mate authority over cingulate children. Parents cannot allow oppositional behavior to prevail. If they do, it only reinforces the oppositional behavior, which could ruin a child’s life. Per- missive parents don’t teach their children to deal with authority, and those kids have trou- ble socially and in school. Authoritative, fi rm parents tend to raise the most effective chil- dren. Just as when people who have OCD give in to their obsessive thoughts or compulsive behaviors those behaviors become stronger and harder to fi ght, when you give in to oppo- sitional children and allow them to oppose you and disobey their oppositional behavior only becomes worse. The earlier you train oppositional children out of this behavior, the better off everyone will be. To that end, I have developed a set of parenting rules that is the fi rst step in dealing with these children. It is important to clearly spell out the rules and make sure the child knows you are going to"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"358 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE back them up. Here are two of the rules that deal with oppositional behavior: Do what Mom and Dad say the fi rst time . No arguing with parents . These rules spell out that you have authority as parents and will not allow your child to argue with you. If you make it a rule for chil- dren to comply the fi rst time, then they know that is what is expected of them. You must also quickly intervene if they do not comply the fi rst time. Do not tell a child to do some- thing eight times. Your chance of abusing the child verbally or physically goes up dramati- cally if you repetitively tell him or her to do things and don’t intervene early. For exam- ple, if you tell a child to do something and he or she refuses to do it or doesn’t do it within a reasonable period of time, very quickly say, “You have a choice. You can do it now, or you can take a time-out and then you can do it. I don’t care, it’s up to you.” If the child doesn’t move quickly to do what you asked, then put him or her in time-out. Repeat as necessary. Deal with misbehavior quickly, fi rmly, and unemotionally. The more emotional you get, the more these kids tend to misbehave. Con- sistency is essential here."},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":" Getting Unstuck 359 The second rule, “No arguing with par- ents,” is very important for oppositional children. If you allow the child to argue with you, then you are only reinforcing and strengthening his or her cingulate resistance. Of course, you want to hear your child’s opin- ion. But draw the line between stating one’s opinion and arguing. You might want to tell your child, “As your parents, we want to hear your opinion, but arguing means you have made your point more than two times.” These parenting interventions are always more effective when you do them in the con- text of a good relationship with your child. Parents who become “limbically bonded” to their children by spending time and listening to them have fewer problems with oppositional behavior. In summary, use distraction when neces- sary but also be fi rm and authoritative with oppositional children. Pick your battles with them, and do not fight over every issue. Unfortunately, oppositional children often have one or two cingulate parents, which only feeds the negative family dynamics. Flexibility on the parents’ part is often very helpful."},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"360 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE CG PRESCRIPTION 9: CONSIDER CINGULATE MEDICATIONS Medications are often very helpful in the cin- gulate part of the brain, especially those medications that modulate the neurotransmit- ter serotonin. Medications that increase serotonin in the brain are termed serotonergic. These include Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Anafranil, Effexor, Remeron, Serzone, Desyrel, and Luvox. Sev- eral research studies have shown that when these medications are effective, they normal- ize activity in the cingulate system. Clinically, I have seen these medications decrease patients’ repetitive thoughts and compulsive behaviors, calm overfocus or worry, and relax people who have a tendency to be frozen by their inability to see options. When these medications work, they often have a dramatic effect on thoughts and behaviors.

His wife also reported frequent episodes when Rob would become upset about something, be unable to shift away from the thoughts that were upsetting him, lose control, and exhibit aggressive behavior such as breaking furniture or punching holes in the walls. Rob had a childhood history of oppositional behavior. As part of his evaluation, a brain SPECT study was done that showed markedly increased uptake in his cingulate gyrus. I started him on Anafranil (clomipramine), which has been used in patients with obsessive thinking. Over two months of treatment, his dose of Anafranil was increased to 225 milligrams a day.

In addition, Saint-John’s-wort, a natural herbal treatment, in my experience can also be very helpful in raising serotonin levels and calming the cingulate part of the brain.

CG PRESCRIPTION 10: TRY NUTRITIONAL INTERVENTIONS Low serotonin levels and increased cingulate activity are often associated with worrying, moodiness, emotional rigidity, and irritabil- ity. There are two ways that food can increase serotonin levels. Foods high in carbohydrate, such as pastas, potatoes, bread, pastries, pret- zels, and popcorn, increase 1-tryptophan levels (the natural amino acid building block for serotonin) in the blood, resulting in more 1-tryptophan being available to enter the brain, where it is converted to serotonin. The calming effect of serotonin can often be felt in thirty minutes or less by eating these foods. Cerebral serotonin levels can also be raised by eating foods rich in tryptophan, such as chicken, turkey, salmon, beef, peanut butter, eggs, green peas, potatoes, and milk.

For example, the high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets that I recommend for low-dopamine states (related to prefrontal cortex underactivity) often make cingulate problems worse. L-trypto- phan is a relatively small amino acid. When you eat a high-protein diet, the larger amino acids compete more successfully to get into the brain, causing lower levels of brain serotonin and more negative emotional reac- tiveness. Nutritional supplementation with l-trypto- phan can also be very helpful. L-tryptophan was taken off the market a number of years ago because one contaminated batch, from one manufacturer, caused a rare muscle dis- ease and a number of deaths. The l-tryptophan actually had nothing to do with the deaths. L- tryptophan is a naturally occurring amino acid found in milk, meat, and eggs. Many of my patients have found it very helpful for improving sleep, decreasing aggressiveness, and improving mood control.

In doses of 12–20 milligrams a day it has been shown to decrease moodiness, depression, and prob- lems of overfocus. Check with your doctor if you want to try these supplements. CG PRESCRIPTION 11: EXERCISE Exercise can also be very helpful in calming worries and increasing cognitive fl exibility. Exercise works by increasing brain levels of l-tryptophan. As mentioned above, l-trypto- phan is a relatively small amino acid and has trouble competing against the larger amino acids to enter the brain. During exercise, more of the large amino acids are utilized to replenish muscle strength, which causes a decrease in the availability of these larger amino acids in the bloodstream.

Language is one of the keys to being human. It allows us to commu nicate w it h ot her human beings and to leave a legacy of our thoughts and actions for future generations. Receptive language, being able to receive and under- stand speech and written words, requires temporal lobe stability. The ability to accu- rately hear your child say, “I love you,” or to listen and be frightened by a scary story is housed in this part of the brain. The domi- nant temporal lobe helps to process sounds and written words into meaningful informa- tion. Being able to read in an effi cient manner, remember what you read, and integrate the new information relies heavily on the domi- nant temporal lobe. Problems here contribute to language struggles, miscommunication, and reading disabilities.

Memories infl uence every action and pattern of action you undertake. Essential components of memory are integrated and stored in the temporal lobes. When this part of the brain is damaged or dysfunctional, memory is often impaired. Memories can sabotage our chances for success and effectiveness. I once treated a couple with severe marital problems. The hus- band had problems with depression and attention defi cit disorder. His wife tended to be rigid and unforgiving. Ultimately her mem- ories destroyed the relationship. Shortly after they began therapy, the husband’s problems were diagnosed and treated with medication. He got signifi cant relief from his symptoms. Everyone except his wife noticed the improve- ment. Because his more positive behavior was inconsistent with her experience, she could not see his progress and remained in old pat- terns of behavior. She was stuck on blaming him. She was unwilling to get help for herself, and ultimately the marriage died. It was her memories, rather than the new reality, that killed it.

The ability to consistently feel stable and positive, despite the ups and downs of everyday life, is impor- tant for the development and maintenance of consistent character and personality. Opti- mum activity in the temporal lobes enhances mood stability, while increased or decreased activity in this part of the brain leads to fl uc- tuating, inconsistent, or unpredictable moods and behaviors. The nondominant temporal lobe (usually the right) is involved with reading facial expressions, processing verbal tones and into- nations from others, hearing rhythms, appreciating music, and visual learning. Recognizing familiar faces and facial expres- sions and being able to accurately perceive voice tones and intonations and give them appropriate meaning are critical social skills. Being able to tell when someone is happy to see you, scared of you, bored, or in a hurry is essential for effectively interacting with oth- ers.

Most commonly, these problems were associated with defi cits of the right temporal lobe. Results of current research suggest that knowledge of emotional facial expressions is inborn, not learned (infants can recognize their mother’s emotional faces). Yet when there are problems in this part of the brain, social skills can be impaired. The temporal lobes help us process the world of sight and sound, and give us the lan- guage of life.

The front wall of the cavity includes a sharp bony ridge (the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone), which frequently damages the front part of the temporal lobes in even minor head inju- ries. (God would have done better to put bumper guards on that ridge.) Since the tem- poral lobes sit in a cavity surrounded by bone on fi ve sides (front, back, right side, left side, and underside) they can be damaged by a blow to the head from almost any angle.

The temporal lobes, pre- frontal cortex, and cingulate gyrus are the parts of the brain most vulnerable to damage by virtue of their placement within the skull. They are also the most heavily involved in thinking and behavior. Blaine Blaine, age sixty, came to see me because his wife heard me speak at a national conference and she was sure he had a temporal lobe prob- lem. He had memory lapses. He was moody"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"380 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE and he was often aggressive.

When Blaine was fi ve years old, he had fallen off a porch head-fi rst into a pile of bricks. As a schoolboy, he had had a terrible time learning to read and had frequently gotten into fi ghts. His brain SPECT study showed signifi cant abnormalities in his Blaine’s Brain 3-D underside surface view Notice decreased left temporal lobe activity (arrow). 3-D underside active view Notice increased deep left temporal lobe activity (arrow)."},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":" Looking Into Memory and Temper 381 left temporal lobe: a decrease in activity in both the front and back and an area of increased activity deep within. Seeing these abnormalities, it was clear to me that many of Blaine’s problems came from the instability of his left temporal lobe, likely a result of his childhood accident. I placed him on Depak- ote, an antiseizure medication known to stabilize activity in the temporal lobes. When I spoke to him three weeks later, he was elated. The buzzing and shadows had gone away, and he had not lost his temper since he had started the medication. He said, “That was the fi rst time in my life I can remember going three weeks and not screaming at someone.” Four years later his temper remains under control. Common problems associated with left temporal lobe abnormalities include aggres- sion (internally or externally directed), dark or violent thoughts, sensitivity to slights, mild paranoia, word-finding problems, auditory processing problems, reading diffi culties, and emotional instability. Let’s look at each of these in detail. The aggressiveness often seen with left tem- poral lobe abnormalities can be expressed"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"382 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE either externally toward others or internally in aggressive thoughts about oneself. Aggressive behavior is complex, but in a large study per- formed in my clinic on people who had assaulted another person or damaged prop- erty, more than 70 percent had left temporal lobe abnormalities. It seems that temporal lobe damage or dysfunction makes a person more prone to irritable, angry, or violent thoughts (much more on this will be discussed in the chapter on violence). One patient of mine with temporal lobe dysfunction (proba- bly inherited, as his father was a “rageaholic”) complains of frequent, intense violent thoughts. He feels shame over having these thoughts. “I can be walking down the street,” he told me, “and someone accidentally brushes against me, and I get the thought of wanting to shoot him or club him to death. These thoughts frighten me.” Thankfully, even though his SPECT study confi rmed left tem- poral lobe dysfunction, he had good prefrontal cortex function, so he is able to supervise his behavior and maintain impulse control over his terrible thoughts. In a similar case, Misty, a forty-fi ve-year-old woman, came to see me about her angry outbursts. One day, someone"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":" Looking Into Memory and Temper 383 had accidentally bumped into her in the gro- cery store and she had started screaming at the woman. “I just don’t understand where my anger comes from,” she said. “I’ve had sixteen years of therapy, and it is still there. Out of the blue, I’ll go off. I get the most hor- rid thoughts. You’d hate me if you knew.” She had fallen off the top of a bunk bed when she was four years old and had been unconscious for only a minute or two. The front and back parts of her left temporal lobe were clearly damaged. A small daily dose of Depakote was very helpful in calming the “monster” within. I often see internal aggressiveness with left temporal lobe abnormalities, expressed in sui- cidal behavior. In a study from our clinic we saw left temporal lobe abnormalities in 62 percent of our patients who had serious sui- cidal thoughts or actions. After I gave a lecture about the brain in Oakland, a woman came up to me in tears. “Oh, Dr. Amen,” she said, “I know my whole family has temporal lobe problems. My paternal great-grandfather killed himself. My father’s mother and father killed themselves. My father and two of my three uncles killed themselves, and last year my son tried to kill himself. Is there help for"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"384 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE us?” I had the opportunity to evaluate and scan three members of her family. Two had left temporal lobe abnormalities, and Depak- ote was helpful in their treatment. In terms of suicidal behavior, one very sad case highlights the involvement of the left temporal lobes. For years I wrote a column in my local newspaper about the brain and behavior. One column was about temporal lobe dysfunction and suicidal behavior. A week or so after it appeared a mother came to see me. She told me that her twenty-year-old daughter had killed herself several months earlier and she was grief stricken over the unbelievable turn of events in her life. “She was the most ideal child a mother could have,” she said. “She did great in school. She was polite, cooperative, and a joy to have around. Then it all changed. Two years ago she had a bicycle accident. She accidentally hit a branch in the street and was fl ipped over the handle- bars, landing on the left side of her face. She was unconscious when an onlooker got to her, but shortly thereafter she came to. Nothing was the same after that. She was moody, angry, easily set off. She started to complain of ‘bad thoughts’ in her head. I took her to see"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":" Looking Into Memory and Temper 385 a therapist, but it didn’t seem to help. One evening, I heard a loud noise out front. She had shot and killed herself on our front lawn.” Her tears made me cry. I knew that her daughter might well have been helped if some- one had recognized her “minor head injury,” which had likely caused temporal lobe dam- age; anticonvulsant medication might well have prevented her suicide. Of interest, in the past twenty years psychiatrists have been using anticonvulsants to treat many psychiatric problems. My suspicion is that we are fre- quently treating underlying physiological brain problems that we label as psychiatric. People with left temporal lobe abnormali- ties are often more sensitive to slights and even appear mildly paranoid. Unlike people with schizophrenia, who can become frankly para- noid, people with temporal lobe dysfunction often think others are talking or laughing about them when there is no evidence for it. This sensitivity can cause serious relational and work problems. Reading and language-processing problems are also common when there is dysfunction in the left temporal lobe. Being able to read in an"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"386 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE effi cient manner, remember what you read, and integrate the new information relies heav- ily on the dominant temporal lobe. It is currently estimated that nearly 20 percent of the U.S. population has difficulty reading. Our studies of people with dyslexia (under- achievement in reading) often show underactivity in the back half of the left tem- poral lobe. Dyslexia can be inherited, or it can be brought about after a head injury damag- ing this part of the brain. Here are two illustrative cases. Denise Thirteen-year-old Denise came to see me because she was having problems with her temper. She had pulled a knife on her mother, which had precipitated the referral. She also had school problems, especially in the area of reading, for which she was in special classes. Due to the seriousness of her aggression and learning problems I decided to order a SPECT study at rest and during concentration. At rest her brain showed mild decreased activity in the back half of her left temporal lobe. When she tried to concentrate, the activity in her left"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":" Looking Into Memory and Temper 387 temporal lobe completely shut down. As I showed Denise and her mother the scans, I told Denise that it was clear that the more she tried to read, the harder reading would become. As I said this Denise burst into tears. She cried, “When I read I am so mean to myself. I tell myself, ‘Try harder. If you try harder then you won’t be so stupid.’ But trying harder doesn’t seem to help.” I told her it was essential for her to talk nicely to herself and that she would do better reading in an interesting, fun, and relaxed setting. I sent Denise to see the educa- tional therapist who works in my offi ce. She taught her a specialized reading program that showed her how to visualize words and use a different part of the brain to process reading. Carrie Carrie, a forty-year-old psychologist, came to see me two years after she sustained a head injury in a car accident. Before the accident she had had a remarkable memory and had been a fast, effi cient reader. She said reading had been one of her academic strengths. After the accident, she had memory problems and struggled with irritability, and reading became"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"388 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE diffi cult. She said that she had to read passages over and over to retain any information and that she had trouble remembering what she read for more than a few moments. Again, her SPECT study showed damage to the front and back of her left temporal lobe (the pattern typ- ically seen in trauma). I had her see my biofeedback technician to enhance activity in her left temporal lobe. Over the course of four months she was able to regain her reading skills and improve her memory and her con- trol over her temper. In our experience, left temporal lobe abnor- malities are more frequently associated with externally directed discomfort (such as anger, irritability, aggressiveness), while right tempo- ral lobe abnormalities are more often associated with internal discomfort (anxiety and fearful- ness). The left-right dichotomy has been particularly striking in our clinical popula- tion. One possible explanation is that the left hemisphere of the brain is involved with understanding and expressing language, and perhaps when the left hemisphere is dysfunc- tional, people express their discomfort inappropriately. When the nondominant"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":" Looking Into Memory and Temper 389 hemisphere is involved, the discomfort is more likely to be expressed nonverbally. Mike Nondominant (usually right) temporal lobe problems more often involve social skills prob- lems, especially in the area of recognizing facial expressions and voice intonations. Mike, age thirty, illustrates the diffi culties we have seen when there is dysfunction in this part of the brain. Mike came to see me because he wanted a date. He had never had a date in his life and was very frustrated by his inability to success- fully ask a woman out on a date. During the evaluation Mike said he was at a loss as to what his problem was. His mother, who accompa- nied him to the session, had her own ideas. “Mike,” she said, “misreads situations. He has always done that. Sometimes he comes on too strong, sometimes he is withdrawn when another person is interested. He doesn’t read the sound of my voice right either. I can be really mad at him, and he doesn’t take me seri- ously. Or he can think I’m mad, when I’m nowhere near mad. When he was a little boy Mike tried to play with other children, but he"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"390 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE could never hold on to friends. It was so pain- ful to see him get discouraged.” Mike’s SPECT study showed marked decreased activity in his right temporal lobe. His left temporal lobe was fi ne. The intervention that was most effective for Mike was intensive social skills training. He worked with a psychologist who coached him on facial expressions, voice tones, and proper social etiquette. He had his fi rst date six months after coming to the clinic. Abnormal activity in either or both tempo- ral lobes can cause a wide variety of other symptoms, including abnormal perceptions (sensory illusions), memory problems, feelings of déjà vu (that you have previously experi- enced something even though you haven’t), jamais vu (not recognizing familiar places or people), periods of panic or fear for no partic- ular reason, periods of spaciness or confusion, and preoccupation with religious or moral issues. Illusions are very common temporal lobe symptoms. Common illusions include: seeing shadows or bugs out of the corner of the eyes seeing objects change size or shape (one patient would see lampposts turn into animals and run • •"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":" Looking Into Memory and Temper 391 away; another would see fi gures in a painting move) hearing bees buzzing or static from a radio not there smelling odors or getting odd tastes in the mouth feeling bugs crawling on the skin or other skin sensations Unexplained headaches and stomachaches are also common in temporal lobe dysfunction. Recently, the anticonvulsant Depakote received a clinical indication for migraine headaches. Often when headaches or stomachaches are due to temporal lobe problems, anticonvul- sants seem to be helpful. Many of the patients who experience sudden feelings of anxiety, nervousness, or panic make secondary associ- ations to the panic and develop fears or phobias. For example, if you are in a park the fi rst time you experience a feeling of panic or dread, you may then develop anxiety every time you go into a park. Moral or religious preoccupation is a com- mon symptom with temporal lobe dysfunction. I have a little boy in my practice who, at age six, made himself physically sick by worrying about all of the people who were going to hell. • • •"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"392 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE Another patient spent seven days a week in church, praying for the souls of his family.

Another patient came to see me because he spent so many hours focused on the “mysteries of life” that he could not get any work done and was about to lose his job.

On a very small daily dose of Depakote, his ideas were unlocked and he could write for hours at a time. Harriet Memory problems have long been one of the hallmarks of temporal lobe dysfunction. Amne- sia after a head injury is frequently due to damage to the inside aspect of the temporal lobes. Brain infections can also cause severe memory problems. Harriet was a very gracious eighty-three-year-old woman who had lost her memory fi fteen years earlier during a bout of encephalitis. Even though she remembered events before the infection, she could remem- ber only small bits and pieces afterward. An hour after she ate, she would feel full but couldn’t remember what she had eaten.

Unfortunately, it robs many people of their retirement years and can leave fami- lies physically, emotionally, and financially exhausted. SPECT is an important tool in diagnosing this disorder. Before functional studies were available, the only way to diagno- ses Alzheimer’s was through autopsy.

Jim Like Ellen and Jack, Jim was bothered by peri- ods of spaciness and panic. He also had periods of “religious thoughts,” in which he felt the “presence of the devil” and was unsure and afraid. His fear of the devil haunted him, made him reclusive, and made him seem paranoid to his family. There was an interesting difference between Jim’s SPECT study and Ellen’s and Jack’s studies: Jim’s study revealed abnormal activity in the left temporal lobe, not the right. In my experience, left temporal lobe problems are often associated with very negative or “dark” thoughts. After Jim was placed on Depakote, the “presence of the devil” was gone.

Song has long been known to have healing qualities. You can often tell that a person is in a good mood if he or she is hum- ming or singing. Song is a true joy of life, no matter how you sing. Song is often associated with spiritual expe- rience. When I was in college, I attended Calvary Chapel, a large church in southern California. The music was magical.

The music uplifted both the soul and mood of the con- gregation. The pastor said the music was “blessed by God Himself.” Several of my friends were choir members. They were often transformed when they started to sing. Shy people would become more extroverted, more alive. People in t he cong regation became more involved in the service during congregational singing. The church community glistened with the contagious joy of the music. Preschool and kindergarten teachers have known for a long time that children learn best through songs. They remember the material better, and it is easier to keep them engaged in the activity. So why do we stop singing in the second or t hird grade? Perhaps we should con- tinue the singing into later grades. Interestingly, when I was in basic training in the military, we often sang when we marched. I still have those songs in my head. When we sang as a group, morale went up, and the tasks that we were doing (like twenty- mile road marches) didn’t seem quite as bad. Sing whenever and wherever you can.

TL PRESCRIPTION 3: USE HUMMING AND TONING TO TUNE UP YOUR BRAIN In The Mozart Effect , Don Campbell, founder of the Institute of Music, Health, and Educa- tion, lists the benefi ts of using your voice to enhance mood and memory. He says that all forms of vocalization, including singing, chant- ing, yodeling, humming, reciting poetry, and simply talk can be therapeutic. “Nothing rivals toning,” he concludes. The word toning goes back to the fourteenth century and means to make sounds with elongated vowels for extended periods of time. Ah, ou (as in soup ), ee, ay, oh , and om are examples of toning sounds. Campbell writes that when people tone on a regular basis for fi ve minutes a day, “I have witnessed thousands of people relax into their voices, become more centered in their bodies, release fear and other emotions, and free themselves from physical pain....I"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"408 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE have seen many people apply toning in practi- cal ways, from relaxing before a dreaded test to eliminating symptoms of tinnitus or migraine headaches....

Consciously focus on humming during the day. As the sound activates your brain, you will feel more alive and your brain will feel more tuned in to the moment. TL PRESCRIPTION 4: LISTEN TO CLASSICAL MUSIC Listen to a lot of great music. Music, from country to jazz, from rock to classical, is one of the true joys of life. Music has healing proper- ties. Listening to it can activate and stimulate the temporal lobes and bring peace or excite- ment to your mind. Music therapy has been a part of psychiat- ric treatment for decades. Certain music has a calming effect on patients. Fast-tempo, upbeat music can stimulate depressed patients in a positive way.

Gordon Shaw, one of the researchers, suggested that Mozart’s music may “warm up” the brain: “We suspect that complex music facilitates certain complex neuronal patterns involved in high brain activ- ities like math and chess. By contrast, simple and repetitive music could have the opposite effect.” In a follow-up study, the researchers tested spatial skill by projecting sixteen abstract figures similar to folded pieces of paper on an overhead screen for one minute each. The test looked at the ability of partici- pants to tell how the items would look unfolded. Over a fi ve-day period, one group listened to Mozart’s Sonata for Two Pianos , another to silence, and a third to mixed sounds, including music by Philip Glass, an audiotaped story, and a dance piece.

The research- ers proposed that Mozart’s music strengthened t he c reat ive r ig ht- br a i n proce s si n g center as so - ciated with spatial reasoning. “Listening to music,” they concluded, “acts as an exercise for facilitating symmetry operations associ- ated with higher brain function.” Don Campbell gives a nice summary of this work in The Mozart Effect , along with many other examples of music enhancing learning and healing the body. Campbell writes that in his experience, Mozart’s violin concertos, espe- cially numbers 3 and 4, produce even stronger positive effects on learning. In the context of the temporal lobes, this research makes perfect sense since the tempo- ral lobes are involved in processing music and memory. Certain types of music may activate the temporal lobes and help them learn, pro- cess, and remember information more efficiently. It is likely that certain types of music open new pathways into the mind. Certain music may also be very destructive. I believe it is no coincidence that the majority of teenagers who end up being sent to residen-"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"412 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE tial treatment facilities or group homes listen to more heavy metal music than do other teens. Music that is fi lled with lyrics of hate and despair may encourage those same mind states in developing teens. What your children listen to may hurt them. Teach them to love classical music when they are young. Music is infl uential from a very early age. Dr. Thomas Verny in his book The Secret Life of the Unborn Child cites scientifi c experiments showing that fetuses preferred Mozart and Vivaldi to other composers in early as well as later stages of pregnancy. He reported that fetal heart rates steadied and kicking lessened, while other music, especially rock, “drove most fetuses to distraction,” and they “kicked vio- lently” when it was played to their mothers. Classical music and other beautiful, sooth- ing music can positively stimulate your brain.

After six months, all the"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":" Enhancing Experience 413 children could play basic melodies from Mozart and Beethoven. They exhibited signifi - cant increases in visual-spatial skill—up to 36 percent improvement compared to other pre- schoolers who received computer lessons or other types of stimulation. Campbell cites the following studies: the College Entrance Exam- ination Board in 1996 reported that students with experience in musical performance scored 51 points higher on the verbal part of the SAT and 39 points higher on the math section than the national average. In a study of approxi- mately 7,500 students at a university, music majors had the highest reading scores of any students on campus. Learning a musical instrument at any age can be helpful in the development and activation of temporal lobe neurons. As the temporal lobes are activated in an effective way, they are more likely to have improved function overall.

Many Americans never learn about the concept of rhythm and how important it can be to healing and health. Chanting is commonly used in Eastern reli- gions and orthodox Western religions as a way to focus and open one’s mind. Chanting has a special rhythm that induces a trancelike state, bringing peace and tranquillity and opening the mind to new experiences and learning. Even for people with two left feet like myself, dancing and body movement can be very thera- peutic. When I worked on a psychiatric hospital unit, the patients had dance therapy three to four times a week. I found that my patients were often more open and more insightful in psycho- therapy after a dance therapy session. Dancing, like song and music, can change a person’s mood and provide positive experiences to treasure throughout the day or week, or even longer. Look for opportunities to move in rhythms.

Medications can often be very helpful in temporal lobe dysfunc- tion. Depakote (divalproex), Neurontin (gabapentin), Lamictal (lamotrigine), and Tegretol (carbamazepine) are antiseizure med- ications that are very effective in stabilizing abnormal activity in the temporal lobes. They have been shown to be helpful for a wide variety of “psychiatric” problems, such as aggressiveness, intractable depression, manic- depressive disorder, migraine headaches, pain syndromes, and even learning disabilities. Dilantin, a classic antiseizure medication, has also been shown to help some patients with temporal lobe abnormalities. If you suspect you have temporal lobe problems, obtain an evaluation by a neurologist or neuropsychia- trist. TL PRESCRIPTION 8: GET ENOUGH SLEEP Current research underscores the importance of sleep.

They often presented with symptoms of cog- nitive impairment, paranoia, and hallucinations. Sleep is essential to optimal brain function, especially temporal lobe function. Make sure you get at least six to eight hours every night. TL PRESCRIPTION 9: ELIMINATE CAFFEINE AND NICOTINE In our experience and the experience of other brain researchers, caffeine and nicotine are powerful vasoconstrictors that decrease blood fl ow to the brain, especially to the temporal lobes.

Even though caffeine and nico- tine may help in the short run, they will make things much worse in the long run. The overall"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":" Enhancing Experience 417 decreased activity caused by the caffeine and nicotine makes people use more and more to get the same effect. They end up chasing a self- induced problem. TL PRESCRIPTION 10: WATCH YOUR NUTRITION Nutritional support can be very helpful in temporal lobe problems. Many people with aggressive behavior become much worse after a high sugar load. If aggressiveness is present without features of depression or obsessive thoughts (more the explosive or short-fuse form of aggressiveness), then a higher-protein/ lower-simple-carbohydrate diet is likely to be very helpful. If the aggressiveness is associated with ruminations, moodiness, and depression, then a balanced diet of equal amounts of car- bohydrates and protein is likely to be best.

This can be very helpful for brain injury patients. One woman who was involved in a head-on collision had memory problems, irritability, and trouble reading after her accident. Her cognitive state prevented her from returning to work, which fed a growing depression. On SPECT she had decreased activity in the left temporal lobe. After twenty- fi ve EEG biofeedback sessions over her left temporal lobe, she reported marked improve- ment in memory, was less irritable, and enjoyed reading once again. Her mood also improved, and she was able to return to work."},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"419 13 The Dark Side Violence: A Combination of Problems Violence is a complex human behavior. There has long been a passionate debate over whether violent behavior is the result of psychological, social, or biological factors.

Because of the lack of specific biological studies to evaluate violent behavior, clinicians have had to rely on family history to look for genetic factors, along with a history of head trauma, seizures, or drug abuse to evaluate possible medical causes. One of the reasons underlying the lack of clear biological diag- nostic tools in violence may be the diversity and variability of the reported fi ndings in the scientifi c literature.

Our SPECT studies provide a useful win- dow into the brain of violent or aggressive patients and help bring together the diversity of biological fi ndings. I have studied hundreds of children, teenagers, and adults who exhib- ited violent or aggressive behavior and compared them to people who have never been violent. The brain of the violent patient is clearly different from that of the nonviolent person. I have found clinically and statistically significant differences between aggressive groups and nonaggressive groups clustered around three major fi ndings: decreased activ- ity in the prefrontal cortex, increased cingulate activity, and increased or decreased activity in the left temporal lobe.

PROFILE OF VIOLENCE These fi ndings point to a brain SPECT profi le of the aggressive patient that involves several specifi c areas of the brain, especially the left hemisphere. When these findings are taken together, they suggest that aggression is a com- plex process mediated by several different areas of the brain. Decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex is a fi nding often cited in people who are having cognitive diffi culty, such as in schizophrenia or major depression. The prefrontal cortex is"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":" The Dark Side 431 involved in mediating concentration, impulse control, and critical thinking. Aggressive peo- ple often misinterpret situations and react in an impulsive manner. As mentioned above, increased activity in the cingulate is frequently noted in people who become “stuck” on certain thoughts or behav- iors. Aggressive people often become “stuck” on real or imagined injustices and think about them over and over. For example, in several of the case histories, the men often became enraged while driving. They reported that if someone accidentally cut them off on the road, they would think and think about it to the point where they would have to do something, such as honk, ges- ture, or even chase the other driver, in order to get the thoughts out of their minds. Studies have shown that medications that increase serotonin in the brain (such as Prozac or Anafranil) nor- malize activity in the cingulate. Increased activity in the basal ganglia is often found in patients who have anxiety or panic disorders. People who are aggressive often report a baseline level of tension or anxi- ety, and many clinicians have seen a pattern with these patients where they become increas- ingly more anxious before they strike out."},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"432 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE Abnormalities in the limbic system have been associated with aggressiveness. Some research- ers believe that affected people have limbic seizures. Studies consistently fi nd that when the amygdala, a structure in the deep temporal lobes often considered part of the limbic sys- tem, is stimulated, a person becomes more agitated and aggressive. The limbic system is often cited as the part of the brain that sets the mood, and abnormal activity in this area may be associated with signifi cant moodiness. Aggression and abnormalities in the tempo- ral lobes have been described in numerous studies. They are perhaps the most striking fi nding of our work. Medications such as Neu- rontin, Tegretol, and Depakote have been found helpful in decreasing abnormal activity in this portion of the brain. In my experience with brain SPECT imag- ing, left-side brain abnormalities are associated with patients who are more irritable and aggressive. In addition, right-side brain abnor- malities often correlate with patients who are more withdrawn, socially conscious, and fear- ful, and much less aggressive.

His teacher had noticed bruises on his arms and legs and had called Child Protective Services. Phillip wasn’t sure if he should tell them the truth—that his father, Dennis, had beaten him up—or if he should say that he had fallen down a fl ight of stairs or something like that. Phillip did not want to get his dad into trouble, and he felt responsible for the beating he had received. After all, he reasoned, his father had told him ten times to clean his room, but for some reason unknown to Phillip, he hadn’t done it. Phillip and his father often fought, but it had never been apparent to people outside the home. Phillip decided to tell the truth, hoping that it would help his family get some help."},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":" The Dark Side 435 Indeed, Phillip’s family did get help. The court ordered counseling for the family and a psychiatric evaluation for the father. The father was found to be impulsive and explo- sive in many different situations.

His wife reported that when Phillip had fi rst been born, his father had been loving, patient, and attentive. After the acci- dent, he had become irritable, distant, and angry. In family counseling sessions, Phillip was very diffi cult—restless, overactive, impulsive, and defi ant. He ignored his parents’ request to stop his annoying behaviors. I soon discov- ered that the interaction between Phillip and his father was the problem and counseling alone would not be helpful. I believed there was some underlying biological or physical “brain problem” that contributed to the abu- sive interactions. In an effort to further understand the biology of this family’s prob- lems, I ordered brain SPECT studies on Phillip and his father. The studies for both were abnormal.

After taking a history, watching the family interact, and reviewing the SPECT studies, it was clear to me that Phillip’s and his father’s problems were, in part, biological. I placed both of them on medication. The father was put on an antiseizure medication to calm his left temporal lobe, and Phillip was placed on a stimulant medication to increase activity in the front part of his brain. Once the underlying biological problems were treated, the family was able to benefi t from psychotherapy and begin to heal the wounds of abuse. In counseling sessions, Phillip was calmer and more attentive, and his father was better able to learn how to deal with Phillip’s diffi cult behavior in a constructive way.

They had come on gradually during his adult life. Most notably, he also had a twenty-year history of heroin abuse and had been in multiple treat- ment settings.

After that, I luckily stayed away from drugs and alcohol. After what I’ve seen in my work, there’s no way you could get me to use marijuana, heroin, cocaine, metham- phetamine, * LSD, PCP, or inhalants or to drink more than a glass or two of wine or beer. These substances damage the patterns in your brain, and as you’ve gathered by now, without your brain, you are not you. In this chapter, I’ll share with you some of the insights we have gained from SPECT about drug and alcohol abuse and tell you how I apply this information with my patients. In the next chapter I’ll look at the connections among drug abuse, violence, and the brain. There is quite a bit of scientifi c literature on the physiological effects of drugs and alcohol on the brain. The most common finding among drug and alcohol abusers is that their brain scans display an overall toxic look. In general, their brains look less active, more shriveled, less healthy overall. A “scalloping *Methamphetamines are in a class of drugs known as psycho- stimulants. These medications are used to treat attention defi cit disorder.

Normal brain patterns show smooth activity across the cortical surface; scalloping is a wavy, rough sea-like pattern on the brain’s surface. I see the same pattern in patients who have been exposed to toxic fumes or oxygen deprivation. COCAINE AND METHAMPHETAMINE Cocaine and methamphetamine are rapidly taken up by the dopamine system in the basal ganglia, causing short-term brain activation. Over time, amphetamine and cocaine abusers show multiple perfusion defects across both hemispheres of the brain. On SPECT these areas look like mini-strokes across the surface of the brain. These effects appear both acutely and chronically. One study investigated the cerebral blood flow patterns and cognitive functioning in cocaine abusers. The patients had been drug-free for at least six months before evaluation. All showed regions of sig- nificant under-activity in the frontal and temporal-parietal areas.

This study indi- cated that long-term cocaine use may produce sustained brain blood fl ow defi cits and persis- tent intellectual compromise in some subgroups of cocaine-abusing patients. In another study, crack abusers showed a 23 per- cent decrease in cerebral blood fl ow compared to the control group, and crack users who were also cigarette smokers showed a 42 percent decrease overall compared to the control group. Cigarette smoking makes everything worse. Jeff Jeff, thirty-six, came to see me because he had severe problems abusing methamphetamines. Child Protective Services (CPS) had taken his three young children out of his home and placed them with his parents. He was also about to lose his job at a local warehouse because of chronic tardiness and erratic work performance.

His parents had tried to get Jeff help, but he had refused, denying that there were any problems. At fi rst, when he was forced by the court to see me, he was in denial. It was everyone else’s fault. He said that he used only a little bit and couldn’t understand why every- one was so upset. To help break through his denial, I ordered a SPECT study. It showed multiple holes in activity across the surface of his brain. When I showed Jeff his brain on the computer screen, his mouth dropped open. He didn’t say anything for about three min- utes. “So much for denial,” I said. “You have serious brain damage caused by this drug. Keep doing it and you won’t have any choices about what you do. You won’t have enough brainpower to make good decisions.” Through Jeff’s history, it was clear that besides the drug abuse he had underlying attention defi cit disorder. He had a childhood history of hyperactivity, restlessness, and impulse control problems, and a short atten- tion span. He had barely fi nished high school, despite having a high IQ.

I told him, “Let me do your drugs for you.

I also saw him weekly and ensured that he attended a daily twelve- step program. After a year of maintaining sobriety and compliance with treatment, he was able to have his children come home. Mark Mark, twenty-four, was very different from Jeff. He had been abusing cocaine for two years when he decided he had had enough and came to my clinic. He told me, “When I fi rst started using cocaine, I felt better around other people. I have always been shy and uncomfort- able in group settings.

It depends on what drug you used, how long you used it, what other toxic substances might have been in what you used, and how sensitive your individual brain is. Some people are very sensitive to the effects of drugs and damage becomes evident after a short while. Other people have more resistance to drug damage and can use for longer periods of time without serious damage. It depends. But who is to know ahead of time? Seems to me like a stupid risk to take once you have this information! I placed Mark in a drug treatment program and also saw him in individual psychotherapy. I taught him other ways to calm himself in social situations (using biofeedback and ANT therapy). Later Mark told me that seeing his brain had been the most powerful deterrent to doing cocaine.

ALCOHOL Alcohol abuse is also associated with cerebral blood flow abnormalities. Small doses of alcohol produce cerebral activation, while higher doses induce cerebral vasoconstriction and overall decreased brain activity. Chronic alcoholism is associated with reduced cere- bral blood flow and cerebral metabolism, especially in the frontal and temporal regions of the brain. In one study, SPECT was used to study seventeen healthy volunteers and a sample of fi fty patients dependent on alcohol, without other major physical or mental disor- ders. The SPECT studies were abnormal in thirty-four patients, but in only two volun- teers. The main abnormality was decreased activity across the whole cortex. A genetic vulnerability to alcohol was suspected in the study because SPECT abnormalities were more frequent in patients with a family his- tory of drinking problems."},{"pageNumber":477,"pageContent":" Brain Pollution 457 Chronic alcohol abuse also decreases thia- mine (a B vitamin essential for cognitive function) and puts patients at risk for Korsa- koff’s syndrome (KS). KS is an amnestic disorder in which the inability to record new memory traces often leads to confabulation (lying to make up for missed information) and a seemingly paradoxical situation in which the patient can carry out complex tasks learned before his illness but cannot learn the simplest new skills. In a study comparing alcoholics with and without KS, both had overall decreased activity, but the decreased activity in the KS group was much more severe. The study concluded that chronic alcohol abuse, in the absence of thiamine defi ciency, reduces cerebral blood fl ow by causing direct toxic effects on the brain. If thiamine defi ciency is also present, more severe blood fl ow reduc- tions are superimposed. “But, Dr. Amen,” you might ask, “what about all of those studies that say that a little bit of alcohol is good for your heart?” A little bit of alcohol is probably good for your heart and maybe even for your brain.

Carl Carl, a forty-six-year-old attorney, came to see me after his wife threatened to divorce him if he didn’t stop drinking. He had been drink- ing for twenty-fi ve years and heavily for the past ten years. Even though his drinking had just recently begun to affect his work, it had affected his family life for many years. His children stopped asking friends over because they never knew when Daddy would be drunk. They worried about him constantly. Carl fought regularly with his wife about his drink- ing. And his blood pressure had been elevated for several years. His doctor could not fi nd a medicine to bring it down. Typical of many substance abusers, denial was part of Carl’s problem, even when he was confronted by his whole family. I ordered a scan as part of his workup. He reluctantly agreed.

Before his scan he said, “Don’t tell me if I have one of those brains with holes in it. I don’t want to know.” I thought to myself, “You better want to know. Otherwise you won’t have enough brain left to care.” Like many of my alcoholic patients, Carl had a shriveled brain that looked years older than it was. As Carl looked at the studies of his brain, he started to cry. His wife, sitting next to him, put her hand on his shoulder.

He clearly had a drug-affected brain with holes across the cortex and the shriveled appearance that comes from alcohol abuse. In addition, off his substances for two weeks, he had markedly increased activity deep in his basal ganglia and right temporal lobe.

I showed Rob his scan. I was sur- prised at how nonchalant he was in viewing his brain. He said, “Do I really have to stop drinking?

A year later, he was dramatically improved. His work was bet- ter. His relationships were more stable, and his overall attitude toward life was very posi- tive.

The part of her brain that controlled impulses was damaged. On my intake form she reported that she had never had a head injury. I knew that many alcoholics, during blackouts, have head injuries they are not aware of. I asked her doctor to check further into her history for head injuries. When he asked her to check with her mother, her mother remembered a time when Karen had been kicked in the head by a horse at age seven and had been unconscious for about ten minutes. Given her history, I recommended that Karen be given a small dose of a slow-release stimu- lant medication to help her with impulse control. Slow-release stimulants, such as Rit- alin-SR, enter the system slowly and are not associated with any sort of high, thus are not typically abused.

Some of the worst brain damage I have seen was caused by heroin abuse. Robert’s story at the beginning of this chapter illustrates how serious it can become. In my experience, heroin and other opiates (such as methadone, codeine, Demerol [meperidine], Dilaudid [hydromorphone], Percodan [oxycodone], and Vicodin [hydroco- done]) consistently cause overall decreased activity throughout the brain. These medica- tions are very addictive and can literally take away your brain and your life. I often use the term “brain melt” to describe the SPECT appearance of opiate abusers. I have also seen similar serious brain damage in methadone users. Many heroin addicts are medically administered methadone as a way to help treat their addiction, decrease crime (if they get their drug legally, they don’t need to commit crimes to get money to buy it), and eliminate the spread of infection from dirty needles.

He wondered what seven years of methadone had done to his brain. He had wanted to get him off the meth- adone, but Doug was panicked by the idea and other members of the treatment team were resistant. Doug’s SPECT study showed sig- nifi cant overall decreased activity. As I showed Doug his brain, his attitude about methadone changed. “I need to get off this stuff,” he said, “otherwise I won’t have much brain left.” He, and the treatment team, agreed to take him completely off opiates using a new rapid-detox protocol developed at Yale University.

Mar- ijuana has also been described as a “gateway” drug by several researchers, with one study reporting that 98 percent of cocaine users started with marijuana. Despite these studies, there is controversy both in the mind of the general population and in the medical com- munity about whether marijuana use is harmful. Legalizing marijuana has been a social/political topic for decades. I am truly amazed by the nonchalant atti- tude our country has toward marijuana usage. Even my home state of California passed a law in 1996 legalizing marijuana as medicine. I think many people misunderstood Proposi- tion 215, feeling that by voting for it they were allowing people dying from cancer to have marijuana to soothe their pain and increase their appetites. What they got was a law that basically says a doctor can write a prescription for marijuana for anything including anxiety, stress, moodiness, or irritability. The biggest problem with the law, as I see it, is that the perception of marijuana’s dangerousness has gone way down. Teenagers tell me that it’s medicine, not a problem. Drug abuse expert Mark Gold, M.D., put it succinctly: “As the"},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"470 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE perception of a drug’s dangerousness goes down, its use goes up.” SPECT has been used to study both the short-term and long-term effects of marijuana on the brain. These studies report that inex- perienced marijuana smokers had an acute decrease in cerebral blood flow and that chronic marijuana users had overall decreased perfusion when compared to a nonusing con- trol group. In performing many SPECT studies on marijuana abusers I noticed decreased tempo- ral lobe activity that was not mentioned in the above studies, most likely because of the lesser sensitivity of the SPECT resolution in older scans. I wondered if our newer fi ndings were the cause of the memory and motivation prob- lems often associated with marijuana usage. I decided to study the effects of marijuana on the brain, comparing patients who had ADD and chronic marijuana usage with people who had ADD with no drug usage. I did this for three reasons: First, the functional brain- imaging studies of ADD have not shown temporal lobe abnormalities. Utilizing a con- trol group with the same diagnosis rather than a general psychiatric control group eliminates"},{"pageNumber":491,"pageContent":" Brain Pollution 471 the possibility of contaminated fi ndings. Even a normal control group adds an uncertainty because so many marijuana users have addi- tional diagnoses. Second, I felt that comparing them to a population with the same, common diagnosis would give useful information. Finally, 52 percent of people with ADD have been reported to have problems with sub- stance abuse, a high number of them with marijuana abuse. I compared the scans of thirty teenage and adult marijuana smokers (who had used it for a minimum of one year at least on a weekly basis) who had been diagnosed with ADD, with ten control group subjects also diagnosed with ADD, matched for age, sex, and handed- ness, who had never abused any drugs. In the marijuana/ADD group, by clinical history, marijuana was the primary drug of choice and no other drugs of abuse had been used in the prior year; again by history, there was no sig- nificant alcohol use by these patients (sig nifi cant alcohol use in this study meant more than three ounces of hard liquor or six beers a week).

This study was consistent with previous studies mentioned above demonstrating that frequent, long-term marijuana use has the potential to change the perfusion pattern of the brain. While prior studies showed global decreased brain activity, I found focal decreased activity in the temporal lobes. (This may be accounted for by the increased sophis- tication of the imaging camera used.) Abnormal activity in the temporal lobes has been associated with problems in memory, learning, and motivation—common com- plaints of teenagers (or at least their parents) and adults who chronically abuse marijuana.

Published research indicates that caffeine, even in small doses, is a potent cerebral vaso- constrictor (decreases brain blood fl ow). My experience also suggests this to be true. The more caffeine you consume (caffeine is found in coffee, tea, most sodas, chocolate, and many cold remedies), the more underactivity occurs in your brain. Many people, especially my ADD patients, use caffeine as a brain stimu- lant. They use it to get going and keep going through the day. The problem with caffeine is that even though in the short run it may help, in the long run it makes things worse. Then you begin chasing the underactivity caused by the caffeine with more caffeine, worsening an already tough brain condition. Periodic caf- feine usage is probably not a big problem. Heavy daily usage (more than three cups of coffee a day) is a problem and needs to be stopped in order to maintain a healthy brain.

Many people ask me what happens to the brain when alcohol or drug abuse is stopped. It depends. Generally, the longer a substance has been abused, the more toxic its effect. Certain drugs are clearly more toxic than oth- ers. It depends on what other toxic substances were also in the drug and on the sensitivity of the user’s brain. There are rare individuals who can abuse drugs for a long time before stopping with few if any lasting ill effects. Others can incur brain damage after a very short period of time. In either case, the sooner you stop, the better chance your brain has to heal."},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":" Brain Pollution 481 THE POSTER: WHICH BRAIN DO YOU WANT?

Understanding the intricacies of this connection is essential to fi nding effective interventions and solutions. Much has been written about the psychosocial causes of drug abuse and violence, but there have been few studies of the biological relation of drugs and violence to the brain. Through our brain-imaging work, we have recognized several clinical and SPECT pat- terns that may help further the understanding of the connection between substance abuse and violence and the brain.

In this chapter, I examine the connection between substance abuse and violence through the lens of our work with SPECT. In reviewing the literature on substance abuse it is important to note that substances tradition- ally linked with violence (e.g., cocaine, methamphetamine, and alcohol) cause abnor- mal perfusion patterns in the areas that have been associated with violent behavior. Nicotine and caffeine may also be involved and may mag- nify the negative effects of other substances. Here are fi ve patterns connecting the links between drugs, violence, and the brain. 1.

John John, a right-handed seventy-nine-year-old contractor, had a long-standing history of alco- hol abuse and violent behavior. He had frequently physically abused his wife over forty years of marriage and had been abusive to their children when they were living at home. Almost all of the abuse occurred when he was intoxi- cated. At age seventy-nine, John underwent open-heart surgery. After the surgery he had a psychotic episode that lasted ten days. His doc- tor ordered a SPECT study as part of his evaluation. The study showed markedly decreased activity in the left-outside frontal- temporal region, a fi nding most likely due to a past head injury.

None of his brothers had prob- lems with aggressive behavior. Given the location of the brain abnormality (left frontal-temporal dysfunction), John was likely to exhibit violent behavior.

In prison, he was placed on Cylert (a brain stimulant similar to Ritalin) and Depak- ote. He has had no aggressive outbursts in the past two years. 3. Drugs or alcohol may be used as self- medication for underlying brain problems involved in aggression. Many substance abusers have dual psychiat- ric diagnoses, and we believe they may be using their substances as a way to medicate underly- ing psychiatric or neurological problems, such as depression, panic symptoms, posttraumatic stress anxiety, and even aggressive behavior.

He had a severe meth-"},{"pageNumber":513,"pageContent":" The Missing Links 493 amphetamine problem that had wreaked havoc in his life. He was unable to keep steady work; he was involved in a physically abusive rela- tionship with his girlfriend (he had been arrested four times for assault and battery); he was mean to his parents even though they tried to help him; and he had failed fi ve drug treat- ment programs. In the last program the counselor had recommended a “tough love” approach: He had told the parents to let Rusty “hit bottom” so that he would want help. The parents read about my work and decided to do one more thing before going the “tough love” route. Rusty’s lack of responsiveness to tradi- tional treatments made me suspect an underlying brain problem. We scheduled a SPECT scan with the parents, but Rusty didn’t know about it until the morning he was sup- posed to have it. He showed up at the clinic loaded on high-dose methamphetamine from the night before. Rusty told me about his drug abuse. He said, “I’m sorry for messing up the scan. I’ll come back next week. I promise I won’t use anything.” I had often wanted to do SPECT studies on people intoxicated with illegal substances to see their effects on the brain, but due to ethical concerns I hadn’t."},{"pageNumber":514,"pageContent":"494 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE But if a person shows up for the scan on drugs there isn’t an ethical issue. I decided to scan Rusty that morning with the effects of the methamphetamine still in his system and then a week later off all drugs. It turned out to be a very fortuitous decision. When Rusty was under the infl uence of high-dose methamphet- amine, his brain activity appeared suppressed. A week later, however, off all drugs, he had a terribly overactive left temporal lobe, probably causing his problems with violent behavior. Likely, Rusty was unconsciously self-medicat- ing an underlying temporal lobe problem with high-dose methamphetamine. As I probed deeper into any history of a head injury, which initially both Rusty and his parents did not remember. When pressed, Rusty remembered a time when he had been in second grade and had run full speed into a solid metal basketball pole and briefl y been knocked unconscious.

An additional ben- efi t of the scan was that I was able to show Rusty the serious damage he was doing to his brain by abusing the methamphetamines.

Seeing these pictures was even more incentive to stay away from the drugs and get proper treatment for his problems. SPECT worked both as a powerful diagnostic tool to better assess one of the root causes of Rusty’s problem and also as a therapeutic tool to address his denial. A picture is worth a thousand denials . Often, having this type of information is valuable in helping patients make a more positive move toward sobriety.

Jose Jose, a sixteen-year-old gang member, was arrested and charged with attempted murder after he and another gang member beat another teenager nearly to death. Their gang claimed the color red. One evening, when they were in an intoxicated state (from both alcohol and heavy marijuana usage), they approached a boy who was wearing a red sweater while walking his dog. They asked, “What colors do you bang?” (ask- ing him about his gang affi liation). When the boy said he did not know what they were talking about, Jose replied, “Wrong answer,” and he and his companion hit and kicked the boy repeatedly until he was unconscious.

STRATEGIES FOR EFFECTIVELY DEALING WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND VIOLENCE This chapter highlighted some of the ways that brain dysfunction is intimately connected with violent behavior and substance abuse. Under- standing this connection is critical to developing more effective treatment strategies and policies in dealing with this national problem. Based on this work I offer several suggestions: 1. Consider the brain. Too often, brain dys- function is thought of too late in the evaluation and treatment process. Evaluating brain func- tion through clinical history, neurological exams, and sophisticated brain-imaging stud- ies when indicated is key to proper diagnosis and effective early intervention. 2.

Violent individuals and substance abus- ers should be screened for underlying psychiatric and neurological conditions that may contribute to or exacerbate their prob- lems (such as ADHD, bipolar disorder, learning disabilities, temporal lobe dysfunc- tion, etc.). In Washington state, the criminal court system under Judge David Admire, in conjunction with the Learning Disability Association of Washington, set up a program for those convicted of crimes to be screened for ADD and dyslexia. If they met a high level of suspicion for these disorders on screening, they were sent through a fourteen-week “Life Skills” program to help them be more effec- tive in dealing with these problems. Outcome data presented recently indicated that the recidivism rate had been decreased by 40 per- cent. 4.

However, in our experience, many substance abuse treatment programs and anger management programs shy away from the use of medication, and patients are made to feel “inferior” for considering medication as an option. This attitude hampers appropri- ate treatment and leaves many individuals at higher risk for relapse. 5. Explore whether victims of crimes may be unwittingly contributing to their situation by their own substance use or underlying neu- ropsychiatric problems. I know this is a controversial suggestion, but it is my clinical experience that some victims have made bad decisions or exhibited provocative behavior based either on their own substance abuse or on their own underlying brain patterns. I am certainly not suggesting that victims are in any way responsible for what happened to them. It is my hope that by addressing any underlying problems, they won’t become vic- tims again. 6.

In my experience, SPECT can be helpful in the following ways: by showing cerebral drug damage to abusers to enhance drug treatment compliance by uncovering past brain trauma that may be contributing to the clinical situation by providing help to clinicians in choosing ap- propriate medications (these include anticon- vulsant medications for temporal lobe abnor- malities, serotonergic medications for anterior cingulate hyperactivity, and stimulant medica- tions for prefrontal cortex deactivation.

Any drug—including physician- prescribed—has an effect on this set point by either increasing or decreasing its reactivity to an insult. The degree of reactivity results from the unique response of any given brain to the metabolic changes induced by a chemical. The very short-term, moderately short-term, and long-term changes in brain function, combined with preexisting factors, result in a greater or lesser propensity for an individual to act on violent impulses. When someone is healthy, he or she has a high degree of control and usually needs intense provocation to elicit a violent reaction. Over time actual changes in brain metabolism as a result of drug or alcohol abuse lead to a diminished ability to regulate aggressive impulses.

They fought constantly. Mike had had two affairs, seemed prone to pick fi ghts, and had to work excessively long hours because he performed ineffi ciently. Gerry had a ten- dency toward depression, was angry that their marriage was such a struggle, and would hold on to hurts from years in the past. The thera- pist had tried all the techniques she knew. She even went to a conference on “the resistant couple” as a way to fi nd help for Mike and Gerry. She was frustrated because she couldn’t make any progress with them. When I fi rst met with them, Mike was the IP (identifi ed patient). The therapist felt that if she “fi xed” Mike, they would make progress. Mike, in fact, had ADD. He had underachieved in school. He was restless, fi dgety, inattentive, disorganized, and impulsive. He had trouble listening to Gerry. His marital affairs had not been planned but impulsive. He tended to seek confl ict from others and often infl amed situa- tions by making thoughtless comments. In the"},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":" I Love You and I Hate You 509 fi rst few meetings with the couple, however, I felt that Gerry also contributed to the marital turmoil. She tended to voice the same com- plaints over and over. She argued over insignifi cant things. She had a strong tendency toward repetitive worry, and when things weren’t “just so,” she’d be upset for hours. I decided to scan both Mike and Gerry. Mike had markedly decreased activity in his prefrontal cortex (consistent with ADD symp- toms), and Gerry had a signifi cantly overactive cingulate gyrus (consistent with overfocus issues).

He was more organized at work, and he acted in a more positive, thoughtful way toward Gerry. Even Gerry noticed a difference. After several weeks (Zoloft takes longer to be effective than Adderall), Gerry also felt a signifi cant differ- ence within herself. Her thoughts no longer tended to loop.

The missing link for this couple was in their brain pattern and neurotransmitter irregulari- ties. They continued in therapy for several more months to solidify their gains. It was important that they really understand the magnitude of the biological contribution to their problems and that they see each other through new eyes. This allowed them to be more forgiving of each other and to heal the painful memories associated with twelve years of marital struggle. If I had treated just Mike and not Gerry, she might very well have stayed stuck in the pain and frustration of the past, seeing herself as a victim of Mike and being unable to let go of the past.

Let’s start by looking at the relational traits of each brain system when they work right and when they misfi re. LIMBIC RELATIONAL TRAITS When the limbic system functions properly, people tend to be more positive and more able to connect with others. They tend to filter information in an accurate light and they are more likely to give others the benefi t of the doubt.

She and Joe had been married for fi ve years. They both worked and did not have any children. At the end of the day, Sarah was frequently very tired. Most often she liked to be on her own and didn’t want to do anything after work. She usually wasn’t interested in sex, except for one or two days after she started her menstrual cycle. Sarah also tended to look at the negative side of any situation. Joe com- plained about the lack of companionship in their relationship. He was very upset by her lack of interest in sex and her nonchalant atti- tude toward it. He felt she was too negative, and their lack of connectedness made him feel lonely. Joe tried to talk to Sarah, but she said she didn’t have any problems and he just"},{"pageNumber":535,"pageContent":" I Love You and I Hate You 515 expected too much from her. Joe made an appointment with me. He said, “I wanted to see if there was anything I could do before I saw a divorce attorney.” I encouraged him to bring Sarah with him to see me. I fi rst got Sar- ah’s reading on the situation. She admitted to feeling chronically tired, overwhelmed, and negative. She just fi gured she had a low libido and was destined to live with it. She had expe- rienced a major depression when she was a teenager. Her mother had been depressed, and her parents had divorced when she was fi ve years old. I explained the limbic system to her and all about depression. I then placed her on the antidepressant Wellbutrin (bupropion) and saw the couple in counseling. Over two months, Sarah felt much better. She had better energy and more focus, and she also felt more social. In addition, her libido increased and she was more sexually receptive to Joe.

He tended to see the worst in situations and often predicted failure. He was anxious, nervous, and sickly (frequently complaining of headaches, backaches, and mus- cle tension). He had been married to Betsy for fi fteen years. When they had fi rst been married, Betsy had mothered him, taking care of his aches and pains and soothing his fears and negativity. She liked to feel needed. After years of this, how- ever, she had gotten tired of Ryan’s whining and his tendency to be afraid in even the most benign situations. Ryan’s anxiety and medical problems were taking over their relationship. She felt iso- lated and alone. She became irritable, less understanding, and distant from him. Seeing the love go out of their relationship, she made an appointment for me to see them both. Ryan was angry with her about the appointment. He complained that they didn’t have the money, counseling wouldn’t help, his problems were physical and not psychological (actually he was right; this was a basal ganglia problem), and all psychiatrists were crazy anyway (I wouldn’t say all of us are crazy, just a bit odd).

The basal ganglia hyperactivity was interfering with their relationship. When I explained his behavior in medical/brain-physiology terms to Ryan, he relaxed. I helped the couple with communica- tion and goal setting and then engaged Ryan in his own therapy. I taught him how to kill for- tune-telling ANTs (his were very strong). I worked with him using biofeedback (teaching him how to warm his hands, relax his muscles, and breathe diaphragmatically). And I taught him self-hypnosis. Ryan was a very fast learner and quickly soaked up the basal ganglia pre- scriptions. He no longer used Betsy as his doctor; he began to work with his medical doctor to address his physical issues and started to predict positive things rather than fear in his conversa- tions with his wife. Once we treated Ryan’s basal ganglia problems, the marital therapy became more effective and the marriage improved.

Even though Ray owned a very successful restau- rant, he was restless, impulsive, and very easily distracted. He spent excessive time at work due to inefficiency, and he had frequent employee problems (often because he hired impulsively without adequate screening). Mar- ital counseling was Ray’s idea, because he saw his wife turning away from him. He told the counselor that his wife was chronically stressed, tired, and angry. “She’s not the woman I mar- ried,” he said to their counselor. In my fi rst session with this couple, Linda clearly explained that it was true; she had changed. It was an all-too-familiar story to me. She had married Ray because he was fun, spontaneous, thrill-seeking (she was actually a bit reserved), and hardworking. She now felt her life had been taken from her. Her ADD children were a handful, and she felt she had no support from Ray. She said, “When he’s home, he’s not with me. He’s always working on projects that don’t get fi nished.

He had had an affair several years before they entered counseling, and Linda didn’t believe she could trust him. She felt isolated, alone, and angry. There was no question in my mind that Ray had ADD. As a child and teenager he had been restless, impulsive, hyperactive, and dis- organized. He had underachieved in school and barely fi nished high school, despite obvi- ously being very bright. The chronic stress of living in an ADD home was beginning to change Linda’s personality. She had gone from being a relaxed, happy person to being depressed, angry, and withdrawn. Something had to change. I put Ray on Adderall, a stimu- lant medication, which helped him be more thoughtful, more attentive, and more effi cient at work. I encouraged the couple to continue to see their counselor to work on healing the hurts from the past. I got involved with the children’s treatment to make sure they were on the right dosages of medication and that Ray and Linda used effective parenting strate- gies (many of Ray and Linda’s fi ghts were over disciplining the children).

Larry had heard me speak in San Francisco at a local conference on children of alcoholics. He said when I talked about problems associated with the cingulate gyrus, I was talking about things that affected his wife. He bought one of my videotapes and took it home for Rose to see. Rose was stunned when she recognized herself when I talked about some of my work with couples who had incompatible brains. She had grown up in an alcoholic home. As a teenager she had also had problems with alcohol and mar- ijuana. As an adult she had periodic bouts of depression. More damaging to the marriage was her infl exibility: She had to have things a certain way or she’d explode (even though she didn’t know it and even though she didn’t want to be that way). She was “the world’s worst worrier” according to her husband. Her house looked perfect. “The president could visit any time of the day or night,” her husband said. “I don’t know why she cleans so much. It’s not like we’re dirty people.” She held grudges. Things would get brought up multiple times over the years. If she liked someone, she was a wonderful friend.

She hadn’t talked to her own mother for eighteen years because of a trivial fi ght one Christmas. Rose never said she was sorry.

The setting had to be just right in order for any- thing to happen. “God help me if I ask for it directly,” Larry said. When I asked Larry what kept him in the relationship, he said he didn’t know. He had grown up Catholic and felt it was his obliga- tion to stay. He found gratifi cation at work and just spent more and more time away. Plus, he felt Rose really tried. She always set up the counseling appointments, and she was com- mitted to staying with him. I was very surprised that no one had sent Rose to see a psychiatrist.

This couple had long-term marital dissatisfaction and multiple failures at marital counseling. I was betting there were brain patterns interfering with inti- macy.

Her brain’s gearshift was stuck, unable to shift into new and different modes of thinking. I put her on Zoloft (a serotonergic antidepressant) to help her mood and fl exibil- ity. I taught the couple about how the brain works and how it can interfere with intimacy. I taught them the functions and problems of this part of the brain, along with cingulate prescriptions. In addition, I worked with them on developing a new perspective about their past behavior and healing the memories of pain. After four months of medication and therapy, they were much better. They were able to have fun together. Larry was able to ask for sex without fear of rejection. He no longer had to play “cingulate games.” He spent more time at home, because the atmosphere was so much more relaxed. Rose called her mother and reconnected with her.

During one of those times he had been drunk, but during the other two he had not been drinking at all. Shelley’s family and"},{"pageNumber":555,"pageContent":" I Love You and I Hate You 535 friends thought she was crazy for staying with him. Shelley said she loved Don and wanted the marriage to work. She was afraid when she thought about staying and sad when she thought about leaving, but she knew the violence had to stop. Don was always so sorry after the attacks. He always cried for a long time and seemed truly sorry. When the therapist learned that Don had had a signifi cant head injury from a motorcycle accident at the age of seventeen, he suggested that Don see me as part of his evalu- ation. Don and Shelley seemed to truly love each other. Don did not have a good explana- tion for his problems, and he denied that he ever wanted to hurt Shelley. “I just get out of control,” he said. I found out that Don saw shadows. He had many periods of spaciness. He had diffi culties fi nding the right words. He was very forgetful. He was moody, volatile, and temperamental, and he had odd sensations of déjà vu. Don often took things the wrong way, and he thought many other people were out to hurt him.

One of the underlying messages of this chap- ter is that many couples struggle not because they want to, but because they have underly-"},{"pageNumber":557,"pageContent":" I Love You and I Hate You 537 ing brain patterns that interfere with intimacy. Sometimes medication can help alleviate these problems. The appropriate medications for each of the brain systems have been discussed in the chapters on individual brain system pre- scriptions. I have seen many relationships literally saved by the use of medication. Here are several additional tips about the use of medication in couples: 1. Be aware of when the medications will wear off and be especially cautious about con- flict then. Some medications, such as stimulants, work for defi ned periods of time. If the medication’s effectiveness wears off around 8:00 P . M . , do not bring up emotionally loaded topics at 10:30 P . M . Be sensitive to the effectiveness cycle of the medication. 2. Be sensitive to the sexual side effects of medication. Some of the medications we use to treat brain abnormalities can alter sexual function and libido. Medications that enhance serotonin production in the brain, such as Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft, Anafranil, Effexor, and Luvox, often decrease libido or delay the ability to achieve orgasm. If this occurs, there are strategies your doctor can use to counteract these problems, such as"},{"pageNumber":558,"pageContent":"538 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE adding gingko biloba or the antidepressant Wellbutrin. Talk these problems over with your doctor. Also, let your partner know that there may be medication side effects and not to take them personally. 3 . B e p e r s i s t e n t w h e n m e d i c a t i o n i s r e q u i r e d . Too often people will try medication, then abandon it too early if it isn’t immediately effective. Sometimes it takes several trials of medication for prolonged periods of time. Be patient. RELATIONAL THERAPY BRAIN PRESCRIPTIONS It is clear that using medications is only part of the solution to people’s problems. Based on my brain-imaging work, I have developed a number of effective nonmedication brain sys- tem prescriptions to help couples. I break them into the different systems we’ve discussed. Of course, there is overlap between systems, but I think this is a useful way to think about help- ing couples. The “Self ” prescriptions here are for those affected by these problems, and the “Partner” prescriptions are for the partners of those affected."},{"pageNumber":559,"pageContent":" I Love You and I Hate You 539 Limbic Relational Prescriptions for Self 1. Spend time together: Bonding is essential to all human relationships. You need to spend physical time with your partner. The less you are around each other, the less bonded or lim- bically connected you become. 2. Smell good: Choose scents your partner likes and wear them. The limbic system directly processes the sense of smell, and it can have a positive or negative effect on your relationship. 3. Build positive memories: Focus on the times you have enjoyed each other. The limbic system stores highly charged emotional mem- ories. When you focus on the negative in a relationship, you feel more distant from each other. When you focus on the positive in your relationship, you feel more connected. 4 .

Limbic Relational Prescriptions for Partner 1. Don’t let your partner isolate himself or herself. Even though isolation is a natural ten- dency in depression, it makes the situation worse. Encourage activity and togetherness. 2. Touch your partner. Back rubs or a touch on a shoulder or hand can be very reassuring to someone who feels alone. Connectedness is very important. 3. If your partner has a loss of sexual inter- est, do not take it personally. Often depression is accompanied by sexual problems. Work on getting him or her help. 4. Help your partner around the house, with the children, and so on. Often limbic problems are associated with low energy and poor con- centration. Your partner may feel overwhelmed and need your help.

Basal Ganglia Relational Prescriptions for Self 1. Kill the fortune-telling ANTs: Predicting failure, pain, or an unhappy outcome often causes erosion in relationships. Clear thinking is essential in relationships. Do not believe every thought you have. 2. Predict the best: Looking to the future in a positive manner is a key to happiness. Your mind helps to make happen what it sees. Peo- ple with basal ganglia issues have a natural tendency to predict the worst and thus help to make bad things happen by their predictions. Fight that tendency. When you see good things happening in your relationship, act in ways to make them even more likely to hap- pen.

After three or four deep breaths of this type, your brain will be fi lled with oxygen, you will feel more relaxed, and you will be much more likely to make better decisions. 4.

Do not get irritated with your partner’s anxiety or negative predictions. Soothe him or her with gentle words or a touch. 3. Pace your breathing to help your part- ner’s breathing. Often people unconsciously mirror their partner. When you breathe slowly and deeply, your partner is likely to pick up a more relaxed breathing pattern, automatically calming his or her anxiety. 4. Encourage your partner to face confl ict in an effective way. Prefrontal Cortex Relational Prescriptions for Self 1. Focus on what you want: Clear focus is essential to relationships. I have many of my couples develop a “two-minute focus state- ment.” In this statement they write down, on one piece of paper, the major goals they have for their relationship in the areas of communi- cation, time together, money, work, parenting, and sexuality. Then they post this statement where they will see and read it every day. This helps to keep their behavior on track."},{"pageNumber":564,"pageContent":"544 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE 2. Focus on what you like about your part- ner more than what you don’t like: This encourages your partner’s positive behavior. Think about how we train pets. Do you smack them every time they do something wrong (this will not train them to do any- thing but avoid you), or do you praise them every time they do something right (this encourages new behavior)? Focus on what you like, and you are more likely to get it. Many couples with prefrontal cortex prob- lems are confl ict-seeking as a way to stimulate themselves. Naturally they tend to notice the problems in their relationships, which makes them more upset and unconsciously gives them stimulation. The problem with focus- ing on negative behavior is that you drive the other person away. The negativity kills the relationship. 3. Positive stimulation is helpful: Look for new, exciting ways to stimulate the relation- ship. The prefrontal cortex seeks stimulation. It is important to have new, exciting, stimulat- ing experiences to keep the relationship fresh and alive. Look for ways to do new things together, such as sharing a hobby, going to new places, or trying new sexual experiences."},{"pageNumber":565,"pageContent":" I Love You and I Hate You 545 4. Learn to say “I’m sorry”: Admitting mis- takes and saying you’re sorry are essential to relational health. When the prefrontal cortex doesn’t work hard enough, people don’t have access to good internal supervision, and they may say or do things impulsively. When that happens, it is important to apologize and let your partner know you’re sorry. Unfortu- nately, many people aren’t good at saying they are sorry, and they try to justify why they did or said hurtful things. Learn to apologize and take responsibility for your mistakes. 5. Think about what you say or do before you say or do it: Thoughtfulness and fore- thought are essential to effective relationships. Before you say or do something in a relation- ship, ask yourself if what you say or do fi ts with the goals you have for the relationship. Will your behavior help or hurt the relation- ship? Supervising your thoughts and actions is essential to relational health. Prefrontal Cortex Relational Prescriptions for Partner 1.

Without knowing it (uncon- sciously), they try to upset you. They try to get you to yell. They try to make you angry. It is very important if you feel this is happening to have a calm demeanor. Do whatever you can to not yell or become emotionally intense. When you feel as if you are going to blow, take a deep breath or a break until you can get yourself under control. 2. Notice the positive. You change behavior by focusing on what you like a lot more than what you don’t like. Often people with pre- frontal cortex problems have low self-esteem and need encouragement and positive input from those they love. 3. Help your partner with organization. Dis- organization is often a hallmark of prefrontal cortex problems. Rather than complain about the disorganization, it is generally much more effective to help your partner become more organized—if he or she will allow you to. 4. Make the appointment and drive your partner to the doctor. Often forgetfulness, procrastination, and denial accompany pre- frontal cortex problems.

Don’t wait for your partner to have the desire, will, or commitment to change; you may wait too long. 5. If medication is necessar y, help your par t- ner remember to take it. Do not do this in a condescending way, such as “Did you take your medicine? Your behavior is way off.” Instead, help your partner with a gentle (non- sarcastic) reminder, or help your partner come up with a reminder system, such as weekly pill organizers or calendars. Cingulate Relational Prescriptions for Self 1. Notice when you are stuck: The fi rst step in breaking negative cycles is for you to notice when you are in them. Being aware of repeti- tive negative patterns of behavior allows you to do something different.

If you would usually just go on and on trying to make your point, stop and say, “I’m fi nished. What do you have to"},{"pageNumber":568,"pageContent":"548 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE say?” Then be quiet long enough to really hear what your partner is saying. 2. Take a break when things get hot: When you notice things are getting into a negative “cingulate” loop, take a break. When you notice tension in your voice, your body, or your conversation, fi nd a way to distract your- self or take a break from the situation. 3. Stop nagging: Nagging erodes a relation- ship and needs to stop. Nagging—complaining about something over and over—is very com- mon in cingulate people. It often has a seriously negative impact on a relationship. When you find yourself going over the same material again and again, stop it. Beating someone over the head who is not listening to you is ineffec- tive and irritating. Try to fi nd new ways to deal with your frustrations. 4. Use good problem-solving techniques: When you are stuck in an impasse, write out the problem, options, and solutions to the problem. Writing down the issues that bother the relationship can often be very helpful. Use the following problem-solving model: Write out the issue (such as spending too much money), write out the options and solutions to the problem (spending less, budgeting, cut-"},{"pageNumber":569,"pageContent":" I Love You and I Hate You 549 ting up credit cards), and then choose among the options. Writing problems down often helps to get them out of your head and out of repetitive relational arguments. 5. Exercise together: Exercise enhances serotonin production in the brain and often helps a person (maybe even a couple) to become more fl exible and less cingulate. 6. Have a carbohydrate snack. Carbohy- drates (whole-grain bread, crackers, yogurt, etc.) often improve mood and help cingulate people be more f lexible. Low blood sugar often correlates with anger and irritability. Cingulate Relational Prescriptions for Partner 1. Notice when your partner is stuck: The fi rst step to breaking negative cycles is for cou- ples to notice when they are in them. Being aware of repetitive negative patterns in your partner allows you to be helpful in the situa- tion rather than infl ame it. For example, if you notice your partner is not listening to you but holding fi rmly on to his or her own position, take a breath and really try to listen to your partner. Do something different to break the negative cycle."},{"pageNumber":570,"pageContent":"550 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE 2. Take a break when things get hot: When you notice your partner is getting into a nega- tive “cingulate” loop, change the pace.

As I’ve said, one of the most helpful things I tell people to do is learn how to go to the bathroom when things get hot. 3. Deal effectively with nagging. Nagging may be caused by an overactive cingulate, or it may arise because you’re not listening to your partner. When someone has repetitive complaints about you, let him or her know you hear what they are saying. Ask your part- ner what steps you can take to make the situation better. Also, make it clear that you have heard about the issue and would ap preciate not hearing about it again. In a kind way, ask what you can do to make that happen. 4.

Use memory helpers to keep the relation- ship fresh: Reminders can make all the difference between your partner knowing you care and feeling he or she is not important.

Use notes, signs, computer reminder systems, ticklers, and so on to keep your atten- tion focused on making the person you love feel loved.

When you know that you have a temporal lobe problem and anger is a serious issue for you, practice effective anger management strategies. Deep breathing, correcting negative thoughts, and clear communication are some anger manage- ment strategies that work. In addition, be sure to stay away from alcohol and drugs. They can unleash a vulnerable temporal lobe, uncorking anger and causing serious prob- lems. 6. Know you have a tendency to be extremely sensitive to the behavior of others.

She saw many of her own characteristics in Ben. One day she asked Ben to come into her offi ce.

She said that her boss wanted her to fi re him, but she had convinced him to give Ben another chance. She suggested that Ben seek professional help if he could relate to her story. Ben started to cry. His history was a carbon copy of hers. He had done poorly in school and had trouble with concentration, organization, completing assignments, and underachievement. He did not expect his boss to care enough about him to try to help. Other employers would just fi re him, as the boss’s boss wanted to do. Ben came to see me. He had a classic case of ADD. With medication and struc- tured therapy, his behavior improved dramatically. His boss and those higher up in the company saw a wonderful turnaround in Ben. The company saved money by not having to hire and retrain someone to take Ben’s place, and Ben was deeply grateful that he was given another chance, along with the information he needed to heal.

Initially, Jerry listed many reasons why he wouldn’t go for help: He didn’t see that the problems were that bad; it was too much money; he thought all counselors were “messed up”; and he didn’t want to be perceived as crazy by anyone who might fi nd out about the counseling.

Their lack of awareness and strong tendency toward denial prevent them from seeking help until more damage has been done than necessary.

As a child he had been forced to see a counselor for behavioral problems at school. He hated feeling different from the other kids and resented his mom for making him talk to the doctor. Some people may say it is unfair for me to “pick on” men. And indeed, some men see problems long before some women. Overall, however, in my experience mothers see prob- lems in children before fathers and are more willing to seek help, and many more wives call for marital counseling than husbands. What is it in our society that causes men to overlook obvious problems, to deny problems until it is too late to deal with them effectively or until more damage is done than necessary?

Try the straightforward approach fi rst (but with a new brain twist). Clearly tell the person what behaviors concern you. Tell him or her that the problems may be due to under- lying brain patterns that can be tuned up. Explain that help may be available—help not to cure a defect but rather help to optimize how the brain functions.

Good information can be very persuasive, especially if it is pre- sented in a positive, life-enhancing way. 3.

Staying in a toxic relationship is harmful to your health, and it often enables the other person to remain sick. Actually, I have seen that the threat or act of leaving can motivate people to change, whether it is about drinking, drug use, or treating underlying ADD or manic-depressive disor- der. Threatening to leave is not the first approach I would take, but after time it may be the best approach. 7.

Support groups often have members who have visited the professionals in the area, and they can give you important information about the doctor, such as his or her bedside manner, compe- tence, responsiveness, and organization. 4. Once you get the names of competent professionals, check their credentials. They should have board certifi cation; to become board certifi ed, physicians have to pass cer- tain written and verbal tests. They have had to discipline themselves to gain specialized skill and knowledge. Don’t give excessive weight to the medical school or graduate school the professional attended to the exclu- sion of other factors. I have worked with some doctors who went to Yale and Harvard who did not have a clue about how to treat patients appropriately, while other doctors from less prestigious schools were outstanding, for- ward-thinking, and caring. 5. Set up an interview with the professional to see whether or not you want to work with him or her.

Look for a rela- tionship that is collaborative and trusting. I know it is hard to fi nd a professional who meets all of these criteria and who also has the right training in brain physiology, but it is pos- sible. Be persistent. The right caregiver is essential to healing. HOW CAN I TELL IF I NEED A SPECT STUDY? I order SPECT studies only for very specifi c reasons. Because of our very large database, I actually order fewer studies now than I did several years ago. Our extensive SPECT work has given me the clinical experience to diag- nose more readily brain patterns that are"},{"pageNumber":596,"pageContent":"576 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE responsive to certain treatments. I have included many of these patterns in this book. Here are several common questions and answers about SPECT. Will the SPECT study give me an accurate diagnosis? No. A SPECT study by itself will not give a diagnosis. SPECT studies help the clinician understand more about the specifi c function of your brain. Each person’s brain is unique, which may lead to unique responses to medicine or therapy. Diagnoses about spe- cific conditions are made through a combination of clinical history, personal inter- view, information from families, diagnostic checklists, SPECT studies, and other neuro- psychological tests. No study alone is a “doctor in a box” that can give accurate diagnoses on individual patients. Why are SPECT studies ordered? Some of the common reasons include: 1. Evaluating seizure activity 2. Evaluating cerebral vascular disease 3. Evaluating dementia and distinguishing between dementia and pseudodementia 4. Evaluating the effects of mild, moderate, and severe head trauma"},{"pageNumber":597,"pageContent":" HELP! 577 5. Suspicion of underlying organic brain condition, such as seizure activity contributing to behavioral disturbance, prenatal trauma, or exposure to toxins 6. Evaluating atypical or unresponsive ag- gressive behavior 7. Determining the extent of brain impair- ment caused by drug or alcohol abuse In this book I have listed other examples of SPECT’s use, such as in diffi cult marital situ- ations. I must emphasize that this is a very sophisticated use of SPECT and not likely to be found in clinics outside our own. Do I need to be off medication before the study? This question must be answered individually between you and your doctor. In general, it is better to be off medications until they are out of your system before a scan, but this is not always practical or advisable. If the study is done while on medication, let the technician know so that when the physician reads the study, he or she will include that information in interpreting the scan. In general, we recom- mend that patients try to be off stimulants at least four days before the fi rst scan and remain"},{"pageNumber":598,"pageContent":"578 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE off them until after the second scan if one is ordered. Medications such as Prozac (which lasts in the body four to six weeks) are gener- ally not stopped because of practicality. Check with your doctor for specific recommenda- tions. What should I do the day of the scan? On the day of the scan decrease or eliminate your caffeine intake, and try to not take cold med- ication or aspirin (if you do, please write it down on the intake form). Eat as you nor- mally would. Are there any side effects or risks to the study? The study does not involve a dye, and people do not have allergic reactions to the study. The possibility exists, although in a very small per- centage of patients, of a mild rash, facial redness and edema (swelling), fever, and a transient increase in blood pressure. The amount of radiation exposure from one brain SPECT study is approximately the same as from one abdominal X ray. How is the SPECT procedure done? The patient is placed in a quiet room, and an intravenous (IV) line is started. The patient remains quiet for approximately ten minutes with eyes open to allow his or her mental"},{"pageNumber":599,"pageContent":" HELP! 579 state to equilibrate to the environment. The imaging agent is then injected through the IV. After another short period of time, the patient lies on a table and the SPECT cam- era rotates around his or her head (the patient does not go into a tube). The time on the table is approximately fi fteen minutes. If a concentration study is ordered, the patient returns on another day to repeat the process; a concentration test is performed during the injection of the isotope. Are there alternatives to having a SPECT study? In our opinion, SPECT is the most clinically useful study of brain function. There are other studies, such as electroencephalo- grams (EEGs), positron emission tomography (PET) studies, and functional MRIs (fMRIs). PET studies and fMRIs are considerably more costly, and they are performed mostly in research settings. EEGs, in our opinion, do not provide enough information about the deep structures of the brain to be as helpful as SPECT studies. Does insurance cover the cost of SPECT stud- ies? Reimbursement by insurance companies varies according to your plan. It is a good idea to check with the insurance company"},{"pageNumber":600,"pageContent":"580 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE ahead of time to see if it is a covered bene- fi t. Is the use of brain SPECT imaging accepted in the medical community? Brain SPECT studies are widely recognized as an effective tool for evaluating brain function in seizures, strokes, dementia, and head trauma. There are liter- ally hundreds of research articles on these topics. In our clinic, based on our experience over eight years, we have developed this tech- nology further to evaluate aggression and nonresponsive psychiatric conditions. Unfor- tunately, many physicians do not fully understand the application of SPECT imag- ing and may tell you that the technology is experimental, but over one hundred physi- cians in the United States have referred patients to us for scans.

John, a retired contractor, who had been physi- cally and emotionally abusive to his wife during most of their marriage, and emotionally abu- sive to his children. At the age of seventy-nine, after a psychotic episode following open-heart surgery, it was discovered that he had had a se- rious head injury at the age of twenty that had damaged his left frontal-temporal region. The head injury may have changed his behavior and affected three generations of his family . These stories and many others in the book and in my practice have caused me to ques- tion the very essence of who we are. Who are we really? Are we really who we are when our brain works right? Or are we really who we are when our brain misfi res? I believe, after seeing fi ve thousand SPECT studies (along with the patients and stories that go with them), that we are really who we are when our brain works right. When our brain works right, we are more thoughtful, more goal-oriented, and more interested in other people. We are kinder, our moods are more stable, and we are more tolerant. Anxiety doesn’t rule us, although we have enough anx- •"},{"pageNumber":610,"pageContent":"590 CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFE iety to get out of bed in the morning and go to work. Even though we may have negative thoughts from time to time, they do not rule our internal life. Even though we may have graphic, violent thoughts, they are not com- mon and we do not act them out. When our brain works right, our spouse may make a mis- take, but we do not hold on to that mistake for twenty or thirty years. We feel sexual, but we are not ruled by our sexual desires. Our chil- dren may still drive us crazy, but we act toward them in a positive, helpful way the vast major- ity of the time. When our brain works right, we are more able to be who we really want to be. Other questions that this work has stimu- lated me to ask are: What choices do we really have about our be- havior? Probably not as many as we think . Does our relationship with God depend on brain function? Probably it is easier to see a kind, loving, involved God when our brain works right. And it is probably easier to im- agine a harsh, punitive God when we have an overactive cingulate and limbic system coloring the world in a negative way.

Perhaps, but again, we are more likely to make bad choices when our prefrontal cortex is un- deractive as a result of brain trauma or having ADD. Of course this doesn’t mean we cannot make bad choices as a result of bad training, defi ance of God, poverty, and the like, but do- ing so will be more likely when our internal supervisor is less active than necessary . Do we make better choices when our brains work right? Of course we do is the obvious an- swer from this book . Is our personality a collection of neurons, neu- rotransmitters, and hormones? Yes and no. Our personality is intimately connected to brain function, but as we have seen, brain function is also intimately connected to our thoughts and environment. They work in a circle and cannot be separated . What does Mike Tyson’s brain look like?

My guess is that we would gain great insight into the po- litical process. Odds are President Ronald Re- agan’s brain would have demonstrated blood fl ow patterns indicating Alzheimer’s disease in the early part of his presidency. His forgetful- ness became obvious during his second term. If we had known about his impending Alzheim- er’s disease, what then? Should I scan my son’s and daughters’ roman- tic interests? I think so. My kids are not thrilled about the idea . The questions could go on and on. The main point is that the brain matters in all we do. The brain is one of the fi rst things we should think about when we try to understand abnormal behavior. Self-help programs need to consider the brain.

A skilled psycho- pharmacologist can help you sort through these medications."},{"pageNumber":627,"pageContent":" Appendix 607  These medications need to be monitored more closely than stimulants, especially their effect on heart function. Many adults respond to very low doses of these medications for ADD symptoms. This is important because the low doses of- ten produce far fewer side effects than the higher “antidepressant” doses. Unlike stimulants, these may take several weeks to a month to become effective. When Wellbutrin was fi rst released in the United States, a number of people devel- oped seizures while taking it. It was pulled from the market in the early 1980s. The manufacturer fi gured out that the dosage pattern was wrong, and the FDA allowed it to rerelease it with a different dosage regimen. Do not take more than 150 mil- ligrams at a time. These medications are usually not fi rst-line treatments for ADD. I use these medica- tions to treat depression, anxiety disorders, bed-wetting, and the limbic subtype of ADD, often in conjunction with one of the stimulants. • • • • •"},{"pageNumber":628,"pageContent":"608 Appendix 3. Antiobsessive or “Antistuck” Medications These medications increase the availability of serotonin in the brain, and they are often helpful to calm down cingulate hyperactivity. They are typically marketed as antidepressants. They also tend to calm down limbic hyperactivity. Except for Effexor, these medications are not fi rstline treatments for ADD and, in fact, they may make ADD worse. These serotonin-enhancing medi- cations are also used to treat eating disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, PMS (over-focused type), excessive worrying, temper problems associated with things not going a person’s way, and other cingulate problems listed in this book.  Contrary to the negative media attention, Prozac is generally a very safe medication. In our experience, however, people who have temporal lobe problems may experi- ence an intensifi cation of angry and ag- gressive feelings on Prozac or other serot- oninenhancing medications. Therefore, we are careful to screen for these before plac- ing someone on these medications. If you have side effects on any medication, it is important to contact your doctor and dis- cuss them. •"},{"pageNumber":629,"pageContent":" Appendix 609 Unlike stimulants, these may take several weeks to several months in order to be ef- fective and even three to four months to become optimally effective. The most common side effect of these medications is sexual dysfunction. Some- times adding gingko biloba or bupropion counteracts these problems. 4.

They are often very effective in resistant psychiatric conditions where all else has failed.  Tegretol and Depakote/Depakene are used as primary treatments for manic-depressive disorder. Neurontin and Lamictal are now also being used for this as well. These are often helpful for people with ADD and violent outbursts or those who have experienced head trauma. • •"},{"pageNumber":631,"pageContent":" Appendix 611 5. Blood Pressure Medications The following blood pressure medications have been used to help with tic disorders, hyperactivity, aggressiveness, and impulsivity. They are not usually helpful with the atten- tional symptoms, and they are often mixed with a stimulant medication when ADD is present.  Clonidine and guanfacine are also used as primary treatments for tic disorders such as Tourette’s syndrome. When I use clonidine in addition to a stim- ulant medication, I order a screening EKG. There have been several reports that this combination may cause problems, even though I have found it to be effective and safe. These medications are also used to treat insomnia, which is very common in ADD. • • •"},{"pageNumber":632,"pageContent":"612 Appendix 6. Combination Medications People can have more than one problem or more than one brain system involved in their symptoms. Sometimes one medication seems to be able to treat a number of problems, as mentioned above, and sometimes a combina- tion of medications is needed to obtain full therapeutic benefi t. Here are four common combinations of medications I use in my practice. A stimulant plus an antiobsessive antide- pressant (such as Adderall plus Effexor) for patients with ADD plus depression, obses- siveness, or severe oppositional behavior. In my clinical experience I have seen many people who are children or grandchildren of alcoholics benefi t from this combina- tion. Frequently, this population presents with cingulate (overfocus symptoms) and prefrontal cortex problems (attentional symptoms). An anticonvulsant plus an antiobsessive antidepressant (such as Depakote plus Zoloft) for patients with temper problems and excessive worrying or depression.
