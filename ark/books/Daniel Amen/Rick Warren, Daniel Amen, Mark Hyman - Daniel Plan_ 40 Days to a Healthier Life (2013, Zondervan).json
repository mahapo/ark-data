Everybody’s FAT!That shocking thought kept reverberating in my mind one bright spring day as Iwas baptizing 827 adults.I’ll admit it wasn’t a very spiritual thought for a pastor to have, especiallywhile baptizing! But I was getting tired, since our church baptizes the wayJesus was baptized in the Jordan River — by lowering people under the water,then lifting them back up.That day, based on the average weight of Americans, I lifted more than 145,000pounds!I had read plenty of articles about the growing epidemic of obesity, diabetes,and heart disease in America, but that day I actually felt the weight ofAmerica’s health problem in a dramatic way.While my first thought was that everyone I baptized was overweight, my secondthought was more personal and pointed:But I’m fat too! I’m as out of shape as everyone else is!In that moment of clarity, I realized the terrible example I was giving with myown health. How could I expect my congregation to take better care of theirbodies if I was such a poor model? I had ignored my own growing problem forthirty years.Let me explain:I grew up in a family that didn’t drink alcohol or smoke, but all food — nomatter how unhealthy it might be — was considered okay. And growing up, much ofmy life centered around food.Every memory of my childhood, both good and bad, was connected to food. When wewere happy, we celebrated by eating. When we were sad, we consoled ourselveswith comfort food. If I had a difficult day as a child, the antidote was cookiesand milk or a piece of fresh pie.Living on five acres in the country, my dad grew a huge vegetable garden, my momloved to cook, and we all loved to eat. Eating was our entertainment, and we hadhuge meals every night. In fact, our handmade fourteen-foot dining table made ofa single four-inch slab of redwood was the largest piece of furniture in ourhouse. It dominated our home, and our family life revolved around the meals weshared together.Blessed with good health, a high metabolism, and an active life, I could eateverything I wanted and as much as I wanted and never gain a pound. When Imarried Kay, I was as thin as a flagpole even though I rarely exercised and atejunk food constantly. I paid no attention to my health.Then, in 1980, at age twenty-five, I became the founding pastor of SaddlebackChurch in Southern California. As the church rapidly grew to thousands ofmembers, I worked long days, ate meals on the run, and spent hours sitting whileleading meetings, counseling people, and studying for sermons. I began adding afew pounds every year, but because my energy remained high and I didn’t caremuch about appearance, I ignored my growing health problem. By 2010, I wasseverely overweight.Ironically, over the past decade I had sent nearly 21,000 of our church membersoverseas to 196 countries to serve the sick and the poor through a program wedeveloped called the P.E.A.C.E. plan. The C of the P.E.A.C.E. stands for “Carefor the sick,” and our members had compassionately cared for the health ofothers around the world who were suffering from poor nutrition, poor water,malaria, and HIV/AIDS. But I ignored my own declining health and that of my ownmembers.That baptism was my wake-up call to the health issues in my life and in thelives of those in our congregation. I knew drastic changes were needed, so Ibegan educating myself about preventative health. What I learned shocked me: * For the first time in history, as many people are suffering from the result of too much food as malnutrition. While millions of people suffer from not having enough to eat, millions are struggling with the effects of being overweight.1 [part0020_split_001.html#ch1ft1] * Seven in ten Americans are overweight.2 [part0020_split_001.html#ch1ft2] * Diabetes, heart disease, and other “lifestyle-based diseases” now kill more people than infectious diseases worldwide.3 [part0020_split_001.html#ch1ft3]The next Sunday, I stood before my congregation and made this public confession:Friends, I’ve been a poor steward of my health and a terrible example for you.While we’ve been helping many around the world, I’ve ignored the problem here athome.So today I am publicly repenting, and I ask for your forgiveness! God expects usto take care of the bodies he has given us, but I have not done that. Now, I’veonly gained two to three pounds a year, but I have been your pastor for thirtyyears. So I need to lose ninety pounds! Do any of you want to join me in gettinghealthy?The audience responded with sustained applause.Honestly, I expected that maybe a couple hundred people would join me in myquest to get healthy, so I was overwhelmed when more than 12,000 people signedup in the first few weeks! Now I needed a plan. It had to be simple,inexpensive, and scalable. Since I was preaching that day about a man in theBible named Daniel who refused to eat junk food and challenged a king to ahealth contest, I named the program The Daniel Plan.Since I knew nothing about getting healthy, I recruited three nationally knowndoctors — Dr. Daniel Amen, Dr. Mark Hyman, and Dr. Mehmet Oz — to coach me ingetting healthy and help me design The Daniel Plan to be used in our church. Allthree doctors graciously volunteered their expertise and time for free becausethey care about our health.Over the first year of The Daniel Plan, Saddleback members collectively lostmore than 250,000 pounds! But even more important, we learned insights,developed skills, and established habits for a lifetime of healthy living. TheDaniel Plan is far more than a diet. It is a lifestyle program based on biblicalprinciples and five essential components: Food, Fitness, Focus, Faith, andFriends. These last two components — faith and friends — are what I call thesecret sauce that makes The Daniel Plan so effective. When you have God and agroup helping you, you now have far more than willpower helping you makepositive changes, and you are far more likely to stay consistent.Let me be clear: There is no magic pill, no quick fix, no instant formula, andno shortcut that will make you healthy overnight. You must make wise choicesevery day. You will likely have setbacks. I have! In fact, as I write thesewords, I am recovering from a recent setback. My family experienced a tragicloss that was devastating to all of us. In my grief, I didn’t sleep much, andthat left me exhausted, both emotionally and physically. Overwhelmed by sorrowand fatigue, I stopped making healthy choices and began to add unwanted weight.All those pounds I had lost kept finding me! But as anyone in recovery will tellyou, setbacks are part of the process in long-term change. Rather than beatmyself up, I simply asked God and my friends to help me get back on track.The plan you will read about in this book is really quite simple. Dedicate yourbody to God. Ask for his help, and get involved in a small group of some kindthat will support you on your journey. Then start making healthy choices — suchas replacing donuts with fresh fruit and making exercise a part of your dailyroutine. Make whole foods a regular part of your diet. Live a more activelifestyle. Get more sleep. Cut down on your stress. It’s not rocket science.It’s just good, common sense. After all, God expects you to use the brain hegave you.Many diets and fitness plans use guilt as a motivation, but that never works inthe long run. You can guilt yourself into doing anything short-term, but thechange will last only as long as the guilt (or fear) does. In contrast, TheDaniel Plan is built with love as the motivation: Experiencing God’sunconditional love for you, learning to love him back, learning to love whom Godmade you to be, and learning to give and receive love from others in a smallgroup setting.The Bible says, “Love never gives up, never loses faith, is always hopeful, andendures through every circumstance” (1 Corinthians 13:7 NLT). It is love — notfear, not guilt, and not peer pressure — that causes us to keep going when wefeel like giving up.The Bible also tells us that lasting change begins with committing your body toGod. Romans 12:1 – 2 says, “… give your bodies to God…. Let them be a living andholy sacrifice — the kind he will find acceptable. This is truly the way toworship him. Don’t copy the behavior and customs of this world, but let Godtransform you into a new person by changing the way you think” (NLT, emphasisadded). Notice the strong mind-body connection in this verse. Two thousand yearsafter this verse was written, we now know that not only do our minds affect ourbodies, but also our bodies affect our minds.What you do with your body sets the tone for everything else. Physical healthinfluences your mental health, your spiritual health, your emotional health,your relational health, and even your financial health. How many times have youread a book, heard a message, or attended an event that motivated you to makesome change, but then you didn’t have the physical energy to do it? Instead, youlaid down on your couch and watched TV.A major motivation for me to be physically healthy is that I want the energy andalertness to make other changes in my life. My guess is that you too have otherareas of your life you would like to improve. So we are going to begin byraising your energy level, since you can’t do anything without a body! We aregoing to start at the most basic level of your life: your physical health."},{"pageContent":"WHAT DOES GOD SAY ABOUT YOUR BODY?The Christian family I grew up in attended church services every week. I havelistened to thousands of sermons on what God has to say about our souls, ourminds, our wills, and our emotions. But not once had I ever heard an entiresermon on God’s view of our bodies. The subject was completely ignored. This iswhy most people still have no theology of health. While our culture is obsessedwith physical beauty and sexy bodies, many believers ignore their bodies as ifthey don’t matter. But they do.God has a lot to say about the importance of the body he gave you. It is talkedabout through the Bible. But for the sake of brevity, let me show you just onechapter of the Bible, 1 Corinthians 6:12 – 20:“I have the right to do anything,” you say — but not everything is beneficial.“I have the right to do anything” — but I will not be mastered by anything. Yousay, “Food for the stomach and the stomach for food, and God will destroy themboth.” The body, however, is not meant for sexual immorality but for the Lord,and the Lord for the body. By his power God raised the Lord from the dead, andhe will raise us also. Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christhimself? Shall I then take the members of Christ and unite them with aprostitute? Never! …Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a person commits are outside thebody, but whoever sins sexually, sins against their own body. Do you not knowthat your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you havereceived from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Thereforehonor God with your bodies.Wow! This is definitely an in-your-face, tell-it-like-it-is, no-holds-barreddescription of what God considers to be the right and wrong use of our bodies.In this and other passages of Scripture we learn five radical truths about ourbodies that run counterculturally to everything you hear today.1. My body belongs to God. It is his property, not mine. I don’t own it, Goddoes. He created my body, and he expects me to use it the way he intended for itto be used. Now we naturally rebel against this idea. Our culture teaches us,“My body is mine to do whatever I want to with it.” But God says, “No, you’rewrong. It’s not your body, because you didn’t create it. I made it, and I loanedit to you to live in while I put you on earth, and I expect you to take care ofmy creation.”The fact is, everything you can see on earth was created by God. He made it, andhe owns it. What you think you own is really on loan. The Bible says, “The body… is not meant for sexual immorality but for the Lord, and the Lord for thebody” (1 Corinthians 6:13).Today we make the same common mistake Greek philosophers did thousands of yearsago. Aristotle, Socrates, and Plato believed in dualism,4[part0020_split_001.html#ch1ft4] which included the idea that your mind (orspirit) is important, but your body isn’t important spiritually. They devaluedthe body. In fact, some Greek philosophers taught that your body is evil, so itreally didn’t matter if you messed it up.The Bible tells us the exact opposite. Your body is holy because God made it,and everything God makes has a purpose. We are to bring glory to God with ourbodies, so we can’t compartmentalize our lives and think that we can divorce ourbodies and live as if only our spirit matters. God owns your body!2. Jesus paid for my body when he died for me on the cross. As we saw earlier, 1Corinthians 6:19 – 20 tells us that our bodies have been bought!Millions of TV viewers love watching American Pickers and Pawn Stars becauseit’s fun to guess how much old items are worth. The owners often think somethingthey own is more valuable than it really is. But the reality is that somethingis only worth whatever someone is willing to pay for it! You may think yourhouse is worth more, but it’s really only worth what a buyer is willing to payfor it.God has never made a person he didn’t love. If you want to know how valuableyour life is to God, just look at the cross. With his arms outstretched, nailedto the cross, Jesus was saying, “This is how valuable you are to me. I love youthis much! I’d rather die than live without you.” You are priceless.Now, if you are worth dying for, don’t you think God wants you to take bettercare of yourself? If you bought a million-dollar race horse, would you feed itjunk food and keep it up all night? Of course not! You would protect yourinvestment. The fact is, Jesus has made an investment in you. He paid for yourlife with his life, and he expects you to take care of his investment.3. God’s Spirit lives in my body. When you say yes to God, accepting by faithwhat Jesus did for you and trusting his grace and forgiveness to save you, thenGod puts his Spirit inside you as a guarantee of your salvation. The Bible saysit like this: “Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit,who is in you, whom you have received from God?” (1 Corinthians 6:19).When God puts his Spirit inside you, your body becomes a temple of God, aresidence for his love. So let me ask you this: If you saw someone vandalizingor damaging a temple dedicated to God, wouldn’t you consider that a crime? Ofcourse! But you abuse and vandalize God’s temple, your body, when you deprive itof rest and sleep, overeat, put too much stress on it, and fail to take care ofit.4. God expects me to take care of my body. I am not the owner of my body, but Iam the caretaker, or manager, of it. The word for manager in the Bible issteward. Taking care of my body is an issue of spiritual stewardship. In fact,God tells me that one day I will have to give an account for how well I managedeverything he gave to me, including my body. I will stand before God and have toanswer the question, “What did you do with what I gave you?”In The Purpose Driven Life I explain how your life on earth is a test, a trust,and a temporary assignment. This life is preparation for our next life, whichwill last forever in eternity. God is testing you on earth to see what he cantrust you with in eternity. He is watching how you use your time, your money,your talents, your opportunities, your mind, and yes, even your body. Are youmaking the most of what you’ve been given? God isn’t going to evaluate you onthe basis of the bodies he gave to other people, but he will judge what you didwith what you have been given.5. God will resurrect my body after I die. God never wastes anything. He getsthe maximum use out of all he creates. Right now you are living in the 1.0version of your body. You will get the 2.0 version of your body in heaven. TheBible says, “By his power God raised the Lord from the dead, and he will raiseus also” (1 Corinthians 6:14).We don’t really know what our resurrected bodies will be like, but we do have afew clues. We know that after Jesus came from the grave, he walked aroundJerusalem for forty days in a resurrected body. He was seen multiple times bymany different groups of people, including one event where more than 500 peoplesaw and talked with him. So we know that other people will still recognize youin the new 2.0 version of your body in heaven, but there will be one majordifference: in heaven your body will be perfect, with no blemishes, no brokenparts, no wounds, and no pain.Did you notice the phrase by his power in that last Bible verse? This is whatmakes The Daniel Plan different from other approaches. It is built on trustingin God’s power to help you change, not merely your own willpower. Let’s behonest. Willpower works for a few weeks, or maybe a month or two at best. Thisis why New Year’s resolutions never last. Trying to change by willpower alone isexhausting. You can keep it up for a while, but it feels unnatural and stressfulto force yourself to be different simply on the basis of willpower.In The Daniel Plan you will learn the power of prayer, the power of faith, thepower of letting God’s Spirit refocus your thoughts, the power of fellowship andcommunity in a supportive small group, and most of all, the power of God’sSpirit inside you, helping you to make the changes God wants you to make and youwant to make."},{"pageContent":"HABITS ARE THE KEY TO YOUR SUCCESSMaking big and lasting changes in our lives is never easy — whether it’s changesin the way we relate to others, the way we manage our time, the way we use ourmoney, the way we do our work, or the way we treat our bodies. Whenever we wantto improve or change something, we usually start out with great enthusiasm andhopeful expectations, but over time, those feelings fade, and so does ourresolve. That is why the key to long-lasting success is to develop habits — new,positive habits that replace our self-defeating behaviors. The Bible speaks of“putting off our old self and putting on a new self,” which includes our habits(see Ephesians 4:22, 24).Our habits control our lives. We shape our habits; then our habits shape us. IfI asked you to make a list of all your bad habits, you would quickly identifythem. You already know what they are, and you know that they aren’t helpful. Infact, many are harmful. So why haven’t you replaced them? What makes breakingbad habits and creating new ones so difficult? Here are four of the most commonreasons: * You’ve had your unhealthy habits for a long time, so you’re comfortable with them. Regardless of whether you are overweight or anorexic, whether you overeat or have any kind of eating disorder, whether you are out of shape or don’t have enough energy, you didn’t get that way overnight. It was likely a long, slow decline in your health. Many of your adult habits were developed in your childhood. Some of your unhealthy habits may have been survival tactics for unmet emotional and spiritual needs that you experienced early in life. Other habits you developed out of fear. Some habits are developed to soothe negative emotions such as loneliness, anxiety, depression, or feeling unloved. * You identify with your unhealthy habits. Anytime you hear someone say, “I’m always late” or “I’m a worrier” or “I can never resist a dessert,” that person is identifying himself or herself with a bad habit. We often confuse our identity with our habits, but the truth is, habits can be changed! Habits are things you do. They are not who you are! You have weaknesses, but you are not your weaknesses. You are a unique creation of God, flawed by your nature and choices, yet deeply loved by God. No man or woman will ever love you as much as God does. His love for you is not dependent on your habits. * Your unhealthy habits have a payoff. In the long run they cause pain, but in the short term they seem easier and more rewarding. And whatever gets rewarded gets repeated. The addicting taste of junk food, the short-term high from carbohydrates, or the pleasure of loafing around instead of exercising gives immediate gratification. We want to feel good now, not later. God warns of this when he said, “There is pleasure in sin for a short time” (see Hebrews 11:25). Most of the social problems we see in our culture today are the direct result of our unwillingness to delay gratification. To overcome this, you must see the greater payoff and rewards of making healthy choices. * You have an enemy who wants to discourage you. Not only do you have to fight against your natural inclinations, but Satan — whom the Bible calls the Deceiver and the Accuser — is actively working against you every moment of your day. Since Satan cannot hurt God directly, he tries to hurt God’s children. Satan does not want you living a healthy life because that honors God. So he is constantly suggesting negative thoughts to keep you stuck. He loves to plant seeds of doubt in your mind: “Who do you think you are? You’re never going to change! You have never been able to change in the past. What makes you think this will be any different? It’s hopeless, and you’re hopeless. So don’t even try!” (In the chapter on Focus, we will have more to say about replacing negative thoughts.)With these four elements working against us, it is no wonder that most attemptsby people to develop healthy habits end in failure. Again, you need more thanjust good intentions and willpower to change. You need God’s plan for change."},{"pageContent":"FIVE ELEMENTS FOR LASTING CHANGEThe Daniel Plan is based on five elements for lasting change that are found inJohn 8, Ephesians 4, and many other Bible passages:1. Lasting change requires building your life on the truth.One of the most famous statements by Jesus is in John 8:31 – 32: “If youcontinue to obey my teaching, you are truly my followers. Then you will know thetruth, and the truth will make you free” (NCV). Jesus promises that the truthwill make you free. But first, the truth is likely to make you miserable! Wedon’t like to face the truth about ourselves, our weaknesses, our bad habits,and especially our motivations. But until you face the truth about why you dowhat you do and get to the root of your habits, change is likely to be shallowand short-lived.Too often, popular diet fads offer fast formulas, easy pills, and secret curesthat supposedly will melt the fat away. By contrast, The Daniel Plan helps youto face the truth about yourself and your relationship to God, to food, to yourpurpose in life, and to other people. If you are looking for a quick fix, youcan set this book down now. But if you want to build an authentically healthylife based on the truth of God, and you’re willing to be honest with God,yourself, and a few trusted friends, keep reading.Nothing will change permanently until you dig down to the bedrock of truth aboutyour life and God’s purpose for it. This book is an introduction to get youstarted on the right pathway, but the journey will take the rest of your life.2. Lasting change requires making wise choices.Everyone wants to be healthy, but very few people choose to be healthy. It takesmore than desire or a dream to get healthy … it takes a decision. You won’tchange until you choose to change. You don’t get healthy by accident. It’sintentional. It’s a choice. Actually, it’s a lifetime of choices, but it beginswith a decision.As a pastor I have met many people who were praying for God to heal illnessesand sicknesses that could easily be reversed if they simply made healthierchoices. Why should God heal you of an obesity-related illness if you have nointention of changing the choices that led to it? God is waiting for you tostart making healthy choices. So if you have been waiting for a sign, this isit!As you make more and more healthy choices, you will begin to change: “Get rid ofyour old self, which made you live as you used to — the old self that was beingdestroyed by its deceitful desires. Your hearts and minds must be madecompletely new, and you must put on the new self, which is created in God’slikeness” (Ephesians 4:22 – 24 GNT).Whose Slave Are You?Years ago, Bob Dylan sang, “You’re gonna have to serve somebody. It may be theDevil or it may be the Lord.” In today’s culture that encouragesirresponsibility, I counsel many people who have become slaves to their owndesires. Every time you make a bad choice, it becomes harder to make a good one.Romans 6:16 says, “Don’t you realize that you become the slave of whatever youchoose to obey? You can be a slave to sin, which leads to death, or you canchoose to obey God, which leads to righteous living” (NLT).Fortunately, God offers you his power to make healthy choices. “For God isworking in you, giving you the desire and the power to do what pleases him”(Philippians 2:13 NLT). As you begin to follow The Daniel Plan, you will see howGod has a part and you have a part in your physical health and your spiritualmaturity.You do what you can do, and God does what only he can do.3. Lasting change requires new ways of thinking.The way you think determines the way you feel, and the way you feel determinesthe way you act. If you want to change how you act, you must begin by changingthe way you think. Your thoughts are the autopilot of your life.Romans 12:2 says, “Don’t copy the behavior and customs of this world, but letGod transform you into a new person by changing the way you think. Then you willlearn to know God’s will for you, which is good and pleasing and perfect” (NLT).The biblical word for changing your mind is “repentance.” To repent is to make amental U-turn. I choose to focus my thoughts in a completely differentdirection. This new mind-set creates new emotions, which give me motivation tochange.Let me ask you a personal question: What old ways of thinking do you need tochange? Where do you need to repent? Have you held on to some self-destructiveideas about food, about your body, about sex, or about work that have harmedyour health? To get healthy, you’ll need to repent of unhealthy choices. You’llneed to think differently about your body — and every other area of your lifetoo. Philippians 2:5 says, “Have the same mind-set as Christ Jesus.” The way youdo this is by filling your mind with the Bible, God’s truth.In The Daniel Plan, you will learn some new thinking skills, such as learning toreplace negative thoughts rather than resisting them. Whatever you resist,persists. The more you fight a feeling, the more it controls you. The secret ofvictory over any temptation is simply to change the channel of your mind.Refocus your attention on something else, and the temptation immediately losesits power over you.4. Lasting change requires God’s Spirit in your life.I have already mentioned that you need God’s power, not just willpower, tochange.God’s Holy Spirit helps us break free from bad habits, compulsions, andaddictions. Since he offers to help, it would be foolish to not take advantageof it. Galatians 5:18 asks, “Why don’t you choose to be led by the Spirit and soescape the erratic compulsions of a law-dominated existence?” (MSG).The more I allow God’s Spirit to guide and empower me, the more he growspositive character qualities in my life to replace my bad habits. The Biblecalls these qualities the Fruit of the Spirit. Galatians 5:22 – 23 gives a listof them: “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance,kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.” Note that lastquality: self-control. You already know how important that one is and the damagethat happens when you don’t have it. But what most people don’t know is that thesecret of self-control is to allow ourselves to be Spirit-controlled.This is the exact opposite of what most people think. Ask someone on the street,“What do you think of when I use the phrase ‘Spirit-filled’ or‘Spirit-controlled’?” and typically people will describe someone acting out ofcontrol. But the Bible says that the more I allow God’s Spirit to direct andguide me, the more self-controlled I become! As the apostle Paul said, “For Ican do everything through Christ, who gives me strength” (Philippians 4:13 NLT).Only a Bible-based program like The Daniel Plan can offer this promise.5. Lasting change requires honest community.Here’s the reality: Some of your habits and patterns and behaviors are so deeplyingrained that you will never be able to uproot and replace them on your own.You have probably tried to change many times and have failed to maintain thechanges. If you could change these tough areas by yourself, you would havealready done so. But some habits are so strong, we must team-tackle themtogether.Actually, this is a good thing, because it forces us to recognize our need foreach other. It’s part of God’s plan. We were created to live in community. Weare designed by God for relationships. The very first thing God said to mankindwas “It is not good for the man to be alone” (Genesis 2:18). God hatesloneliness. So he made us to need each other.The deepest changes in your life will only happen as you open up to a fewtrusted friends who will support you and check up on you. You don’t need alegalistic schoolmaster, but you do need some friends who will meet with youregularly as a small group. At Saddleback Church we have more than 32,000 peoplemeeting weekly in more than 7,000 small groups, so I speak with confidence intelling you that if you are serious about making lasting changes in your life,the best and most effective way to do it is with the support of others. AtSaddleback Church, when 12,000 people lost more than 250,000 pounds, wediscovered that those connected to a small group lost twice as much as those whotried to do the program on their own.In another chapter you learn some specific ways that a small group can assistyou in your journey to health by encouraging you, praying for you, supportingyou, and giving you feedback.The Bible is filled with verses on the importance of community. Hebrews 10:25says, “Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing,but let us encourage one another” (NIV 1984). Galatians 6:2 says, “By helpingeach other with your troubles, you truly obey the law of Christ” (NCV).And Solomon said, “Two people are better off than one, for they can help eachother succeed. If one person falls, the other can reach out and help. Butsomeone who falls alone is in real trouble…. A person standing alone can beattacked and defeated, but two can stand back-to-back and conquer. Three areeven better, for a triple-braided cord is not easily broken” (Ecclesiastes 4:9 –12 NLT).You don’t need a lot of people to form your Daniel Plan small group. You canbegin with just two or three people. Jesus said, “For where two or three gatherin my name, there am I with them” (Matthew 18:20). This is part of “the faithfactor” of The Daniel Plan. Jesus will be with you.As you read through these chapters, you will realize that The Daniel Plan is notcomplicated, but rather simple and straightforward: You assess your currenthealth and then dedicate your body to God. You ask for God’s help. You gather afew friends and form a weekly support group. You begin to make healthy choicesthat will become habits as you reinforce them. Finally, you expect God toempower you to be consistent, claiming the promise of Philippians 1:6: “Beingconfident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on tocompletion until the day of Christ Jesus.”I am proud of you for wanting to be healthier, and I hope you will jointhousands of us who have used The Daniel Plan as a tool to change what we fearedcould never change. This is your moment! There is no telling what God might wantto do through you as you gain more energy, think more clearly, feel moreconfident, and grow physically stronger and more flexible.I will be praying for you, specifically the words of 3 John 2: “Dear friend, Ipray that you may enjoy good health and that all may go well with you, even asyour soul is getting along well.”As you begin The Daniel Plan, I would love to hear from you about what happensin your life, in your small group, and in your church.

His cholesterol was high. His triglycerides wereclose to 400 mg/dL (normal being around 150 mg/dL). He was pre-diabetic and onmultiple medications.As Steven reveals, “My Daniel Plan journey started when my wife and I startedtalking about the arrival of our first child and the plans and decisions wewould make as parents and as a couple. One of the things that came up was ourlongevity. She said to me, ‘If you die early, man, I’m going to miss you. But ifyou die of something that was preventable, I’ll be really disappointed that youdidn’t do everything you possibly could to be here for me and for yourdaughter.’ Well, she only had to say that once to get my attention.”Steven took it seriously, and whatever The Daniel Plan doctors and Pastor Warrenrecommended, Steven did it. He examined his faith. He asked his men’s group tosupport him. He started planning his days around healthy foods. He found activegames that interested him to move his body. More than two years later, Steven isdown 80 pounds, and his health numbers are improved. He is even taking fewermedications. He is still “doing” The Daniel Plan because it has changed hislife.Hopefully, Steven’s story inspires you. We have told you why health is soimportant, and we have told you part of Steven’s story to show you how doable itis. Now we want to show you five areas of your life that work together to affectyour health — for good or for bad. The Daniel Plan is based on five Essentials:faith, food, fitness, focus, and friends.The Essentials are a pathway to much more than improved physical health. Each ofthe Essentials holds up your life, enlivens your body, enriches your mind, andfills your heart. Integrating these can lead to a whole, healthy life that helpsyou love fully, serve joyfully, and ultimately live out your calling at yourbest. We want to wake up and be able to give our highest gifts. And we want thatfor you too.Pastor Warren dives into your spiritual health and walks with you as you buildthat foundation. Dr. Hyman tells you everything you need to know about the powerof food to affect your mind and body. Once you see how good the right foods canbe for you, we hope it will inspire new eating habits that you enjoy.Exercise physiologist Sean Foy removes the roadblocks that keep you fromexercising. He shows you how much fun moving your body is and all the benefitsthat come from it. Dr. Amen helps you turn your brain into the powerful tool Godmade it to be by showing you how to boost its physical health, renew your mind,and fulfill your purpose.The powerful synergy of these Essentials with the support of friends brings youmore than any one essential alone. The prophet Daniel didn’t simply choose toeat healthier; he made that choice based on his faith, with a clear focus andthe support of his friends. So it’s no wonder that he was in better shape andhealth than the others in the king’s court."},{"pageContent":"THE FAITH ESSENTIALHere is a very frank question: Do you quit on your faith every time you hit abump? Do you say, “Forget it, God. I just can’t do this one hundred percent ofthe time, so what’s the use?” No! We know our faith relies on God. He’s the onewho builds it and sustains it.God gives us the grace and power to have a relationship with him. His Wordinstructs us on running this race of faith. God’s power is the key to anytransformational change in our lives, including our health. He wants us to pluginto that power so that we can live and move the way he intended.If you really believed God’s power was behind you, energizing and sustainingyou, what would hold you back?The Daniel Plan starts with faith, because spiritual health gives you afoundation for building habits and perspectives for health in any area. AsPastor Warren mentioned in chapter 1, faith is part of the secret of The DanielPlan. You may have tried a dozen diets and a dozen exercise programs. But healthis about more than a program. Health comes from recognizing and using God’spower in your life and treating your body and mind with the care that heintended.Where God guides, he provides. What he calls you to do, he equips you to do. Hedoesn’t need your strength and willpower, but he does need your commitment. Hewants you to live an abundant life that includes a vibrant faith, a vibrantbody, and a vibrant mind. But you must rely on Jesus.For too many of us, unhealthy choices have left us without the mental, physical,or spiritual energy to embrace what God has put us on this planet to do. Some ofyou think, “It’s too late for me. I’d do it if I were younger, but I’ve wastedmy opportunity. I’m woefully out of shape now. I’ll never get to where I need tobe.” But it’s never too late.Consider your faith — it’s always changing, always growing, always beingchallenged. Sometimes you step forward. Sometimes you step back. But you knowfaith is a life-long race. Hebrews 12:1 – 2 says, “Let us run with perseverancethe race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecterof faith.”You have to believe you can get healthy even if you can’t see it yet. Hebrews11:1 says, “Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about whatwe do not see.” Faith is visualizing the future in advance. It is seeing thefuture in the present. Every great achievement began when somebody saw it inadvance. When President John F. Kennedy issued the challenge to put a man on themoon, the technology hadn’t even been invented to do it.“There has never been the slightest doubt in my mind that the God who startedthis great work in you would keep at it and bring it to a flourishing finish onthe very day Christ Jesus appears” (Philippians 1:6 MSG).The same is true when it comes to getting healthy. You look in the mirror andbelieve that, with God’s help, you’ll get healthy even though the person staringback at you is exhausted, stressed, out of shape, or overweight.A Great Gift“With faith, I embraced the change [of The Daniel Plan lifestyle] and took ithead-on. I didn’t know where I would land spiritually, but I knew I had to stayclose to God. I can recall the day when I felt the Spirit telling me that thevessel God made of me was no longer to be in my control. He was breaking it downagainst my stubborn will, for my own good. He was about to make a new creation,something adorned in His fashion, that would somehow inspire others. I had toembrace it, and I knew deep down that this would impact my life in more waysthan I could imagine.”— Matthew BursteinYou have to keep going even when you want to quit. Holocaust survivor Corrie TenBoom said, “If you look at the world, you’ll be distressed. If you look within,you’ll be depressed. But if you look at Christ, you’ll be at rest.” It alldepends on where your focus is; where you bring your mind’s attention determineshow you feel.There will be tough days on this journey to healthy living. If you start thehabit of turning to God in tough times, then when you face challenges with food,fitness, or focus, you will be in the habit of turning to him for help. God’sgrace is always there, even when you are tired or tempted.You have to believe that God has your best in mind even when you can’t see whathe is doing. Throughout The Daniel Plan, we do our best to explain why — bothbiblically and scientifically — we are making certain recommendations. But inthe end, it will come down to your relationship with God and the health of yourfaith.Abraham is a classic example of obeying when he didn’t understand. He was aboutseventy-five years old, and God asked him to give up all his security (Hebrews11:8). Remember Abraham’s faith when you start to wonder things such as: * “How healthy will I get on this plan?” * “How long is it going to take?” * “How will I know when I get there?”You have to trust God even when you don’t get what you want. We all know frompersonal experience that faith doesn’t exempt us from problems. It’s easy totrust God when life is going well and we feel strong. But faith develops in thevalleys. When our dreams shatter and we feel helpless, that’s when we have tobelieve in God’s power and presence. So if you have ever been in a valley andyour faith was tested, then you know exactly how to face the lows on the journeyof health: trust God.Faith can virtually be regarded as a verb. It is active and not passive. It issomething you do. Decision making is a faith-building activity. Use your musclesof faith to build your physical muscles.God has given you a mission in life, and only you can fulfill it. Are you goingto let your health stand in the way? Are you going to be able to face yourSavior at the end of your life and say, “I finished the race. I did what YOU putme on earth to do. I didn’t get tired and worn out. I gave Jesus everything,including my physical health”? That’s what we hope you can say. So we want tohelp you build your faith by plugging into God’s power and asking him to openyour eyes to his view of your life. It will transform you from the inside out."},{"pageContent":"THE FOOD ESSENTIALWhat do you really know about food? You know what you like. You know what youdon’t like. You know what gets your kids excited to eat. Believe it or not, foodis much more than your mealtime sustenance. Food can reinvigorate your health,reconnect families, restore vibrant communities, improve the economy, improvethe health of the environment, reduce pollution, and even help our kids getbetter grades and avoid eating disorders, obesity, and drug abuse.“So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God”(1 Corinthians 10:31).How many of us have ever considered that food can heal? This is the biggestscientific discovery since the germ theory of disease and antibiotics: food ismedicine. Food is the most powerful drug on the planet. It can improve theexpression of thousands of genes, balance dozens of hormones, and optimize tensof thousands of protein networks. It can cure most chronic diseases, and itworks faster, better, and cheaper than any drug — and all the side effects aregood ones.Food contains messages, instructions, and information that tell your body whatto do every moment to increase vitality or create disease. Every bite you takeis a powerful opportunity to create healing or infirmity. Real, whole food thatcomes from the earth — food that was created by God — heals, whileindustrial-processed food created in factories by man harms.How Bad Is It?One in two Americans suffer from some chronic disease.1[part0020_split_002.html#ch2ft1] Heart disease; diabetes; cancer; dementia;autoimmune diseases; allergies; acid reflux; irritable bowels; neurologicalproblems; depression; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; thyroid,hormonal, and menstrual problems; skin problems including eczema, psoriasis,acne, and more. We spend almost $3 trillion a year in our health care system,and almost 80 percent of that is for chronic lifestyle preventable andreversible disease.2 [part0020_split_002.html#ch2ft2]Unfortunately, many of us don’t eat food anymore. We eat factory-made,industrially produced food-like substances. This should make us stop and think.Should we really be putting that stuff into our bodies?Dump the JunkThe National Institutes of Health spends $800 million a year trying to discoverthe cause of obesity.3 [part0020_split_002.html#ch2ft3] Could it be the 29pounds of French fries, 23 pounds of pizza, 24 pounds of ice cream, 53 gallonsof soda, 24 pounds of artificial sweeteners, 2.7 pounds of salt, 90,000milligrams of caffeine consumed every year by the average American?4[part0020_split_002.html#ch2ft4]We think of these foods as “convenience” foods. For a long time, the inventionof jarred, canned, and packaged foods seemed like a great idea for easiercooking and convenient, on-the-go meals. But now we have discovered that thisconvenience has led to depression, obesity, fatigue, and the surge of peopletaking multiple medications for lifestyle diseases such as heart disease,depression, and acid reflux. How convenient is that?The good news is that a life of abundance and vitality is right around thecorner. In fact, it is right in our own kitchens. It is time to get back intoour kitchens and take back our health. We have been convinced that it istime-consuming, expensive, and difficult to eat well. We are here to tell youthat enjoying real, fresh, whole food is easy, inexpensive, and most important,delicious.The Daniel Plan is rooted in a very simple principle: Take the junk out and letthe abundance in. The choice is yours. We don’t want to focus on what you can’teat (although we will educate and caution you about certain food substances) asmuch as on what you can include — delicious whole foods full of extraordinaryflavor, delightful textures, and hidden surprises. Our philosophy is that if itwas grown on a plant, eat it. If it was made in a plant, leave it on the shelf.Yes, we encourage eating lots and lots of vegetables. Our theory aboutvegetables is this: if you hate them, you’ve never had them prepared properly.They were canned, overcooked, boiled, deep-fried, or highly processed andtasteless mush. Just think of overcooked Brussels sprouts or mushy canned greenbeans. Those definitely don’t sound or taste very appetizing.As Dr. Hyman says, “Cooking is a revolutionary act.” We have unfortunatelyabdicated the essential act of cooking — the unique act that makes us human — tothe food industry. We have become food consumers, not food producers or makers.We have outsourced our cooking to corporations. We need to bring the cookingback home. Cooking can be fun, freeing, and simple.The Daniel Plan is designed to cut cravings, satisfy your appetite, and teachyou to listen to your body. You may not believe it yet, but your body willnaturally start rejecting the junk — the sugary, processed, and refined foods —and you will begin to crave real food.You will be invited to eat natural foods that bring vitality and energy to yourbody and mind. As you slowly introduce real whole fresh food, your body willrespond automatically and heal, and chronic symptoms will fade into memory. TheDaniel Plan introduces you to a whole new world of fresh fruits and vegetables,beans, whole grains, nuts, seeds, eggs, chicken, fish, lean or naturally raisedanimal products, and spices. The Daniel Plan gives you a clear, goof-proof plan.We are deeply concerned about our fat and sick nation, about our children’s andyour children’s future. The best medicine for this ailment is something sosimple, so easy, so healing, so affordable, and so accessible to almosteveryone: cooking real, whole food in the home with your family and friends.Our philosophy is that if it was grown on a plant, eat it. If it was made in aplant, leave it on the shelf."},{"pageContent":"THE FITNESS ESSENTIALBe honest — what do you think of when you hear the word fitness?Most of us understand that to have a fit, healthy, energetic, and abundant life,we need to exercise. But the reality is, most of us don’t. In fact, more than 70percent of us are not exercising regularly enough to maintain our health. It’snot because of a lack of information or education. For years we have beenencouraged, pushed, and prodded by medical doctors, fitness professionals, andgovernment agencies that for a fit and healthy life, we need to exercise.Like food, exercise works better than medicine. So what keeps us from taking ourregular dose? If we are honest, for many of us, exercise isn’t something we lookforward to doing. It’s not on the top of our to-do list.These sentiments may sound familiar:“Who has the time or energy to exercise regularly?”“I’ve tried to exercise before, but I just can’t seem to make it a habit.”“Exercise isn’t a lot of fun; it’s really a lot of work!”“When I exercise, all I feel is pain!”Most of us will admit that exercising regularly is difficult with an alreadycrammed, busy, and hectic schedule. And for those of us who begin to move, wewill quit after just a few weeks. If you find yourself in these statistics, youare not alone — but more importantly, we have great news for you.We would like to share with you a different approach to fitness — one that willhelp you actually look forward to exercise instead of dreading it. It’s a provenmethod for moving your body, helping you to realize God’s purpose, pleasure, andplan for your fitness and health.Unlike fitness regimens offered in popular health and fitness books,infomercials, DVDs, or gym classes, exercise physiologist Foy will show you howto maximize and enjoy your fitness experience so you can become what we callDaniel Strong.The prophet Daniel was a strong man. In body, mind, heart, and spirit, he foundhis power, purpose, and strength in devotion to God. No matter where he was orwhat he was doing, he lived with passion and singular focus: to honor God in allhe did. Whether he found himself in the comfort of the king’s court or in thedarkness of a lions’ den, Daniel was ready and able to follow God withcommitment, devotion, and strength rarely seen. He was fit to serve, whenever,wherever, under extreme difficulty, and in any and all circumstances. He wasDaniel strong. But like all of us, he wasn’t born with this strength. Rather, henurtured it by following God’s plan and design for his life.Power WalkerIn her fifties, Patti Kaminski never would have dreamed that she would become afitness fanatic. “I have gone from hardly being able to walk to my front door[when I weighed 110 pounds more than I do today] to walking six miles in thehills every Saturday. Once a month I walk eight miles.” She even found apersonal trainer and loves going to the gym. “Now my trainer is my workout buddyand my new unofficial adopted son. I love every minute! I have energy likecrazy, memory improvement (steel trap), and a complete change on my outlook onlife.”Daniel was recognized early for his potential and was chosen as a young boy toserve the king of Babylon. He diligently trained physically, intellectually,relationally, and spiritually with the purpose to be the best he could possiblybe. With a strong body, a strong mind, a strong character, and most of all astrong faith, Daniel honored God in all he did — and you can too.Another Daniel strong man was Eric Liddell, a man celebrated and remembered fromOlympic history for a race he never ran. It was the 100-meter qualifying heat ofthe 1924 Olympic games hosted in Paris, France. Liddell was the favorite in theevent and was expected to take home the Olympic Gold medal for his country. Buthis qualifying race was scheduled on a Sunday, the day he observed as theSabbath. To the shock and dismay of the press and the racing world, Liddell, adevout Christian, withdrew from the race, desiring to honor God above others’expectations, great opposition, and his own personal gain.A few days later, Liddell focused his attention on a race that was not one ofhis better events, the 400 meters. Since he was racing against a field of worldrecord-setting competitors, very little was expected of Liddell in this event.Yet, not only did he win the 400-meter race, but he also broke the existingworld record with a time of 47.6 seconds, a record that would stand for years.Exercise MedicineExercise is the best strategy to: * Increase energy * Improve muscular strength, tone, and endurance * Make you happier, reducing stress, anxiety, and depression * Look and feel years younger * Manage weight and decrease body fat * Increase productivity * Stimulate creativity * Sharpen focus * Promote restful sleep * Enhance intimacy and relationships * Strengthen bones * Make you smarter * Enhance immune function * Increase joint mobility * Improve posture * Treat and prevent more than forty chronic diseasesNeed we say more?Liddell is known for saying, “When I run, I feel God’s pleasure.” This quoteembodies the man, servant, and athlete Eric Liddell. It also captures the veryessence of what fitness in The Daniel Plan is all about.But we don’t have to be Olympic athletes — or even train like one — to capturethe profound lesson that Eric Liddell’s life demonstrated. Liddell discoveredthat his love of running, training, and exercising not only made his body strongand healthy, but also gave him great satisfaction and joy and prepared him to bein the best shape he could be for the rest of his life.Leading health and wellness organizations such as the American College of SportsMedicine have discovered that moving your body even just a little bit on aregular basis impacts not only your physical health, but also your intellectual,emotional, social, financial, and spiritual health.Like Daniel and Eric Liddell, we are designed to move. When we are fit, ourbodies, minds, and relationships work better, and we have the potential,resilience, and strength to be all we were designed to be.Wherever you are at with fitness — even if you have never exercised on a regularbasis — The Daniel Plan will help you find a personal fitness strategy that youwill enjoy. We will help you discover what moves you so that you can build andstrengthen the body God gave you."},{"pageContent":"THE FOCUS ESSENTIALYou can have solid faith, healthy food choices, and plenty of exercise and stillsabotage your health. The potential saboteur? Your brain. Your mental health isvital for your overall health. Negative thoughts, positive thoughts, or lack ofthought can consume you. Depending on which one consumes the most of your mind,you could make or break your health before you even get started. Whatever getsthe most of your mind’s attention will direct many other areas of your life.When your brain works right, you work right. When your brain is healthy, yourability to focus increases and you make better decisions. So many distractionscompete for your attention, so it is important to renew your mind and focus onGod’s plan and priorities for your life.Change Your Mind“Whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure,whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable — if anything is excellent orpraiseworthy — think about such things” (Philippians 4:8). Part of stayingfocused is being able to develop mastery over the quality of your thoughts.Thoughts lie — they lie a lot. It is often your uninvestigated thoughts thatdrive depression, anxiety, fear, and overeating that derail progress towardbetter health.Ultimately, the health of your brain heavily influences the quality of yourdecisions and your ability to maintain focus. Your brain is involved ineverything you do. Modern-day neuroscience clearly tells us that when your brainworks right, you tend to be happier, physically healthier, and more thoughtful,because you make better decisions. (Decision making is a brain function.)A patient who was a mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter came to see Dr. Amen. Onemight imagine MMA is not good for the brain. This patient had been fightingcompetitively for more than five years and struggled with his focus, temper, andmood. Using the Essentials of The Daniel Plan — which included more deeplyconnecting with his purpose, changing his diet, engaging in non-brain-damagingexercise, using some simple supplements to enhance brain function, andconnecting with friends — this patient was able to show remarkable improvement.One of the most important parts of the Focus Essential is to know yourmotivation, or why you must get healthy. Without an underlying clear sense ofmotivation, it is much harder to stay the course in good times and hard ones.But once you know why you care, why you must be healthy, your motivationliterally provides the fuel for staying focused. Ask yourself why you must behealthy. Is it to live in God’s will? To have greater health and mental clarity?Or to be a great role model for someone you love?Every time you have a thought, your brain releases chemicals. Negative, angry,and hopeless thoughts produce negative chemicals that make your body and mindfeel bad; by contrast, positive, happy, and hopeful thoughts produce acompletely different set of chemicals that help you feel relaxed, happy, and incontrol of your impulses. We will explain several ways your mind distorts thetruth. Knowing how to talk back to your negative thoughts is critical to beingable to focus on the truth in God’s Word and helping you live in the fullness ofmental and physical health that God wants for you.In a similar way to disciplining your mind to have accurate, honest thoughts, itis also important to bring your attention each day to those things for which youare grateful. Modern medical research reveals that when you consistently focuson your blessings and what you are grateful for each day, it has positiveeffects on your physical and mental health. For example, psychologist MartinSeligman from the University of Pennsylvania found that when people wrote downthree things they were grateful for each day, within three weeks itsignificantly increased their level of happiness.5[part0020_split_002.html#ch2ft5] As you will see, gratitude even helps yourbrain work better.Losing More Than PoundsLaura, a fifty-three-year-old project manager, had struggled with her weight formany years. She had tried diet after diet without lasting success. Learning howto focus on gratitude, correct her negative thought patterns, and learn frommistakes rather than beat herself up, together with the elements of faith, food,fitness, and friends made a huge long-term difference for her. She lostforty-three pounds over six months and became dedicated to a new way of livinginstead of a fad diet.Often, attempts to improve your health or life fall flat or end too soon becauseyour willpower is hard to build. You know that your willpower must rest on thepower of God, but it also grows stronger with a clear mind and self-control.Think about how often you try to avoid something bad for you but fail becauseyou cannot control your impulses. It’s frustrating, isn’t it? So, what if youcould learn the two most important words in the English language when it comesto your health: then what. * Then what will happen if I eat this? * Then what will happen if I say this impulsive thing to my wife? * Then what will happen if I stay up at night on the computer and don’t get good sleep for tomorrow?Keeping these two words at the top of your mind and engaging in the righthabits, such as getting enough sleep and eating right, will make a dramaticdifference in your mental and physical health, which in turn will help yourfriendships and your connection with God.Clear focus and a healthy mind don’t preclude failure on this journey. Failureis a part of everyone’s journey. But it is your attitude toward failure thatwill determine your ultimate success. Focus and a healthy mind can help you havethe right attitude toward failure. We are telling you now to expect both ups anddowns on your journey toward better health. There will be highlights andsetbacks.Failure does not have to defeat or derail you. It can actually increase yourchances of ultimate success. The Daniel Plan encourages you to turn bad daysinto good information and to study your failures. Learning from your mistakeshelps to prevent them in the future.One of Dr. Amen’s favorite exercises to help people get and stay healthy for alifetime is called The Fork in the Road.Vividly imagine a fork in the road with two paths:To the left, imagine a future of pain. If you don’t care about your brain andbody and just keep doing what you’ve always done, what will your life be like ina year … in five years … in ten years? Imagine your body continuing to get oldand all that goes with that … brain fog, tiredness, depression, memory loss, andphysical illness.To the right, imagine a future of health. If you care about your body, which isa gift from God, and do The Daniel Plan, what will your life be like in fortydays, in a year … in five years … in ten years?

The secret sauce — friends — brings it all together.When it comes to your health, every body needs a buddy. After all, God createdthe universe in such a way that we need each other. In fact, the New Testamentuses the phrase one another over and over. It says love one another, encourageone another, serve one another, support one another. The word “support”literally means to increase one another’s potential.Doesn’t that sound like something you want? You already have it in some way. Youmay have a prayer circle that supports your spiritual walk. You may meet with adinner club in which everyone finds joy in cooking. You may be part of a moms ordads group where you all talk about the daily challenges of raising your kids.You have friends who support you.Now consider what your journey toward whole health would be like if you did itin community. Research shows that people getting healthy together lose twice asmuch weight as those who do it alone.6 [part0020_split_002.html#ch2ft6] Thatsuccess dramatically increases when you are connected with others, receivingconstant encouragement to stay focused and motivated toward your goals.Friends and faith set apart The Daniel Plan as a lifestyle that is attainableand maintainable. Diet and nutrition books can give you the nuts and bolts, butonly the mutual support of others can increase your results and sustain them.The wisest man in the world, King Solomon, knew it: “Two are better than one”(Ecclesiastes 4:9).The prophet Daniel understood this principle too. He didn’t make his commitmentto God’s ways and healthy choices by himself. He did it with three friends. Thefour of them — together — were much stronger than any of them could have beenalone.God never meant for you to go through life solo, and that includes your journeytoward better health. Whether you join with a few neighbors, ask parents of yourkids’ friends, start a group at the office, sign up for a church small group, orgather your family, find a few others to start The Daniel Plan with you. Socialconnections are critical. When you are surrounded by people who have the samevalues, goals, and health habits, you are going to progress farther than youcould on your own.For example, when you’re facing a tough situation, who do you turn to? Yourfriends or family, those who know you best, those who will pray for you. Thosepeople step up to support you, check in on you, and serve you. Friends inspireand motivate you.You may not feel like eating healthy foods today, but if the friend you aremeeting for lunch orders a healthy entrée, it will boost your decision to orderthe same. You may not feel like meditating on God’s Word, but if you’re going tochurch or a small group tonight, they will bring you into God’s presence. Thesense of community is why fitness classes and activity groups are so popular —they provide motivation for long-lasting change.A safe group of friends is also a place where God promises to be with you. JesusChrist made an incredible promise about it: “For where two or three gathertogether as my followers, I am there among them” (Matthew 18:20 NLT).Learn more practical tips about getting healthy through the five Essentials.Invite some friends to do The Daniel Plan DVD Study and Study Guide together.

Let’s get healthy together.Reflect and Take a Step …Now it’s time to assess where you are. Everyone has a different starting point,so make this very personal. How is your overall health?

Jesus said, “According to your faith let it be done to you”(Matthew 9:29).We call this the Faith Essential, and it is one of the key differences betweenThe Daniel Plan and other approaches to better health. If you don’t trust God tohelp you get healthy, all you are left with is willpower — and you know fromexperience that willpower doesn’t usually last very long. You get tired of doingwhat’s right, and you give up.The Bible says, “Let’s not get tired of doing what is good. At just the righttime we will reap a harvest of blessing if we don’t give up” (Galatians 6:9NLT). But where do you get the power to keep on going? You get it from God, byasking him to empower you and trusting in him moment by moment.God can make changes in your life that you have never dared to even dream of. Hespecializes in miracle makeovers. “God can do anything, you know — far more thanyou could ever imagine or guess or request in your wildest dreams!” (Ephesians3:20 MSG). That is a power that you cannot find anywhere else.Every year hundreds of self-help books are published. Many of them offerexcellent advice, but most of them lack the most important ingredient:explaining where you get the power to change. They tell you what to do, but donot provide the power to do it. That can be frustrating.For instance, have you ever tried to give up caffeine or sugar? You may succeedfor a few days or a few weeks, but then stress hits, and you wind up needing apick-me-up. Before you know it, you have been drinking two double lattes a dayfor a week straight. Or have you ever tried to forgive someone who has neveradmitted his wrong against you? You put your mind to it and feel at peace for ashort time. Then something triggers your memory, the hurt and anger return, andyou think, I will never be able to forgive that person. You’re right. You can’tdo it without God’s help."},{"pageContent":"[../images/00007.gif]GOD’SPOWER [part0003.html#sec1]PROVERBS 16:9 SAYS, “We plan the way we want to live, but only God makes us ableto live it” (MSG). The reason we eventually fail at all our good resolutions isbecause we don’t depend on God. How many times have you started off a new yearwith a new resolution or a new desire or a new diet, and only a few weeks lateryou’re right back in the same spot? You need willpower, but you also need morethan that for a lifetime change. God says, “Don’t depend on your own power orstrength, but on my Spirit” (Zechariah 4:6 CEV).Think about this: What positive changes in your life could happen if you reliedon God’s unlimited power instead of your limited willpower. The Faith Essentialin The Daniel Plan means that you won’t be doing it on your own. God will helpyou as you rely on him and trust him to give you the ability and power to changewhat you want to change. I explain this in detail in The Purpose Driven Life:Only the Holy Spirit has the power to make the changes God wants to make in ourlives…. We allow Christ to live through us … through the choices we make. Wechoose to do the right thing in situations and then trust God’s Spirit to giveus his power, love, faith, and wisdom to do it. Since God’s Spirit lives insideof us, these things are always available for the asking.1[part0020_split_003.html#ch3ft1]God understands you better than you understand yourself. God knows what makesyou tick — he knows what energizes you, what fatigues you, what makes you sick,and what makes you operate at your best. Doesn’t it make sense to trust him tohelp you?God has been there every moment of your life. He watched you being formed inyour mother’s womb and watched you take your first breath. That means he caresabout every detail, including your health. So why would you attempt to gethealthy — something God clearly desires for you — without relying on him?Jesus said, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible”(Matthew 19:26).The fact is, you will never reach your optimum health without paying attentionto the spiritual dimensions of your life. You have a body, but you are far morethan just a body. Every area of your life affects every other area. Forinstance, it’s hard to be spiritually strong and mentally alert when you areemotionally stressed or physically fatigued. If you are spiritually andemotionally weak or ill, your body cannot perform at its peak. The Daniel Planis about your total health, not just your physical fitness. For this reason, wemust start with your relationship to God — the Creator who designed you, knowsbest how your body was made to operate, and has the power to help you make thechanges that you want to see."},{"pageContent":"YOU NEED GOD TO CHANGEWithout God’s power in your life, you are just running on your own energy. Godnever meant for you to do that. It’s like having a laptop that’s unplugged; thebattery will eventually drain and shut down the computer. Why would you livelike that when God created you for so much more?If you find yourself tired all the time, one reason may be that you are tryingto solve all your problems, fulfill your responsibilities, and make all yourchanges on your own. One clue that this may be happening is when you worry morethan you pray.Think of it this way: You have a small battery inside you. It has a limitedamount of energy. When it depletes, you shut down. At the same time, God offersyou access to his unlimited power plant. All you need to do is plug in — and thepower cord is prayer.Stop trying, and start trusting. The key to a faith-filled life is not in tryingharder. It’s not in psyching yourself up, but in relaxing in God’s grace, so hecan do through you what he desires to do. Philippians 2:12 – 13 says, “Beenergetic in your life of salvation, reverent and sensitive before God. Thatenergy is God’s energy, an energy deep within you” (MSG).God Got Me off the Couch“The weekend that Pastor Rick spoke about the need to be healthy to fulfillGod’s plan for our lives, he challenged those of us who were carrying a fewextra pounds to write down the number of pounds we wanted to lose by Christmasand drop a card in the basket. I wrote down ‘25 pounds,’ hopeful that this wouldfinally be the time it worked. At age 36, I was 288 pounds, probably headedtoward all the health problems that overweight people have.“I had no idea about the journey God was going to take me on. I didn’t feel anydifferent. I didn’t hear God speak to me. I just dropped a card in a basket. Godknew what I did. God had just enrolled me in what I like to call Daniel Plan1.0. When I woke up the next morning, God had taken over my physical life. I hadnot exercised in years. That day, I started small by going for a walk. I had noteaten well — ever. That day, I began to view food differently. My lifelongbattle with my weight changed that day because God grabbed hold of me andchanged my heart. As I write this note, I am 70 pounds lighter than I was sixyears ago.“God got me off the couch six years ago, and He will get the credit when I crossthe finish line of Ironman Arizona. I have swum, biked, and run nearly 20,000miles in the last six years. Along the way, I have said many prayers of thanksthat God has given me the ability and desire to be fit. I know of no greater wayto worship God than to be outside enjoying His creation doing what He created meto do.”— Joel GuerraLater, in the same book, Paul says this: “I have the strength to face allconditions by the power that Christ gives me” (Philippians 4:13 GNT). Noticethat it doesn’t say, “I have the strength for most conditions.” It says allconditions. That includes breaking bad habits and creating healthy ones.Living by faith means you are attempting to do something you cannot do yourself.Anything you can do by your own effort obviously doesn’t require faith. But inthe areas of your life that seem unchangeable — the intractable problems, thepersistent areas of failure, the stubborn bad habits that won’t respond towillpower — these things require a power greater than you possess. Just askanyone who has overcome an addiction through the Celebrate Recovery program.You may have had so many failures at changing the way you eat or exercise orthink or act that the possibility of lasting change feels like an unreachablegoal. Well, to be honest with you, it probably will be — unless you plug intoGod’s power. What is impossible from a human standpoint is easy to God. WithGod, today’s impossibility is tomorrow’s miracle. Are you ready for one?The Bible says, “Without faith it is impossible to please God” (Hebrews 11:6).It will take faith to achieve and maintain the total health that God desires foryou. But it begins with admitting that you don’t have enough power on your ownto become all you’re meant to be. People of faith are those who admit that theycan’t do it on their own. The journey starts with humility. Have you taken thatfirst step yet?For some people, it takes years of frustration and failures before they canadmit that willpower alone doesn’t work to make the deepest changes. We needboth a savior and a manager (or “Lord”) of our lives. Fortunately, God came toearth in Jesus to fulfill that role for us. It’s the reason Christmas is thebiggest holiday on the planet. If we didn’t need a savior, God would not havewasted the time and energy to send one 2,000 years ago."},{"pageContent":"THE LOVE BEHIND THE POWERTo really understand God’s power, you have to know and believe his love for you.God loves you so much that he freely gives his power to work in your life. Godproved his love by sending Jesus to die on the cross for you, even before youknew how much you needed that to be done for you. How great is God’s love foryou?Ephesians 3:17 – 19 says, “Then Christ will make his home in your hearts as youtrust in him. Your roots will grow down into God’s love and keep you strong. Andmay you have the power to understand, as all God’s people should, how wide, howlong, how high, and how deep his love is. May you experience the love of Christ,though it is too great to understand fully” (NLT). This verse reveals that God’slove for us is far greater than our human brains can comprehend. It isfour-dimensional:God’s love is wide enough to be everywhere. There is no place on this planetwhere God’s love isn’t present. There is no place in the universe where God’slove ends. In your life, you will go through many experiences that leave youfeeling sad, discouraged, or alone. But you’re not alone. There will never be amoment in your life when God is not paying attention to you.Faith PowerKalei Kekuna had always struggled with her body image and being self-conscious.For many years she battled with an eating disorder. As she realized God’s powerand love through The Daniel Plan, her focus shifted. “I learned that God lovesme exactly the way that I am, unconditionally. It’s not necessarily about losingweight or looking a certain way. It’s more about making healthy choices thathelp me follow God’s plan for me.“I wake up every morning and say, ‘God, I need help with this. Can you pleasejust be there with me through this day as I make healthy choices and as I chooseto go to the gym versus sitting on my couch, and as I choose the healthy saladversus the donut?’ Just knowing that he’s there the entire time helping methrough this was a huge change for me.”God’s love is long enough to last forever. Human love often withers and dies,because it is conditional. People say, “I love you if …” or “I love you because…,” and when circumstances change, the love evaporates. But God’s love isunconditional, so he will never, never stop loving you. You cannot make God stoploving you, because his love is based on who he is, not what you do. It is basedon his character, not your conduct. This doesn’t mean that God approves or likeseverything you do. He doesn’t. But your sin does not stop him from loving you.It is this unconditional grace of God, not conditional approval, that is thefoundation of The Daniel Plan.God’s love is deep enough to handle anything. No matter what hurt you haveexperienced in the past, what problems you’re going through right now, or whatpain you will face in the future, you can count on God’s love. There may be dayswhen you feel you have hit bottom and could not possibly go any lower. Well,beneath what feels like the bottom is the bedrock of God’s love. Nothing isdeeper than his love for you.God’s love is high enough to overlook my sins. Jesus said, “I did not come tojudge the world, but to save the world” (John 12:47). Have you accepted hisforgiveness and salvation by faith? This is where the Faith Essential begins.You can’t have the power of God in your life without Jesus in your life. It allstarts with a relationship. Not rules. Not regulations. Not rituals. Notreligion. It’s all about a relationship to God through his Son, Jesus.God’s laws and commandments simply show our inability to do what’s right withouthis grace and power in us:Its purpose was to make obvious to everyone that we are, in ourselves, out ofright relationship with God, and therefore to show us the futility of devisingsome religious system for getting by our own efforts what we can only get bywaiting in faith for God to complete his promise. For if any kind ofrule-keeping had power to create life in us, we would certainly have gotten itby this time! (Galatians 3:21 MSG).Resolutions and rules aren’t enough to change the human heart. For example, thegovernment can create a law that makes racism illegal, but no law will transforma bigot into a kind, loving person. That kind of heart transformation requiresthe love of God inside.The beginning of healthy change starts in the heart. If you haven’t yet openedyour heart to God’s love, I urge you to do so right now, before you read anotherchapter. It’s the healthiest choice you will ever make. When you invite Jesus tobe the Savior and Lord (manager) of your life, your past is forgiven, you get anew purpose for living, and you get a home in heaven. In addition, you plug intoGod’s power to change your life.Here is a prayer I would urge you to pray. The words are not as important as theattitude of your heart. If you’re in a place where you can read this prayeraloud, I encourage you to do so. Otherwise, read it quietly to yourself:Dear God, thank you for creating me and loving me so that I can have arelationship with you. Thank you for understanding the frustration I have feltin failing to change things in myself that need changing. I realize that withoutyour help I am powerless to change my deepest habits, hurts, and hang-ups. Ineed a Savior, and I thank you for sending Jesus to die on the cross for me.Jesus, I need your presence, your power, and your purpose in my life. I want toturn from my plans to your plan, and from depending on my power to your power.From now on, I want you to be the Lord and manager of my life. In faith, Ihumbly ask you to forgive my sins and my failures and help me to become what youintended for me to be. For the rest of my life, I want to get to know you betterso I can trust you more. I pray this in your name. Amen.The Bible promises, “You will know … how very great is his power at work in uswho believe. This power … is the same as the mighty strength which he used whenhe raised Christ from death” (Ephesians 1:18 – 20 GNT)."},{"pageContent":"HOW GOD’S POWER WORKSPhilippians 2:12 – 13 explains that lasting change and spiritual growth come asa result of our cooperation with God. We cannot achieve that on our own, but hewill not do it without our cooperation. God supplies the resources and power forchange, but we must make choices to activate those things in our lives. To putit another way: “Continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling,for it is God who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfill his goodpurpose.”Notice two phrases: work out and work in. We are commanded to work out while Godworks in us! That’s the cooperation required for change. What does it mean towork out your salvation? Well, it doesn’t mean “work FOR” your salvation,because salvation cannot be earned. “For it is by grace you have been saved,through faith — and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God — not byworks, so that no one can boast” (Ephesians 2:8 – 9).When you do a physical workout, you develop the muscles God has already givenyou. In these verses the Bible is talking about a spiritual workout — not toearn or gain your salvation, but to grow and develop the new life God has givenyou. So, in your growth and change, God has a part and you have a part. You workout, and God works in!Let’s first look at God’s side of the equation (what he works in), then we willlook at our side of the equation (what we work out).1. God uses his Word to change us. The first tool God uses in changing us is theBible. Through Scripture he teaches us how to live and how to change. SecondTimothy 3:16 – 17 tells us, “All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful toteach us what is true and to make us realize what is wrong in our lives. Itcorrects us when we are wrong and teaches us to do what is right. God uses it toprepare and equip his people to do every good work” (NLT). Another way of sayingthis is that God’s Word shows us (1) the path to walk on, (2) when we havegotten off the path, (3) how to get back on the path, and (4) how to stay on theright path.If you are serious about changing your life in any significant way, you aregoing to have to get into the Bible. You need to read it, study it, memorize it,meditate on it, and apply it. Jesus said, “Then you will know the truth, and thetruth will set you free” (John 8:32). Sometimes learning the truth aboutourselves first makes us miserable — because we want to deny it — butultimately, the truth is liberating.The first element of The Daniel Plan is faith, and the way you grow your faithis by filling your mind with the truth of God’s Word.2. God uses his Spirit to change us. The second resource God uses to change usis his Spirit within us. He doesn’t just offer advice from the sidelines. Whenwe commit ourselves to Christ, the Holy Spirit comes into our lives to empowerand direct us (Romans 8:9 – 11). The Spirit of God gives us his strength to dowhat is right. Second Corinthians 3:18 says, “As the Spirit of the Lord workswithin us, we become more and more like him and reflect his glory even more”(NLT).Note that God’s goal in all the changes we make is that we become more and morelike Christ. God’s number one purpose in our lives is to make us like JesusChrist. The Spirit of God uses the Word of God to make the child of God morelike the Son of God. And what is Jesus like? His life on earth embodied the ninefruits of the Spirit listed in Galatians 5:23 – 24: love, joy, peace, patience,kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.3. God uses circumstances to change us. God’s ideal way to change us is throughthe Bible so that we can find out how we should live and then through hisindwelling Spirit, who enables us to do it. Unfortunately, we can be too oftenstubborn, and we don’t change that easily or quickly. Bad habits get ingrained.So God brings in a third tool to work on us: circumstances! This refers to theproblems and pressures, heartaches and hard times, difficulties and stress thatwe all experience.Problems always get our attention, and the more painful they are, the more wepay attention. C. S. Lewis noted that God whispers to us in our pleasure butshouts to us in our pain. It often takes a painful situation to get ourattention. We all know the truth of Proverbs 20:30: “Sometimes it takes apainful experience to make us change our ways” (GNT). The truth is, we are morelikely to change because we feel the heat than because we see the light! Peoplerarely change until the pain exceeds the fear of change.“Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God” (Romans 10:17 KJV).The interesting thing about how God uses circumstances is that their sourcemakes no difference at all to him. We often bring problems on ourselves by ourown faulty decisions, poor choices, bad judgments, and sins. Other times ourproblems are caused by other people. Sometimes the devil causes things to happento us as he did to a man named Job in the Bible. But God says the source of thecircumstance is irrelevant. He will still use it for your good and your growthif you cooperate with him.Romans 8:28 – 29 is one of the great promises of the Bible: “We know that God isalways at work for the good of everyone who loves him. They are the ones God haschosen for his purpose, and he has always known who his chosen ones would be. Hehad decided to let them become like his own Son” (CEV).Shoe Lesson“I wear shoes for comfort, not for style, and once they get broken in and verycomfortable, I hate to give them up. A few years ago, I had a pair of shoes thatI wore almost every day for over a year. They finally started getting holes inthe bottom of them, but they were so comfortable that I continued to wear them.I just wouldn’t cross my legs when sitting on a platform so the audiencecouldn’t see the holes! I knew I needed to buy new shoes, but I kept putting itoff. Then it rained for an entire week. After four days of soggy socks, I gotmotivated to buy some new shoes.“The first step in change is usually discomfort!”— Pastor WarrenGod promises that he will fit everything — even your setbacks, relapses, andfailures — into his plan and purpose for your life. God loves to turn stumblingblocks into stepping-stones and crucifixions into resurrections.So God shows you how to change through the truth in the Bible, then his Spiritwithin you gives you the power to change. But if you ignore these, God willgladly use circumstances to get your attention. God loves you whatever way youare, but he loves you too much to let you stay that way, and he will usewhatever it takes to help you grow to spiritual maturity."},{"pageContent":"[../images/00007.gif]OUR PARTIN CHANGE [part0003.html#sec2]• IF GOD’S RESPONSIBILITY is to provide life-changing truth, Holy Spirit power,and custom-made experiences to help you change and grow, then what is yourresponsibility for personal change? You must develop three spiritual habits thatwill deepen your faith and develop your spiritual strength."},{"pageContent":"CHOOSE TO FILL YOUR MIND WITH GOD’S WORD EVERY DAYChange is a matter of choice. We can’t just passively sit around doing nothingand expect our lives to get better. We must make healthy choices to use theresources God gives us, and the first healthy choice is to carefully choose whatwe think about.It is often said, “You’re not what you think you are, but what you think about,you are!” Did you get that? If you are going to change your life, you must firstchange the way you think — your perceptions about God, about yourself, aboutlife, about food, about health, and about everything else. Change always beginswith new thinking. We must change the patterns of our mind. (We will look atthis more in chapter 6 on Focus.)The biblical word for personal change is repentance. Most people completelymisunderstand the term. The popular conception of repentance is “Stop sinning!Quit doing bad things!” But the word actually means to change your mind. Itcomes from the Greek word metanoia, which means to change your perspective,think in a different way, make a mental U-turn.2[part0020_split_003.html#ch3ft2] Of course, if you change your mind, yourbehavior will follow, but repentance starts in the mind, not in actions.Choosing to change your perspective and what you think about is your firstresponsibility in getting healthy. The Bible teaches that the way you thinkdetermines the way you feel, and the way you feel determines the way you act. Ifyou want to change any behavior, you must start by challenging your unhealthyperspective on that subject. For example, if you have difficulty controllingyour anger, don’t start with your actions; instead, begin with identifying andchanging the thoughts that prompt you to anger. Romans 12:2 says that we aretransformed by the renewing of our mind. We are not transformed by an act of ourwill, but by repentance — seeing everything from God’s perspective.The Start of My Change“When I repented and accepted God’s gift of salvation by grace, I changed myperspective on a lot of things. I began to think differently about God, good andevil, my past, my present, my future, my relationships, my money, my time, sex,work, play, and everything else.“When you truly repent, you see everything differently. Having a new perspectivechanges your values. As the apostle Paul said, ‘I once thought all those thingswere so very important, but now I consider them worthless because of what Christhas done’ (Philippians 3:7 NLT).”— Pastor WarrenImagine that you have a speedboat with an autopilot that is set to head eastacross a lake, and you suddenly decide that you want to go west, in the exactopposite direction. What would you do?You would have two options: The hardest way would be to grab the steering wheeland physically force the boat to go in the opposite direction than it wasprogrammed to go. By sheer willpower you could force the boat to make a180-degree turn. As long as you held onto the steering wheel, the boat wouldhead in the new direction. But the entire time, you would feel the tension inyour arms and body because you were forcing the autopilot to go against itsprogrammed nature. You would feel stressed and uptight, and eventually you wouldget tired and let go of the steering wheel. At that point, the boat’s autopilotwould immediately return to heading east.The simpler and easier way to change the direction of the boat is to change theautopilot. Then it will naturally head in the direction you want it to go.For a similar reason, this is why diets, quit-smoking plans, and other self-helpefforts based on willpower eventually fail. The entire time you are forcingyourself to change, you are under tension because your old thought patterns areunconsciously telling you to keep doing what you’ve always done. We get tired ofdoing what feels “unnatural” and soon quit exercising, or start smoking again,or return to our bad habits and destructive ways of relating to others. We arevictims of our own autopilots that we have programmed by repetition.Your autopilot is the collection of thoughts and ideas in your mind that youbelieve to be true about yourself and what feels natural. Complete this sentenceten times, and you will have a good idea of what your mental autopilot is: “It’sjust like me to …”The good news is that God can change your mental autopilot far faster than youcan. He specializes in giving you a new mind-set. That new mind-set will changethe way you feel, which will change the way you act. I pointed out earlier thatJesus said the truth sets you free. When you begin to renew your mind with God’sWord, and you replace old lies, false ideas, and misconceptions with the truth,it will set you free from the habits and hang-ups that limit your life. Youractions will naturally begin to align with your new attitudes.This process only happens when we follow God’s instructions. God’s Word gives uslife-changing truth, but we must read it, study it, memorize it, meditate on it,and then practice it. When I use the word meditation, I am talking aboutbiblical meditation as described in the book of Psalms, in Joshua 1:8, and inmany other passages of the Bible.What you think determines the way you feel.What you feel determines the way you act.In many ways, biblical meditation is the exact opposite of eastern or New Agemeditation, which is about emptying your mind and repeating a single word ormantra. In contrast, biblical meditation means taking a verse of the Bible, suchas a promise or a command or a story, and seriously pondering its meaning. Youthink through the implications for and application of God’s truth to your life.This is the kind of meditation that David referred to when he repeatedly said,“I meditate on your Word day and night” (see Psalm 1:2; 119:148, etc.).God makes some amazing promises to those who take the time to seriously thinkabout his Word. Psalm 1:1 – 3 says, “Blessed is the one … whose delight is inthe law of the LORD [the Bible], and who meditates on his law day and night.That person is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruitin season and whose leaf does not wither — whatever they do prospers.” What apromise! Would you like to succeed at everything you do? God makes that promiseto those who meditate on the Bible.Seeing Things DifferentlyAs a pastor, Tom Crick noticed a change in his spiritual life as he started TheDaniel Plan. “If you’re constantly in the Bible, reading and doing your devotiontime, all of a sudden you start to see things there that are really speaking towhat you’re doing in the rest of your life.” Biblical principles that he wouldread before now had practical application to his health. Each day it was as ifthe Scriptures were encouraging him to eat better and boosting his energy. Thenhe started noticing the same thing happening with others who were doing TheDaniel Plan.“Like me, I saw people start to see things in the Scriptures that they didn’tsee before. They could [read] a Scripture and say, ‘This applies to me, and thisis how I’m getting through those tough times when I have a craving. [I sawothers] using God’s Word to help them…. What a difference when you really startto figure out what Scripture means to your life.”So how do you learn to meditate on God’s Word as David did? It’s not hard atall. You focus your attention on a single truth from the Bible and then continueto think about it throughout your day. If you look in a dictionary, you willfind that a synonym for meditation is the word rumination. Rumination is what acow does when it chews its cud. A cow eats some grass, chews it up, thenswallows it. The grass soaks in the stomachs for a while, then the cow burps itup again — with renewed flavor! The cow chews on it a while more and finallyswallows it again. That process is rumination. That cow is extracting everyounce of nourishment it can from that grass as it digests it.In a similar way, biblical meditation is truth digestion. You aren’t puttingyour mind in neutral, but the exact opposite. Biblical meditation means engagingyour mind to probe and consider and analyze what God has said in his Word. Youthink about a Bible verse over and over and over to digest its meaning andapplication to your life.Philippians 4:6 – 7 explains the benefits of meditating on Scripture instead ofworrying: “Don’t worry about anything; instead, pray about everything. Tell Godwhat you need, and thank him for all he has done. Then you will experience God’speace, which exceeds anything we can understand. His peace will guard yourhearts and minds as you live in Christ Jesus” (NLT).Easier Than You ThinkYou may be thinking that biblical meditation is a difficult skill to develop,but you actually already know how to do it if you know how to worry! When youtake a fear or a problem or a negative thought and think about it over and over,that’s called worry. When you take a verse of Scripture and think about it overand over, that’s called biblical meditation.If you are serious about improving your life and your health, you need to investa minimum of 10 minutes a day reading the Bible, meditating on what you’ve read,writing down what you learn, and then talking to God in prayer about it. Thishealthy habit is called “daily quiet time.” If you would like to learn moreabout how to set up and structure a daily quiet time, email me,PastorRick@saddleback.com, and I will gladly send you a booklet I wrote nearlyforty years ago that has helped millions of people begin this habit. You canalso use The Daniel Plan Journal to get started. You will be amazed at how muchit transforms your life."},{"pageContent":"CHOOSE TO DEPEND ON GOD’S SPIRIT EVERY MOMENTEveryone who trusts Christ to save them receives his Holy Spirit in their lives,but few people experience the power of the Holy Spirit because they still dependon their own power instead. Learning to depend on God’s Spirit to guide you,strengthen you, empower you, and use you is the second habit you must developfor spiritual strength.Jesus gives a beautiful illustration of this in John 15. He compares ourspiritual life to a grapevine and its branches. Jesus said, “I am the vine, andyou are the branches. If you stay joined to me, and I stay joined to you, thenyou will produce lots of fruit. But you cannot do anything without me” (John15:5 CEV).No grape branch can produce fruit without staying connected to the main vine,and you cannot produce spiritual fruit while disconnected from God’s Spirit. Thefruitfulness of your life will depend on how dependent you are on the HolySpirit. Attempting to bear fruit (and making positive changes) on your own poweris as foolish as tying apples on the branches of a dead apple tree. From adistance, it might look as if the tree is alive and fruitful, but on closerinspection, people would realize the fruitfulness is fake.Many “religious” people try to fake fruitfulness. They tie on all kinds of goodactivities — such as attending church services, helping the poor, and beingpolite and generous to others — but there really is no spiritual life or powerinside them, because they are not connected to God. All their “spiritual”activities are just for show. When you get close to them, you can see that theydon’t have a personal relationship with Jesus.So how do you develop a vibrant, life-giving relationship to God? The same wayyou develop any other relationship! It takes time, it takes talking, and ittakes trust. To develop a friendship with God, you have to be in continualconversation with him, listening to him through his Word and talking with him inprayer. If you are not talking to God throughout your day, you certainly aren’tdepending on him. Prayer is far more than a once-a-day quiet time or a memorizedblessing before each meal. God wants to have a running conversation with you!What should you pray about? Everything! Here’s a simple rule: If it’s worthworrying about, then it is worth praying about. If you prayed as much as youworry, you would have a whole lot less to worry about.My Daily Conversation“As I work through my day, I often find myself praying after each task, ‘What’snext, Lord?’ And before I walk into any room for a meeting, I always say asilent prayer, asking God to give me wisdom for that meeting. Prayer is the keyto staying connected to God, and staying connected is the key to God’s power andeffectiveness. I recently tweeted this: ‘Much prayer — much power. Little prayer— little power. No prayer — no power.’ If I am not quietly talking to God as Ido my work, I am not depending on him at that moment. And if I don’t talk to Godabout what I’m doing, it shows that I’m doing it on my own power.”— Pastor Warren"},{"pageContent":"CHOOSE TO TRUST GOD IN EVERY CIRCUMSTANCEYou cannot control everything that happens to you. In fact, most of what happensaround you is completely out of your control. But you do have control over twoimportant factors: You control your response, and you control how much youchoose to trust God, regardless of your circumstances.Viktor Frankl, a Jew, was sent to one of the Nazi death camps of World War II.In his powerful classic, Man’s Search for Meaning, Frankl wrote that while hewas a prisoner at Dachau, the guards stripped him of everything he had. Theytook his identity. They took his wife and family. They took his clothes. Theyeven took his wedding ring. But, he said, there was one thing that no one couldtake from him: his freedom to choose his response and attitude. He wrote, “Theyoffer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing:the last of the human freedoms — to choose one’s attitude in a given set ofcircumstances, to choose one’s own way.”3 [part0020_split_003.html#ch3ft3] Noguards could take that away from Viktor Frankl. It was his choice.None of us knows what will happen in the future, but we can control how we reactand respond. We choose whether something will make us bitter or better. God gaveus that freedom, and he is watching how we respond to events that don’t go ourway. What matters in life is not so much what happens to us, but what happens inus.One of the most famous examples of that principle is the story of Joseph in theOld Testament. Joseph was betrayed by his jealous older brothers and sold intoslavery. Years later, when they met again, the brothers feared retaliation, butJoseph said, “You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good” (Genesis50:20). That is true for you too. Over your lifetime you will encounter peoplewho intend to hurt you. But God’s purpose for your life is greater than anyproblem you face, and he intends to use it for good, as Romans 8:28 promises.Anyone can bring good out of good, but God can bring good out of bad — if youwill trust him in every circumstance.Sometimes circumstances that look as if they are meant to destroy us end upbeing situations that develop us. That is why James 1:2 – 4 says, “When troublescome your way, consider it an opportunity for great joy. For you know that whenyour faith is tested, your endurance has a chance to grow. So let it grow, forwhen your endurance is fully developed, you will be perfect and complete,needing nothing” (NLT).Circumstances are the third tool God uses to change us, grow us, and make usmore like Christ. Knowing this keeps us from becoming resentful or bitter.Romans 5:3 – 4 says, “We also have joy with our troubles, because we know thatthese troubles produce patience. And patience produces character, and characterproduces hope” (NCV).This has been God’s plan from the very beginning. When God decided to createhuman beings, he also decided to make us in his own image (Genesis 1:27). Whatdoes that mean? Not that we will become gods (we won’t), but that we will becomegodly, having the same moral qualities of love, kindness, goodness, justice, andintegrity that God has. He wants us to develop Christ-like character, which ismore important than our appearance, our achievements, or our acquisitions inlife.The reason why your character is so important is that you are going to take itto heaven. You are not taking your career to heaven. You won’t take your car orclothes or any of the material things you have collected on earth. But you aretaking your character! So ultimately, it is the most important thing you candevelop on earth. The five Essentials of The Daniel Plan — Faith, Food, Fitness,Friends, and Focus — will do far more than help you get healthier physically.They will help you deepen your faith and develop your character, which, in thelong run, will matter even more than how you feel here and now. Christ-likecharacter will reap eternal rewards that you will enjoy forever.We want you to remember a very important truth: God is not waiting for you toget physically healthy or spiritually mature before he starts loving you orenjoying you. He loves you right now, and he will be cheering you on at everystage of your growth and development. He is not waiting for you to cross thefinish line first. He is smiling at you as you run the race.You might be thinking, But what if I happen to stumble or fall in the race? Godwill still love you. Imagine this scene: If parents are watching their child runin a race at school and the child stumbles and falls, what do loving parents do?They cheer even more loudly. They don’t criticize or belittle the child. Theyyell, “I know you can do it! Get up! I believe in you! Don’t be discouraged!It’s just a minor setback! Keep going! I know you can make it to the finishline!”That is what God is saying to you right now. “I’m proud of you for trying, andI’m going to be helping you. I will supply the power you need if you will spendtime with me reading my Word every day, if you will depend on my Spirit insideyou every moment, and if you will trust me to use every circumstance in yourlife for your good and growth.”So this is your moment to grasp God’s love and power. The moment you get aclearer view and stronger foundation of faith. The moment when God starts tochange you from the inside out.Reflect and Take a Step …Faith is the foundation of The Daniel Plan, and learning to rely on God’s poweris the key to lasting change. Don’t be afraid to share everything with God. Heis waiting to hear from you. Start with this simple prayer:“Father, I want to do what I need to get healthy and glorify you. I know I can’tdo this on my own. I’ve tried and I’ve failed, and I’m nervous that I will failagain. I’m willing to do my part, Lord, and I’m going to faithfully trust thatyou are working to help me succeed. I’m learning that you want me to succeedmore than I do. Help me see your hand in this quickly, and keep me encouraged asI work toward better health. Amen.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4[../images/00008.gif]FOOD [part0003.html#ch4]So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God(1 Corinthians 10:31).Most Americans are confused about food. Should you eat like a caveman and stickto meat, vegetables, and fruit and avoid all grains and dairy? Or eat onlyfruits, vegetables, and herbs like a gorilla? Low-carb or low-fat? What aboutfood labels and calorie counts? What about all the health claims on the label?Or low-calorie or diet foods? What is the right diet?Can we make sense of it all? It is not very easy, because the food and dietindustry makes billions — in fact, more than $1 trillion — by keeping youguessing. It is good for them, but bad for you.When you provide the conditions for a thriving human being and you remove theimpediments to health, disease often simply goes away as a side effect. When youfocus on health, healing and weight loss happen automatically. That is exactlywhat happens in The Daniel Plan.The Daniel Plan was not designed as a weight-loss program. In fact, we neverfocused on weight, but on health. How do you create a healthy human? When westarted the program at Saddleback Church, we designed it as a wellness program,combining the Essentials of faith, food, fitness, focus, and friends into apowerful potion of renewal and healing. Not only did the original participantslose more than 250,000 pounds in the first year, but they also reportedimprovement or resolution of chronic symptoms and diseases, including asthma,allergies, headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, acid reflux, autoimmunediseases, depression, heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, acne and skinissues such as eczema and psoriasis, brain fog, fatigue, and insomnia. Theyreported fuller engagement with their families, friends, church, and community,being better able to serve a higher purpose. Many lost well over 100 pounds andmany type 2 diabetics got off insulin and multiple medications. We didn’t haveto treat all their diseases individually. Most chronic diseases and symptomsarise from the same common causes: imbalances in the five core Essentials.Have you ever stopped to think about what food is, why we eat it, and what itdoes to us when we eat it? The link between food and our well-being is soimmediate, so profound and direct, yet most of us have no idea that how we feelis linked to what we eat, that our various complaints and conditions and moodsand energy (or lack of it) are driven by the fuel we put into our body.Doctors rarely ask the simple question, “How do you create a healthy human?”Veterinarians study nutrition extensively. How do you get a horse to win theKentucky Derby? You learn how to optimize its metabolism and health by thequality of the food you feed it.That is what we want for all of you — to optimize your health. We want you tolove, enjoy, and celebrate food and use it to enrich and enliven you. Food cantransform your health within a few weeks through the simple principles of TheDaniel Plan.The Daniel Plan is a way of life, or as some have called it, a health-style thattakes the guessing out of eating and cooking. You can actually eat anythingbased on one rule: Eat real, whole food. Eat a colorful variety of real, wholefoods from real ingredients that you can make yourself — or that are made byanother human nearby.If you want French fries, then make them yourself from whole potatoes andunrefined, unprocessed oil. Chances are you won’t eat them every day, but youwill enjoy them more and they will be much better for you.“Let food be thy medicine, and medicine be thy food.”— Hippocrates, the ancient Greek physicianSimple, real, fresh, delicious, nutrient-packed foods that are easy to cook,foods that come from a farmer’s field rather than a factory, food that traveledthe shortest distance from the field to your fork — that is what we should eat.That’s it — you can skip to the next chapter.Well, maybe not yet. Unfortunately, most of us never learned what real food is,so just in case, we are going to lay it out for you in this chapter: What foodis, what I should avoid, how I find the good stuff, and how I make my own meals."},{"pageContent":"[../images/00009.gif]FOODS THAT HEAL:SO WHAT SHOULD WE EAT? [part0003.html#sec3]WHAT IS FOOD? NOURISHMENT? A source of energy or calories? A delightfulpleasure?Yes, it can be all of those things. But as a doctor who has dedicated his careerto studying how food affects the body and contributes to or prevents disease,Dr. Hyman has a slightly different take on food: Food is medicine.Food has the power to heal us. It is the most potent tool we have to helpprevent and treat many of our chronic diseases — including diabetes and obesity.Truly, what you put on your fork dictates whether you are sick or well, slim orfat, depleted or energized.How does food do all this? Through the groundbreaking science known asnutrigenomics. The molecules in your food do much more than provide fuel foryour body. They provide instructions that tell every cell in your body what todo every moment. More than 95 percent of chronic illness is not related to yourgenes, but to what those genes are exposed to in your lifetime. We call that theexposome.The exposome is the sum of everything you eat, breathe, drink, think, and feel,plus the toxins in our environment and even the 100 trillion bacteria that liveinside your gut. This is good news because it means that you have almostcomplete control over your health. And the most important thing you do everysingle day to interact with your genes is eat.So the next time you put something on your fork, imagine what your genes mightfeel. Would they like that extra large soda or cheesy corn chips, or would theyprefer some sweet blueberries or sautéed broccoli with garlic and olive oil?Food is medicine. It is the most powerful tool we have to combat chronicdisease.We want to teach you how to treat your body with respect and kindness. We willteach you what foods to choose to nourish yourself and which ones to avoid. Mostof all, we will show you how to create a nurturing, peaceful relationship withfood and cooking that will automatically lead to weight loss, radiant health,and an overall sense of well-being.The Scriptures teach us how to live and love fully. But somehow we skip over theparts that instruct us to honor the vessel of the Holy Spirit, our body. Beingin a food coma from eating sugar and junk food, having your brain chemistryhijacked by hyper-processed, hyper-palatable, hyper-addictive foods prevents youfrom fully inhabiting your body and your mind. If the food you are eating ismaking you sick and unfocused and makes you so sluggish that if you happen toget the urge to exercise you instead lie down until it goes away, living a fullyengaged and God-honoring life is difficult.Real food has the power to give you your life back and more fully engage in thepurpose for your life. The reason to do it is not to fit in your jeans or lookgood in a dress, but to be awake to the beauty and miracle of life, to be ableto live with purpose, to love, serve, connect, and celebrate the gifts God hasgiven you.If you nourish your body with high-quality ingredients from real food, not onlywill you increase your energy, lose weight, and reverse many chronic illnesses,but you will also feel lighter and more motivated to exercise, your mood willlift, and your brain will have better clarity, allowing you to clear out thedebris in the way of your relationships with others and God.So what do we mean by “real” food? Anything that is whole, fresh, andunprocessed. Stuff that your great-grandmother would recognize as food. Achicken, a vegetable, a bean, a nut, a grain, a fruit, an egg. Everything elseis fake food that depletes energy and health. Real food heals. Real foodnourishes.“Food is our common ground, a universal experience.”— James BeardChanging Control“My biggest health achievement so far has been to lose over 150 pounds,” ChloeSeals says. “I didn’t know it at the time, but my doctor told me I wasconsidered diabetic in 2010 when I weighed 277 pounds. Changing my eating habitsand making healthier food choices has resulted in completely eliminatingdiabetes. I feel like I’ve gained my life back, and I feel more in control overwhat I eat instead of comfort and the lure of foods controlling me.“I have learned to enjoy a variety of foods that I prepare for myself as well asmy two kids. I feel better about myself instead of always feelingself-conscious. My greatest motivation comes from my kids and wanting to behealthy as long as I can so I can be there for them.”The good news is that the list of real food is short, easy to understand, andeasy to identify. Unfortunately, though, many of us are not well acquainted withreal food. We have outsourced our cooking to the food industry for packaged,processed, and prepared convenience foods and to fast-food restaurants andconvenience stores. But there is nothing convenient about feeling disconnected,sluggish, slothful, foggy, or depressed or having the diseases you get andmedications you have to take when you fuel up with “convenient food.”Let’s debunk one myth up front. We have been led to believe that eating well isexpensive and that cooking your own food takes too much time. The facts arequite different. The research shows that you can eat well and in less time forless money than buying processed foods.1 [part0020_split_004.html#ch4ft1] With afew simple tricks, you can shop well, cook simply, and eat better for less inthe same time it takes to hit a fast-food drive-through window and eat yourmeal. More importantly, real food tastes better and is more nourishing andsatisfying. It can even eliminate your cravings.The Daniel Plan focuses on the core food groups of healthy carbs, healthy fats,healthy protein, healing spices, drinks, and super foods. And The Daniel Plangives an easy guideline to use for any meal: * 50 percent non-starchy veggies * 25 percent healthy animal or vegetable proteins * 25 percent healthy starch or whole grains * Side of low-glycemic fruit * Drink — water or herbal teas[../images/00010.gif]TOP 10 CHOICES IN EACH FOOD GROUP to Get You StartedNON-STARCHY VEGGIESAsparagusBell peppersBroccoliCauliflowerCollard greensCucumbersGreen beansKaleSpinachZucchiniPROTEINBeansBeefChickenEggsHalibutLentilsNutsSalmonSeedsTurkeySTARCH OR GRAINBeetsBrown or black riceCarrotsBuckwheatGreen peasCornQuinoaSweet potatoesTurnipsWinter squashLOW-GLYCEMIC FRUITApplesBlackberriesBlueberriesGogi berriesGrapefruitPlumsKiwiNectarinesPeachesRaspberries"},{"pageContent":"THE GOOD CARBSThe Daniel Plan is a high-carb diet. In fact, carbs are the single mostimportant food you can eat for long-term weight loss and health. Does this meanload up on cereal, bread, rice, pasta, cookies, cakes, and donuts? Sorry, no.All plant foods contain carbohydrates. You want the right carbs: unrefined,unprocessed carbs, otherwise known as vegetables and fruits. Whole grains andbeans are also carbs, but since they are a little more starchy should be eatenin moderation.Unfortunately, less than 10 percent of Americans eat the recommended five tonine servings of fruits and vegetables a day. (A serving is generally half a cupor one piece of fruit.) Yet scientific research overwhelmingly tells us that thesingle most important thing we can do for our health is to eat more vegetablesand fruits. In fact, it is about the only thing that every nutritionalphilosophy agrees upon.Plant foods contain a rich combination of blood-sugar-balancing,anti-inflammatory, detoxifying compounds called phytonutrients. Inflammation hasbeen linked to most of the diseases of aging, including heart attacks, diabetes,cancer, and dementia. In fact, being overweight is a chronic inflammatory state.Vegetables and fruits contain nature’s most powerful anti-inflammatories.Plant foods are the main source of vitamins and minerals in your diet. Thesevitamins and minerals run every chemical reaction in your body; they are thegrease that lubricates the wheels of your metabolism. The fiber in plant foodsis necessary to keep your digestive system healthy, feed the good bacteria thatkeep inflammation down, and help balance blood sugar. Most Americans get 8 to 12grams or less, while we really need 30 to 50 grams of fiber per day.The good news is that you get unlimited refills on vegetables. Think “binge onbroccoli.” (Okay, so broccoli may not sound that exciting, but stick with us!)When thinking about dinner, think about cooking two or three different kinds ofvegetables or trying some raw varieties with a delicious dip, such as hummus orhomemade salsa. (See chapter 10 for recipes.) When eating out, order two orthree sides of vegetables and skip the bread and pasta, which are proven to packon the pounds and cause diabetes.“Then God said, ‘I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the wholeearth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours forfood’ “ (Genesis 1:29).Boost Your FiberAdd the following to your diet to increase your fiber: * Whole grains such as quinoa or brown rice * Vegetables, vegetables, vegetables * Flax seeds (grind them and sprinkle on salads or fruit) * Legumes — also known as beans and peasIn fact, these plant foods should make up 50 percent of your diet. It’s a bigchange for most people, but the closer you can come to upsizing the veggies andcomplementing with fruits, the more you will improve your health (and the healthof the planet to boot).When you get used to real foods, then we encourage you to focus on one simpleprinciple: Focus on foods that don’t raise your blood sugar or don’t raise itquickly. This concept is called the Glycemic Index or glycemic load of foods.For example, white bread is a carb that raises your blood sugar more and fasterthan even table sugar, while crunchy green veggies barely make a dent in yoursugar levels. Both are carbs, but act very differently calorie for calorie."},{"pageContent":"THE GLYCEMIC INDEXThe Glycemic Index (GI) is a nutritional tool to identify how carbohydratesaffect our blood sugar levels. Carbs with a low GI (55 or less) don’t make ourblood sugar levels rise too high, but provide sustained energy. Carbohydrateswith a high GI (70 or more) cause our blood sugar levels to rise higher for alonger period. One of the best strategies for keeping blood sugar low is toincorporate low GI foods into your daily eating plan. These are some of thehealth benefits: * Helping you avoid getting into a food emergency because you feel satisfied * Keeping your insulin levels low, which helps burn fat easier * Helping you to release body fat and keep lean muscle tissue * Reducing your triglycerides, total and bad (LDL) cholesterol * Increasing your levels of good (HDL) cholesterol * Lessening your risk of developing type 2 diabetes * Limiting your risk of developing cardiovascular disease * Sustaining your energy levels longer, ultimately enhancing your mental and physical performanceTop 10 Tips for Low-Glycemic Eating 1. Follow The Daniel Plan plate. 2. Fill half your plate with colorful vegetables. 3. Limit starchy vegetables such as potatoes, winter squash, or cooked beets (only ¼ of your plate). 4. Limit (or eliminate) sugar and flour products. 5. Eat protein for breakfast such as a whole food protein shake (see page 317 for a recipe), whole eggs, or an omelet, or have dinner for breakfast. Or incorporate more nuts and seeds into breakfast. 6. Add good fats to your diet such as extra-virgin olive oil, avocados, nuts and seeds, and extra-virgin coconut butter. 7. Replace starchy pasta choices with some gluten-free grains such as buckwheat, black or brown rice, or quinoa. 8. Eat beans such as lentils or chickpeas. 9. Choose a lean protein source (animal or plant) at every meal. 10. Carry snacks such as nuts and veggies with hummus to avoid a food emergency.Breakfast Swap: Choose a whole grain breakfast, such as steel-cut oats withalmonds and berries, instead of your favorite boxed cereal."},{"pageContent":"THE CALORIE MYTHNow is the time for us to blow up the calorie myth. Here’s the myth: Allcalories are created equal.The lesson we have all learned is that calories are a form of energy, andaccording to the laws of physics, a calorie is a calorie — the amount of energyrequired to raise the temperature of one liter of water by one degreecentigrade. This law is true for physics, but all bets are off when you putbiology in the mix. If it was all about “eat less, exercise more,” we would alldo it and be skinny and fit. But there are different kinds of calories: healingcalories and disease-causing calories. Let us explain.Let’s compare a 20-ounce soda with 240 calories to the equivalent number ofcalories from broccoli (which is about 7.5 cups). The soda has no fiber and novitamins or minerals, but has 15 teaspoons of sugar in the form of high fructosecorn syrup, caffeine, and phosphoric acid — which causes osteoporosis. The sugarin the soda spikes your insulin, causes a fatty liver, increases triglycerides,lowers good cholesterol, raises bad cholesterol, increases cortisol (the stresshormone), and causes diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and dementia.The broccoli (if you could actually eat the 7.5 cups!) has the same number ofcalories but about ½ teaspoon natural sugar and 35 grams fiber and is rich invitamins and minerals, including folate and magnesium. Broccoli also containspowerful phytonutrients, which are healing plant compounds that help reduce yourrisk of cancer and boost your detoxification capacity. And broccoli has verylittle ability to raise your blood sugar. In fact, when it enters your body, thebroccoli has the exact opposite effect of the soda. It creates health ratherthan destroys it. Same calories — very different results.Clearly, all calories are not the same. It is a matter of quality. So we want tohelp you focus on becoming a “qualitarian.”"},{"pageContent":"LOW-GLYCEMIC VEGETABLESLow-glycemic vegetables are your new best friends. Go ahead and fill up on theselife-giving plants. They should make up 50 percent of your plate. Keep a list ofthese as you walk through your grocery store, which is your new FARMacy, whereyou will find the best medicine for body and soul. Have two or three veggiedishes at dinner. Make a salad with arugula, artichokes, and avocados, and havea side of sautéed zucchini with garlic and olive oil and some roasted mushrooms.Go crazy!Try some unusual and rare vegetables; they have much higher levels of nutrientsand healing phytochemicals than the most common domesticated varieties.Choose heirloom varieties when possible. Heirloom vegetables are uniquevarieties that predate all the major plant breeding of the last hundred years.For example: Cherokee purple tomatoes, Touchon carrots, or Black-seeded Simpsonlettuce. They pack a more nutrient dense punch. You can often find them atfarmer’s markets or community-supported agriculture (CSA) programs.MushroomsMost of us are familiar with white button mushrooms and often use them raw insalads. Don’t do that. They contain cancer-causing toxins when eaten raw. Butthere are other wonderful members of the mushroom family that have powerfulanti-inflammatory, cancer preventing, and immune boosting properties. They arealso full of minerals and are the best (and one of the only) vegetable sourcesof vitamin D. Try different and unique mushrooms. They have wonderful texturesand flavors. Dr. Hyman puts them in a pan, drizzles with olive oil, garlic, andsalt, and roasts them. They are amazing!Try these mushrooms: oyster, porcini, shitake, maitake, and enoki. You can getthese from Asian grocers and in many supermarkets today.The one type of vegetable you can never get enough of is the cruciferousvegetable family, which includes kale, collards, broccolini, cabbage, Brusselssprouts, cauliflower, and bok choy. They contain powerful detoxifying chemicalscalled glucosinolates that prevent cancer and support your health. We recommenda cup or two every day.Sea VegetablesBefore you think this is too weird, you have probably already tried seaweed insushi rolls. It’s that black wrapping around the rice. Seaweed is one of themost nutrient dense, mineral rich, anti-cancer foods on the planet. If you havenever tried sea vegetables, be adventurous. Try Seasnax, yummy, crunchy flavorednori snacks. You can add seaweeds such as kombu, arame, and wakame to soups andstews.Look for them in the international or ethnic foods aisle of the grocery store;for more varieties check an Asian grocery or health food store.

There is an entire class of compounds (phytonutrients) inour plant foods that work hard to reduce inflammation; rid our bodies of toxins;improve the way our bodies metabolize food and boost calorie burning; optimizeimmune function; prevent cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and dementia; andcontain powerful antioxidants that literally prevent our bodies from rusting andaging too fast.Detoxifying foods: Cruciferous vegetables are the super detoxification foods.Other natural detoxifiers are green tea, watercress, dandelion greens, cilantro,artichokes, garlic, citrus peels, pomegranate, and even unsweetened cocoa powder(not the sugary hot chocolate kind).For anti-inflammatory foods, think dark berries and cherries. Eat dark greenleafy vegetables and orange sweet potatoes to cut down on inflammation. Curcuminis found in the yellow spice called turmeric and is used in curries andmustards. It is nature’s ibuprofen and the most powerful anti-inflammatory. Addit to stir fries or when you cook grains or make curries.The Rainbow of FoodEat from the rainbow of colors (and no, we don’t mean Skittles) in the plantworld, and you will be covering all the phytonutrient bases. Think reds, orange,yellows, greens, purple, blue — the darker and deeper the colors, the betterthey are for you.Eat at least five to nine servings a day from the rainbow. Explore yoursupermarket and farmer’s market to find unique and rare or heirloom vegetables.They pack more phytonutrient power in every bite.Antioxidant-rich foods: These foods prevent aging and promote overall health.They are found in dark berries, black rice, beets, and pomegranates; orange andyellow vegetables such as winter squash; dark green leafy vegetables such askale, collards, and spinach; and resveratrol-containing fruits such as purplegrapes, blueberries, cranberries, and cherries.Hormone-balancing foods: Foods such as miso, tempeh, and tofu (all of which arewhole soy foods) and ground flax seeds help balance hormones and prevent cancer.Many foods high in phytonutrients are also considered super foods. These arefoods richest in high-quality protein, good fats, vitamins, and minerals. Theseare among the most health-promoting of all the foods you can eat. Visit TheDaniel Plan website (danielplan.com) for a list of super foods."},{"pageContent":"GRAINSWhole grains can be part of a healthy diet, but in moderation. For some, grainscan trigger spikes in blood sugar. The key is the amount and what you eat themwith. The ideal serving size for grains is ½ cup for men and ⅓ cup for women.You may tolerate more if you are a marathon runner, but for the average Joe orJoanna, the extra sugar can trigger insulin, weight gain, and inflammation.Give Us Our Daily BreadJesus taught his disciples to pray, “Give us this day our daily bread.” Eatingbread is almost a religious commandment. Unfortunately, the bread we eat todayis not the bread of biblical grains. Most bread now is highly processed and madefrom a different genetic strain of wheat that is higher in starch and containsgluten, a known inflammatory agent. (We will cover this more on page 122.)Have you ever found yourself overeating from the bread basket? Processed orrefined grains have all the fiber and nutrients stripped out of them, so theyact just like sugar in your body. If something is made from flour (whether withgluten or gluten free), start thinking of it as a super sugar. If you want tolose weight or have known inflammatory health problems, it is best to eliminateit for a while or keep your intake to a minimum.Here are a few tips to enjoy better quality bread: * If you are not gluten sensitive (see page 119), then the best bread is whole kernel German rye bread (also made with flax and spelt), made from whole kernel grain, not whole grain flour. It is great toasted with anything on top. * If you want regular flour bread, be sure that it contains no white flour (also labeled as “wheat flour”) and is made from coarse whole grain flour, with extra protein and fiber ingredients such as nuts and seeds. * Try sprouted whole grain breads such as Ezekiel 4:9 Whole Grain Sprouted Flax bread by Food for Life, if you are already healthy and fit. * Change the way you think of bread. Think of it as a treat, to be used sparingly, ideally no more than one slice a day. * Minimize flour-containing foods such as waffles, muffins, donuts, pretzels, and crackers. * Try some of the non-flour crackers made from seeds and nuts.The key is to eat only whole grains, not processed in any way. That means youbuy them in their original form, such as oats, wheat berries, and even popcorn.Many packaged foods say “whole grains,” but it is often a little whole grainflour mixed into white flour, sugary cereals, or other products. The ingredientlist will tell you what’s really in there.If you have diabetes or pre-diabetes, you may not even be able to toleratesignificant amounts of whole grains in your diet until you correct theunderlying metabolic imbalances. So the best grains are the gluten-free grains.Trylow-glycemic grains such as black rice (also known as the emperor’s rice),brown rice, red rice, buckwheat, and quinoa. Pastas cooked al dente (cooked justenough to retain some firm texture) are lower glycemic, but flour productsshould be considered a special treat that you only eat occasionally."},{"pageContent":"FRUITFruit is a wonderful source of powerful anti-inflammatory, antioxidantphytonutrient compounds. The darker and richer the colors, the more unique andwonderful the fruits, the more power-packed nutrition they contain. We focus onthe lower sugar fruits such as berries and apples and pears and use the othersas treats in smaller quantities. The average serving size is ½ cup or one pieceof fruit. (If you are overweight or have blood sugar issues, then you want to becareful with fruit intake and limit it to one serving a day.) There are plentyof low-glycemic fruits. * Dark berries. Blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries are rich in phytonutrients. You can get frozen organic versions and put them in shakes or even make great frozen desserts by putting them in the blender. * Stone fruit. Plums, peaches, nectarines, cherries, and their variants are known as “stone fruit.” They are healthy and full of fiber and healing chemicals and not too high in sugar. * Pomegranates, kiwis, papayas, and mangos are also wonderful healing fruits. * Citrus fruits such as grapefruit, oranges, lemons, and limes are great, but it’s best to stay away from juices. They often have as much sugar as soda. (We will explain why when we talk about sugars.)Limit high-sugar fruits. Melons, pineapple, and grapes are wholesome, but it’sbest to eat them in small quantities because of their high glycemic index. Also,dried fruit such as apricots, raisins, and currants are the highest in sugar, souse them sparingly. Many dried fruits also contain added sugar. Have one or twofigs or dates or 2 tablespoons of raisins or currants as a treat, or mix a smallamount with nuts and seeds to make your own trail mix."},{"pageContent":"POWER UP WITH PROTEINThe secret to optimal health, fewer cravings, balanced blood sugar, and losingweight is getting high-quality protein in every meal. But where should you getyour protein? Americans have come to equate protein with beef, pork, or chicken,and meat is still the centerpiece of most dinner plates at home and inrestaurants. The whole debate over veganism or paleo diets confuses people evenmore.Science on both sides backs up the health claims. Some studies show that toomuch animal protein and dairy can cause heart disease and cancer. However, ifyou compare Spam or deli meats or even feed-lot factory-farmed beef to wild andlean buffalo/bison, grass-fed beef, or cage-free chicken, the effects are quitedifferent.The ironic thing is that vegan and paleo diets are closer to each other than thestandard American diet full of sugar, trans fats, and processed foods. Vegan andpaleo diets both emphasize whole foods, with lots of fruits and veggies, nuts,and seeds. Some people thrive on vegan diets, and some do poorly. Some feelweighed down by meat. We are all biochemically, metabolically, and geneticallyquite different.Each of us has to listen to our own body and honor its unique-nesses. The bodynever makes a mistake. When we mindlessly put food in our mouths withoutconsidering if it is offering our body nutrition or healing, we compound ourhealth issues. So we have to learn what our bodies thrive on and buy the bestquality of it.Bottom line: You want to include good quality protein with every meal, and itshould make up about 25 percent of your plate or meal. A serving size is 4 to 6ounces or about the size of your palm.What follows are the best sources of protein in your diet."},{"pageContent":"1. HEALTHY ANIMAL PRODUCTSIf you enjoy animal proteins, whenever possible you want to choose the animalproducts that have the most to contribute to your health (and the least impacton the planet). You can’t always find the cleanest or lowest impact, mosthumanely raised animal protein sources, but following these guidelines willshift the food production system, improve your health, and reduce negativeenvironmental impact.Pick the right poultry. Choose organic, grass-fed, free-range, and hormone-,antibiotic-, and pesticide-free poultry whenever you can. Chicken and turkey aregood inexpensive sources of protein. A roast chicken dinner is cheaper than atrip to a fast-food joint for a family of four. Buy higher quality poultry; itshould be available at your mainstream grocers. Why not even try ground turkeyfor your burgers once in a while? For turkey burger recipes, go todanielplan.com or The Daniel Plan Cookbook.Enjoy omega 3 eggs or free-range eggs. Eggs were given a bad rap for a longtime. Omega 3 eggs contain DHA, the ultimate omega 3 fat and brain food. Eggs donot raise your cholesterol; they do just the opposite. Egg yolks also containcholine and B vitamins. Stick with whole eggs, not egg whites.Go fish. Fish is one of the best sources of protein and omega 3 fats. However,because of the contamination of our oceans and farmed fisheries, finding safefish is not as easy as it used to be. The best fish to eat are wild-caught andsmaller, toxin-free fish such as sardines, tilapia, crawfish, and freshwatertrout. Think small fish. If the whole fish can fit in your frying pan, it isprobably safe to eat. It is best to stay away from fish with high mercurylevels. For a handy wallet card listing fish with the lowest mercury content, goto nrdc.org/health/effects/mercury/walletcard.PDF.Safe Fish and MeatsDownload the app or reference card from seafoodwatch.org, or visit cleanfish.comto find fish companies and types of fish that are sustainably farmed andharvested (not overfished) and low in toxins.See the Environmental Working Group’s Meat Eater’s Guide atewg.org/meateatersguide to help you pick the best meat sources for you and theplanet.Get shelled. Shrimp and scallops are also healthy forms of seafood low in toxinsand high in good quality protein and minerals. Oysters are among the highestsources of zinc.Downsize your meat. Choose quality over quantity. Small amounts of lean,organic, grass-fed, and hormone- and antibiotic-free lamb or beef can be a partof a healthy diet. You can even think about buying and freezing a whole animalwith your extended family, friends, or church group. Consider trying leaner,more sustainably raised or wild animal products such as bison or buffalo orvenison. Eat red meat no more than once or twice a week and no more than 4 to 6ounces per serving. There are good sources at local health food stores, and manygrocery stores are starting to carry better options.Pork is the least healthy meat. Excess meat consumption has been associated withcancer, heart disease, and diabetes. Avoid charred or blackened meat, whichcauses cancer because overgrilling creates carcinogens."},{"pageContent":"2. VEGETARIAN SOURCES OF PROTEINGo nuts. Nuts can be part of your protein intake. They are a wonderful source ofprotein, fiber, minerals, and good fats that satisfy your appetite and reducethe risk of diabetes and heart disease. Nut butters are a great snack. Keep bulknuts tightly sealed in the pantry or fridge. Eat walnuts, almonds, pecans, andmacadamia nuts. Watch portion sizes. A serving is a handful or about 10 – 12nuts. Buy raw or lightly toasted, unsalted nuts. Avoid nuts fried or cooked inoils.Seed your health. Seeds are easy to add to salads, bean or grain dishes, andsmoothies, or just enjoy a handful. Try pumpkin, sunflower, and sesame seeds, oradd unusual seeds to your diet such as black sesame seeds. (Sprinkle them oneggs or into a stir fry.) Experiment with hemp, chia, and flax seeds; they arerich in omega 3 fats, minerals, and fiber.Enjoy soy. This is a controversial topic, and many are worried about the harmfuleffects of soybeans on our health. But the science is straightforward. Stickwith traditional whole soy products. These include tempeh, tofu, miso, andnatto. They are broken down or fermented to make them easily digestible. Modernindustrial soy products, extracted from soybeans in the process of creatingsoybean oil (which is then used to make trans fats), cause cancer and should beavoided. More than 90 percent of soy in the typical American diet is hidden andmade from genetically modified or industrially refined soybeans. So avoidprocessed soy products, such as those found in deli-meat replacements, soycheese, or meal-replacement bars.BeansBaked beans full of sugar being served as a side to a processed hot dog is howmost of us first “tasted” beans. But beans are a wonderful, inexpensive,power-packed source of protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals. They don’t spikeblood sugar for most people, and some simple strategies can make them easier todigest. Buy canned precooked beans (preferably in BPA-free cans), or buy them inbulk and cook them yourself. If you cook them, add a piece of kombu (a seaweed),fennel seeds, or fresh ginger slices to the pot while the beans boil to improvedigestibility. You can also take digestive enzymes to help your body digest thebeans.Try different varieties, such as chickpeas, adzuki, Anasazi, mung, kidney,black, or pinto beans, in soups, stews, and in salads. Lentils cook quickly andcome in many varieties, including French, red, and regular.Bulk up on beans or legumes. You can prepare these with a little planning bysoaking them overnight and cooking in batches. This is the cheapest bang foryour buck. Or you can buy canned beans in toxin-free (bisphenol A-free, orBPA-free) cans for a quick meal or addition to salads, soups, or stews."},{"pageContent":"HEALING FATSOn The Daniel Plan you get to enjoy many healthful fats. We used to think thatfat is all bad and causes heart disease. Here’s the skinny on fats. The goodfats such as omega 3s from fish, nuts, seeds, avocados, olives and extra-virginolive oil, and coconut butter (a plant-derived saturated fat) have been provento reduce diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and dementia. They lower cholesteroland triglycerides. And they are powerful anti-inflammatory compounds. But moreimportant, they make your food tasty and satisfying.In one dietary study in Spain, researchers split the study population into threegroups. They were all told to eat a basic Mediterranean diet, but one group wasgiven a liter of extra-virgin olive oil a week, another was given 30 grams(about an ounce) of nuts a day, and the last group had only the diet. The groupswho had the olive oil and nuts had over a 30 percent reduction in heart attacksand death.2 [part0020_split_004.html#ch4ft2] This is a better result than statindrugs — without any of the side effects. More fat was better.Fighting CholesterolWhen Tracy Keibler started following The Daniel Plan, her cholesterol dropped.Her total cholesterol dropped from 260 to 207, with an LDL/HDL ratio of 1.6 andTotal/HDL ratio of 2.5. Her triglycerides were 48. “All this happened withoutthe use of a statin drug — or any drugs at all!” Tracy says. One of her doctorseven told her she was a model patient. But that’s not all.“More significantly, my arsenal of medications is gone. I no longer requireinhalers for asthma, my gastrointestinal issues are gone, and my eczema problemsand sinus allergies are substantially better.”If you eat good quality fats with every meal, you will leave the table satisfiedand without cravings. Your blood sugar will be balanced, and your brain will behappy. In fact, 60 percent of your brain is made from fat, specifically DHA. Youcan get DHA from fish and algae. Every one of your 10 trillion cells is wrappedin fatty membrane. The health of your cells determines your health, and the goodfats make healthy cell membranes. (We discuss your brain health in chapter 6.)We basically all need an oil change. Swap out the bad fats for the good andwatch your health improve, your mood lift, your memory improve, and your skin,hair, and nails glow. So stock your pantry with a variety of healthy fats. Learnto use them. It can be as simple as grabbing a handful of nuts, opening a can ofwild salmon, taking a spoonful of creamy coconut butter from the jar, or pouringextra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) over your veggies or salad.Our favorite sources of good quality healing fats include foods we have alreadytold you about. Fish and seafood are great sources of omega 3 fats (as well asprotein and minerals). The best sources of omega 3 fats are sardines, herring,and wild salmon. Keep several cans in your pantry at all times. They are greaton salad, or try them with a squirt of lemon and your favorite herb or spice.Nuts and nut butters (without added sugar, salt, or hydrogenated fats) providemonounsaturated fats. Make sure they are raw or lightly roasted. Grab a handfulof nuts, or dip apple slices into a nut butter as a snack. Seeds are a fabulousfood few people eat. They aren’t just for birds.Other healthy fats come from olives, avocados, and coconut. Olive oil and olivesare rich in monounsaturated fats as well as antioxidant, anti-inflammatorypolyphenol phytonutrients. Extra-virgin olive oil, cold-pressed, is the primaryoil you should have on hand in your pantry. You can put it in salads or overvegetables, and cook with it on low to medium temperatures; at high temperaturesit can oxidize and burn. For high-temperature cooking, use grape seed oil orcoconut butter/oil. For flavor in cooking, such as in a stir fry, you can useunrefined sesame oil.Avocados are a wonderful and unusual fruit that contain good monounsaturatedfats and powerful anti-inflammatory compounds. Cut one in half and drizzle somebalsamic vinegar on top. Put chopped avocados in salads, or mash them intoguacamole with some lime juice, chopped tomatoes, diced onion, salt, and pepper.Avocados can make smoothies creamy and can even be used to make a healthychocolate pudding. (Visit danielplan.com for the recipe “Amazing AvocadoGelato.”)Extra-virgin coconut butter or oil is an extraordinary super food that containsa special kind of anti-inflammatory saturated fat called lauric acid. It is thebest source of the fuel your brain prefers, and it boosts your energy and brainpower.Change Your OilStock your pantry with the following unrefined oils that are good for your bodyand your brain: * Extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO), cold-pressed: for dressings, marinades, and cooking over low to medium heat * Extra-virgin coconut oil, cold-pressed or unrefined: for cooking even at medium high temperatures * Grape seed oil: for cooking at higher temperatures * 100% avocado oil: for cooking, less of this oil goes further than EVOO * Sesame oil: for cooking when you want to add a bit of flavor"},{"pageContent":"WHAT ABOUT DRINKS?We are going to have to tell you that your taste buds have been hijacked.

We are on the go constantly. Every day, most Americans live in a constantstate of busyness. They often skip breakfast or are at the mercy of the localcoffee chain that offers high-sugar coffees and donuts or muffins or scones(which sound like a health food but are really giant sugar cookies in disguise).Then, at work there are bowls of candy and vending machines full of soda. On theway home, fast-food restaurants and convenience stores lure you in with a “quickfix” for your hunger. We live in a toxic nutritional wasteland, so the lastplace you want to find yourself is in a food emergency.What is a food emergency? When your blood sugar starts to drop, you arehard-wired to eat anything (and everything) in sight. To think you can usewillpower to control your hunger or cravings contradicts the science of how yourbrain controls your behavior. The more willpower you try to use, the more itbackfires eventually. How often do you find yourself automatically overeatingand bingeing, or just eating whatever happens to be in front of you?But there is a solution — a simple, practical idea that most of us never thinkabout: planning and bringing food with us. If you were a type 1 diabetic, youwould not leave the house without your insulin syringe or a packet of sugar. Ifyou did, your life would be at risk. If you had a severe peanut allergy, youwouldn’t go anywhere without your Epi-pen. One sniff of peanut dust, and youcould die without your protection.While you may not die in an hour when you get hungry, you will get sick and fatand live a shorter, poorer life if you regularly find yourself in a foodemergency. You will repeatedly choose poor quality, high sugar, refined foodsand eat more than you need. A few things that will keep you from a foodemergency include starting your day with a healthy balanced breakfast, eatingevery three to four hours, hydrating your body throughout the day, and stockingan emergency food kit.We recommend that everyone create an emergency food pack; it will be your foodsafety net. Find your favorite things to include; the choices are plentiful.Stock these packs in your home, your travel bag or purse, your car, and yourworkplace with key rations for any food emergency. If you didn’t have time toeat breakfast, what could you grab for the car? Or if you get busy at work, whatcan you find in your drawer to get you through the day, or what is at the readyin the late afternoon if you start to droop?We recommend protein for many of the choices, because protein controls yourappetite and balances your blood sugar over long periods of time. Protein snackskeep on giving, but without the quick rush and crash we get from most “snackfoods” that leave us more hungry and tired. If you wait until you are hungry,you will make irrational decisions. So set yourself up to make better choices byhaving nutritious choices around you.Dr. Hyman’s Go-To Travel Food Emergency PackWhen I am on the road, my health Is In jeopardy every time I step out of mycontrolled environment. Airports, hotel mini-bars, and bad restaurants are oftenfood deserts. So I bring food with me and make it a rule never to eat on planesor in airports (although increasingly you can find edible whole foods inairports; you just have to know how to hunt and gather!). I never leave homewithout these things, and I keep a good stock in my pantry, so I can just throwthem in my bag. They take up little space and pack a powerful nutritional punch. * Wild salmon jerky * Grass-fed beef or turkey jerky * Packets of coconut butter and macadamia nut butter * Raw protein food bars * Organic almonds * Organic macadamia nuts * Organic datesWith a little bit of planning and shopping, we can stay healthy and out of foodemergencies. Get a few glass containers with lids and sandwich baggies to putyour snacks in.

Of course not! We can’tlive without oxygen. Our brains are hardwired to crave it. Most of our brainsalso crave sugar. It is simply a survival mechanism. So if you believe willpowercan rescue you from bad eating habits and cravings for junk food, sugar, orrefined carbs, forget it. You might as well try to hold your breath for an hour.It is a matter of hormones and brain chemistry. Fix those two things, and yourcravings will go away in a couple of days (not for oxygen, though!). It is hardto imagine but true.In the book Salt Sugar Fat, Michael Moss reveals that the food industry hasintentionally and scientifically designed the hyper-processed, hyper-palatable,sugar-laden food to make us addicted — not metaphorically, but actuallyphysically addicted. Think heroin lollipops or morphine muffins. The industrydesigned “craving experts” to find the “bliss point” of foods. Brain imagingstudies confirm that these foods light up the parts of the brain that respond toopiates like heroin and stimulate hunger and cravings. In fact, sugar is moreaddictive than cocaine.3 [part0020_split_004.html#ch4ft3] No wonder we havecravings!Tame the Four Hormones of the ApocalypseIt’s easy to get your key hormones in balance. Here’s how to cut the cravings: * Cut out sugar and white flour. Go cold turkey. * Cut out all artificial sweeteners. * Increase fiber. * Eat protein for breakfast. * Eat a handful of nuts 15 minutes before a meal to cut your appetite. * Stop night-time eating and bingeing. * Focus on portion size. Learn appropriate portion sizes for lean proteins and whole grains. * Wait 20 minutes before eating a second portion. It takes that long for food to hit the lower part of your small intestine and trigger PPY, the hormone that is a powerful brake on your appetite. * Put your fork down between bites. It will slow you down, and by the time you get to seconds, you won’t want any. * Increase exercise, which you will read about in the next chapter. * Sleep at least 7 to 8 hours a night. Those who lost even one or two hours of sleep a night craved more carbs and ended up eating more during the day.4 [part0020_split_004.html#ch4ft4] * Breathe. The simplest and fastest way to relax and reduce cortisol is to take five breaths. Count to five on the in breath, and count to five on the out breath. Do it five times. * Play, which is a form of fitness, is something we do without thinking when we are young. It is a wonderful way to lower cortisol. * Give and receive — one of the most powerful healing and restorative things in the world.There are four key hormones that drive our brain chemistry and control ourappetite and metabolism. We call these the “four hormones of the apocalypse.” Ifyou learn simple tricks to regain control of these hormones, your cravings willvanish quickly, usually in less than forty-eight hours. If you get thesehormones under control, all the rest often resets automatically: 1. Insulin is produced in large quantities by the pancreas in response to sugar or starch that triggers fat storage in the belly and interferes with appetite control centers in the brain, making you hungry and craving more sugar and carbs. 2. Ghrelin is the hunger hormone produced in the stomach. Most of the ways we eat and live cause this hunger hormone to spike. 3. PYY (peptide YY) is produced in the intestine and puts the brakes on your appetite. 4. Cortisol is the stress hormone produced by the adrenal glands and during chronic stress causes hunger, storage of belly fat, and loss of muscle.The beauty of adding food that heals, nourishes, and satisfies you deeply isthat it will almost effortlessly shift your body and mind into a different state— a state where your cravings are gone, where your willpower is not neededbecause you naturally crave what makes you thrive and feel good. By addingsimple habits — sleeping a bit more, moving your body, calming your mind,breathing, playing, serving — you will gradually, day by day, shift into aprofound capacity for self-care and healing. Fulfillment, living with purpose,and well-being are the natural result.Now that you have learned that food is medicine, that real food has the power tocreate a healthy life, and exactly what foods you can eat for the most powerful,life-giving energy, it is time to have a look at what we have been eating thatwe thought was food, but isn’t, and how to avoid life-robbing,disease-promoting, obesity-inducing foods.The Cravings StoppedPastor Tom Crick had heard other people on The Daniel Plan say things like “Youknow, you will get over that after a little while.

Hunter-gatherer populationsconsumed about 22 teaspoons of sugar a year; now the average American consumes22 to 30 teaspoons of sugar every single day.6 [part0020_split_004.html#ch4ft6]In 1800, the average person consumed 5 pounds per year;7[part0020_split_004.html#ch4ft7] now we average 152 pounds a year.8[part0020_split_004.html#ch4ft8] Our bodies are not designed to handle thatamount of sugar. Paracelsus, the ancient Greek physician said, “The dose makesthe poison.” At the current dose, sugar is poison. The average 20-ounce soda has15 teaspoons of sugar. Would you put that much in your cup of coffee or tea?Sugar has many names: cane sugar, evaporated cane juice, brown sugar, dextrose,agave, maple syrup, honey, and of course, high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), whichis now the single biggest source of calories in our diet. All of these areharmful when eaten in excess. Sugar-sweetened drinks like soda now make up 15percent of the calories consumed by the average American. One can of soda a dayincreases a kid’s risk of obesity by 60 percent and women’s chance of gettingdiabetes by more than 80 percent.9 [part0020_split_004.html#ch4ft9]Other dangers are refined or processed white foods that spike blood sugar, butwe don’t think of them as sugar. They are white flour, white rice, and whitepasta. These white foods act like sugar in the body. We should substitute withbetter options, such as bread made from whole kernel rye, or black or brownrice.Since 1950, more than 600,000 packaged and processed foods have been introducedinto the marketplace. Eighty percent of them are full of sugar, oftentablespoons and tablespoons, hidden and disguised by all sorts of names.10[part0020_split_004.html#ch4ft10] It is in bread, ketchup, and salad dressings.In fact, the average serving of commercial spaghetti sauce has more sugar than aserving of chocolate sandwich cookies, which is why later in this chapter wewill show you how to effectively read labels.The Varieties of SugarFamiliar Sugars (not healthy, just real)Agave HoneyBarley malt Juice concentrateBrown rice syrup MaplesyrupBrown sugar MolassesCoconut sugar Palm sugarEvaporatedor Sugar dehydrated cane juice Hidden Sugars or Toxic SugarsDextrose GlucoseDextrin LactoseDisaccharides MaltodextrinFructose MaltoseHighfructose corn Monosaccharides syrup (or any corn Sorghum sugar orsyrup) SucroseHydrogenated starch Xylose"},{"pageContent":"WHY SUGAR IS THE MAIN CAUSE OF DISEASESince low-fat dietary recommendations in the early 1980s (which we all thoughtwere good for us at the time), we have doubled our rates of obesity in adultsand tripled it in kids, and the rate of type 2 diabetes around the world hasincreased sevenfold. In fact, today in America, one in two people havepre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes. We have seen the number of people with heartdisease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, dementia, depression, and infertilityskyrocket. (Actually, to diagnose cancer, doctors give patients radioactivesugar. The sugar then goes straight to the cancer, and it lights up on the PETscan.)Sugar triggers a cascade of changes in your body that make you sick and fat.Here’s what happens: 1. You eat quickly absorbed sugar or refined carbohydrates (like white flour). 2. Your blood sugar spikes. 3. Your insulin levels spike. 4. Insulin triggers the storage of belly fat and increases your appetite and sugar cravings. 5. The sugar (particularly the fructose in high fructose corn syrup) turns on a cholesterol factory in your liver (called lipogenesis), increasing LDL (bad cholesterol), lowering HDL (good cholesterol), and raising triglycerides. 6. This leads to a fatty liver (now affecting 60 to 90 million Americans).11 [part0020_split_004.html#ch4ft11]All of this increases something called insulin resistance, where your cellsbecome numb to the effects of insulin, requiring more and more insulin to keepyour blood sugar normal. This is the major cause of all age-related chronicdisease (such as heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, cancer, type 2diabetes, and dementia.)Your body makes more and more insulin, triggering more and more belly fat andinflammation. This inflammation is at the root of most chronic diseases. Whew!Even if someone doesn’t yet have type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance is themajor cause of heart attacks, strokes, many cancers, and even dementia (nowcalled type 3 diabetes).Bottom line: Sugar is an occasional treat. When you have sugar, stick withtraditional, natural forms: raw sugar, raw honey, natural fruit sugars, puremaple syrup. Stay away from all the rest. Use it in things you make yourself,but sparingly, and use The Daniel Plan recipes on the website and in The DanielPlan Cookbook as a guide to healthy desserts. Avoid all hidden and added sugarsby carefully reading labels.You can use whole fruit or fruit juices in small amounts as natural sweetenersin healthy desserts. As you start to eat real food, your cravings and addictionwill be replaced by deep pleasure and satisfaction for naturally sweet things.Liquid Death: Don’t Drink Your CaloriesIf there was one thing you could do to dramatically improve your health and loseweight, it would be this: Don’t drink liquid sugar calories. This means soda,sports drinks, flavored coffees or teas, energy drinks, and juices (exceptfresh-made green vegetable juice).Here’s what liquid calories do: * They get deposited and become that dreaded belly fat. * They turn your liver into a fat factory triggering more insulin resistance and starting a vicious cycle. * They mess with your head by increasing your appetite and keeping you from feeling full, so you eat more than you normally would in a day.Bottom line: Stick to water or unsweetened, non-caffeinated teas."},{"pageContent":"THE SPECIAL CASE OF FRUCTOSEWe can tolerate sugar in small amounts and as an occasional treat. One goodsource of sugar is real whole fruit (not juice or concentrate). The truth is,fructose that you get from eating fruit is fine because it is packaged in fiberand full of vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients.The problem is when the fructose is taken out of the fruit — which is how we gethigh fructose corn syrup (HFCS). Avoid HFCS at all costs. If you do nothing elseto change your diet, make this one change and be relentless about it."},{"pageContent":"ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERSSince sugar causes so many health problems, why not switch to artificialsweeteners and diet foods made with these alternatives? If losing weight wereall about the calories, then consuming diet drinks would seem like a good idea.A fourteen-year study of more than 65,000 women found that the opposite seems tobe true. Diet drinks may be worse than sugar-sweetened drinks.12[part0020_split_004.html#ch4ft12]There is no free ride. Diet drinks are not good substitutes for sugar-sweeteneddrinks. They also increase cravings, weight gain, and type 2 diabetes. And theyare addictive. Watch for the hidden names of artificial or non-caloric ornon-absorbed sweeteners such as aspartame, acesulfame, and sucralose; and sugaralcohols such as malitol and xylitol and anything else that ends in OL."},{"pageContent":"WHAT ABOUT STEVIA?Stevia seems like the perfect alternative to help avoid the dangers ofartificial sweeteners such as aspartame. It comes from a plant. It’s allnatural. It has no calories. The Guarani Indians in Paraguay have used it sincethe sixteenth century. It sounds perfect. Until 1995 it was banned from theUnited States because of heavy lobbying by the makers of aspartame, anartificial sweetener. When the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) finallyacted on it in 1995, it was approved as a dietary supplement sold in health foodstores. This form of stevia is a good alternative.However, read labels carefully, since some manufacturers have found a way toextract the bitter parts of the plant and keep just the sweet taste, turningwhat was potentially a better sweetener into a refined food substance. Theyisolated the sweet chemical called “rebauside A,” or “reb A” for short.Instead, go for the original whole plant extract, which you can find in healthfood stores or supermarkets. It comes in liquid or powder form. Keep in mindthat sweets are treats, not staples.At this point you may be thinking you want to give up right now. No sugar?Really? The fact is, natural sugars found in fruit and some vegetables can tasteincredibly sweet once you reclaim your taste buds. Life can still be very sweetwithout highly processed, refined sugars and artificial sweeteners. If you focuson real foods — foods that are naturally sweet such as fruit and even sweetvegetables — and learn to enjoy them, you won’t miss the junk. And if you tryjunk again, it will taste extremely sweet. Try roasted vegetables or sweetpotatoes. Even kids love them. Dark chocolate is also a wonderful treat in smallamounts. There is always room for sweet treats in moderation."},{"pageContent":"THE BAD FATSThe science of fat is so mixed up that it’s no wonder everyone is confused.Thankfully, the new U.S. Dietary Guidelines are moving in the right direction,encouraging us to eat the right kinds of fats — which we already covered — andto avoid the bad ones.There are two main classes of fats that are bad for us: trans fat, and processedand refined vegetable oils. Think of clear or yellow oils sold in big jugs usedby most Americans and sold as vegetable, soybean, corn, or canola oil(previously called rapeseed and not a human food until recently). These arecalled omega 6 oils or polyunsaturated fats.As you follow The Daniel Plan, your taste buds will wake up to the wonderfultaste of real food, you won’t feel deprived, and your daily cravings will goaway.They are inflammatory. And by now, you know what inflammation leads to in yourbody!Switch out these oils for ones that benefit your body and brain (see page 97).The exception is that you can use small amounts of unrefined oils — often calledcold-pressed or expeller-pressed — such as from grape seeds, sesame seeds, orwalnuts for cooking at home. And, of course, you can use extra-virgin olive oiland coconut oil.Trans fats are poisons and, next to high fructose corn syrup, the most deadlyingredient in our food supply. There is no safe limit. There is no reason toever eat them.They are made in a factory where liquid vegetable oil (usually from soybeans) ischemically treated under high pressure to make it solid at room temperature. Itimproves shelf-life dramatically, which is why cookies can stay on the shelf foryears and shortening is perfectly good to make piecrust from after thirty yearsin the cupboard. Yes, it improves shelf life. But do you know why they call it“shortening”? It shortens your life!Trans fats increase your risk of the following health problems: * Increased bad cholesterol and lower good cholesterol * Risk of heart attack * Obesity and type 2 diabetes * Cancer * Impaired brain functioning and dementia * Increased inflammationYou will find trans fats in packaged baked goods, cookies, cakes, crackers,fried fast foods, chips, and popcorn. Walk down the aisle of any supermarket andtry to find any food without “hydrogenated fat” on the nutrition label. Yes,trans fats are now labeled, but the food policy permits the label to say “zerotrans fats” if the product has less than 2 grams per serving. Frozen whippedtopping is made from water, hydrogenated fat, and high fructose corn syrup asthe main ingredients, yet the label says “0 trans fats” because a serving hasless than 0.5 grams. Call it legalized lying.How Does What We Eat Affect the Planet?The things you put on your fork have the power to affect not only your health,but also agricultural practices, climate change, and even our economy. Onechurch member told us about Nigerian farmers he met who were given seed by alarge agricultural company at a cheaper price than their regular seed, but thenthe seeds from that crop couldn’t be replanted. (They are designed that way.)The farmers then were forced to buy the seed from the same company at a higherprice the next year and eventually couldn’t afford to farm.This pattern of industrial agricultural practices not only has impacted thequality of the food you eat, but also creates hunger in little children inAfrica. When you stop buying industrial food, it has an enormous ripple effect.The power of your fork can change the world.When it comes to our health and the health of the planet, we have a lot more tolearn and study, but we don’t need all the answers in order to take action. Wecan each make choices to buy more whole foods, sustainably raised animals,locally grown produce, and more. Just as we’ve learned that certain fats aregood for us and others are destructive, we can learn what agricultural and foodpractices are best for us too."},{"pageContent":"FACTORY-MADE SCIENCE PROJECTSOther than getting rid of high fructose corn syrup and trans fat, the best thingyou can do for your health is to avoid factory-made science projects with weirdand strange molecules that haven’t been made by God in nature.Many common food additives cause everything from uncontrollable hunger and bingeeating (blame MSG), to headaches, allergies, and damage to your gut.

In fact, I couldn’t find chicken on the label — it was a‘chicken-like substance.’ “— Dr. HymanEat organic, if you can afford it, to avoid pesticides, hormones, andantibiotics in food. If you are budget strapped, use the Clean Fifteen and DirtyDozen list from the Environmental Working Group (ewg.org) to choose the leastcontaminated conventionally grown fruits and vegetables and avoid the mostcontaminated versions. Go to ewg.org/agmag/2010/06/shoppers-guide-pesticides. Itis a bit more expensive, but being selective here can help the budget and yourhealth. For dairy, we suggest buying organic and eating less. Organic foods haveabout 25 percent more nutrients than conventionally grown plant foods. Beef,poultry, and eggs are also items that are better for you if organic orsustainably raised. If more people used organics, the prices would come down.Eat sustainably. Try to buy sustainably raised animals and animal products whenyou can. This will help you avoid pesticides, antibiotics, and hormones. Lookfor the terms grass fed, pasture raised, free-range or organic, or made withouthormones and antibiotics.

Butit is controversial for moral, personal, and medical reasons.Be aware that in doses of more than one or two glasses, alcohol becomes apoison, and it is a source of high calories and sugar that can significantlycontribute to weight gain. Too much alcohol causes damage to your gut lining,damages your liver, and increases blood sugar and insulin. It can also causeinflammation, disrupt hormones, cause brain atrophy, and deplete your vitaminlevels. One glass may bring health benefits, but more than two can bring harm.Unfortunately, alcohol addiction is common and robs people and their families oftheir lives. For those with addiction or prone to addiction, abstinence is thebest medicine. (If someone you love is struggling with an alcohol addiction, youcan find out how to help them at celebraterecovery.com) Also, if you have a highrisk of breast cancer, are prone to mental illness, have liver or digestiveproblems, have a personal or family history of alcoholism, or are allergic tosulfites in wine, then you shouldn’t consume any alcohol."},{"pageContent":"FOOD SENSITIVITIES AND ALLERGIESThe old saying goes that what is one man’s medicine is another man’s poison.Nowhere is this truer than when it comes to our different responses to food. Andnowhere in medicine is there more controversy, superstition, and confusion thanthere is surrounding the subject of food allergies, sensitivities, and illness.As a doctor in active medical practice, Dr. Hyman has had at his disposal twopowerful medicines for treating, reversing, and even curing hundreds ofdiseases. These medicines are (1) addressing hidden food sensitivities and foodallergies, and (2) getting people to eat real foods. The science of functionalmedicine (his specialty) is about connecting the dots and treating your body asa holistic system, not just focusing on symptoms.The two most common foods that trigger reactions are gluten (found in wheat,barley, rye, spelt, and oats) and dairy. These foods trigger inflammation, whichis the root of autoimmune diseases (suffered by 24 to 50 million Americans);13[part0020_split_004.html#ch4ft13] arthritic, allergic, and asthmatic diseases,which are all on a steep rise; diabetes; dementia; obesity; depression; heartdisease; and autism.So why are we seeing an epidemic of inflammatory disease in this country? Is ita sudden genetic mutation that has millions of us overreacting to foods we haveapparently eaten for thousands of years?The answer is no.We have to start looking for delayed or hidden food reactions that causeinflammation. These reactions might be hard to detect. If you eat bread onMonday, you might get a migraine on Wednesday, or just generally feel bloated,or have brain fog, or gain weight and become pre-diabetic. The symptoms can bevague: fatigue, bloating, brain fog, food cravings, sinus congestion or postnasal drip, acne, eczema, psoriasis, irritable bowels, acid reflux, headaches,joint pains, trouble sleeping, asthma, and more.The food allergies we are referring to are different. They are low-gradereactions that cause problems over a long period of time and lead to chronicrather than acute illnesses. These may affect up to 50 percent of thepopulation.There are blood tests for these reactions, and if you are concerned that youhave a serious gluten sensitivity or celiac disease, you should get the properblood tests. However, for most of us a two-to-six-week trial of eliminatingthese foods will tell you more than any tests. Your body has infinite wisdom.Listen to it. What symptoms get better? How do you feel? Do you lose weight?The rise of these food sensitivities now is directly related to what we’ve beeneating. Our processed, low-fiber, high-sugar diet alters the bacteria that livein our digestive system. You have 500 species of bugs in there. The bacteriaoutnumber your cells 10 to 1, and you have 100 times more bacterial DNA in youthan your own DNA. What research shows is the existence of “leaky gut,” wherefood proteins leak across a damaged intestinal lining and activate your immunesystem. When you eat processed food, you change your gut flora and foster thegrowth of bad bugs that promote inflammation. Add to that the gut-busting drugswe use — antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, acid blockers, and steroids —combined with our stressful lives, and we have the perfect environment for aleaky gut.What about Dairy?Americans have been taught that we need milk, that without it kids will not growup to be big and strong and old ladies’ bones will dissolve in a heap fromosteoporosis. We have been taught that milk is nature’s perfect food. It is. Fora calf! Humans are the only species that drinks milk after weaning. More than 75percent of the world’s population is lactose intolerant (having the inability todigest the sugar in milk), and dairy causes bloating, gas, and diarrhea. Beyondlactose intolerance, the adverse immune responses to the proteins in dairyabound, including congestion, asthma, sinus problems, kids’ ear infections,rashes and eczema, autoimmune diseases, and type 1 diabetes. We encourageeveryone to take a dairy holiday and eliminate dairy for at least ten days butup to forty days to see how you feel. Along with gluten (see p. 122), dairy isone of the most inflammatory foods in our diet.Some people may tolerate dairy in small amounts. If you want to include dairyand find that you tolerate it, here is how to minimize your risk: * Try sheep or goat milk or cheese. * Choose dairy products that are organic and from pasture-raised animals. * Stick with hard cheeses rather than processed cheeses. * Use more easily digested forms of dairy such as kefir or plain yogurt, which contain beneficial bacteria.Then you get a stomach flu or traveler’s diarrhea or take one more course ofantibiotics, and — wham! — suddenly you get a leaky gut. Your immune system (60percent of which lies right under your intestinal lining) gets exposed to foodand bacterial particles. Your normal balance is disrupted. You can’t digest foodproperly or determine friend from foe, and your immune system creates anabnormal reaction to something pretty normal — the food you eat."},{"pageContent":"WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HEALWe can do many things to deal with delayed food allergies or sensitivities,rebalance our systems, and get rid of our chronic symptoms.Here are a few things you can do to heal your leaky gut: 1. For ten to forty days, stop eating gluten and dairy 100 percent. Even 99 percent won’t do the trick. Your immune system responds to microscopic things. We designed The Daniel Plan Detox to give you a meal plan that cuts out dairy and gluten (see page 294). 2. After you have been off those foods for ten to forty days, add one back in every three days and monitor your symptoms in The Daniel Plan Journal to track what causes symptoms that can be delayed by two-to-forty-eight hours after eating the food. 3. Take a probiotic (healthy beneficial bacteria) to help regulate your immune system. Look for brands in the health food store or online from reputable sources that contain a mixture of beneficial bacteria, including Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium, with at least 30 to 50 billion organisms per dose. Foods that contain probiotics include sauerkraut, kimchi, miso or tempeh, and kombucha. Unsweetened yogurt and kefir are fine if you are not sensitive to dairy. 4. Add more fiber to your diet (see page 81). 5. Digestive enzymes help break down food and make it less likely to cause an allergic reaction. Look for broad-spectrum enzymes that contain proteases, amylases, and lipases. They can be either plant or animal derived. There are natural enzymes in your digestive tract, which is how you break down food, but when you have a leaky gut, they may not work as well. 6. Take a good multivitamin and fish oil (1 to 2 grams a day, certified free of metals and other toxins), which contains nutrients that help the digestive system heal. 7. Other nutrients can be helpful to heal a leaky gut, including zinc, vitamin A, evening primrose oil, and glutamine.If problems persist, consider testing for IgG allergens with a blood test andworking with a doctor trained in dealing with food allergies.

THE PROBLEM WITH GLUTENThe heirloom biblical wheat of our ancestors is something modern humans nevereat. Instead, we eat dwarf wheat, the product of genetic manipulation andhybridization, that created short, stubby, hardy, high-yielding wheat plantswith much higher amounts of starch and gluten. The man who engineered thismodern wheat won the Nobel Prize because it promised to feed millions ofstarving people around the world. Well, it has. But it brought some issues withit.This type of wheat also contains special forms of a protein called gluten, theglue-like protein that makes dough sticky. Gluten is found in wheat barley, rye,spelt, oats, and kamut and holds bread together and makes it rise. The dwarfwheat grown in the United States has changed the quality and type of glutenproteins in wheat, creating much higher gluten content, and creating asuper-gluten that causes celiac disease and autoimmune antibodies.The average American eats 146 pounds of flour a year.14[part0020_split_004.html#ch4ft14]Combine this with the damage our guts have suffered from our diet, environment,lifestyle, and medications, and now you know why gluten intolerance is on therise. This super gluten crosses our leaky guts and gets exposed to our immunesystem. Our immune system reacts as if gluten is something foreign, and it setsoff the fires of inflammation in an attempt to eliminate it. However, thisinflammation is not selective, so it begins to attack our cells.Low-level inflammation from gluten that is not celiac disease has been shown toincrease heart attacks by more than 35 percent and cancer by more than 70percent.15 [part0020_split_004.html#ch4ft15] That is why elimination of glutenand food allergens or sensitivities can be a powerful way to prevent and reverseobesity, diabetes, and so many other chronic diseases.Gluten-Free Worked for MeOn a visit to Saddleback Church, Dr. Hyman talked about how you could befollowing the principles of The Daniel Plan and still feel unwell. So if thatwas the case, you should try going off gluten. When Cindy Sproul heard him saythat, she perked up. “A little bell went off in my head. That’s why I’m stillnot feeling well, I thought. I had been having migraine headaches probablyweekly for three or four years. That day, I went off gluten and within threedays, I didn’t have a headache left.“I was thinking clearer. I didn’t have stiffness and swelling in my hands andjoints. I had more energy and felt reignited.”Bottom line: If you have any chronic illness, are overweight, or just want tosee how good you can feel, try a gluten-free diet for ten to forty days. It is apowerful way to identify the cause of chronic health problems. Combined withdairy elimination, it can cure many diseases, accelerate weight loss, and renewyour body and mind."},{"pageContent":"THE DANIEL PLAN DETOXWe recommend that everyone start with a ten-day (which you can extend to fortydays) Daniel Plan Detox to jump-start the healing process, reboot your system,and discover the power of reclaiming your body and mind by letting go of thethings that can harm you and adding in the things that can heal you.

Most of Dr. Hyman’s patients say, “Dr.Hyman, I didn’t know I was feeling so bad until I started feeling so good!” Thatis our prayer for all of you.Eating Away the Pain“The Daniel Plan was really pretty simple, but at first not easy,” LatriceSarver recalls. “I had developed so many bad food habits and had yo-yo dietedfor my entire life, there was a lot that I needed to change.“I never dreamt that my pain would be affected in any way. When we did the detoxat the very beginning, I soon discovered that I had decreased pain when Iavoided animal protein and that my pain increased significantly when I added itback into my diet. By focusing primarily on fruits, vegetables, seeds, nuts, andwhole grains, I had so much less pain, improved energy, improved blood sugars,and gradual weight loss.”We hope you will give yourself the gift of this powerful healing kick-start toThe Daniel Plan. Real food, infused with spices and cooked or prepared, simplytastes far better than any processed food. It may take a week or two to reclaimyour taste buds, but they will come back! And you will start to crave real,fresh food.

There is free or cheap processed food everywhere at work: donuts,bagels, candy jars, sodas. And most likely, fast-food restaurants surround you.The solution is easy. Get your emergency food pack (see page 98) together andhave a version for home, for work, for your car, for your travel bag. If youstart to get hungry, have something.

The good news is, you can eat almost anythingoccasionally and be fine — as long as it’s real food, such as real pizza orFrench fries (not fast-food fries that have about thirty ingredients) or a pieceof cake or cookies, and as long as you or someone you know made them from realingredients.So if 90 percent of the time you eat well, you can have treats and party food 10percent of the time. To stay focused on eating well and still enjoying a vibrantsocial life, here are some basic strategies:Never go to a party hungry. If you have a snack before, you won’t be tempted toeat every greasy, fried, or sugary food.Eat before you travel. Never go to an airport, a ball game, or a public eventhungry.Bring your food. If you are going to a picnic, bring healthy choices to eat ifthere is nothing else worth eating.Start a trend with your friends. See who can find the best real food in yourtown.

If you are traveling, stock up on healthy snacks orrestock your emergency food pack.Start a supper club with your friends or church group. Rotate hosting the mealonce a month between friends. Do a potluck or cook recipes from The Daniel Plan,which are available online (in The Daniel Plan App) and in The Daniel PlanCookbook.Say no to food pushers.

No washing dishes. Our overall suggestion is to eat out lessoften and choose higher quality food when you do go out. When you go out, enjoygreat food and feel great too. Here’s how to eat well, feel well, and have funeating out while still following The Daniel Plan.Look online before you get in line. Check out menus online and look for healthychoices, good quality protein, simple dishes, sides of vegetables, clues such aslocal, seasonal, organic, grass fed on the menu, as well as gluten- ordairy-free options, which are becoming more common. Try apps like Google Plus orYelp to see how restaurants are rated and what they serve; type in the wordsorganic, natural foods, vegetarian, slow food, or whole foods.Try ethnic restaurants such as Thai, Japanese, and Indian that use freshingredients. Sometimes they add a lot of sugar, fat, and salt, or even MSG, soyou have to be discerning with their menus.Be annoying. You can ask for substitutions or changes.Skip the bread. Don’t let them put bread and butter on the table.Avoid drinking alcohol before you eat. Alcohol makes you hungrier and lessinhibited.Drink water, at least a glass or two, before you eat. You will likely eat less.Skip the white sides, and ask for extra vegetables.Order two or three sides of veggies. Go crazy!Dress yourself. Ask for extra-virgin olive oil, vinegar, and fresh pepper foryour salad instead of dressings.Think about the perfect plate. How can you order to have a smaller protein andstarch portion and more veggies? Have salads and sides of veggies, share anentrée. Skip the white flour, white rice, and white potatoes.Avoid foods associated with certain words, such as glazed, fried, crispy,breaded, and creamy.Choose foods associated with good words, such as roasted, broiled, baked,grilled, seared, steamed, and sautéed.If eating breakfast out, order the omelets or two poached eggs over steamedspinach and skip the white toast. You can ask for a bowl of berries.Share one dessert with the table or order one that contains real fruit, is 70percent cacao, and is free of refined sugars.Skip the appetizer.Follow the “hari hachi bu” rule. The Okinawans from Japan live well over 100years old and eat until they are 80 percent full.Eat on time. Don’t go into a restaurant really hungry. You will order and eatmore. Have a handful of almonds before you go. Eat three meals a day at regularintervals to balance your blood sugar and hormones.Bring leftovers home. If the restaurant has large portions, ask for half themeal to be packed up before you even start eating. You will have lunch fortomorrow.Share entrées with a friend or companion. Often portions are double what anormal person should eat.Be mindful. Slow, conscious eating will allow you to really taste your food andyour body to register that it is actually full — which takes twenty minutes fromyour first bite."},{"pageContent":"DESIGN YOUR MINDThere are two reasons to be mindful when you eat. First, you will eat less andenjoy your food more. Second, you will metabolize and burn food better ratherthan store it in your belly. Study after study shows that when we eatunconsciously, we eat more.17 [part0020_split_004.html#ch4ft17] In one study,participants were given snack food bags that automatically refilled from asecret compartment under the table.

One of Dr. Hyman’spatients said he wanted to lose weight but couldn’t change his lunchtime habitof two big cheeseburgers that he ate in the car before he got out of the parkinglot. Rather than telling him to stop eating the burgers, Dr. Hyman suggestedthat he simply go inside the restaurant, sit down, breathe deeply, close hiseyes, and savor every single bite. At his next appointment he told Dr. Hymanthat he never would eat a fast-food burger again, because when he really tastedit, he realized he actually didn’t like it.Are you starting to see how your mind can make such a big difference in youreating habits? That is why focus, the topic of chapter 6, is so important. Thereare a few simple things you can do to eat more mindfully, get more pleasure fromfood, and design your habits, your environment, and your mind to work onautopilot so that after a while you don’t have to think about what you aredoing. You will naturally just do the right thing.Say a blessing of thanks before each meal. Gratitude and prayer honor God andhelp focus the mind and bring you to the present moment.Always sit down and sit still. While eating, eat! Skip watching TV, talking onthe phone, driving, standing, or walking down the street with food in yourmouth. In Europe you can’t actually get a to-go coffee; coffee is served only inceramic cups at tables or the espresso bar.Eat from smaller plates. Eating out of a package, bag, or container is a sureway to overeat and eat unconsciously. Use a 10-inch plate or bowl whenever youcan.Stop and breathe before eating. Take five deep breaths in and out through yournose before every meal.Create a peaceful environment. Soft light, candles, quiet music, flowers. Any ofthese encourage attention, slow eating, and pleasure, all of which will lead youto eat less — as much as 18 percent less!20 [part0020_split_004.html#ch4ft20]Start with healthy foods first. Starting with a salad or grilled veggies willlead you to eat less.Chew each bite multiple times. You will improve digestion of your food and yourenjoyment of it.Serve food before you put the plate on the table. Leave the serving dish on thecounter rather than in the center of the dining table.Don’t reward exercise by thinking, I just walked 3 miles, so I can have a [fillin the blank]. Exercise is its own reward. Plus, if you have one 20-ounce soda,you have to walk 4.5 miles to burn it off. If you eat one super-sized meal, youhave to run 4 miles a day for one week to burn off that one meal. You can’texercise your way out of a bad diet.Don’t shop hungry. If you are hungry when you shop, you will buy more junk,quick snacks, processed foods, and fewer fruits and veggies.Buy in bulk, but then put food into small bags or containers. We tend to finishwhatever size we start.Make your home a safe zone. Don’t keep tempting junk food, bad snacks, processedfood, cookies, or cake in the house.

They are agreat place to see the face that feeds you and to find much more nutrient-dense,better-tasting food. Vegetables are no more expensive there than in mostsupermarkets and are often local, organic, and fresh and include unusual andfunny varieties that pack more phytonutrients and taste.

Check out localharvest.org to find a market nearyou.Community-supported agriculture (CSA): In most communities now, you can buy a“subscription” for the season to a local farm. Every week or month, depending onwhat you choose, you can pick up or have dropped off at your house a box oflocal, delicious organic fruits and vegetables for a fraction of the cost. SomeCSAs also have eggs or sustainably raised meat or chicken. For cold climates,the season is shorter, but it is a fabulous way to eat well for less.

Asian markets often have wonderful vegetables, includingunusual varieties.Food co-ops: These are found in communities and provide good, fresh, local food.You can buy items in bulk such as whole grains, beans, nuts, and seeds.Supermarkets: The key here is to shop around the perimeter of the store. That iswhere you will find the produce, meat, fish, eggs, and dairy. It is notdanger-free, but it is where you should spend most of your time. The aisles are“danger zones,” so try to find anything that doesn’t contain sugar, salt, ortrans fats. You will be hunting a long time. Sometimes you need to venture downthe aisles to find the beans, nuts, whole grains, salsa, hot sauce, olive oil,vinegar, condiments, and spices. Visit The Daniel Plan website for “SupermarketSavvy — The Good Stuff” and “Supermarket Savvy — The Bad Stuff.”Grocery Shopping TipThe ends of the aisles display the worst foods, such as 2-liter sodas, giantsugared cereal boxes, and worse. In the aisles, the worst food items are at eyelevel; the better-for-you foods are often on the bottom or top shelves.Big ticket stores: Wal-Mart, Costco, Sam’s Club, BJ’s Wholesale, and TraderJoe’s all have great buys at good prices. Explore yours. They increasingly haveorganic foods. You must be careful not to buy more than you need. It is a greatway to stock up on organic olive oil, nuts, sardines, and even fruits andvegetables.

There aretwo parts of the label: the nutrition facts, which are not that helpful; and theingredient list, which is what you need to study.The main thing to know about the nutrition facts is the total calories andserving size. A bag of whole grain baked chips may say 4 servings, but whoshares? The calorie count is per serving, so multiply the serving size bycalorie count to get the true amount you are eating. Look for totalcarbohydrates and carbohydrates from sugar. It should have less than 10 grams orconsider it dessert. More than 5 grams of fiber is good, and more than 10 gramsof protein is also good.The real place to look for what you are actually eating is on the ingredientlist. The good news is that more and more manufacturers are packaging real,whole food that is convenient and good to eat. If you follow these simple rules,you will stay out of trouble:Choose only real food. If there are any words on the label that you don’trecognize or can’t pronounce, are in Latin, or sound like some science project,then put it back on the shelf. A jar of tomatoes, a can of artichokes, a currysauce, a bottle of balsamic vinegar — they are examples of real food.Think five or less. If it is a real food product, it usually has less than fiveingredients. Some newer, healthier products contain more, but they are all realfood.Don’t buy anything with the three most dangerous ingredients. (You have themmemorized by now, don’t you?)Watch out for health claims. Anything with a health claim is almost guaranteedto be bad for you — diet this or low-fat that or trans fat free or low calorieor cholesterol lowering.Be alert to pseudonyms for sugar. There are more than 250 names for hidden sugarin our food supply. Often packaged foods will contain four to six (or more)forms of sugar. Read carefully.What comes first? Ingredients are listed in order of quantity. If you see sugaror salt as the first or second ingredient, then it’s probably not a good idea toeat it. If it has more than 15 grams of sugar, it has more sugar than a glazeddonut.Visit The Daniel Plan website (danielplan.com) for more guidance onunderstanding labels.Health Food Imposters * Sweetened yogurt has more sugar than the average soda. * Watch the soy. Most processed GMO soy foods are harmful, not healthy. Traditional soy products such as tofu, tempeh, and miso are fine. * Meat alternatives or fake meat such as hot dogs or burgers often contain gluten, processed soy, and bad oils. * Protein bars often contain trans fat, high fructose corn syrup or sugar substitutes, and a load of weird ingredients. * Eat only whole food bars made from nuts, seeds, and fruits. * Fruit juice is liquid sugar — a treat, not a health food."},{"pageContent":"HEALTHY EATING ON A BUDGETMaking real food from scratch from real ingredients is cheaper and tastier thanoutsourcing our food making to the industrial food system.

The closer we can get to the food we eat, theshorter the link between field and fork, the better off we will all be. We haveoutsourced our cooking to the industrial food system. By taking back ourkitchens — which we can do simply, easily, and inexpensively — we can create atidal shift in our food system, homes, and communities.Who Knew?The Kluge family grew up in homes where things were either fried or eaten out ofa box or can. They made only two vegetables: boiled cabbage and canned greenbeans. They didn’t have basic cooking implements, such as proper cutting boardsto cut vegetables or even meat. They had some old, dull knives they never usedhidden under the cupboard. Tina, the mom, didn’t know how to chop a vegetable orsauté it. They spent about $1,000 a month on food, half of it eating out infast-food places.So when Dr. Hyman visited the Kluge family, he realized the best way he couldhelp them was not to prescribe medication or tell them to eat less and exercisemore, but to teach them to cook real food from scratch. He got the whole familycooking, washing, peeling, chopping, cutting, and touching real food. He showedthem how to peel garlic, cut onions, and snap asparagus to get rid of the chewyparts. He taught Tina how to sauté them in olive oil and garlic, to roast sweetpotatoes with fennel and olive oil, and to make turkey chili from scratch. Theyeven made fresh salad dressing from olive oil, vinegar, mustard, and salt andpepper.After a happy, filling, healing meal of real food, one of the teens said indisbelief, “Dr. Hyman, do you eat real food like this with your family everynight?”Five days after Dr. Hyman’s visit, Tina texted Dr. Hyman that her family hadalready lost 18 pounds, and she was making his chili from scratch. After threemonths, Tina lost 47 pounds, and her husband and son both lost 30 pounds — fromcooking their own meals at home from scratch.“My mother was given the gift of knowing food through her mother, which she thengifted to me, helping me learn the beautiful connections between gardening,cooking, eating, and wellness,” Dr. Hyman says. “And I have taught that to mychildren who have become wildly gifted cooks — making delicious home-cookedmeals from real ingredients.”The most important food skill you have to create a rich, abundant, healthy lifeis this: cooking. Cooking at home can be faster and cheaper than eating out.Cooking a meal at home with family or friends, sharing the meal, and celebratinglife and food together is one of life’s greatest pleasures.Cooking is one of those acts that we have been doing for thousands of years.Ritual, tradition, and connection around food are part of every culture. In thetime it takes to cook most packaged foods, you can make yourself a simple,delicious, healthy meal from real ingredients. You just have to have them in thehouse ready to go.To succeed in the kitchen:Get the right equipment. A few sharp knives will last a lifetime and make easywork of chopping and cutting vegetables. Good pans are easier to use and createbetter results.Learn basic cooking skills. You can take a class, but today you can learn almostany basic cooking skill online.Start with knife skills. YouTube is a great place to start.Plan ahead. Set time aside for shopping every week. Plan your meals, and makeyour grocery list.

If you can read, you can cook! Getting all the ingredients out,even measured, before you start to cook makes quick work of any meal. Read therecipe carefully. Check out danielplan.com for new recipe ideas.Know when it’s done. The hardest part of cooking is learning when something isdone. The vegetables should still be crisp, not soggy and limp. Overcookedchicken, meat, or fish is chewy and tough. You want to cook it until the pink isjust gone. Fish is ready when it starts to flake apart when touched. Red meatsshould be cooked medium rare or medium.If you are new to cooking from scratch, start with simple meals. Use just a fewingredients. Once you find a few quick simple dinners or lunches that you andyour family like, keep the ingredients in your fridge or freezer so you arenever stuck. Use the forty-day core meal plan in chapter 10 to get started.Another thing is to make the kitchen fun.

No one wants to see us destroy ourown backyards and the very land that sustains us. The erosion of our health hasbecome a social justice issue, a human rights issue. The right to health isamong the most basic of human rights.Individuals and their communities, social networks, and connections havetremendous power to change everything about our food system. Aligning what weeat with who we are and our core values will make it much easier to change ourhabits.

What you choose to put on your fork is a powerful influence to changeour individual health, food production practices, food policies, health carecosts, and the health of the environment. By making simple changes in your foodchoices and cooking real food made from real ingredients, you will not onlyrestore your health and your family’s health, but can also contribute tochanging what is wrong with our food and health care system.The Daniel Plan is about taking back your health.

Experts have coined the phrase “sittingdisease” to describe it.This is what the science is saying: * The University of Missouri discovered that sitting for three to four hours at a time actually shuts off your body’s ability to burn fat efficiently.

Research proves that performing movements such as standing or fidgeting orlightly stretching or (as you will learn) active games, aerobic activity, orstrength training even for just a minute or two every hour throughout your daycan make a big difference to your health and well-being — and combat sittingdisease.9 [part0020_split_005.html#ch5ft9] We suggest that you also use thesemovements to strengthen your relationship with God throughout your busy day.Consider using an hourly reminder to move your body. Not only will you combatsitting disease and improve your health and fitness, but you can also connectwith God through worship, thanksgiving, and prayer.To help you experience motion and devotion throughout your busy day, here are afew ideas to help you from nine to five, or whenever you find yourself sittingfor long periods of time. Set an alarm clock or your phone to remind you everyhour to do two or three of the following:“When movement is experienced as joy, it adorns our lives, makes our days gobetter, and gives us something to look forward to. When movement is joyful andmeaningful, it may even inspire us to do things we never thought possible.”— Scott Kretchmar, Penn State University Professor of Exercise and SportsScience * Stand up for 1 to 2 minutes, and thank God for the many blessings in your day and life. (Chapter 6 will inspire you even more with the power of gratitude for your mental health.) * Stretch your shoulders and arms, but close your eyes to worship God in silence. * Squat up and down 5 to 10 times while thinking about how you are becoming Daniel Strong. With each repetition, thank God for a strong, healthy body and the ability to move. * Stretch your lower back and legs by slowly reaching down to touch your toes. Hold for a few seconds, stand, and repeat again for a minute, and let this be a posture that expresses your devotion to God as you humble yourself, bowing down to God’s will in your life. * Perform deep breathing for a couple of minutes. Inhale God’s strength and goodness. Exhale any worry or concern you may be carrying, releasing it to him with each breath. * Stand or pace when you are talking on the phone. With each step, think about how Daniel listened, walked, and talked with God throughout his day. * Do 10 desk push-ups. Thank God for the use of your muscles and the health of your body. * Go for a walking meeting instead of sitting in a conference room. Use this as a time of fellowship with others at work, like Daniel and his three faithful friends. * Turn on some music and dance for a few minutes to your favorite song or worship music. * Take a 2-minute recess. Use a hula hoop, jump rope, or Frisbee at work. Remind yourself that God loves when you smile and laugh and bring a cheerful and joyful heart to others. Your smile and laughter may be the one thing that brightens another’s day.Cool TipHow would you like to rev up your metabolism, burn up to 200 – 300 extracalories a day, and get In shape without sweating much from 9 to 5?

Every hour stand for 2 minutes, and let this be a reminder to you to stand for God in all you do. Daniel risked being arrested for praying. Let your standing, instead of sitting, strengthen you, not only physically, but also spiritually.Can you imagine the impact performing simple movements such as these, along withregular prayer, will have on your life?"},{"pageContent":"L-LOOSENING BREAKSResearch from the American Council on Exercise, the Mayo Clinic, the AmericanCollege of Sports Medicine, and other established health and fitnessorganizations have determined that regular loosening, or stretching, activitiesperformed throughout your day or before or after your workout can have asignificant impact on your health, fitness, flexibility, and performance.10[part0020_split_005.html#ch5ft10] Take a look at just a few of the benefitsloosening movements or activities can offer you: * Decreases muscle stiffness, increases range of motion, and slows the physiological aging process of your joints * Warms up your body and reduces risk of injury * Helps relieve post-exercise aches and pains * Improves posture and body symmetry * Helps reduce or manage your stress * Increases blood circulation, reduces muscular tension, and enhances muscular relaxation * Improves your body’s overall functional performance * Prepares the body for the stress of exercise * Promotes circulation and prevents injury * Decreases the risk of lower back pain11 [part0020_split_005.html#ch5ft11]Reduced Pain“I played football at the University of Southern California in the early 1970s.From that alone, I had lower back pain and suffered from that greatly all thetime. I had gone to a number of the high-level orthopedic surgeons,chiropractors, and acupuncturists — you pretty much name it. I wanted to be ableto pick up my grandkids and hold them without dropping them because of the pain.Plus, my family was tired of me complaining. So when I heard about a stretchingclass [for one hour], I was the first guy to sign up. I had nothing to lose.“There’s nothing radical about it; it’s very easy going. But after that hour ofpure stretching, I’m a new guy. Now I not only can see my toes, but can actuallytouch them.”— Jim LucasLoosening movements or activities can be performed in two formats: statically ordynamically. Both increase flexibility of joints without stiffness or injury.This is important because flexible muscles, tendons, and ligaments can be lessprone to soreness and injury and can help improve muscular performance. Think ofyour muscles as rubber bands. If you take a rubber band and quickly andforcefully stretch it past the point that it was intended to, the band willbreak. But by stretching it a little at a time and more each time, you canstretch it out farther and farther. By performing regular loosening breaks, youcan increase the pliability of your joints to prevent “breaking,” or injury.Dynamic loosening, stretching as you are moving, prior to your exercise is thebest way to warm up your body. Static loosening movements after you exercise isone of the best ways to enhance flexibility as well as minimize post-exerciseaches and pains. But you can also perform loosening breaks throughout your dayfor fifteen to thirty seconds anywhere, anytime:"},{"pageContent":"STANDING ARM CIRCLES 1. Stand upright, with your feet hip-width apart, knees slightly bent, and your arms extended out to your sides, raised to shoulder level with your palms facing the floor. 2. Next, begin to make small, forward circular motions (about one foot in diameter) with your hands and arms in a controlled and slow fashion. Perform ten times. 3. Now, begin to increase the size of your shoulder arm circles by progressing to medium and then to larger circular motions, until you are reaching as far forward and back as you comfortably can (e.g., above your head and below your hips). Perform ten times. 4. Repeat the motion by following steps 2 and 3, but in reverse. 5. Perform ten times or for 15 to 20 seconds in each direction."},{"pageContent":"TOE TOUCHES 1.

Hold the stretch for 10 to 30 seconds.Note: Warm up your muscles before performing this or any static stretch move.Also, if you have lower back problems, do not try toe touches like this.Instead, you may want to try a seated chair toe touch.Alternative: Seated in a chair, with one leg extended, reach forward with bothhands, bending from the waist, trying to reach your shins or toes.If you have the time, you can participate in a class and enjoy loosening up fora full hour or more.

Many of us think strength training is only forathletes. But you don’t have to be an athlete to appreciate the benefitsstrength training can have on your body, mind, and life. Those who performstrength training on a regular basis, with a smile on their face, will be thefirst to tell you their body and mind feel years younger.

Perform one to three sets (a group ofrepetitions) at a moderate intensity for a minimum of two or three days a week.Remember, if you only have time for one or two strength training movements, youwill still find a number of benefits. You can perform youthful strength trainingexercises using just your body weight as part of your prayerful movementsthroughout your day and still see good results.For example, you could perform the following movements several times each day:[../images/00011.jpeg] Ten squats [../images/00011.jpeg] Ten dips [../images/00011.jpeg] Ten lunges(See chapter 9 for details on performing these movements correctly.)Can you imagine how fit you would become performing this thirty-repetitionroutine even four times during your workday on a regular basis?

With each check, wegain confidence to make things happen and move closer to our long-term goals.Imagine on Sunday evening, before your week begins, you were to sit down andpull out your smart phone or calendar and create a written “agreement” withyourself in which on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 6:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.you commit to your fitness, such as walking.

At the beginning, I was 280 pounds and would get out ofbreath just putting on my shoes. I wanted to get healthy and look better. Todaymy goals have changed.

Remember, one of theessentials of lifelong fitness is to do what you love. But one thing to be awareof when you perform the same exercises over and over is that your body canbecome accustomed to the movement. So cross-training, a variety of movements oractivities, enhances your overall performance and helps you in a number of ways: * Prevents boredom * Protects joints and body from overuse * Extends longevity in sport or activity * Prevents burnout15 [part0020_split_005.html#ch5ft15]It takes your body about two to four weeks to get used to a routine, so shakethings up with cross-training and try something new every few weeks. Watch howyour body responds.2. Increase the frequency. If you have been successful at exercising for twodays a week, give it a try to bump up your exercise to three days a week. Byincreasing the number of days you exercise, you will naturally challenge yourbody and create even greater fitness.3. Increase the intensity. Increasing the speed, elevation, pace, or duration ofyour aerobic activity just a little bit could be just what you need to improveyour cardiovascular fitness and boost your metabolism. For example, try intervaltraining. If you are a walker, instead of walking at a steady pace, try walkingat a moderate pace for one minute and then as fast as you can for one minute.You could even jog or run for the fast minute if you’d like. You may want tomonitor your heart rate as you challenge and change your intensity throughoutyour exercise.Increase the number of reps, sets, or weight of the resistance of your youthfulstrength training movements. You can also perform movements that are total body,called “compound exercises,” such as Kettlebell swings that use your upper andlower body. Another option is to manipulate the speed of your movements, eithermoving slowly — five seconds on the upward motion and five seconds on thedownward motion — or exploding on the way up with each movement.4. Change your equipment or your environment. If you are used to using dumbbellsin your strength training, how about using a medicine ball or a stability ballto change things up? If you are used to going to the gym and waiting in line fora treadmill, an elliptical, or a bike, what about using one of thosefunny-looking machines that no one uses, such as the rowing machine, skimachine, or Versa climber? Why not grab that jump rope gathering dust in thecorner of the gym?Did you know you can burn almost two to three times more calories usingtotal-body machines or exercises compared with slow walking on a treadmill?Plus, you will shake things up a bit by using different muscle groups indifferent ways. Also, if you are used to exercising indoors, go outside everyfew days. If you are an outside kind of person, why not give an aerobic orspinning class a try? Changing your scenery, meeting new people, and tryingsomething different can be just what you need to keep your fitness routinefresh.5. Decrease your rest interval. By decreasing the amount of time you rest inbetween exercises or sets, you will naturally increase the intensity of yourworkouts and cause your body to adapt and become stronger.6. Time your exercise routines. For your next workout, try to beat your previoustime. This type of training provides you with a tangible score to challengeyourself and cause your body to adapt to a new intensity.7. Give yourself a break. Believe it or not, one of the worst things you can doto your body is to exercise too much with no rest. So one of the best things youcan do for your body, especially if you are challenging yourself on a regularbasis, is to take a break. Your body will thank you, and you will come back evenmore excited and ready to take your fitness to another level.Buddy UpWhat do Peyton Manning, Oprah Winfrey, Michael Jordan, George W.

We want that onedecision to last for a lifetime, which requires a renewed mind and sustainedfocus. In a world where so many distractions compete for your attention, it ismore important than ever to stop the busyness in your head and focus on God’splan and priorities for your life. The bottom line is that whatever gets yourattention gets you.Unfortunately, it is the loss of focus that causes many people to cycle throughhopeful starts and many failed stops as other things vie for their attention. Wewill help you optimize your brain health, renew your mind, increase your focus,and live with a purpose-driven mind-set.All of the information in this book is designed to help you win the war betweenthe thoughtful part of your brain that knows what you should do and yourpleasure centers that always want gratification now. Your pleasure centers, deepin the brain, are always looking for a good time: They crave the doublecheeseburgers, will stand in line for the fresh cinnamon rolls, and convince youto stay on the couch in front of the TV for another hour instead of going forthat run.“To be made new in the attitude of your minds; and to put on the new self,created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness” (Ephesians 4:23 –24).Left unchecked, your pleasure centers encourage thoughts such as * We deserve it. * Come on, let’s have some fun! * You’re so uptight! * Live a little. * I already had one bowl of ice cream; just one more won’t hurt. * I’ll be better tomorrow. I promise.Without focus, your brain can ruin your health. To balance your pleasurecenters, there is an area in the front part of your brain called the prefrontalcortex, which helps you think about what you do before you do it. It is thebrain’s brake that stops you from saying or doing stupid things. The prefrontalcortex is called the executive part of the brain because it acts like the bossat work and is involved with executive functions, such as focus, forethought,judgment, planning, and self-control. It thinks about your future, not justabout what you want in the moment. Instead of thinking about the chocolate cake,it is the rational voice in your head that helps you avoid having a big belly,is concerned about your bulging medical bills, and has the ability to say no andmean it.When your prefrontal cortex is strong, it reins in your pleasure centers so thatyou can enjoy life, but in a thoughtful, measured way. To get healthier andhappier for the long run, it is critical to strengthen your brain."},{"pageContent":"CHANGE YOUR BRAIN,CHANGE YOUR HEALTH [part0003.html#sec9]YOUR BRAIN IS THE MOST AMAZING ORGAN. Even though it is only 2 percent of yourbody’s weight, it uses 20 to 30 percent of the calories you consume and 20percent of the oxygen and blood flow in your body. It is the most expensive realestate in your body that requires the most resources. It has 100 billion nervecells and more connections in it than there are stars in the universe.When your brain works right, you work right. When your brain is troubled, youare much more likely to have trouble. With a healthy brain, people are happierand physically healthier, because they make better decisions. People withhealthy brains are often wealthier and more successful because of those betterdecisions. (Are you beginning to see a pattern?) When the brain is not healthy,people are sadder, sicker, poorer, and less successful.It is your brain that pushes you away from the table, telling you that you havehad enough. It is your brain that gives you permission to have the third bowl ofice cream but chooses berries instead. If you want better health, strive to havea healthier brain. Ultimately, boosting brain health is about three specificstrategies: (1) brain envy — you have to passionately care about your brain, (2)avoiding anything that hurts it, and (3) engaging in habits that boost itshealth.Brain envy is a term Dr. Amen coined after looking at tens of thousands of brainSPECT scans of patients at the Amen Clinics. A brain SPECT (single photonemission computed tomography) scan evaluates blood flow and activity patterns inthe brain. Dr. Amen’s research clearly shows that healthy SPECT scans come frompeople who make smarter decisions and act in a way to bring health and goodnessinto their lives.Yet few people ever think about their brains, much less care about them. We letlittle kids hit soccer balls with their heads, do dangerous gymnastic routines,or play tackle football. In football and hockey, we cheer big hits, now known tocause lasting brain damage.Saving My Brain“A number of years ago my friend Doctor Cyrus Raji and his colleagues publisheda study reporting that as a person’s weight went up, the size of his or herbrain went down. That horrified me. I never want to purposefully do anything toharm the health of my brain. That information motivated me to get to a healthyweight so I could have a healthy mind.“I first saw my brain in 1991 with the then-new technology of brain SPECTimaging. My brain looked older than I was. It motivated me to have what I call‘brain envy’ and make radical changes with my health. I stopped drinking dietsoda, started sleeping more than six hours a night, began exercising more, andfocused on having more fun. I was vigilant about keeping sugar out of my diet,boosted my vegetable and lean protein intake, and made sure to always eatbreakfast. Over time these things have become a natural part of my life.”— Dr. AmenSo why don’t we care more about our brains? Because most people never see theirbrains. You can see the wrinkles in your face or the fat around your belly anddo something when you don’t like how they look, but the brain is different. Ifyou could look at your brain, all of a sudden everything would change. You couldsee if yours is troubled and do something about it.Since most people will not have the opportunity to look at their own brains,here are seven warning signs your brain may be in trouble. If you have any ofthese, it is time to develop brain envy and start taking much better care of it.1. Poor memory. If your memory is worse than it was ten years ago, it is a signyour brain is struggling.2. Poor judgment/impulsiveness. If you struggle with consistent problems of poorjudgment or impulsive behavior, your brain may be troubled.3. Short attention span/distractibility. Having a short attention span or beingeasily distracted could be a sign of brain dysfunction, meaning it is time tostart taking better care of it.4. Depression. From time to time all of us feel sad, but when sad or depressedfeelings persist, it is called clinical depression and is usually associatedwith lower activity in the brain. Boosting brain function often has a verypositive effect on mood. Many of The Daniel Plan choices have anti-depressantproperties. Exercise, eating right, taking supplements such as fish oil, andlearning not to believe every thought have been shown independently to boostmood.1 [part0020_split_006.html#ch6ft1] If depression persists despite followingThe Daniel Plan strategies, please see a mental health care professional.5. Obesity or being overweight. In studies at the Amen Clinics, we have foundthat as your weight goes up, your ability to think and reason goes down, whichmeans that over time, if you don’t get your weight under control, it will becomeharder for you to use your own good judgment.6. Low energy. When people feel physically tired, it is often due to low brainfunction.7. Chronic insomnia/sleep apnea. Another sign that your brain may be in troubleis a lack of sleep or sleep apnea. Research suggests that people who get lessthan seven hours of sleep at night have lower overall blood flow to the brainand poorer cognitive functioning.2 [part0020_split_006.html#ch6ft2] Sleep apnea(snoring loudly, stopping breathing at night, or feeling chronically tiredduring the day) increases a person’s risk for obesity, depression, andAlzheimer’s disease. If you have insomnia or sleep apnea, it is critical to getthem under control.Start boosting your brain health by avoiding anything that hurts the brain.Illegal drugs, too much alcohol, brain trauma, environmental toxins, andinfections are obvious. Now we also know that a poor diet, especially one highin sugar and simple carbohydrates, increases the risk of Alzheimer’s diseasefourfold.3 [part0020_split_006.html#ch6ft3] Hypertension, diabetes, high bloodsugar levels, chemotherapy, insomnia, and obesity can all damage the brain andlead to smaller brain volume and poorer cognitive abilities. Even high normalblood pressure and high normal fasting blood sugar levels lead to brain atrophy.In one large study, hypertensive individuals had 9 percent less brain volumethan those who had normal blood pressure.4 [part0020_split_006.html#ch6ft4]There are now more than a hundred studies reporting that being overweight orobese damages brain tissue and function. Untreated depression, excessive stress,low hormone levels, such as thyroid or testosterone, and a lack of exercise orexcessive exercise also hurt the brain.When the two men first met, Pastor Warren told Dr. Amen that he never feltmotivated to get healthy for his heart and didn’t really care about livinglonger or being “sexier.” But when Pastor Warren heard that as his weight wentup the size of his brain would go down, it motivated him to change. Hismotivation came from his brain — he wanted to protect his.Finding SleepAs Avery Parsons approached menopause, deteriorating sleep was at the top of herbody’s changes. With dramatic hormone shifts, Avery’s sweet tooth was worse thanever. Getting through the afternoon required an extra latte or handfuls ofchocolate or both! This not only spiked her blood sugar levels, but also createdproblems sleeping at night.Recognizing the harmful cycle she had created, Avery turned to a list of DanielPlan sleep tips to get back on track. Bit by bit, she improved her sleep.Cutting out the chocolate binges was the first priority. If she had anycaffeine, she consumed it before noon. Avery also began preparing for sleep byturning off all electronics, dimming the lights, and putting on soft, relaxingmusic. Choosing to read a book helped relax her mind and send the message thatit was nearing time for bed. Instead of relying on problematic sleep aids, shetook 200 – 400mg of magnesium citrate to calm down her nervous system.To start your own personal sleep hygiene routine, visit danielplan.com for alist of ideas.The last step to boosting brain health is to engage in regular brain healthyhabits, including moderate physical exercise (which you read about in chapter5), new learning, an amazing Daniel Plan – friendly eating plan (see chapter 10for a 40-day meal plan), and simple supplements such as a multiplevitamin/mineral complex and omega 3 fatty acids. Omega 3 fatty acids improvemood and lessen anxiety, and the combination of vitamins B6, B12, and folic acidenhance memory and cognition.5 [part0020_split_006.html#ch6ft5] Also, being at ahealthy weight, being physically healthy, and getting adequate sleep enhancesbrain function, as does having regular prayer and stress management practices.Think of the brain as a computer with both hardware and software. Once youoptimize the physical functioning of the brain (its hardware), you optimize yourmind (the software). But there is one more crucial behavior for your brainhealth — avoiding chronic stress."},{"pageContent":"THE BRAIN AND STRESSStress is a normal part of everyday life. Bad traffic, a big deadline, a fightat home — hundreds of things can stress us out. When the event passes, so doesthe stress, and we can breathe a big sigh of relief. With chronic stress,however, there is no relief. Stemming from things like family discord, financialhardships, health issues, work conflicts, or school trouble, chronic stress isunrelenting. And it affects far too many of us. In a poll by the AmericanPsychological Association, a whopping 80 percent of Americans say they feelsignificant stress.6 [part0020_split_006.html#ch6ft6] That spells trouble foryour brain and body.Don’t get us wrong — a little stress can be a good thing. When stress hits, thebrain tells your body to start pumping out adrenaline (epinephrine) andcortisol, two hormones released by the adrenal glands. Within seconds your heartstarts to pound faster, your breathing quickens, your blood courses fasterthrough your veins, and your mind is on heightened alert. You’re ready foranything — running away from a would-be mugger, giving a speech in front of aroomful of peers, or taking an exam.These stress hormones are the primary chemicals of the fight-or-flight response.They are especially useful when you face an immediate threat, such as arattlesnake in your front yard. The human brain is so advanced that merelyimagining a stressful event will cause the body to react to the perceived threatas if it were actually happening. You can literally scare your body into astress response. The brain is one powerful organ.Brief surges of stress hormones are normal and beneficial. They motivate you todo a good job at work, study hard, or pay your bills on time. Those short burstsof adrenaline and cortisol are not the problem with stress. The problem is thatfor many of us, the stress reactions never stop. Traffic, bills, work, school,family conflict, not enough sleep, health issues, and jam-packed schedules keepus in a constant state of stress. Take note that it isn’t just the bad stuff inlife that causes stress. Even happy events, such as having a baby or getting apromotion, can be major stressors.[../images/00016.gif]Chronic stress harms the brain. It constricts blood flow, which lowers overallbrain function and prematurely ages your brain. A series of studies looked atlong-term exposure to stress hormones, especially cortisol, and its effect onbrain function in varying age groups. The older adults with continuously highlevels of cortisol performed worse on memory tests than older adults withmoderate-to-low cortisol levels. The older adults with high cortisol levels alsohad a 14 percent smaller hippocampus, the area involved with memory.7[part0020_split_006.html#ch6ft7] The hippocampus is part of the stress responsesystem and sends out signals to halt the production of cortisol once a threathas vanished. But when the number of brain cells in the hippocampus is depleted,it no longer sends out this signal, which results in the release of even greateramounts of cortisol.Excessive amounts of cortisol affect other areas of the brain too. Canadianresearchers used functional brain imaging studies to show that exposure tostress hormones is associated with decreased activity, not only in thehippocampus, but also in the parts of the brain that control cognitive functionand emotional balance.When stress hurts your brain, it can also ravage your body. Your body respondsto the way you think, feel, and act. Because of this brain-body connection,whenever you feel stressed, your body tries to tell you that something isn’tright. For example, high blood pressure or a stomach ulcer might develop after aparticularly stressful event, such as the death of a loved one. Chronic stressweakens your body’s immune system, making you more likely to get colds, flubugs, and other infections during emotionally difficult times. Stress has alsobeen implicated in heart disease, hypertension, and even cancer.Your boss is handing out pink slips. You just had a fight with your teenagedaughter. You are late for an appointment. How do you react? You may try to calmyour nerves with chocolate, ice cream, French fries, or potato chips (or all ofthe above). And there’s a scientific reason why. Stress and cortisol are linkedto increases in appetite and cravings for carbs and sweet stuff that can makeyou fat.“Give all your worries and cares to God, for he cares about you” (1 Peter 5:7NLT).Living with stress on a daily basis makes you more likely to have issues withyour weight for a number of other reasons. For example, chronic stress usuallygoes hand in hand with a lack of sleep. That pumps up cortisol production andthrows appetite-control hormones out of balance. That should explain why youfeel as if health flies out the window during stressful situations. So it’s nosurprise if you overeat, crave sugary treats, and store more fat.Common Signs and Symptoms of Stress[../images/00011.jpeg] Frequent headaches or migraines[../images/00011.jpeg] Gritting or grinding teeth[../images/00011.jpeg] Stammering or tremors[../images/00011.jpeg] Neck ache, back pain, or muscle spasms[../images/00011.jpeg] Dry mouth or problems swallowing[../images/00011.jpeg] Frequent colds, infections, or herpes sores[../images/00011.jpeg] Stomach pain or nausea[../images/00011.jpeg] Difficulty breathing or sighing[../images/00011.jpeg] Chest pain or heart palpitations[../images/00011.jpeg] Poor sexual desire or performance[../images/00011.jpeg] Increased anger, frustration, or irritability[../images/00011.jpeg] Depression, frequent, or wild mood swings[../images/00011.jpeg] Increased or decreased appetite[../images/00011.jpeg] Insomnia, nightmares, or disturbing dreams[../images/00011.jpeg] Difficulty concentrating, racing thoughts[../images/00011.jpeg] Trouble learning new information[../images/00011.jpeg] Overreaction to petty annoyances[../images/00011.jpeg] Reduced work efficiency or productivity[../images/00011.jpeg] Excessive defensiveness or suspiciousness[../images/00011.jpeg] Constant fatigue or weakness[../images/00011.jpeg] Frequent use of over-the-counter drugs[../images/00011.jpeg] Excessive gambling or impulse buying8[part0020_split_006.html#ch6ft8]Since chronic stress can make you feel tired and achy, you are less inclined toexercise. Of course, you can’t blame stress for all your poor health and weightgain, but you can see how easily it happens.Chronic stress drains your emotional well-being and is associated with anxiety,depression, and Alzheimer’s disease, all of which can affect your body. If youexperience some form of emotional trauma — say you’re involved in a car accident— your emotional system becomes very active, which can make you more upset anddepressed. Then the battle of the bulge and unhappiness with your body can feeloverwhelming.Chronic stress can attack you at any stage of your life. When chronic stresshits you or someone in your circle, everyone suffers. You’ve heard of thetrickle-down economic theory; there’s also a trickle-down stress theory. Whenthe boss is stressed out, everyone at work is stressed out. When your spouse isstressed out, everyone in the family is stressed out.Stop the trickle-down effect and calm stress. Here are a few strategies thatwill boost your mood and your decision making.1. Pray on a regular basis. Decades of research have shown that prayer calmsstress and enhances brain function. Dr. Andrew Newberg at Thomas JeffersonUniversity used brain SPECT imaging to study the neurobiology of prayer andmeditation in those that dedicated time to those disciplines regularly. He founddistinctive changes in brain activity as the mind went into a prayerful ormeditative state. Specifically, activity decreased in the parts of the braininvolved in generating a sense of three-dimensional orientation in space. Theyalso found increased activity in the prefrontal cortex associated with attentionspan and thoughtfulness.9 [part0020_split_006.html#ch6ft9] Prayer tunes peoplein, not out.The benefits of prayer go far beyond stress relief. Studies have shown that italso improves attention and planning, reduces depression and anxiety, decreasessleepiness, and protects the brain from cognitive decline associated with normalaging.Prayer Start“The focus for me was staying focused on God — actually sitting down and havingmy quiet time. Once I got into the routine of doing it regularly at the sametime of the day, every day, in the morning, then [everything else with TheDaniel Plan] really started falling in place even more.”— Cindy SproulAs we mentioned in chapter 3, King David practiced biblical meditation andprayer. You can too, just about anywhere, anytime. If you’re at work, you cansimply close the door to your office, sit in your chair, close your eyes, andpray. At home, you can sit on the edge of your bed and spend a couple minutescalming your mind and focusing on God. The Bible says, “Whatever is true,whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely,whatever is admirable — if anything is excellent or praiseworthy — think aboutsuch things” (Philippians 4:8).God wants us to think deeply on his goodness and loveliness. This is biblicalmeditation. The Bible says, “In repentance and rest is your salvation, inquietness and trust is your strength” (Isaiah 30:15). You need to regularly,repeatedly set time aside to quiet yourself and refocus your thoughts on thegreatness and power of God.Besides growing your relationship with God and building a foundation forspiritual health, prayer offers many health and stress-relief benefits.Physicians Larry Dossey (Healing Words), Dale Matthews (The Faith Factor), andothers have written books outlining the scientific evidence of the medicalbenefits of prayer and other meditation.10 [part0020_split_006.html#ch6ft10]Some of these benefits include reduced feelings of stress, lower cholesterollevels, improved sleep, reduced anxiety and depression, fewer headaches, relaxedmuscles, and longer life spans. People who pray or read the Bible every day are40 percent less likely to suffer from hypertension than others.11[part0020_split_006.html#ch6ft11]A 1998 Duke University study of 577 men and women hospitalized for physicalillness showed that the more patients used positive spiritual coping strategies(seeking spiritual support from friends and religious leaders, having faith inGod, praying), the lower their level of depressive symptoms and the higher theirquality of life.12 [part0020_split_006.html#ch6ft12] A 1996 survey of 269 familyphysicians found that 99 percent believed prayer, meditation, or other spiritualand religious practices can be helpful in medical treatment; more than half saidthey currently incorporate these practices into treatment of patients.13[part0020_split_006.html#ch6ft13]2. Learn to delegate. It seems as if being busy is a sort of badge of honor. Askanyone what they have planned for the day, and it’s likely they will respond bytelling you how incredibly busy they are. “I’m finishing a project for work,hosting a dinner party, making the kids’ costumes for the school play,volunteering at church, and going to my book group.” Phew! It can stress you outjust thinking about all that.“You will keep in perfect peace all who trust in you, all whose thoughts arefixed on you!” (Isaiah 26:3 NLT).Ten Names of God to Dwell On 1. Jehovah Rapha — the God who heals, who makes healthful 2. El Roiy — the God who sees me 3. Jehovah Jirah — the Lord who provides 4. El Shadai — All sufficient one, Lord God Almighty 5. Jehovah Nissi — the Lord our banner of loving protection 6. Jehovah Oz — the Lord my strength 7. Adonai — the Sovereign Lord God 8. Jehovah Shammah — the Lord is there 9. Jehovah Shalom — Our perfect peace 10. Jehovah Raah — the Lord my shepherdNews flash! You don’t have to accept every invitation, take on every project, orvolunteer for every activity that comes your way. Two of the greatest lifeskills you can learn are the art of delegation and the ability to say no. Whensomeone asks you to do something, a good first response would be, “Let me thinkabout it.” Then you can take the time to process the request to see if it fitswith your schedule, desires, and goals. When you have too much on your plate,delegate.3. Listen to soothing music. Music has healing power that can bring peace to astressful mind. Of course, it depends on the type of music you listen to.Listening to uplifting music that reminds you of God’s truth can have a calmingeffect and reduce stress and calm anxiety.4. Consider calming scents. The scent of lavender has been used since ancienttimes for its calming, stress-relieving properties. This popular aroma has beenthe subject of countless research studies, which show that it reduces cortisollevels and promotes relaxation and stress reduction. Add a few drops of lavenderoil to your bath or set dried lavender in your bedroom. Many other scents, suchas geranium, rose, cardamom, sandalwood, and chamomile, are considered to have acalming effect that reduces stress.5. Take a calming supplement. Some supplements may be helpful in soothingstress, but take these under the supervision of a health care professional.B vitamins help the brain affect mood and thinking.L-Theanine is an amino acid mainly found naturally in the green tea plant. Itpenetrates the brain and produces significant increases in the anti-depressantneurotransmitters serotonin and/or dopamine concentrations. Note: Pregnant womenand nursing mothers should avoid L-theanine supplements.GABA: Gama-aminobutyric acid (GABA) works in much the same way as anti-anxietydrugs and anticonvulsants. This means it has a calming effect for people whostruggle with temper, irritability, and anxiety, whether these symptoms relateto anxiety.6. Laugh more. There is a growing body of scientific literature suggesting thatlaughter counteracts stress and is good for the immune system. It’s no joke! Onestudy of cancer patients found that laughter reduced stress and improved cellactivity associated with increased resistance to the disease.14[part0020_split_006.html#ch6ft14] According to University of California –Irvine’s Professor Lee Berk, “If we took what we know about the medical benefitsof laughter and bottled it up, it would require FDA approval.” Laughter lowersthe flow of dangerous stress hormones. Laughter also eases digestion and soothesstomachaches, a common symptom of chronic stress. Plus, a good rollicking guffawincreases the release of endorphins, which make you feel better and morerelaxed. Laughter truly may be the best medicine when it comes to stress relief.The average child laughs hundreds of times a day. The average adult laughs onlya dozen times a day. Inject more humor into your everyday life. Watch comedies(which could be a helpful form of TV), go to humorous plays, read joke books,and swap funny stories with your friends and family.We can’t stress enough (pun intended) how important it is to learn to laugh atyourself too. When you drop the milk jug and it goes splashing across thekitchen floor, when you call a business associate by the wrong name, or when youstumble over your words while teaching a class, be the first to chuckle. Whenyou stop taking yourself so seriously, your stress levels will subside.“A cheerful heart is good medicine” (Proverbs 17:22)"},{"pageContent":"[../images/00017.gif]RENEWYOUR MIND [part0003.html#sec10]NOW THAT YOU KNOW how to optimize your brain health, we want to focus on thepower center of your brain — your thoughts.Philippians 4:8 (see page 196) is one of the most powerful, emotionally healingverses in the Bible. One of the cornerstones to success on The Daniel Plan is toreign over your moment-by-moment thoughts, so that with God’s help you can stayin control of your behavior.Neuroscience teaches us that every time you have a thought, your brain releaseschemicals that make you feel good or bad. Thoughts exert a powerful influenceover your life and body. Whenever you have a happy, hopeful, or optimisticthought, your brain releases chemicals that raise your spirits and encourage youto feel good. Positive thoughts exert a physical response and have the power toimmediately relax and soothe your body. They tend to warm your hands, relax yourmuscles, calm and soothe your breathing, and help your heart beat in a healthierrhythm.Try this exercise now: Take a minute, close your eyes, and think of the lasttime you felt truly loved. When most people do this exercise, they feel a deepsense of happiness and physical relaxation.The opposite is also true. When you have an angry, anxious, hopeless, orhelpless thought, your brain releases chemicals that stress your body anddisrupt how you feel both physically and emotionally. Take a minute, close youreyes, and think of the last time you felt really angry. How did that make youfeel? Most people feel tense, their breathing becomes shallower, their handsbecome colder, and they feel angry and unhappy. Now go back to the firstexercise before you continue reading!Thoughts are automatic. They just happen. They are based on complex chemicalreactions and information from the past. And what most people don’t know is thatthoughts are sneaky and they lie. They lie a lot. It is often theseuninvestigated thoughts that provide the emotional fuel for anger, anxiety,depression, and unhealthy behaviors such as overeating.Think on God’s CharacterGod is all-powerful: “Ah, Sovereign LORD, you have made the heavens and theearth by your great power and outstretched arm. Nothing is too hard for you”(Jeremiah 32:17).God is love: “For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nordemons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nordepth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from thelove of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Romans 8:38 – 39).God is all-knowing: “Before a word is on my tongue, you, LORD, know itcompletely. You hem me in behind and before, and you lay your hand upon me. Suchknowledge is too wonderful for me, too lofty for me to attain” (Psalm 139:4 –6).God is merciful: “Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are inChrist Jesus, because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit who gives lifehas set you free from the law of sin and death” (Romans 8:1 – 2).God is faithful: “Because of the LORD’S great love we are not consumed, for hiscompassions never fail. They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness”(Lamentations 3:22 – 23).Plus, if you never question your erroneous, negative thoughts, you believe them100 percent and then you act as if the lies in your head are true. For example,if you think your husband never listens to you, even though he has on manyoccasions, you act as if he doesn’t, and you feel justified in yelling at him.If you think you are a failure, even though you have had many successes, you aremore likely to give up easily.Over the last forty years, mental health practitioners have developed cognitivebehavioral therapy to help people rein in and control their erroneous thoughtpatterns. When you correct negative thought patterns, it is an effectivetreatment for anxiety disorders, depression, relationship problems, and evenovereating. Researchers from Sweden found that people who were trained to talkback to their negative thoughts lost seventeen pounds in ten weeks and continuedto lose weight over eighteen months, proving this technique works long term.15[part0020_split_006.html#ch6ft15]To get and stay healthy, start by noticing your thoughts and questioning them.Whenever you feel sad, mad, nervous, or out of control, ask yourself if they arereally true. It is often the little lies we tell ourselves that keep us fat,depressed, and feebleminded. Being overweight or unhappy is as much a “thinkingdisorder” as it is an eating or mood disorder."},{"pageContent":"IS IT TRUE?“Is it true?” Carry these three words with you everywhere you go. They caninterrupt your thoughts and short circuit an episode of bingeing, depression, oreven panic. One of our participants weighed 425 pounds when he first joined TheDaniel Plan. When one of the doctors asked him about his weight, he said that hehad no control over his appetite. That was his automatic response, “I have nocontrol.”“Is it true?” the doctor asked. “You really have NO control over your eating?”The man paused, then said, “No. That really isn’t true, I do have some control.”“But just by thinking that you have no control, you have just given yourselfpermission to eat anything you want at any time you want,” the doctor replied.It is the little lies that you tell yourself — such as “I have no control” or“It is my genetics” — that steal your health.One of the most important steps in getting healthy in a lasting way is to getcontrol of your mind. Whenever you feel anxious, sad, obsessive, or out ofcontrol, write down the thoughts that are going through your head. Recordingthoughts helps to get them out of your head. Then ask yourself if the thoughtsmake sense or are really true. For example, if you hear yourself thinking, Ihave no control, write that down. Then ask yourself, “Is it true? Is thatthought really true?” If not, replace that negative, false thought with correctinformation.Common LiesHere are some of the common little lies we have heard The Daniel Planparticipants say:“I can’t eat healthy because I travel.” We are amused by this one, because allof us — Pastor Warren, Dr. Hyman, Dr. Amen, and Sean Foy — travel a lot. It justtakes a little forethought.“My whole family is fat; it is in my genes.” Genes account for only 20 to 30percent of your health. The vast majority of health problems are driven by baddecisions. Many healthy people have the genes that increase the risk of obesity,but they do not make the decisions that make it likely to happen.“I can’t afford to get healthy.” Being sick is always more expensive thangetting healthy.“I can’t find the time to work out.” The extra energy exercise will help you beeven more efficient in the long run and save you time.“It’s Easter … Memorial Day … July 4th, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas,Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday.” There isalways an excuse to hurt yourself.When you stop believing these lies and replace them with accurate thinking andGod’s truth and promises, your response to life events will shift, and you willfeel less stressed and more hopeful. Instead of worrying about tomorrow, you canlinger on truths such as Jeremiah 29:11: “ ‘For I know the plans I have foryou,’ declares the LORD, ‘plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans togive you hope and a future.’ “"},{"pageContent":"HOW WE DISTORT OUR THOUGHTSOver the years, therapists have identified a number of negative thoughts thatkeep people stuck in bad habits:1. Overgeneralization. This usually involves thoughts with words such as always,never, every time, or everyone and makes a situation out to be worse than itreally is. Here are some examples:I have always been fat; it will never change.Truth to Combat Lies“So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. Iwill strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous righthand” (Isaiah 41:10).“But [God] said to me, ‘My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is madeperfect in weakness.’ Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about myweaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me” (2 Corinthians 12:9).“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Takemy yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and youwill find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light”(Matthew 11:28–30).“The LORD your God is with you, the Mighty Warrior who saves. He will take greatdelight in you; in his love he will no longer rebuke you, but will rejoice overyou with singing” (Zephaniah 3:17).“Let us then approach God’s throne of grace with confidence, so that we mayreceive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need” (Hebrews 4:16).“Take delight in the LORD, and he will give you the desires of your heart”(Psalm 37:4).Every time I get stressed, I have to eat something.I don’t like any of the foods that are good for me.Overgeneralizations creep into your mind and have an immediate, negative effecton your mood. Overgeneralizations make you believe you have no control over youractions and behaviors and that you are incapable of changing them.2. Thinking with your feelings. These negative thoughts occur when you have afeeling about something and you assume your feeling is correct. Feelings arecomplex and are often rooted in powerful memories from the past. Feelings, likethoughts, can lie too. These thoughts usually begin with the words “I feel.” Forexample:I feel like a failure.I feel God has abandoned me.I feel hungry and must eat or I will get sick.Whenever you have a strong negative feeling, check it out. Look for the evidencebehind the feeling. Is it based on events or experiences from the past?3. Predicting the future. Predicting the worst in a situation causes animmediate sense of anxiety, which can trigger cravings for sugar or refinedcarbs and make you feel that you need to eat to calm your nerves. What makesfuture-telling thoughts so toxic is that your mind tends to make happen what itsees.Healthy food will be expensive, taste like cardboard, and won’t fill me up.I can’t change my habits for the long term.My spouse or my kids will never do this with me.4. Blame. When you blame something or someone else for the problems in yourlife, you become a victim of circumstances, as though you can’t do anything tochange your situation. Blaming thoughts can keep you unhealthy and unhappy. Behonest and ask yourself if you have a tendency to say things such as …“It’s your fault I’m out of shape because you won’t exercise with me.”“It’s not my fault I eat too much; my mom taught me to clean my plate.”“If restaurants didn’t give such big servings, I wouldn’t be so overweight.”One of the participants of The Daniel Plan said he was fat because everyone inhis family was overweight. It was just his genetics. “Is that true?” we asked.“This really doesn’t have anything to do with how much you eat?” He paused andsaid, “No, it’s really not true. In fact, not all my siblings are overweight.”Whenever you begin a sentence with “It’s your fault that I …,” it can ruin yourlife. These thoughts make you a victim. And when you’re a victim, you becomepowerless to change your behavior.5. Denial. These thoughts prevent you from seeing the truth.I have plenty of time to work on getting healthy.If I don’t buy sugar cereals, my kids won’t eat breakfast in the morning.I can stop consuming alcohol anytime I want. I just don’t want to quit.I only overeat when I’m stressed, not every day.Now it’s time to learn how to develop a little mental discipline and turn yournegative thinking patterns into positive, accurate, healthy thinking, similar tohow we encouraged you with spiritual discipline in chapter 3. We want you tolearn how to discipline your thoughts to be honest and helpful. A 2010 studyfound that a twelve-week program designed to change thinking patterns helpsbinge eaters stop their negative eating behaviors.16[part0020_split_006.html#ch6ft16]6. Focusing on the negative. Many people are masterful in finding somethingnegative to say about any situation. This negative cognition takes a positiveexperience and taints it.I wanted to lose thirty pounds in ten weeks, but I have only lost eight pounds.I’m a complete failure.I went to the gym and did a hard workout, but the guy on the bike next to me wastalking the whole time, so I’m never going back there.I started eating two servings of vegetables a day, but I should be eating fivefor optimal health, so why bother?Putting a positive spin on your thoughts leads to positive changes in your brainthat will help you stick with healthier choices. For example, here’s how youcould think about these same situations:I have already lost eight pounds and have changed my lifestyle, so I willcontinue to lose weight until I reach my goal of losing thirty pounds.After working out, I had a lot more energy for the rest of the day.Eating two servings of vegetables a day is better than none.Banning the NegativityWhen Solange Montoya started The Daniel Plan with two friends, she was hoping tochange more than her weight and how her clothes fit. She knew there was more tolifelong health. And there was!“So many insecurities and all this negative self-talk come when you don’t feellike you can do this physically,” she says. “But there was such a change when Ihad that energy and [started thinking positively instead of negatively]. I justfeel like, Wow, God, there’s nothing now that I don’t want to do for you. Theexcuses just kind of started to melt away, more so than the weight. There’s thisfreedom that comes with me now wanting to get out there and live my life — notjust for me, but for my kids, for God, and for other people.”Whenever you feel sad, mad, nervous, or out of control, identify which of thesix types of the negative thoughts you are engaging in. Challenge the negativethoughts by finding and stating the truth. This takes away their power and givesyou control over your thoughts, moods, and behaviors.[../images/00018.gif]"},{"pageContent":"GRATITUDEAnother way to discipline your mind — that feels good — is to bring yourattention to the things you are grateful for in your life. Research reveals thatbeing consistently grateful will have a positive effect on your health.17[part0020_split_006.html#ch6ft17] God designed us in such a way that gratitudepromotes healing.A Yale University research study evaluated more than 2,000 veterans between theages of 60 and 96 to assess which traits helped them age successfully.18[part0020_split_006.html#ch6ft18] Gratitude and purpose were the mostsignificant traits associated with successful aging. Your attitude matters.Another study, from the University of California – Davis, examined the effect ofa grateful outlook on psychological and physical well-being. Participants wererandomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions. They kept weekly ordaily journals to write about hassles, gratitude, or neutral events. They alsorecorded their moods, coping behaviors, health behaviors, physical symptoms, andoverall life appraisals. The grateful group exhibited the most heightenedwell-being.19 [part0020_split_006.html#ch6ft19]Where you bring your attention determines how you feel, and feeling grateful isa joyful place to be. This mind-set also helps your faith as you focus on God’sgifts to you. It helps you eat right as you focus on being grateful for theability to eat delicious, healthy food that serves your body. It helps youmaintain your fitness level as you feel grateful for the ability to move yourbody. And it helps your friends as you notice what you like about them more thanwhat you don’t like.Gratefulness actually helps your brain work better. Psychologist Noelle Nelsonin her book The Power of Appreciation in Everyday Life described a study whereshe had a brain SPECT scan twice. The first time she was scanned after thirtyminutes of meditating on all the things she was thankful for in her life. Thenshe was scanned several days later after focusing on the major fears in herlife. After the appreciation exercise, her brain looked very healthy. The scantaken after she focused on her fears looked very different. Activity in twoparts of her brain had significantly dropped. Her cerebellum completely shutdown.20 [part0020_split_006.html#ch6ft20]“Rejoice always, pray continually, give thanks in all circumstances; for this isGod’s will for you in Christ Jesus” (1 Thessalonians 5:16 – 18).Morning RitualThe first thing on Dr. Amen’s master to-do list, the first thing he sees eachday, is his gratitude list. Rather than just writing down a few things, he keepsa running tab on what he is grateful for, looks at it every day, and adds to itas joyful moments occur.The other area of Dr. Nelson’s brain that was affected was the temporal lobes,especially the one on the left. The temporal lobes are involved with mood,memory, and temper control. Problems in this part of the brain are associatedwith some forms of depression, but also dark thoughts, violence, and memoryproblems. Practicing gratitude literally helps you have a brain to be gratefulfor.Here is a helpful exercise: Write down three things you are grateful for everyday. The act of writing down your grateful thoughts helps to bring yourattention to them to enhance your brain. Research from University ofPennsylvania psychologist Martin Seligman demonstrates that when people do thisexercise, they notice a significant positive difference in their level ofhappiness in just three weeks.21 [part0020_split_006.html#ch6ft21] Otherresearchers have also found that people who express gratitude on a regular basisare healthier, more optimistic, make more progress toward their goals, have agreater sense of well-being, and are more helpful to others. Doctors whoregularly practice gratitude are actually better at making the correct diagnoseson their patients.Notice the connection Philippians 4:6 – 7 makes between gratitude and peace ofmind: “Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer andpetition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God,which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds inChrist Jesus.” It’s not enough just to present your requests to God. Do it withthanksgiving if you also want peace of mind."},{"pageContent":"THE B STUFFAt the turn of the century, a shoe company sent a representative to Africa. Hewired back, “I’m coming home. No one wears shoes here.” Another company senttheir representative, and he sold thousands of shoes. He wired back to hiscompany, “Business is fantastic. No one has ever heard of shoes here.” Both repsperceived the same situation from markedly different perspectives, and theyobtained dramatically different results.We are not controlled by events or people, but by the perceptions we make ofthem. All of us have experienced a fair amount of criticism for our work overthe years, as we have tried to do things differently in our fields of expertise.We had the option of feeling hurt, demoralized, and stopping the work webelieved in. Or we had the option of realizing that anyone who does something ina different way is likely to be criticized. It was just part of the territory oftrying to make a difference.Perception is the way we interpret ourselves and the world around us. Our fivesenses take in the world, but perception occurs as our brains process theincoming information through our feeling filters. Our perception of the outsideworld is based on our inside world. For example, when we are feeling tired, weare much more likely to overeat or snap at our spouse or children than when weare rested.The view that we take of a situation has more reality than the situation itself.Noted psychiatrist Richard Gardner, M.D., has said that the world is like aRorschach test, where a person is asked to describe what he or she sees in 10ink blots that mean absolutely nothing. What you see in the ink blot is based onyour inner view of the world. Therefore, it is how you perceive situations,rather than the actual situations themselves, that cause you to react.If A is the actual event and B is how we interpret or perceive the event, then Cis how we react to the event: A + B = C.“Life is 10 percent what happens to me and 90 percent how I react to it.”— Charles SwindollOther people or events (A) trigger our initial feelings, but it is ourinterpretation or perception (B) of those people or events that causes how weeventually feel or act (C). For example, suppose you worked hard to bring ahealthy meal to the church function, but someone made a negative comment, suchas, “It looks so healthy, it probably tastes like cardboard.” That is A, or whatactually happened. You might think, She hates me! My efforts were a waste oftime and money, or Every time I try to do something good, it fails. Yourinterpretation of her comment is B. Then you feel terrible and withdraw fromfurther efforts to get healthy and be involved. Your reaction is C.If, on the other hand, your thoughts about her comments (A) go in a differentdirection, and you think, Poor woman, she is judging the food without eventasting it (B), you might then encourage her to taste it (C) or allow others torave about it (C). Your thoughts about the comments determine how you feel, notthe comments themselves.On this path toward a healthier life, we encourage you to identify yourperceptions, starting with yourself. Do you see yourself as the child of God youare, dearly loved by the one who gave his life for you (John 3:16)? We tooseldom treat ourselves with the love of God or even the love of a good parent.When we make a mistake, we might behave in an abusive manner toward ourselves.We may overeat, belittle ourselves, and feel hopeless. When children makemistakes, good parents don’t belittle or abuse them; rather, they help themlearn from their mistakes.Just questioning your thoughts and perceptions and then filtering them through aloving God and honest mind will make a huge difference in your life, happiness,and health.Our perceptions are one of the largest influences on what dictates our behavior."},{"pageContent":"[../images/00017.gif]ATTITUDEAND PURPOSE [part0003.html#sec11]ANOTHER CRITICAL “FOCUS” STRATEGY is your attitude toward failure. We havesomething very important to tell you that is absolutely essential for your mind.On The Daniel Plan you cannot fail — because you start it as a forty-day journeyand then get to see changes gradually unfold over your lifetime. In The DanielPlan — or in life, for that matter — no one just gets better. You get better …have a slip up … move forward…. Setbacks and comebacks are part of the journey,and graciousness must be part of both.When you make a mistake, just make a U-turn. Do you have a GPS device on yourphone or in your car? When you make a wrong turn, the GPS doesn’t call you anidiot. It just tells you where to make the next legal U-turn. If you payattention to your mistakes, such as that you went too long between meals, didn’tsleep, or failed to plan, they can be your best teachers. Very soon you findyourself in a new place where you have dramatically improved both your brain andyour body."},{"pageContent":"CHANGE OCCURS IN STEPSThe diagram on the top of the next page is often used for participants inresearch studies.We usually think of failure as a negative experience. But wise people know howto take advantage of failure. They learn from it. They make the most of it. Theyuse it as an education.Supposedly, Thomas Edison had about 1,000 failures when he was inventing thelightbulb. When asked by a reporter how it felt to fail so many times, Edison issaid to have replied, “I didn’t fail one thousand times. The lightbulb was aninvention with one thousand steps.”[../images/00019.gif]God uses failure to educate us. Mistakes are simply learning experiences, andthere are some things we learn only through failure. So some of us are highlyeducated!How do you learn to become a success? By learning what doesn’t work and notdoing it anymore. Saddleback Church has done more things that didn’t work thandid. Every staff member and minister at the church makes at least one goodmistake a week. If we’re not making any mistakes, we’re not growing. But wearen’t afraid of failure. The freedom from the fear of failure is the freedom togrow.Good DataSetbacks help you identify your most vulnerable moments. We do not want you tobe victims of your failures, but rather to study them just as a scientist woulddo. Be curious. We like saying, “Turn bad days into good data.”Your setbacks can even reaffirm your faith. It may surprise you to know thatadmitting your hopelessness to God can be a statement of faith. King David said,“I believed in you, so I said, ‘I am deeply troubled, LORD.’ In my anxiety Icried out to you” (Psalm 116:10 – 11 NLT).David’s frankness actually reveals a deep faith: First, he believed in God.Second, he believed God would listen to his prayer. Third, he believed God wouldlet him say how he felt and still love him.Regardless of your circumstances and how you feel, focus on who God is — hisunchanging nature. Remind yourself what you know to be eternally true about God:He is good, he loves me, he is for me. He knows my struggles and mycircumstances, and I know he has a good plan for my life.Simple Rules for Vulnerable TimesOne tip we have found helpful for people who study their failures is to createsimple rules for vulnerable times, such as … * Eat healthy foods before bad ones. * Eat veggies first. * Eat before you go to the ballgame to avoid being tempted by the caramel apples. * When tempted, take a walk, repeat a poem, drink a glass of water.Be aware of the impulse and then focus on something else until the impulse goesaway.Failure can also be motivational. A lot of times we change, not when we see thelight, but when we feel the heat. When you fail, maybe God is trying to get yourattention and saying, “I want you to go in a new direction.”Failure does not automatically grow your character. Failure only builds yourcharacter when you respond to it correctly, when you learn from it, when yougrow from it, when you say, “What didn’t work here, and what can I change?” Whenyou think about failure and setbacks like this, your heart softens. Failuremakes you less judgmental and helps you be a little more sympathetic to peoplearound you."},{"pageContent":"BE PURPOSE DRIVENThe entrance to the Saddleback Campus in Lake Forest, California, starts on“Purpose Drive” for a reason. In our first Daniel Plan rally, we had ourparticipants fill out an exercise plan to help them clearly define their visionor mission, a written purpose statement to help them focus all of theirthoughts, words, and actions. Why? Your amazing brain makes what it sees happen.Seeing success in your mind makes it more likely to happen — as does seeingfailure.So we would like you to do this exercise too. Write out your major goals andpurpose. Use the following headings: * Faith * Food * Fitness * Focus * FriendsThe five Essentials are separated in order to encourage you to have a morebalanced approach to life. Burnout occurs when your life becomes unbalanced andyou overextend yourself in one area while ignoring the others.Next to each heading write what you believe God wants for you and what you wantfor yourself. Be positive and use the first person. Write your purpose withconfidence and the expectation that with God’s power it can happen. If you needto, work on it over several days. After you finish with the initial draft (youwill frequently want to update it), place this list where you can see it everyday, such as on your refrigerator, in your phone, by your bedside, or as yourdesktop wallpaper.Chuck’s Purpose-Driven ExerciseChuck is a manager at a local bank. He is married with three children. He hadbeen recently diagnosed with diabetes and hypertension when he came to TheDaniel Plan rally. Here is what he wrote down for his purpose-driven exercise:“Faith — To live close to God, to seek his purpose for my life, trust God in themoment, pray daily, and attend church regularly.“Food — Focus on food that serves my body and spirit. With the recent diagnosesof diabetes and hypertension, this is more critical now than ever before. Iconsume only whole, high-quality food, plenty of water, lean protein, healthyfats, low-glycemic, high-fiber carbohydrates, and an abundance of colorfulfruits and vegetables. I eat often enough to maintain a stable blood sugar toavoid cravings.“Fitness— My body is the temple of the Holy Spirit. I treat it with love andrespect, which means exercising it on a regular basis, at least four times aweek.“Friends — Stay connected to those I love and be a role model of health andwholeness. I want to have a kind, caring, loving relationship with my wife andbe a firm, kind, positive, predictable presence in my children’s lives, and totake time to maintain and nurture my friendships.“Focus — Focus on brain envy and brain healthy habits, SMART goals, mymotivation, accurate, honest thoughts, gratitude, the right attitude towardfailure, and journaling.”Whenever you do a behavior over and over, such as reading your purpose-drivenexercise daily, it actually develops and strengthens specific pathways in thebrain. The purpose-driven exercise can become the guidepost for all of yourthoughts, feelings, and actions."},{"pageContent":"SMART GOALSWe also want you to make SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, andTime-Bound) goals — similar to what we talked about in chapter 5 on fitness —for the other areas of your life that you wish to improve. Proverbs 4:26 says,“Give careful thought to the paths for your feet and be steadfast in all yourways.”Pastor Warren teaches that goal setting, like prayer and spending time alonewith God, is a spiritual discipline. In fact, goals can be an act of stewardshipor worship where you say, “God, I want to make the most of what I’ve been given”or “God, I give you back the life you’ve given to me, and I want to go in yourdirection.”Some people think, I’m not going to plan; I’m just going to trust God and gowith the flow. Yes, we should trust God. But we should also plan, because theBible says God plans. “God plans to bring all of history to its goal in Christ”(Ephesians 1:10 paraphrased). Notice that God doesn’t just sit around and letthings happen. And we have the choice to follow his lead.Specific goals are those that are clear and unambiguous. This is where you tellyour brain exactly what is expected and why it is important. A specific goalusually answers five “W” questions: * What: What do I want to accomplish? For example, to lose 30 pounds. * Why: Specific reasons, purposes, or benefits of accomplishing the goal. For example, to get truly healthy, have better energy, and be physically able to do God’s purpose in my life. * Who: Who is involved? For example, me, but it will also involve those closest to me. * Where: Identify a location. For example, at home and everywhere I go. * Which: Identify the requirements and constraints. For example, faith, food, fitness, focus, and friends.To set specific goals, you need to know the difference between pressures andpriorities. You need to know the difference between activity and achievement,between what’s urgent and what’s important. You need to know what matters most.If you focus your energy on goals that aren’t God-directed, your energy won’thave much power. Energy that is focused has enormous power. Paul modeled this in1 Corinthians 9:26: “Therefore I do not run like someone running aimlessly; I donot fight like a boxer beating the air.”Measurable emphasizes the need for tangible benchmarks. If a goal is notmeasurable, it is not possible to know whether you are making progress towardit. Measuring your progress helps you stay on track and keeps you excited. Ameasurable goal will usually answer questions such as “how much? By when?”Attainable means the goals need to be realistic, even though dreams can be big.Extreme goals usually invite failure and frustration. When you identify goalsthat are most important to you, your brain begins to figure out ways to makethem come true.At the same time, you must also realize that attainable doesn’t mean only thegoals you can accomplish in your own power. Goals can stretch your faith andaffirm your trust in God. If you can do it in your own power, then you don’treally need any faith. Saddleback Church is the story of ordinary people settingand attempting big goals in faith and then watching God do it.Relevant means you choose goals that matter. The goal of “surf 100 websites by9:00 p.m.” may be specific, measurable, attainable, and time-bound, but lacksrelevance. A relevant goal answers yes to these questions: Does this seemworthwhile? Is this the right time? Does this match your other efforts/needs?Being relevant also means your goals are relevant to God and bring him glory.Any goal that brings you closer to him and makes you want to serve him andothers is a goal that matters. The apostle Paul encouraged us to “make it ourgoal to please him, whether we are at home in the body or away from it” (2Corinthians 5:9).Goals keep you moving forward when you feel like giving up. They are likemagnets that pull you forward and give you hope.Time-bound stresses the importance of attaining the goal within a certain timeframe. A commitment to a deadline helps you focus your efforts on completion ofthe goal on or before the due date. Time-bound criteria help you focus yourefforts.Here are some examples of SMART goals: 1. Walk as if I am late 4 times a week for 45 minutes with my walking partner. 2. Do a complete kitchen cleanse (removing all unhealthy food) this week. 3. Spend one night a week with friends reading and discussing The Daniel Plan material. Call in between meetings for encouragement and accountability. 4. Spend 5 to 10 minutes a day journaling my progress. 5. From this moment forward, focus on eating The Daniel Plan – approved foods 90 percent of the time.Work toward SMART goals that give your brain and mind clear direction and focuson what is important."},{"pageContent":"KNOW YOUR MOTIVATIONIn order to get and stay healthy, it is critical for you to know why it isimportant. What drives your desire to be healthy?Is it because it is God’s will for you to take care of your body? Consider 1Corinthians 6:19 – 20: “Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the HolySpirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own;you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies.”Is it because you are in pain or tired of feeling sick, lethargic, forgetful,and not anywhere near your best?“God is always more interested in why we do something than in what we do.Attitudes count more than achievements.”— Pastor WarrenIs it because you want to feel healthy and vibrant to live out your purpose, todo the work you love, to be with the people you care about, or to see yourgrandchildren grow up?Is it because you want to prevent illnesses that may run in your family, such asdiabetes, cancer, heart disease, or Alzheimer’s disease?Write down your motivation — why it is important for you to get healthy — andthen look at it daily. We find it most effective if you approach it from twoperspectives: To attain benefits, and to avoid negative consequences.A Mind for the Future“My greatest motivation is to be healthy in order to model the Lord for mygrandchildren and to work with children. For this, I need energy and a clearmind, a ready laugh, and joy in each experience. I notice the responses ofothers when I look good and feel good; I even notice the nudgings of the Lordmore clearly. Perhaps this relates to having a sense of contentment andwell-being. I am more loving and more compassionate when my body temple isfunctioning closer to optimum operating level.”— Mandy CameronFifty percent of your brain is dedicated to vision. So it is often helpful toput up what we call “anchor images” to anchor or remind yourself why you want tobe healthy. These pictures stimulate motivation. If you want to be healthy to bea great leader of your family, post your favorite picture of your family. If youwant to look great, post a picture of yourself when you looked and felt yourbest. If you want to be healthy to serve out God’s purpose, put a picture ofyourself doing things that exemplify your purpose."},{"pageContent":"BRAIN POWER AND ACTIONA hallmark of intelligence and what separates us from other animals is ourability to think about the consequences of our behavior before acting onimpulse.Effective decisions involve forethought in relation to your goals, which helpsyou not only to live in the moment, but also to be living ten or even fiftyyears from now. Boosting your brain power and health will help you avoidtroubled situations. Here are seven simple steps to boost your brain and renewyour thoughts.1. “Then What?” The two most powerful words, when it comes to your health, arethen what. These two small words can literally change your health in a positiveway if you keep them at the top of your mind. If I do this, then what willhappen? If I eat this, then what will happen? Does eating the third piece ofpizza, skipping the workout, or staying up late help me with any of my goals?Think about the consequences of your behavior before you act.2. Get 8 hours of sleep. Less sleep brings lower overall blood flow to the brainand more bad decisions.3. Keep your blood sugar balanced. Research says that low blood sugar levels areassociated with lower overall blood flow to the brain, poor impulse control,irritability, and more bad decisions.22 [part0020_split_006.html#ch6ft22]4. Optimize your omega 3 fatty acid levels. Low levels of omega 3 fatty acidshave been associated with ADHD, depression, and Alzheimer’s disease — all brainproblems.5. Read your purpose-driven goals daily. Ask yourself, “Is my behavior todaylining up with my purpose?”6. Practice using your brain. Self-control is like a muscle. The more you useit, the stronger it gets. Just as good parents help children developself-control by saying no, strengthen the self-control part of your own brain bysaying no to the things that are not good for you. Over time your brain willmake better choices more automatically.The most effective people in life think ahead. They know what they want, knowwhat motivates them, keep their thinking honest, and then act in consistent waysover time to achieve their goals.7. Balance your brain chemistry. Getting help for problems such as ADHD,anxiety, and depression can help you maintain control over your life.All of the tools in this chapter work together to help get and keep you focusedon the journey toward a healthier life. Making consistently great decisionsrequires a healthy brain. We gave you a lot to think about. That’s the point: Wewant you to think about your health and become mindful, intentional, and purposedriven. You need a healthy brain and a renewed mind to do that.Reflect and Take a Step …Be careful what you think, because your thoughts run your life! (See Proverbs4:23.) Replace any negative thought with one of God’s truths. Reflect on hispromises and the plans he has for you to prosper. Journal your gratitude daily,and allow God to restore and transform your mind."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7[../images/00020.gif]FRIENDS [part0003.html#ch7]Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor(Ecclesiastes 4:9).In 2009, the city of Huntington, West Virginia, was plagued with the title of“Fattest City in America” by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), identifyingit as the unhealthiest city in the United States.For Steve Willis, pastor of First Baptist Church Kenova, near Huntington, thenumbers were not just statistics, but lives — and deaths. He was surprised athow many funerals he officiated, especially of people who were dying young ofpreventable diseases caused by their unhealthy habits.According to the CDC, Huntington was first (as in worst) in the nation in adultswho suffered from diabetes (13 percent), first in the prevalence of heartdisease (22 percent), and first in the percentage of adults who had no regularform of exercise (31 percent). Nearly half of those over sixty-five had lost allof their natural teeth (first place in that category too)! The city was first inkidney disease, vision problems, and sleeping disorders. Whether it was highblood pressure, circulation issues, or the depression that stems from suchunhealthy bodies, the area was the worst in every aforementioned category.While a few other cities came close to those percentages in some areas, no oneelse encroached on Huntington’s incredible 46 percent of adults who were obese(not just overweight). That’s nearly half of the adults. It was, as they say inthe sporting world, a total blowout.In those sobering statistics Pastor Willis heard God calling him to achallenging assignment: preach about health to a very unhealthy congregation.Willis says,The transformation began with a declaration of the truth that taking care of ourbodies is an act of worship. Nearly half of our congregation struggled withobesity, so [addressing this issue head-on] was one of the most difficult[sermons] I have ever delivered. But nearly a third of our congregation made apublic commitment to lose at least forty pounds.Pastor Willis was delighted at both their response and the life change thatoccurred.I wasn’t ready for such a large mass of people (pun intended), but thanks topeople like Elizabeth Bailey and my wife, Deanna, we put together a Daniel-likeplan for our first set of accountability groups. Each group met weekly forprayer, Bible study, encouragement, and yes, exercise.Willis believes those groups were the secret weapon in battling the obesityepidemic in the Huntington area.When you have friends to go with you on the journey toward better health, youare more likely to succeed. Life change happens in small groups. “By creating aculture of both love and accountability, our church has seen many peoplerevolutionize their lives, not only in the physical realm, but in theirspiritual and mental lives as well,” Willis says.Willis wrote a book, Winning the Food Fight,1 [part0020_split_007.html#ch7ft1]about the experience of transforming his church, his community, even his ownfamily. These days Huntington is no longer “number one.” The city was happy torelinquish its championship status — and in fact worked hard to do so. Thestatistics have changed because people came together to help each other behealthier. Willis adds,Starting with the members of our church, we teamed up with other like-mindedgroups who cared about our city’s health. By implementing the principles of TheDaniel Plan, we are no longer number one in any of those statistics. In fact, ifthe most recent studies are correct, Huntington has begun to reverse the obesitytrend.Four years later, the church has traded unhealthy habits for healthy ones, fromwhat is served at church potluck dinners to the snacks in the children’sdepartment. One church member even donated an acre of land for a communitygarden.Most recently the church began educating the children in its preschool about thedifference between real food and the processed fake foods that are typicallymarketed toward children. Willis reports,These kids are now going home and teaching their parents about the importance ofreal food and knowing where it comes from. Perhaps the best news is that ourchildren’s department has nearly doubled since we have instituted thesenutritional changes. We’ve still got a long way to go, but it continues to amazeme that the more we get physically healthy, the more we seem to be a spirituallyhealthy body of Christ."},{"pageContent":"[../images/00021.gif]THE GIFTOF LOVING COMMUNITY [part0003.html#sec12]THE STORY OF PASTOR WILLIS’S CONGREGATION is inspiring. We all love the idea ofbeing healthy — of being our best self emotionally, spiritually, and physically.The Daniel Plan offers you a clear, simple way to be your best, healthiest you.Improving your health is possible, but doing so requires intention and effort inour daily choices. When we choose to spend time with God, to exercise, to eathealthy food, and to focus our thoughts, we take steps toward our goals in everyarea of life. That can be hard, especially if we’re trying to make changes toexisting habits — and even tougher if we try to go it alone.But the really good news is that God doesn’t want you to do it alone. He madeyou to thrive when you’re connected with others. Being engaged in community willimprove your health — and not just physically. Friends can improve youremotional and spiritual health.The opposite is also true: Isolation injures us. Our lack of community can keepus from being the healthiest we can be. In other words, the Friends Essential isthe secret sauce for all the other Essentials.One of the reasons The Daniel Plan has already helped thousands of people tosucceed in a healthier lifestyle is the fact that it is done in community. Itworked in Huntington, and it will work for you."},{"pageContent":"A MEDICAL SOLUTIONInvolving your friends is not just a feel-good aspect of The Daniel Plan.Research backs up the concept, showing how crucial we are for each other’shealing and success. Much of what currently ails us (and people all over theglobe) is preventable, treatable, and very often curable. Even better: the cureis right next to us.“Share each other’s troubles and problems, and in this way obey the law ofChrist” (Galatians 6:2 NLT).Over the next twenty years, chronic diseases such as high blood pressure,diabetes, and heart disease will cost an estimated $47 trillion to addressworldwide.2 [part0020_split_007.html#ch7ft2] But such diseases are preventable,since their root causes are often being overweight and having a sedentary andunhealthy lifestyle.For decades, the medical community has tried to solve chronic disease problemswith medical solutions — which makes sense, on one level. Medical problems needmedical solutions, right? But no part of our life is isolated from another. Ourmedical travails are tied in part to our lifestyle and our emotions, such asstress and fear. What we eat and how much we move also impact our medicalhealth. So finding a pill or treatment to combat those medical problems doesn’talways work. For years, Dr. Hyman wondered why medical science couldn’t solvewhat appeared to be medical problems. Then he read about the work of Dr. PaulFarmer, and Dr. Hyman’s perspective changed.Dr. Farmer was able to successfully treat TB and AIDS — which everyone thoughtwere untreatable in the face of extreme poverty in places like Haiti, Peru, orRwanda. He realized that the key to treatment was not a new medication butsomething very simple — to rebuild community and connection in places it hadbroken down.4 [part0020_split_007.html#ch7ft4] In other words, friends were thekey. Dr. Hyman says,Cycling for Food and HealthIn Thailand, patients with diabetes take turns pedaling an old bike that ishooked up to a generator to irrigate a community garden.3[part0020_split_007.html#ch7ft3] Exercise with teamwork helps them grow theirown healthy food. This kind of model of a peer group as the catalyst for healthis more effective than conventional medical intervention.Paul’s genius was his insight that the key to solving insoluble health careproblems was each other — people helping people. Paul’s genius was the idea ofaccompanying each other to health, helping each other build back theircommunities with clean water, food, going to each other’s houses to make suretheir sick neighbor knew how and knew when to take their medication.Our social circles influence our health even more than our DNA. We are morelikely to be overweight if our friends are, even if our parents are not. At thesame time, we are more likely to exercise and eat healthy food, to not smoke orovereat, if our friends also practice healthy habits. If they’re sick, we’remore likely to be sick. If our friends have healthy habits, then we probablywill.This means your friends and family may determine how successful you are with TheDaniel Plan. If they’re healthy, you’re more likely to be healthy. If they arefocused on their goals with a positive attitude, you will be too. If they areliving their faith, you will have built-in support.In a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers foundthat one of the strongest associations in the spread of obesity are the peopleyou spent time with. Subjects who had a friend who was obese had a 57 percentchance of also being obese. If the two individuals identified each other asbeing strong friends, the figure shot up to 171 percent. And this relationshipheld even if the subjects didn’t live in the same area. Sibling relationshipsalso proved important. Having an obese sibling was related to a 40 percentincrease in the chance of obesity.5 [part0020_split_007.html#ch7ft5]In one of the longest longevity studies ever done, researchers found that healthhabits are contagious.6 [part0020_split_007.html#ch7ft6] For example, if youspend time with people who exercise, you are more likely to exercise. If youspend time with people who eat healthy, you are more likely to eat in ahealthful way. The group you associate with often determines the type of personyou become.Community has the power to change our overall health more than any doctor orclinic.This doesn’t mean you have to get rid of all your unhealthy family and friends.Rather, be the leader and model a new way of living.You are not just receiving influence; you are an influencer as well. If youdevelop and keep healthy habits, your friends and family are more likely todevelop them. Habits are contagious, which means you can have significant effecton those around you. But that may not happen overnight.Dr. Amen found that he and his wife, Tana, met with some initial resistance fromtheir large extended family when they first changed their eating habits.I have five sisters, a brother, living parents, and twenty-one nieces andnephews. When Tana and I first decided to get really healthy years ago, many inmy own family thought it was very odd and even made fun of us. I explained whyit was important to us to start feeding our brains and bodies in a healthy way.Dr. Amen’s extended family frequently gathered together for meals, which causednoticeable tension when he and Tana insisted on eating differently than the restof the family. But the two of them supported each other in their new lifestyle.Dr. Amen says:Over time, members of our family started coming to us for help. One of mynephews who had been morbidly obese was one of those who asked us for help andended up making radical changes. When Tana and I took the lead on health andpersisted in the face of criticism and initial protests, everyone benefited."},{"pageContent":"LOVE AND HEALTHMajor breakthroughs in recent years have significantly altered the way we asAmericans care for our health. While we have known for a while that lifestylecan cause health problems (smoking can cause cancer, lack of exercise or excessweight contributes to heart disease), the idea that the reverse is also true —that lifestyle can reverse health problems — is new.“To get really healthy, find the healthiest person you can stand and then spendas much time around him or her as possible.”— Dr. AmenDr. Dean Ornish discovered four steps to reverse heart disease: 1. Exercise regularly. 2. Eat a plant-based diet. 3. Reduce your stress. 4. Find love and community support.In 1977, Dr. Ornish studied the effectiveness of these lifestyle behaviors inmen and women with severe heart disease. Dr. Ornish quickly realized that thefourth component was powerfully meaningful for the participants.Since then, he embarked on a quest to find the deeper answers about the verythings that are best for our health and well-being. He realized that justknowing what to do is only part of the solution. He ultimately discovered thatthere is something deeper that enhances motivation and our ability to naturallychoose healthy behaviors — and he incorporated this essential concept into hisprogram for reversing heart disease.This Harvard-trained physician discovered that it is relationships thatultimately impact our motivation to exercise and eat healthy. It is love thattransforms our health, fitness, and lives more than anything else. He wrote:Medicine today seems to focus primarily on the physical and mechanistic: drugsand surgery, genes and germs, microbes and molecules. I am not aware of anyother factor in medicine — not diet, not smoking, not exercise, not stress, notgenetics, not drugs, not surgery — that has a greater impact on our quality oflife, incidence of illness, and premature death from all causes than love andintimacy! Love and intimacy are at the root of what makes us sick and what makesus well, what causes sadness and what brings us happiness, what makes us sufferand what leads to healing. If a new drug had the same impact, virtually everydoctor in the country would be recommending it for his or her patients.7[part0020_split_007.html#ch7ft7]“So now I am giving you a new commandment: Love each other. Just as I have lovedyou, you should love each other. Your love for one another will prove to theworld that you are my disciples” (John 13:34 – 35 NLT)."},{"pageContent":"LIFE CHANGEOur experience at Saddleback confirms Dr. Ornish’s research. When we introducedThe Daniel Plan, more than 15,000 people joined us that first year, eager tofind friends who could help them. They worked their way through the curriculum,but each group had its own focus and flavor. There was no doubt: Groups wereindeed the “secret sauce” of The Daniel Plan, the piece that made this plansucceed where other diet and exercise plans failed. It shouldn’t have surprisedus, of course. We believe life change happens in community.Set a Fitness DateFind a workout buddy with similar interests. Think about friends, familymembers, or members of your church who may have similar interests to you, andgive them a call and set a date to plan your fitness together. You can even postyour interests on Facebook or Twitter to see who responds. Or work out with afamily member. Set a weekly date — before the week begins — with your spouse,child, or parent to participate in a fun fitness activity together.One group of women not only met to study and pray together, but once a weekwould also shop together for healthy food. They would go back to one woman’shouse and cook in bulk, making a big batch of turkey chili or healthy chickensalad. They would divide up the food and each take home a few premade meals.They had a great time shopping and cooking together, and the conversations asthey did so encouraged them even more.Other support came more organically as people at an exercise class or a Biblestudy would talk about healthy lunch ideas or give each other tips on juicing,trade recipes, or just encourage each other.Another Daniel Plan participant lost 45 pounds and radically changed all of herhealth habits. As she got healthy, her husband, who weighed 300 pounds, at firstwas resistant to change. But as he saw his wife’s success, he joined her inchanging his lifestyle. He eventually lost 75 pounds.Often, the most loving thing you can do for your spouse is to get healthyyourself. This woman showed her husband, by her brave example, that a betterlife is possible if you do the right things, which in this case ultimatelyencouraged her husband and her children to get healthier as well.A Pastor’s Family“The fight for good nutrition was never more real to me than when I watched mykindergarten-aged son struggle with adapting to his physician-prescribed,mind-altering drugs.“Lucas had been having discipline problems in school, would frequently strugglewith the ability to focus on tasks at hand, and found himself well below gradelevel in many academic areas. Though his mother was an elementary school teacherwho worked with him incessantly, his test scores remained in the bottom 50thpercentile.“So we did what many parents feel forced to do. We placed him on the ADD/ADHDmedications that would keep him calm in school, but seemed to stunt hispersonality and growth in other areas. For his sake, my wife, Deanna, wanted tomake radical changes to our family’s diet, but I resisted due to my everlastinglonging for pizza, French fries, and syrup-laden ice cream. After months ofwatching our formerly energetic son become totally lethargic and emotionallydisconnected, I relented and told my wife, ‘Do what you have to do.’“She implemented the principles of The Daniel Plan in our home right away.Within just three months, our son was completely changed. He was off hismedications, the discipline problems had ceased, and his test scores jumped fromC’s to A’s. The change was nothing short of miraculous.“If you are in the early stages of making the necessary changes for your family,stay the course and fight the good fight. I won’t tell you it was an easy sellto replace all the sugary cereals and junk food with healthier options. At firstour older children just chose not to eat as much and leave some food on theirplates. Eventually their tastes changed, as did mine, and I can honestly saythat now I’d rather have a good dish of grilled vegetables than a greasyhamburger any day!“The good news is that today our teenage daughter is all about cooking healthyfood for our family. She recently attended a summer camp, and of all the funfree-time activities, she signed up for the healthy cooking class.“As for Lucas, the one who once struggled behaviorally and academically, yearslater he remains an A student in math and consistently scores above the 90thpercentile in nearly every category.“As a pastor and father, I have to wonder: How many other children are in thesame boat as my son? How many other children have the ability to be topmathematicians, scientists, poets, musicians, or athletes, but are being robbedof those capabilities due to an unhealthy diet? This is more than a healthissue; it is a social justice issue. Millions of our children are not reachingtheir God-given potential because we, as adults, won’t take the steps necessaryto get them the nutrition they need. For the church, this problem has to be seenas a moral issue. For the sake of our children and our nation’s future, we haveto do better.”— Pastor Steve Willis"},{"pageContent":"[../images/00021.gif]THEFOUNDATION [part0003.html#sec13]ONE DAY JESUS was having a lively debate with a bunch of religious leaders,people who defined their faith by rule-keeping. They asked him, “Which is thegreatest commandment in the Law?” (See Matthew 26:36 – 40.)Jesus’ answer was radical in that culture, even more than it would be for ustoday. They were expecting to hear about rules and the law or to stump Jesus byasking him to pick one of hundreds of religious laws. Instead, Jesus pointedthem toward grace, contrasting it with the demands of the law. He essentiallytold them, “It’s not about rules at all; it’s about relationships. Life is allabout love. It’s not about accomplishment. It’s not about acquisition. It’s notabout popularity, power, or prestige. It’s about love. It’s aboutrelationships.”If you want to have lasting change in your life, then you must fill your lifewith love. That’s why The Daniel Plan success depends on having friends to walkbeside you — because love is the only thing that can change the unchangeable.It’s the most powerful force in the world. Love invigorates, revitalizes, andrenews.Love is the most irresistible force in the universe because God is love. Andthat love is available and accessible to every human being. We don’t need toearn it, only embrace it. The Bible doesn’t say God has love; it says he islove. Love is the core of his very nature. God’s love heals what cannototherwise be healed. God’s love uplifts. It strengthens.You can summarize all of life in two sentences: “Love God with all your heart,and love your neighbor as yourself” (see Matthew 22:37, 39)."},{"pageContent":"BETTER TOGETHERThere’s a wonderful word in the original language of the New Testament that isused to describe the community of the early church: koinonia. It is most oftentranslated fellowship, a word we sometimes tend to use as a synonym forsocializing, perhaps with our church friends.But koinonia means far more than mere socializing or even gathering in a smallgroup. It means love, intimacy, and joyful participation, deep communion withone another — putting others’ needs before your own. It’s a radical level offriendship and community, similar to that of the early church, described in Acts2:42 – 47 and elsewhere. It implies a deep commitment, not out of obligation,but out of genuine and joyful love for one another.God’s vision for you is that you would experience koinonia.Set the Pace for Someone Else“Leading up to her third marathon, my wife had a simple plan: find her pacer andstay close to him no matter what. Most marathon organizations provide therunners with all sorts of tools and techniques to help them through the gruelingcourse — perhaps most notably, pacers.“A pacer is a man or woman capable of finishing the race at an exact time. Kevinran through the finish line at 3:35 — just what he was asked to do. Now, Kevindidn’t know who was counting on his pace. All he knew was that someone would berelying on his experience, strength, and endurance to help him or her alongtheir way toward the goal.“In our daily pursuit of spiritual and physical stewardship, we all needpacesetters: People whom God places in our lives to help us stay the course. Notonly that, but God may, in fact, bless us with the privilege of being that forsomeone else. Like Kevin, we may or may not know who, but someone is dependingon us to know the way and show the way.”— Jimmy Pena, exercise physiologist and founder of Prayfit.com“We are many parts of one body, and we all belong to each other” (Romans 12:5NLT). God designed us to grow spiritually within a supportive community. Thesame is true if we want to grow healthier."},{"pageContent":"BAN LONELINESSResearchers tell us that lack of relationship significantly affects our physicaland mental health in several ways.8 [part0020_split_007.html#ch7ft8] When we arelonely, it can cause us to lose focus, struggle in our faith, give up on ourfitness goals, and even miss out on fellowship around a food table.Feelings of loneliness and being disconnected from community can … * Increase the likelihood of engaging in unhealthy, self-destructive coping behaviors such as being inactive, smoking, drinking in excess, and overeating. * Decrease the likelihood that we will make healthy lifestyle choices that are life enhancing, such as exercising, goal-setting, spending time with friends, reading our Bible, or praying. * Increase the likelihood of premature disease and death from all causes by 200 – 500 percent! * Keep us from fully experiencing the joy of everyday life.9 [part0020_split_007.html#ch7ft9]Find a ClubJoin a walking, jogging, or hiking group. If walking or running is your gig,check out all the resources in your community related to walking or joggingclubs. A great resource is your local YMCA, Sierra Club, and gyms in your area.Some restaurants even host weekly running clubs. Usually fitness facilities inyour area will offer free walking and/or jogging clubs. If you can’t find any inyour area, think about starting your own.However, when we support each other, we increase one another’s potential inevery area of life. In fact, the word support carries the idea of strengtheningone another — to help one another become more capable of facing the challengesof living for Christ and the challenges of health. As Philippians 1:30 tells us,“We are in this fight together” (NLT).When you connect with a loving community of friends, you will be better able tocope with things like fatigue, fear, frustration, and failure. You will bebetter able to handle depression and despair and, most important, not have towalk through them alone."},{"pageContent":"A WAKE-UP CALLA member at Saddleback, Debra Miller, appeared to be “fine.” No one knew thepain she was hiding. She needed sleeping pills at night, excess caffeine duringthe day, and pain pills to help her manage back pain. She would get out ofbreath climbing stairs, but figured that was what happened to everyone in theirforties. Yet, being ever the enthusiastic volunteer, she decided to lead aDaniel Plan group. She was not overweight, but even so, as she changed hereating habits, she began to feel a bit better. Still, she knew something wasn’tright. “I still felt like I was dying inside, and I still hadn’t stopped themedications,” she admits.She finally got a blood test, which revealed how sick she really was: She wasprofoundly anemic and had bleeding ulcers. The doctors sent her directly to theemergency room for a blood transfusion.That emergency room visit was a wake-up call, which inspired her to get seriousabout her Daniel Plan group — which has been an integral part of staying healthylong-term. She decided she wouldn’t lead alone. So she and her friend Claudiabecame co-leaders. Their group took several immediate actions, such as changingthe snacks they served at group from cookies and cakes to fruit, vegetables, andnuts. Beyond dietary changes, they cooked together, hiked together, andsupported each other.“To do something alone is really difficult,” Debra says. “We are all in ittogether, because together we are better, all the way around.”"},{"pageContent":"COMMITMENT REQUIREDStaying in honest, deep relationships is not always easy. It requirescommitment. But the flip side is a wonderful gift: When you commit to a fewfriends or a small group, the people in that group will also commit to you tohelp you make real and lasting changes. The apostle Paul said, “Your faith willhelp me, and my faith will help you” (Romans 1:12 NCV).Commitment is countercultural, and for some of us, it is counterintuitive. Wedon’t want obligations. But commitment is what makes a small group successfulbecause the group members know that they can depend on one another through goodand bad times.If we pretend that everything is fine and we have no real burdens, we will feellonely and isolated. It’s when we’re open about our burdens (our weaknesses andstruggles) that we find healing and comfort. We find that we are better able tofocus and stay mentally and emotionally healthy. We find we are not alone in ourstruggles to stay on track with our goals. We breathe a sigh of relief, becausethe doubts and temptations that try to get us off track in our faith are notunique. Others face the same struggles.The Bible says openness is a significant step toward healing and wholeness:“Make this your common practice: Confess your sins [faults] to each other andpray for each other so that you can live together whole and healed” (James 5:16MSG).We must be brave enough to be authentic — to admit our issues and accept theweaknesses of others. We need to create a community where every member feelsaccepted and is not afraid to ask for help.The Bible says, “Therefore, as God’s chosen people, holy and dearly loved,clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience”(Colossians 3:12). Nowhere in that list does it say to give advice or offerquick, cosmetic help. Rather, it points us to understand and be gentle with thepain of others.“Encourage one another and build each other up” (1 Thessalonians 5:11).While every group is unique, we support each other by doing the following:1. Love each other. Treat each other with humbleness and patience, no matterwhere each of you is on the journey. Love accepts us where we’re at, but expectsus to grow. And love doesn’t just mean warm feelings; sometimes it meansbringing a hot meal or helping someone with tasks they couldn’t do alone.2. Listen to each other. Admit your weaknesses and struggles, your progress andsuccesses. Then listen to your friends as they share the same. Listening meansfully engaging, noticing not just verbal, but nonverbal, clues about how someonefeels. It is not merely waiting for your turn to talk.The fellowship of suffering is the deepest, most intense level of fellowship.It’s where we enter into each other’s pain and grief and carry each other’sburdens. It is during times of deep crisis, grief, and doubt that we need eachother most. When circumstances crush us to the point that our faith falters,that’s when we really need committed and sympathetic friends. We need a smallgroup of friends to have faith in God for us and to pull us through. “If onepart suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every partrejoices with it” (1 Corinthians 12:26). In a small group, the body of Christ isreal and tangible, even when God seems distant.Ease the ChallengeWorking out with a friend can actually make exercise more effective and lessdifficult. Researchers from Oxford University discovered that when individualsexercise together they release more “happy hormones” (endorphins) than when theywork out alone. Researchers also found that working out in a group decreasedfeelings of pain and discomfort during exercise.10[part0020_split_007.html#ch7ft10]3. Learn from each other. Share what works and what doesn’t. Tell each otherabout what you have tried in faith, food, fitness, and focus. Talk about whatyou’re learning. You can learn from anyone, so don’t assume that someone youngeror less experienced can’t teach you something.4. Liberate each other by showing each other grace. Increase your encouragementand support when others make mistakes or hit a rut on their journey. When peopleknow they’re loved when they face setbacks, your group becomes a safe placewhere people feel free.Someone in your group may be wondering, “Am I strange for feeling this way? Am Igoofy? Am I mixed up?” You can encourage and affirm that person when you say,“No, you’re not weird. You’re just acting like the rest of us. We’ve all beenthere.” Or “I understand what you’re going through, and what you feel is neitherstrange nor crazy.”My Post-College Team“As a collegiate athlete, I loved to work out with my team. After graduation, Irecruited a group of my old football buddies and friends to meet on a regularbasis at the gym. Every morning I’d meet my friends, and we’d get a greatworkout together: pushing, spotting, encouraging, just like the old days. We didthis for years, and our fitness levels were nearly as good as when we were inour playing days.“Eventually my workout friends and I got married, had kids, and moved away. Ifound my fitness levels slowly eroding. I still exercised but now by myself.“I became determined to find another group of like-minded friends to support myfitness — and it was one of the best moves I ever made. We discovered we allhave a love for mountain biking. Now we meet every Friday morning and ridetogether, getting a long great workout, enjoying the outdoors, and usuallyspending an additional bit of time grabbing a cup of coffee or breakfast andsharing life together.“I also discovered four additional blessings in recruiting my new team offitness buddies. My wife, my daughter, and our two dogs are now on my team. Mywife loves to walk and hike — almost as much as our dogs do — so we faithfullywalk at least once a day, sometimes twice. This gives my wife and me anopportunity to talk, laugh, and pray together.“I also work out with my daughter, who is a high school soccer player. We runstairs and perform a boot camp-style weight-training program three times a week.Working out with her challenges me to push myself to keep up with hersixteen-year-old fitness level.

I just kind of gave up. This time around, I think,for me the key point was the friendships.”Her friends agree. To make sure they were faithful about attending exerciseclass, they would attend together and text each other reminders.Solange says, “I’d be home and I’d be trying to come up with every excuse in thebook why I shouldn’t go to exercise class. Then my phone would ring, and it’d beWendy, letting me know she’d meet me at class. Okay, she’s waiting for me. Ineed to go, and if I didn’t get that text, it would be so much easier for me tojust sit on the couch and not go.” The accountability helped both of them,because the person sending the text realized that meant she had to show up aswell!Accountability also helped the group with Focus, Faith, and Food Essentials.Wendy said,Being able to have someone pray for you when you’re feeling at your lowest, whenyou’re ready to pull in somewhere and grab a cheeseburger, and you know that youcan text and say, “Hey, pray for me. Tell me to stop and turn around.” That washuge for me. I’ve tried other diets where I would lose weight in ten days. Butthis is a life change. It’s forever. You learn how to change your eating habitsand your friendships.Whether you are trying to move forward with your mental health (focus), growspiritually (faith), make better choices when it comes to what you eat (food),or stay committed to an exercise program (fitness), community gives you thesupport people need. Knowing you’re not alone, that others are cheering you on,keeps you motivated. Giving that same support to others gives you joy and asense of purpose."},{"pageContent":"CREATING COMMUNITYSo how can you find that life-changing community that is so important to successon The Daniel Plan? It’s not hard, but you do have to seek it out. A great placeto start looking, of course, is your church. You’re likely to find other peopleyou already know who want to embrace the Faith Essential, which is such anintegral part of lifelong health.The Daniel Plan is flexible. Each group can do what works for them. There’s no“wrong” way to have a Daniel Plan group; any step you take is a good one.Perhaps you volunteer in a ministry at your church — would some of your fellowvolunteers want to be in a group with you? Or maybe you are already in a smallgroup or a Bible study — would they want to go through The Daniel Plan together?But don’t limit your quest for community to just your church. In fact, often weconnect around a shared interest: we have golfing buddies, a book club, a momsgroup, co-workers. Parents who have children of similar ages will buildfriendships that start on the sidelines of kids’ soccer games or as theyvolunteer in their children’s school.Why not also find others online? Join an online virtual group. Did you know thatyou can even experience the expertise, training, motivation, and instruction ofa “real time” fitness instructor via your home or office computer? All you willneed is a web cam. For convenience, simplicity, and cost, this type of groupallows you to connect virtually, but in the comfort and privacy of your own homeor office.Begin by asking God to bring the right people together. Trust that he will leadyou as you seek out community. But don’t just sit back and wait for the phone toring. Earnestly begin to look for like-minded friends who might join you on thejourney to a healthier you. Be bold in inviting others, keep your eyes open,even in unexpected places. For example: * Are the people you work with interested in getting more fit and healthy? You might invite some of your co-workers to meet over lunch once a week as a Daniel Plan group. You could even eat together regularly (encouraging one another to make healthy choices), use your lunch hour to walk, or meet at the gym before or after work. * Perhaps you have a few neighbors who would want to go through this book or The Daniel Plan, A DVD Study and Study Guide with you. If you are in a neighborhood book club or Bunco group, perhaps that group of friends might be interested in learning how to live a healthier lifestyle. * Are you in a sports league such as a bowling or softball league? Why not build on the community you already have around physical activity, and be intentional about the other Essentials in The Daniel Plan? * If you have young children, get to know the parents of their classmates at school or the neighbor children they play with. You might even want to do a “family-style” Daniel Plan group, where you gather for a healthy meal and talk about how to build habits of a healthy lifestyle with your kids. * Find eight (or so) people whom you would love to get to know better or deepen your relationship with. Invite them to start a dinner (or breakfast or weekend lunch) club. Meet for a healthy meal once or twice a month. Rotate from house to house. Schedule the get-togethers as potlucks, and challenge everyone to choose healthy, nutritious recipes to share. At each dinner, plan to talk about food, health, or community. Tell success stories and open up about your challenges. You will leave nourished."},{"pageContent":"A BOND THAT HEALSThere is power in community, so just keep looking for friends to join you onyour way to a healthier life. Don’t give up on it; reach out to others you thinkmight be lonely or needing inspiration. Ecclesiastes 4:9 – 12 reminds us:Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor: Ifeither of them falls down, one can help the other up. But pity anyone who fallsand has no one to help them up. Also, if two lie down together, they will keepwarm. But how can one keep warm alone? Though one may be overpowered, two candefend themselves. A cord of three strands is not quickly broken.That cord of three strands is referring to you, God, and the other person. Itties together the Faith and Friends Essentials — the two components that makeThe Daniel Plan unique from any other health plan. Having God and friends withyou as you make changes in your food, fitness, and focus habits is what makesall the difference.Invite some friends to do The Daniel Plan, A DVD Study and Study Guide together.Go to danielplan.com to register your group and get started.Of course, it is quite possible for you to do The Daniel Plan alone — for ashort time. But if you want to sustain a healthy lifestyle for the long-term,and if you want to have fun doing it as well, grab a few friends.Community, when you embrace it, doesn’t just help you succeed in your goals. Itcan bring you joy. Through deep relationships with others, you get to live inthe love that God wants to give you. When you are surrounded by others who arejust as committed to loving their neighbor as you are, then guess what: You’rethe recipient of that love as well as a giver of it.As 1 John 4:12 says, “No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, Godlives in us and his love is made complete in us.”Reflect and Take a Step …Don’t try to do The Daniel Plan by yourself. Get a buddy or get a few friendstogether. We want you to experience how friendship makes all the difference ingetting healthy — in body, mind, and spirit."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8LIVING THE LIFESTYLE [part0003.html#ch8]Dear friend, I pray that you may enjoy good health and that all may go well withyou, even as your soul is getting along well (3 John 2).Now that you have read about the five Essentials from Pastor Warren, thedoctors, and the fitness expert, perhaps you are wondering if this plan canreally work for you. You may be frustrated that other programs haven’t worked inthe past. Regardless of your starting point, there is great hope for change.Thousands of people across the world have experienced success, enjoying a newway of healthy living.Dee Eastman is one of those people. Although her journey is scattered with highsand lows — times of great joy and moments of tremendous grief — Dee has appliedthe practical principles of the five Essentials. She has created new patternsthat are lasting, ways of responding to life that reduce stress rather thancreate it. The Daniel Plan has become her daily practice, and we are confidentit can be for you as well.Life holds challenges for everyone, and Dee’s journey has been no different. Herfirst daughter was born with severe genetic abnormalities and endured severalsurgeries. But after four short months her baby passed away. In an instant,hopes and dreams of a family were stolen. Dee struggled to understand why Godallowed this loss in her life.Despite tremendous grief and unanswered questions, Dee and her husband movedforward with the dream of having a family. Within a year came a healthy son, andtwo years after that a healthy daughter. Then, shortly after, the surprise of alifetime knocked on their door. Dee was pregnant with identical triplet girls!Spinning with joy over the news, they had no idea how they would juggle fivekids under the age of five. The pregnancy was complicated, and the girls wereborn early at twenty-eight weeks. Dee learned that two of the triplets hadcerebral palsy, and the doctors said one daughter may never walk.In the years ahead, striving to find a new normal, Dee tried to adjust to thegirls’ medical issues and the growing needs of her family. But with her stillcarrying so much grief over the loss and too much to juggle, her health startedto suffer. The emotional stress felt overwhelming. Sinking into depression, shedeveloped irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The physical stress was mounting.Dee turned to a friend, and that’s when the healing began. She experiencedfirsthand the power of friendship. The Bible talks about this in Matthew 18:20:“For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them.”That friendship led her to a small group that encouraged her to honestly shareher struggles. Adopting the Friends Essential while entering into authenticcommunity became Dee’s first step. “I had to learn how to receive, rather thanalways being a giver. I had to learn how to talk about the difficult things inmy life, instead of keeping them hidden.” This transformational concept issomething that Pastor Rick frequently teaches: We are only as sick as oursecrets. To get healthy, we need to share our struggles and be willing toreceive help.Dee’s community moved her forward:I had hidden my anger and disappointment for all the difficulties God hadallowed in my life, but I decided to open up and begin working through myfeelings. I realized that I had put God in a tiny box and that the box needed tobe blown up. I needed to embrace the mystery of who he is and trust him, eventhough some of my questions weren’t answered. I made the decision to refocus onhim, sit still before him, and meditate on his promises. I have learned to livewith intention, to notice that in the midst of stress and strain, God can stillbe in the center.One way Dee worked on this was to purposely reflect on the goodness in her life.She kept a journal in which she poured out her feelings and ultimately focusedon gratefulness, even as life threw curve balls her way. “This has become amoment by moment choice for me, and it comes down to how I manage my thoughtsthroughout each and every day. Proverbs 4:23 says, ‘Be careful what you think,because your thoughts run your life’ [NCV].”With help from a functional medicine doctor, a new eating plan, and a desire tomove and regain physical strength, Dee continued making progress. Step by stepwith practical advice, her physical, spiritual, and emotional health started toimprove. Her depression lifted, and within a few months all the IBS symptomsvanished for good.One healthy step led to another. Dee got out to walk, and she eventually ran,approaching exercise not out of guilt, but because of the healing effect it hadon her body. She then ran a 5K, later a 10K, and eventually a marathon. Todayshe continues to discover all types of movement she enjoys.Dee’s experience is ultimately what made her say yes when Pastor Rick invitedher to be the director of The Daniel Plan. The foundational principles in TheDaniel Plan have radically impacted her life for many years now. And in her roleas director Dee has witnessed people from all walks of life, young and old,embracing the five Essentials to become healthy and strong. It is these storiesof transformed lives and the solid principles of the lifestyle that provide afirm foundation for your growth and the ongoing inspiration for your success tobe built on.Set up your health profile and get more expert advice — go to danielplan.comnow."},{"pageContent":"START WITH ONE THINGOne of the most reassuring things about The Daniel Plan is the fact that it istested and true. Once you decide to take your first step, your journey hasbegun. After you experience the benefits of your first health choice, changebecomes easier.Many began by simply trying a new health habit, just one small thing. Theydecided to start the day with breakfast, or add more veggies to their meals, ortake a brisk walk each day, or invite a friend to work out. Small steps, yes.But we began to see surprising life change. Simple changes started to add up.Small steps took them closer to their big dreams.Dr. Oz recommended that we nudge people in the right direction, and that becameour goal. We were astonished by the transformation that occurred right beforeour eyes. Many started to drop a few pounds. Encouraged by their own progressand by the friends who came alongside them, they continued to make healthierchoices. Within the first couple of months, those small changes snowballed intobig ones; we saw increased energy levels, better sleep, improved mood, and lessneed for medication.Dr. Amen has helped patients navigate the change process for nearly thirtyyears. He says that a gradual approach is the surest way to success. Trying tochange everything at once almost inevitably invites disappointment. Don’t try tochange dozens of unhealthy habits at once. Start with a few vital behaviors —the ones that will have the biggest immediate impact — and go from there.Simply IntentionalThink about your morning and evening routines. Do you find yourself working onyour laptop or just dashing off a few emails right before bed? Are youcompletely rushed as you head out the door first thing in the morning? Smallchanges to your morning and evening routine can be simple, but they can lessenyour stress and make you feel more rested. Try something like deciding you won’tstart working until you’ve gone for a walk and eaten a healthy breakfast, orwon’t end your day without prayer and an inspirational reading. Healthyboundaries like those will remind you that you’re in control of your choices —and you will then be inspired to make healthier choices throughout the day."},{"pageContent":"CHANGE OF MINDOne important truth to remember: God has given you the power to change yourlife, to set new patterns and reactions. What we have learned is that thosechanges can be sustained through the Faith Essential.Your daily choices, with God’s limitless power, done with a community offriends, can help you launch each day with intention and purpose. It begins witha shift in perspective: focusing on the good, acknowledging the abundance, andpaying attention to who you are and the power within you to choose what is best.This new outlook leads the way to your transformation.Within every human heart is a desire to improve, grow, and change. It’suniversal. We might have different reasons for that. What is your motivation ordream?That big dream, that goal, is one of the reasons you picked up this book: Youwant to set new patterns and achieve a healthier, more energetic life. And whatwe have seen over and over on The Daniel Plan is that change is possible. Theability to set new patterns for the long-haul is within your reach. Andrevisiting your motivation day by day will help you. When you begin to do that,you will be amazed at the strength you find.Remember how Wendy Lopez’s life changed dramatically when she took the simplestep of joining a small group? Each woman in the group set two or three small,achievable goals every week. Wendy decided she needed to incorporate regularexercise into her life. She scheduled walks after work, hikes on the weekends,and even made a date with her son at the gym. Her small but key step: She sharedher fitness goals with her small group.This is what makes The Daniel Plan so sustainable. She wasn’t alone in herefforts; she had friends who encouraged her as she set and achieved her goals.They would text her to say they were thinking of her and to ask about herwalking and hiking.For the first time in a long time, Wendy felt encouraged. She was hopeful. Shebegan believing she could do this — because she actually was doing it. Takingsmall steps allowed her to continue and led to big results. Her fitnessimproved, but so did her confidence and motivation. She began to believe thatchange was not only possible, but exciting and within reach.Long-Haul ProgressAlonso Charles is another person whose small steps led to big results. Weighingin at over 400 pounds, he was sick and tired of being sick and tired. He hadlost his confidence. He didn’t have the energy to deal with challenges andstress.Like Wendy, Alonso joined a Daniel Plan small group at Saddleback, and thosegroup members held him accountable to his goals. Since then, he has lost 140pounds. Now he dedicates the food he eats to God’s purposes and doesn’t choosethe heavier foods that once weighed him down. He knows that change is hischoice.Alonso’s focus also improved. He developed a drive to approach his spiritualwalk with an openness to what God was doing in his life. His confidence grew,and he began jogging. As his fitness increased, so did his energy, which led toclearer thinking and decision-making. His insecurities and feelings of beinginferior were replaced by the hallmark of The Daniel Plan: hope.Today Alonso participates in sports and still jogs. The asthma he once sufferedfrom has improved dramatically. His journey has fueled new beliefs about God. Hefinds himself thinking differently: “If God can do this in my life (something Inever thought possible), what else can he do?” His small steps have taken him toa place where he anticipates big things from God. He’s regained the ability todream and developed a heart of gratitude. He is a man of God, transformed."},{"pageContent":"BRING IN THE GOODSo often we subscribe to the misguided notion that change requires deprivation —that transformation somehow requires avoiding certain things. We easily focus onwhat we can’t have instead of the abundance of things we can enjoy.But the truth is, change is much more sustainable when we focus on what we canhave, rather than what we can’t. For example, we have talked throughout thisbook about faith. Some people try to be more faithful only following a list ofrules and things they need to stay away from. While it’s important to honorGod’s commandments, making corresponding positive choices is what transforms us.Choices to joyfully worship God, to serve and love others, to focus ongratitude, to be kind — these choices lead to replenishing our spirit andgrowing our faith.Similarly, when it comes to our physical health, if we focus only on what wecan’t eat or can’t do, we won’t be able to sustain the changes we want. But ifwe focus on bringing in the good and enjoying the abundance of what God hasgiven us, our body, mind, and spirit will become stronger. We will begin to seethat things like walking in the morning or reading our Bible and praying are notthings we “have to do,” but opportunities we “get to take hold of” because theyrejuvenate and restore us. We will cultivate a different relationship with foodwhere we see eating healthfully as a way to be kind to ourselves, to lovinglycare for our bodies.This is how the perspective shift begins. We bring in the good not because we“should,” but because we long for the benefits a healthy lifestyle brings.It’s really about self-discovery — trying something new and realizing that youactually enjoy it. It can be simpler than we think it is. You will discover thatThe Daniel Plan lifestyle is bathed in grace, a God-designed way of life thatbrings energy and passion into your very being.Bringing in the good is about going to the grocery store or the farmer’s marketand finding new healthy foods that you enjoy. It’s about learning to love foodsthat actually love you back. Or it might be about getting back on a bike —something you haven’t done in a long time — or swimming for the first time sinceyou were a kid and realizing how much fun it is.As you do these things, your perspective shifts. Instead of telling yourself, “Ican’t do this; it’s too hard,” imagine yourself thinking, “Learning and tryingnew things is a blast, and I’m going to do more of this.” Now life becomes anadventure with an unending list of opportunities to explore.Each of us is in a different place with our health, but the five Essentials openthe door to change. Enter in just as you are. Start with one thing, but start.Perhaps you will set a goal in faith to take time in God’s Word and be refreshedby his promises. Or you may start by eating more real, whole foods or walkingwith friends. The best place to start is wherever you are. As you focus onprogress, not perfection, you will be equipped to run the race God’s set foryou."},{"pageContent":"RUN YOUR RACEPrior to the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, John Stephen Akhwari of Tanzania wasjust another marathon runner. An Olympic caliber runner, yes. He had wonmarathons in Africa, running with times under 2½ hours.He easily qualified for the Olympics. But in Mexico City, Akhwari encountered anobstacle he had never faced before: the altitude, which caused his legs to crampseverely. Still, he kept running. Then, about halfway through the race, hetangled with some other runners and fell. He dislocated his knee, scraped up hisleg, and hurt his shoulder as he fell. But he didn’t stop. With terribleinjuries and cramped muscles slowing him, he labored on and finished the race.He was one of seventy-five people who started the race, and the last offifty-seven to finish it.When he finally entered the arena for the final lap, only a couple thousandpeople were there to see him complete the race. He finished dead last, more thanan hour behind the winner. A cheer went up for this brave runner as he circledthe now darkened track. Although it seemed that Akhwari had lost the race,everyone who saw him finish knew he was a winner.In an interview later on, a reporter asked, “Why didn’t you quit when you werehurt and bruised, bloody, discouraged? Why didn’t you quit?” His answer: “Mycountry did not send me 5,000 miles to start the race; they sent me 5,000 milesto finish the race.”1 [part0020_split_008.html#ch8ft1]We want to equip you to run the race God has called you to so you can finish itwell. Sometimes that means getting up when you fall and continuing forward nomatter how slow it may seem.A crucial step toward running the race well is to remove the things that hold usback. Hebrews 12:1 tells us, “So let us run the race that is before us and nevergive up. We should remove from our lives anything that would get in the way andthe sin that so easily holds us back” (NLT).You wouldn’t run a marathon wearing a winter parka. If you did, you might expendincredible effort — but never finish the race! It seems like a ridiculousexample, doesn’t it? But so many of us can’t figure out why our efforts seem tobring such small results. We get frustrated: “I’m working so hard but feel as ifI’m getting nowhere! Why is this so hard?”It’s time to take off the parka. Whatever is slowing you down, leave it behind.What is the race God intends for you? To answer that, you must first be honestwith yourself and ask him to lead the way.Many of us are losing energy because we have never taken the time to actuallythink about what is going on in our lives. Dr. Hyman recommends that you simplywrite a list of everything that gives you energy and everything that drains yourenergy. Include all persons, places, things, experiences, thoughts, feelings,and foods. What is it that is slowing you down? What brings you joy and helpsyou thrive? What habits are encouraging you, and what habits are getting in theway?Then, each week resolve to let go of one thing that drains your energy and addone thing that gives you energy. This is an enlightening exercise to do beforedetermining your goals and steps for the next 40 days.Energy drains typically fall into one of three categories: unhealthy habits(such as not getting enough sleep, smoking, eating junk food), unhealthyemotions (such as worry, negativity, or anger), or unhealthy relationships(which could be toxic or codependent). Just becoming aware of those is the firststep toward change, toward overcoming obstacles. Spending a bit of time inserious self-assessment of your habits is the first step toward living a healthylifestyle. Then you are ready to put pen to paper and set some initial goalsAs you begin to incorporate the goals you long to achieve, are you looking foran endless power source to keep you going? Are you ready to tap into an abundantsupply of love and encouragement? The biggest energy source available to each ofus is simply the love of God. He ultimately provides the power to change.He wants you to be filled with his power. He longs to fill you up with his love.It’s amazing that he has called us to be his children and that his love for usnever ends. He’s waiting for us to accept and receive his love. That sounds likea welcoming invitation, doesn’t it? Go ahead, open it.Being close with our Creator, enjoying intimacy with our Father, is foundationalto our life here on earth. It is in quiet time with him that you will receiveand understand his will for your life."},{"pageContent":"REFLECT ON YOUR JOURNEYThe end of this book is not the end of the road. Rather, it is the place whereyour journey begins. Forty days to a healthier life is the kick-start. In orderto keep growing and moving forward, it’s important to reflect on our lives. Thatis why tracking your progress is so important. We have a journal and a mobileapp, whichever you prefer. Whatever your choice, we encourage you to record yourjourney. We can miss out on just how far we have come if we never take time tolook back to see the ups and downs in the road and thank God for how far he hasbrought us.Reflecting on your journey will help you figure out your next small step. AsPastor Warren often says, you cannot manage what you do not measure. Journalingyour progress is practical, and as you make progress, you will be motivated tocontinue.Even the setbacks on your journey can help you move forward. If you payattention and track your progress, a bad day gives you good data. When yourprogress wavers, pay attention. Don’t judge yourself, but learn from yourmistakes, as we discussed in chapter 6. What causes setbacks with your food orfitness? Is it when you get too busy? Is it when you don’t get enough sleep?Notice patterns, cycles, and reactions — not so you can beat yourself up or feelguilty, but so you have more information from which to make healthier decisionsin the future.On The Daniel Plan, there is no condemnation or guilt. We all make mistakes. Thegoal here is to learn from them and set new patterns in the areas where we needthat most. When we track our victories as well as setbacks, we see that God’sgrace is sufficient, and his love is bigger than any of our weaknesses.Steven Komanapalli found this to be true. In chapter 2 you read about Steven,who weighed more than 320 pounds and faced several health concerns. Living TheDaniel Plan lifestyle, Steven is a transformed man. You already know he lostweight, improved his cholesterol and blood sugar levels, and got off most of hismedications.Steven also began walking and praying with two friends every day. That was afirst small step, but it strengthened him to take more steps. Steven focused oncasting all anxiety on God, filling his heart and soul with God instead offinding comfort in food. As he reflects on his journey, Steven knows that havingfriends who can help him is crucial. He feels less hungry but more energetic. Hegets out of bed easily in the morning, feeling well rested — something he wasunable to do for twenty years.When Steven reflects on his journey, he is amazed. Tracking his progressregularly brought the needed insight to continue all the changes he is nowenjoying. Living the lifestyle has brought him not only health, but also greatjoy. He now leads a men’s group and inspires others to lead healthier lives.Steven says there are no limits to his success, because God is without limits.As part of The Daniel Plan, you get a FREE app with recipes, exercises, andsocial tools to connect with each other.

fundamentals laid out in The Daniel Plan. Theonly difference is that you stop eating anything that could potentially triggerhealth issues. Even if you think you don’t have a problem, you might see a bigdifference. If a horse had been standing on your foot your whole life, then youmay not know how bad it feels until he gets off your foot. Most of Dr. Hyman’spatients say, “Dr. Hyman, I didn’t know I was feeling so bad until I startedfeeling so good!” That is our wish for all of you.What you will eat: * Eat real fresh, whole food. * Follow The Daniel Plan Detox meal plan chart, or create your own from the real food ingredients.What you will let go of: * Stimulants and sedatives: alcohol, caffeine, etc. * Processed or fast food (get rid of any additives or chemicals) * Artificial sweeteners of all kinds * All sugar in any form (see page 108) * All dairy (milk, yogurt, butter, cheese) 100%, not even a drop * All gluten (wheat, rye, barley, oats, spelt, kamut) 100%, not even a crumb"},{"pageContent":"HOW DO I DO THEDANIEL PLAN DETOX?The Daniel Plan Detox is easier to do in a group or with friends. Find a friendor small group and do it together. You will be enjoying a delicious variety ofwhole fresh foods and stopping inflammatory or toxic foods. Your body will havea chance to heal, reboot, and reset, allowing you to notice for the first timehow good you can really feel. It may seem like a sacrifice, but if you havenever done it, you owe it to yourself to learn firsthand how profound healingcan come from a few simple dietary changes.If you are on caffeine, you can slowly cut down by half over the course of aweek before you do the detox. That will minimize any caffeine withdrawalheadaches. Be sure to drink at least 8 glasses of water a day. Get plenty ofsleep, rest, and even naps while your body is healing. Do gentle exercise suchas a 30-minute walk a day. Try to cut down on any unnecessary activities oroverscheduling; think of this as a time of renewal and restoration. At the endof the 10 (or 40) days, your body will tell you what it needs. If you feelgreat, just continue eating according to the detox meal plan.If you want to add back healthy forms of dairy or gluten, then make sure you addone at a time. Start with dairy. Have something a few times a day and notice howyou feel. Do you have congestion, bloating, or other symptoms? If you do, thenyou would mostly likely be better off without it. After three days of eatingdairy, add back gluten. Have a piece of bread or some whole grain pasta, andobserve carefully. Do you have joint pain, brain fog, headaches, or stomachproblems? If gluten makes you sick, or even just sluggish and tired, you want toconsider eating gluten free or going on a very low gluten diet. Also, you maytry lower gluten grains such as rye or barley or steel cut oats.Many people have low-grade food sensitivities, and The Daniel Plan Detox is awonderful way to learn how these two common inflammatory foods affect you.Adding back caffeine from coffee or tea is also optional. Notice how you feelwithout the caffeine. You can always have decaf. With that said, however, it isnot bad to enjoy your daily cup of joe. Just be sure you don’t load it up withlots of sugar or artificial sweeteners. For those who enjoy a drink from time totime, again, it can be part of a healthy lifestyle. Just notice how it makes youfeel, how it affects your sleep, energy, and mood. We are all different, and itis key to find the right balance for you.Fill out the following medical-symptom questionnaire that assesses your overalllevel of well-being as well as any toxicity or inflammation. Score yourselfbefore and after The Daniel Plan Detox, or at the end of the 40 days. You willbe surprised by how much you can heal in such a short time."},{"pageContent":"THE TOXICITY AND SYMPTOMSCREENING QUESTIONNAIREThis questionnaire identifies symptoms that help to identify the underlyingcauses of illness and helps you track your progress over time.
