I have been surrounded by powerful women my whole life.Growing up, there were so many women in my life that when my mother brought myfifth sister, Joanne, home from the hospital in December 1962, my older brother,Jimmy, and I ran away. Jimmy was nine and I was eight, and we were only gone forforty-five minutes, but, as the only boys, we had had enough! The girls hadtaken over and they were everywhere. I often joke that I never saw a bathroomuntil I was fourteen years old and that once I actually got in, there wasunusual and frightening stuff scattered everywhere.Not only was I raised by a very powerful mother, who at eighty-one years old andfive feet tall is still in charge everywhere she goes, but I have fivestrong-willed sisters, three incredible daughters, two granddaughters, andfourteen nieces and grandnieces. My wife says I came housebroken when it came todealing with women, but it was not an easy process. As we will see, the femalebrain is very different from the male brain.As I came to understand the complexity and power of the female brain, I marveledat what a difference this information could make to the experience of millionsof women and to the men and children in their lives.When a woman understands the uniqueness of the female brain—how to care for it,how to make the most of its strengths, how to overcome its challenges, how tofall in love with it, and ultimately, how to unleash its full power—there is nostopping her. In her personal development, at work, and in her relationships,she can bring the best of herself to her family, her community, and her planet.By contrast, a woman who is not caring optimally for her brain, who is notgiving it the full range of nutrients, exercise, sleep, and emotional supportthat it needs, is squandering her most valuable resource. If you are not takinggood care of your brain, you are at a significantly higher risk of brain fog,memory problems, low energy, distractibility, poor decisions, obesity, heartdisease, cancer, and diabetes. You can’t have the vitality you need to getthrough the day with all the calm, focus, energy, and joy of which you arecapable. You are most certainly going to age faster and become ill both moreoften and more seriously.Those are the risks that both men and women share—but as a woman, you face someunique additional challenges. You are far more likely than a man to suffer fromanxiety and depression and, in some studies, Alzheimer’s disease. You are farmore susceptible to recurring negative thoughts you just can’t dismiss, to bodyimage struggles that all too frequently morph into eating disorders, and toexcessive self-criticism for not being perfect. You are also more prone topouring yourself into the care of your loved ones and the demands of your job,your family, and your community, finding it ever more difficult to take the timeyou need to care for yourself.These are the risks you face, but you don’t have to fall prey to them. Caringfor your female brain and learning how to unleash its power can free you toreach your full potential to be healthy, loving, successful, and strong. It canallow you to have more satisfying intimate relationships and make you a betterpartner. And it can make you a more effective person at your chosen work. Forwomen who choose to have children, it also prepares you for a successfulpregnancy and equips you to help your children fully unleash the power of theirbrains.Unleashing the power of your female brain is your key to finally having the lifeyou’ve dreamed of and deserve.THE FEMALE BRAIN CAN CHANGE THE WORLDWith the epidemic escalation of obesity, diabetes, depression, and dementia, thehealth of Western society is going the wrong way at an ever more rapid pace. Nowmore than ever, we need thoughtful, intelligent, powerful, “brain smart” womento guide and redirect our families, communities, churches, workplaces, nation,and world. And women are in a unique position to make a dramatic difference.One of the reasons I decided to write this book now is that I know what anenormous difference women can make. Growing up, my mother was the health leaderin our home, and today my wife, Tana, plays the same role. I have seen thispattern repeat over and over in the families I treat as a physician. When theadult females take better care of themselves, it tends to positively affectthose around them.As a neuroscientist, psychiatrist, and brain imaging specialist, I have knownfor decades that women typically take their physical and mental health moreseriously than men do. That is one of the reasons, I’m convinced, that they alsolive longer on average than men. In 2010, U.S. women lived an average of eightyyears, as opposed to only seventy-three years for U.S. men. In Russia, womenlive twelve years longer than men—so, men, if you’re reading this to betterunderstand women, you might want to cut back on the vodka.Women also worry more about their health, which, ironically, is one of the majorfactors associated with longevity. The “don’t worry, be happy” people—more oftenmen drinking at bars or four-wheeling in the desert—are more likely to dieearlier from accidents or preventable illnesses, such as alcoholism, diabetes,hypertension, and heart disease. Those who are appropriately concerned abouttheir health ultimately take better care of themselves and live longer,healthier, and happier lives.Maybe we should change the phrase from “Don’t worry, be happy” to “Be concerned,live longer, be happy!”Women also engage in fewer behaviors that damage the “executive control center”in the front part of their brains, where decisions are made, self-control isexerted, and forward thinking takes place. Girls are less likely to engage inbrain-damaging behaviors such as hitting soccer balls with their heads, orplaying tackle football … at least they used to be, until the explosion ofsoccer among young girls.Women may also live longer than men because they exhibit greater empathy andability to forgive, which helps them do a better job at weathering theinevitable storms of injustice that rain down on us all.In our own patient outcome studies at Amen Clinics, both men and women improvetheir health at very high rates. Yet our female patients tend to do better,because they are more compliant and take our treatment recommendations moreseriously.Empathic, concerned women aren’t just thinking of themselves. They’re alsothinking about their husbands, which may very well be one reason why married menlive longer than unmarried men. I often hear wives nagging their husbands totake better care of themselves. They set out their fish oil capsules andvitamins and encourage them to go to the doctor. Yet, in some studies, marriedwomen do not live longer than unmarried women, and they may even have shorterlives. I think the stress of taking care of stubbornly resistant males can wearthem out. Here’s an example:Nabil and his wife, Monica, were both physicians who worked together. One dayNabil called his wife saying he vomited and had a bad headache and was notcoming to work. Alarmed, Monica told Nabil to go to the hospital. Nabil said hewould be okay and that he just needed a nap and hung up the phone. Knowing thesymptoms could be serious, Monica called Nabil back and pleaded with him to seekimmediate help. Nabil again told his wife he would be okay and not to worryabout him. Knowing how much more significant the symptoms could be for people intheir early sixties, Monica’s worry skyrocketed. She raced home and took Nabilto the emergency room where it was discovered that he had a brain aneurysm.Without immediate medical help, the neurosurgeon told the couple, Nabil wouldhave been dead within an hour.Women often become the health monitors in their families because they tend torealize and admit problems faster than men. They typically reach out for helpand community support years or even decades before their male counterparts. AtAmen Clinics, we see that when a couple is struggling in their relationship, thewoman is most often the one who calls for help. Eight out of ten times, when achild is having problems, the mother is the one who calls us, even when bothparents work full-time.Everywhere I look, I see women acting as the health leaders in their familiesand communities. As one of the co-creators of the Daniel Plan—Pastor Rick Warrenand Saddleback Church’s program to get the world healthy through religiousorganizations—I have seen, not surprisingly, that 85 percent of the people whosigned up to get healthy in their churches were women.As a male psychiatrist and physician, I’m increasingly troubled about the waysuch large numbers of men are falling behind. I remember the day I read thatstatistic from our research team at Saddleback Church—and had an absolutetantrum! Men have to do better, but it is often at the insistence of our mothersand wives.In my experience, women are most often the ones who pull the lever for change.They’re typically the ones who plan the meals, and they are often the ones whocoordinate household activities and oversee the children. Growing up with apowerful matriarch, I learned firsthand that when Mom gets health right,everybody else has the best opportunity to get it right too. And when Momdoesn’t get it right, that can have a truly devastating effect on both thephysical and mental healths of the whole family.During my psychiatric residency training, I studied children and grandchildrenof alcoholics. One of my best friends grew up in a severely abusive alcoholichome. One of my research findings was that if your father was an alcoholic, ithad a significant negative effect on your emotional development. But if yourmother was the alcoholic, the devastating effects were much more profound. It isessential to keep the female brain healthy.Most of this book is devoted to helping you unleash the power of your own femalebrain. Once you fall in love with your brain and learn how to take care of it,and do the steps I recommend, you’ll be able to influence your loved ones andcreate a brain-healthy community around you, further supporting your own effortsto be well.In my last book, Use Your Brain to Change Your Age, I wrote about Marianne, thewestern regional director for Franklin Covey, the highly successful training andconsulting company. At fifty-nine years old, she felt that her mind wasbeginning to deteriorate. Physically, she hurt all over and her head felt foggymost of the day. At first she thought that she was just getting older, that shewas experiencing something that eventually happens to everyone. But as she gotworse, she thought it was unfair to her co-workers that she wasn’t at the top ofher game, and she considered resigning. She believed her best days were behindher. Then, fortuitously, one of her daughters gave her a copy of one of myprograms, which she immediately started. To her amazement, within two months shefelt much better. Her pain was gone and the brain fog had lifted. And by stayingon the program, within a year she had lost 60 pounds, and her brain feltyounger, sharper, and more energized than it had in decades. “I have afast-acting brain with the wisdom of experience,” she told me. “I feel like I amat the peak of my life and my best is no longer behind me.”Recently, Marianne and I were together at a Franklin Covey conference where Iwas speaking. She told me that as she had gotten healthier one of her daughtersgot healthier as well. Her daughter had been 140 pounds overweight. But seeingher mother’s remarkable progress, she wanted the same health benefits forherself and over the next two years lost the 140 pounds. Marianne’s remarkablechange also inspired her husband to get healthy. In fact, everything at herworkplace changed as well. She changed the food at work and was amazed at howmuch more energy her team had and how much more they accomplished duringmeetings. “We used to be worn out toward the end of the day. But since westarted serving only brain-healthy food at work, everyone’s energy is up and weare much more productive.”Marianne is the poster female for change in her family, in her business, and hercommunity. My hope is that you will be like Marianne and change your world too.YET THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THE FEMALE BRAIN MAY BE IN TROUBLEAccording to a recent study, women’s life spans in the United States areimproving at a slower pace than men’s and are actually shorter in many areasthan they were two decades ago! Even though women are still expected to outlivemen, the study from the University of Washington is cause for concern. The studyis based on mortality data by age, sex, and county from 1989 to 2009. In thisstudy, life expectancy for men improved by an average of 4.6 years, but only by2.7 years for women. The director of the research team expressed his concern, “Again in life expectancy should be equal among men and women. This is a wake-upcall for all of us. It’s tragic that in a country as wealthy as the UnitedStates, and with all the medical expertise we have, so many girls will liveshorter lives than their mothers.”Life expectancy stopped improving, or even shortened, since 1999 for women in661 U.S. counties and for men in 166 counties. These declining rates also appearin 84 percent of Oklahoma counties, 58 percent of Tennessee counties, and 33percent of Georgia counties. According to the research, a larger percentage ofwomen than men are not adequately treating high blood pressure and highcholesterol. Researchers reported that many physicians do not treat women withheart risk factors as aggressively as they do men. Preventable causes, such astobacco, alcohol, and obesity seem to be at the heart of the lower lifeexpectancies for women.Across the United States, there is nearly a twelve-year gap in women’s lifespans. Women live the longest in Collier County, Florida (85.8), but have theshortest life spans in McDowell County, West Virginia (74.1). In 1989, the gapwas only 8.7 years. In Australia, life expectancy improved twelve years in bothmen and women from 1989 to 2009. We can do better. We can improve longevity ifyou and your family and friends follow the program in this book.THE FEMALE BRAIN UNLEASHEDIn my family, community, and medical practice, I have seen over and over theamazing change that can result when women understand and take steps to optimizetheir unique strengths and response to challenges. I have also seen the negativeoutcomes, including depression, anxiety, and eating disorders, that can resultwhen women do not understand their own brains or take the necessary steps totake care of them.

Sheloved her husband and her family, and she had a strong sense of mission for herwork. She was active in her local church and was a respected member of hercommunity. Viewed from the outside, Susan seemed to “have it all.”But when Susan came into my office, she told a very different story. “I’m justnot feeling good,” she said. “I’m tired all the time, whether I sleep in on theweekends or not! I can’t remember the simplest things, and it seems like I can’tkeep my mind on anything for more than a minute before something distracts me. Iam feeling very overwhelmed.” She sighed. “And it’s getting worse. Stuff I usedto be able to do easily I now really have to struggle through. I know people saythey slow down as they get older, but I never thought it would happen to me atthis age! I wonder if I have early symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. I picked upone of your books and you had such a positive message, that even when we getolder, we don’t have to feel old. That’s what I want! But all sorts of things inmy body seem to be breaking down. I’m gaining weight. My skin is breakingout—that never used to happen! And my cycles feel more jagged and intense. Butthe worst of it is how crabby and short-tempered I am. My husband keeps tellingme I’m always snapping at the children, and at him, and sometimes I don’t evenrealize it!”THE STRENGTHS AND CHALLENGES OF THE FEMALE BRAINSusan is like so many women I see. She thought she ate a healthy diet butstarted most days with coffee and a bagel and had a terrible sweet tooththroughout the day. She wanted to work out but could not find the time andconsistently drank two glasses of wine at night to relax. There was one majorpart of her body that she never gave any thought to—her brain. This is ironic,because Susan’s brain governs every aspect of her life. Her brain decides whatshe eats and how much she sleeps. Her brain decides whether to snap at herchildren or to take a deep breath and try a different approach. And her braindecides whether Susan is going to live a long and vital life looking and feelingher best or whether she is going to age rapidly, look years older than she is,and perhaps even face a serious disorder like cancer, diabetes, heart disease,or Alzheimer’s.Of course, none of these decisions was necessarily conscious. But they were madeby Susan’s brain nonetheless. And if Susan knew how to take care of her brain,how to give it the biological, psychological, social, and spiritual care itrequired, then she would be more likely to have a healthy, beautiful brain,which, in turn, would help Susan feel terrific and have the energy she needed toenjoy and be effective in her life.Brain health is crucial for all my patients: men, women, and children alike. ButI have noticed, over many years of practice, that my female patients facespecial challenges. As we will see in chapter 2[Amen_9780307888969_epub_c02_r1.htm], women’s brains have five specialstrengths: intuition, empathy, collaboration, self-control, and a little worry.Empathy allows women to be loving and nurturing. Intuition enables them toquickly grasp information that may not be obvious or easy to justify throughlogic. Self-control gives them better control over their impulses. Theircollaborative gifts help them to work with others. And their tendency to worry,when it’s in the right proportions, keeps them focused on possible problems andalert to potential solutions.So far, so good. But like all gifts, these have their dark sides. Empathy canmorph into an overwhelming sense of the world riding on your shoulders, thefeeling that you have to take care of everyone before your own needs ever getmet. Intuition can awaken anxiety-provoking fears as you “know” something is notright without making sure to check it out or get more information. The brainfrequently can misperceive things. Self-control can turn into trying toovercontrol others. Being collaborative can all too easily turn into the feelingthat you aren’t allowed to do anything until you’ve gotten agreement fromeveryone else, such as your co-workers, family, or spouse. And the worry that isso useful in small doses can stress you to the point where it hurts your brainand your body and won’t allow you to rest.Susan too struggled with both the strengths and the challenges of the femalebrain. Like many women, she felt guilty no matter what she did. If she was home,she was thinking about work; if she was at work, she was thinking about home. Adeeply empathetic and caring person, Susan took on everybody’s problems as ifthey were her own. She worried about her personal assistant, who was caring foran elderly mother; her husband, who had come back from the doctor with news ofhis high blood sugar; and her children, one of whom had just started to date.Susan worried about the learning-disabled students for whom her company producededucational materials. And she worried about her own parents; her mother seemedmore forgetful and her father less engaged. Wherever she looked, Susan felt asthough there was another demand she should be meeting, another problem sheshould be solving, another person to whom she could be giving just a little bitmore. She just felt as though whatever she did, she could never win. So ofcourse when her husband approached her for sex or even for an affectionate nightof cuddling in front of the TV, Susan couldn’t stay in the moment and enjoytheir time together. She just couldn’t turn off her busy brain.“Susan,” I said to her after hearing about her concerns, “it sounds like you aretaking care of everyone in your life. But it is time to start taking much bettercare of yourself. Everyone you care about will be better if you are at yourbest.”Susan looked at me and asked, “How do I start?”WHY YOUR BRAIN MATTERS!Your Brain Is Involved in Everything You DoIt makes the healthy choices or the unhealthy choices that make you feel good orbad.When Your Brain Works Right, You Work RightYour healthy reactions and decisions benefit you.When Your Brain Is Troubled, You Have Trouble in Your LifeYour bad choices complicate everything.You Can Change Your Brain and Enhance Your Life!Following brain-healthy guidelines can give you a fresh start.THE FOUR CIRCLES APPROACHTO YOUR FEMALE BRAINAt Amen Clinics, we have developed our Four Circles Approach, which is a “brainsmart” comprehensive approach to evaluating and treating our patients. You arealways more than your symptoms, and to be well, it is critical to take intoaccount all aspects of your biology, psychology, social connections, andspiritual health. Our success rates with patients are very high because we takean integrated approach to understanding and healing the brain. If any one ofthese areas is not optimized, your brain will suffer, and so will your health,well-being, appearance, mood, and relationships.With Susan, I went to the whiteboard in my office and drew four big circles. Inthe first circle I wrote Biology and began with a set of questions to look atthe biological factors influencing her brain. I discovered that no one in herextended family had a history of Alzheimer’s disease or other dementia-likeprocesses, but there was a family history of depression. Susan wasn’t on anymedications. Her diet was not great, which, as we’ll see in chapter 5[Amen_9780307888969_epub_c05_r1.htm], is a terrible thing to do to your brain.She also tended to eat a lot on the run, because she was so busy—also not goodfor the brain.Another big biological problem in Susan’s profile was the five or fewer hours ofsleep she got each night. I understood her dilemma. With four children and ahigh-powered job, it was hard to get everything done in a day. But not gettingenough sleep is one of the worst things you can do for your brain, so this was abig concern.As you’ll learn in chapter 4 [Amen_9780307888969_epub_c04_r1.htm], hormones playa huge role in your brain’s health, and Susan’s hormones were not in the bestshape. Her lab results showed that her thyroid levels were low, as were thehormones produced by her adrenal glands (cortisol and DHEA, ordehydroepiandrosterone), likely from chronic stress. Susan basically relied oncoffee to get herself going during the day. Then she had a couple of glasses ofwine each night to help her relax, which didn’t help her hormones, blood sugar,weight, sleep, or brain. Restoring and balancing Susan’s hormones was going tobe a key aspect of improving her brain’s biological health. I was eager to lookat her brain scans (I’ll tell you more about this soon) to see what was goingon.First, though, I wanted to see what was happening in the other three circles. Inthe second circle I wrote the word Psychology. Psychologically, Susan wasthinking in undisciplined and negative ways; her busy brain kept returning tothe same worries, anxieties, and self-criticisms: I should have done thatdifferently. She probably doesn’t like me. I’m not doing enough for him. What iswrong with me, anyway? Like many female brains, Susan’s was prone to a kind ofperfectionism in which she magnified her flaws and minimized her good points. InSusan’s mind, the few extra pounds she had put on felt like the ultimate proofthat she was old and ugly. Her children’s normal childhood crises were clearevidence of Susan’s not being a good enough mother. And her husband’sfrustration with Susan’s short temper seemed like a sign (completelyincorrectly, as it turned out) that their marriage was in trouble.These psychological issues were both the result of Susan’s poor brain health anda contributing factor to it. Thinking in undisciplined, negative ways is justnot good for the health of your brain, which is why, in chapter 6[Amen_9780307888969_epub_c06_r1.htm], I teach you how not to believe everystupid thought you have. I refer to these “automatic negative thoughts” as ANTs,and I’ll show you several simple, effective ways of ridding yourself of them.In the third circle I wrote Social Connections. There too Susan’s brain wasfacing a number of challenges. Susan felt separated from the most importantpeople in her life, distant from her husband and irritable with her kids. Atwork, she felt overwhelmed. The support she might have gotten from friends orfrom her community at church seemed out of reach, because Susan felt tooexhausted to reach out.In the last circle I wrote Spiritual Health. As it happened, Susan’s brain wasin good shape in this circle. She had a deep sense of meaning and purpose in herlife that sustained her, even in this challenging time. She felt her workmattered to others, and she knew that her presence at home was crucial for herhusband and children. She had a deep sense of connection to God, the planet, andthe future. Susan’s brain definitely benefited from her sense of meaning andpurpose.Having evaluated each of Susan’s four circles, I moved on to look at Susan’sbrain SPECT scans. One of the unique aspects of our work that differentiates usfrom most psychiatrists is our belief that we should actually look at andevaluate the organ we treat. We do a brain imaging study called SPECT (singlephoton emission computed tomography) that evaluates brain blood flow andactivity patterns. It looks at how the brain works. At Amen Clinics we have beenperforming SPECT scans for twenty-two years and have a database of over 78,000scans, giving us a significant edge on how to use them. SPECT scans basicallyshow us three things: areas of the brain that work well and display goodactivity, areas of the brain that are low in activity, and areas of the brainthat are high in activity.Susan’s SPECT scans helped me get an even clearer picture of what was going onwith her. I could see that she had low activity in her temporal lobes, thememory areas of her brain, which explained her forgetfulness. She also had lowactivity in an area of her prefrontal cortex (PFC)—the “executive control”center in the front third of her brain, associated with focus, concentration,and impulse control. The low activity in her temporal lobes and PFC are commonin low thyroid states. I suspected that these problems would improvesignificantly as soon as Susan started taking better care of her brain:balancing her hormones, getting the food, supplements, sleep, exercise, andpsychological help she needed, as well as getting more social support from herloved ones and her community.Susan was also experiencing problems in her limbic system, her “emotionalbrain.” There was increased activity there, probably from the chronic stressthat she felt at work, at home, and every place else. Driving out the ANTs wouldhelp calm this part of Susan’s brain, as would meditation, self-hypnosis, andother relaxation techniques. Healthy food, sleep, a multiple vitamin, fish oil,optimizing her vitamin D level, other targeted supplements, and exercise wouldhelp too.I showed Susan her scan and a healthy one for comparison and pointed out eachone of the areas that could use help. As soon as Susan saw her scan andunderstood what it meant, she asked if it could be made better. This is aquestion I love answering. The last twenty-two years of my life have beenfocused on changing my patients’ brains and changing their lives. “Yes,” I said.“If you follow the program I give you, your brain can become much healthier andyou will feel much better.” That got her excited.“You’re telling me if I do a better job of taking care of my brain, that thisisn’t permanent, right?” she said to me. “If I do the right things, I could havea better brain.”“That’s right,” I assured her. “You have to start thinking and caring about yourbrain.”“Starting now,” she said, “I want a better brain and a better life.” Her facebroke out into a smile. “This is just the best news I’ve heard in a long time,”she added. “What do I do?”Susan had just developed brain envy.Healthy Brain SPECT Scans[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_001_r1.jpg]Susan’s SPECT Scans[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_002_r1.jpg]FALLING IN LOVE WITH YOUR BRAINWhat happened to Susan happens for many of our patients who see their brainSPECT scans: They fall in love with their brains. Seeing the images gives themhope and helps them resolve to do things differently. They develop brain envyand want to have a better brain.Susan began to make changes right away. She told me she would clean up her diet,start getting exercise, make sure to sleep more, and work with me on her thyroidand adrenal gland issues. She learned how to kill the ANTs and set betterboundaries with her loved ones so that she wasn’t immediately taking everyoneelse’s problems onto her own shoulders.At the same time, Susan resolved to spend more quality time with her kids—notmore time but better time. As we’ll see in chapter 11[Amen_9780307888969_epub_c11_r1.htm], mothers often feel so racked with guiltthat they end up doing too much. Then they wear themselves out. I told Susanthat good parenting doesn’t take an inordinate amount of time; it just takesconsistent time. I suggested a powerful exercise you will learn in chapter 11[Amen_9780307888969_epub_c11_r1.htm]. She agreed, and found that she and herchildren all got along better as a result.Susan started playing “Chloe’s Game” with herself and her children. This is anexercise I have done with my daughter Chloe since she was two years old. In thegame you ask yourself, “Is this good for my brain or bad for it?” I suggestedthat throughout the day, whatever actions she took, she should ask herself thissimple question. The answers helped keep Susan and her children makingbrain-healthy decisions. I have a close friend in Hong Kong who plays the gamewith his four-year-old daughter, Kaitlyn. She likes to call it Kaitlyn’s Game.I saw Susan again about a month later, and she was already improving. She hadlost 8 pounds and laughed about the time at the gym when her pants were so loosethey fell down. “Thank goodness,” she said, “it was an all-girls’ class.” Herskin looked younger, and she was more optimistic. Her energy, mood, and outlookwere better too.I love success stories! What is truly wonderful about Susan’s story is that itcan be yours too. But the first step is falling in love with your brain, aradical new concept.THE NEED FOR BRAIN ENVYYour brain is involved in everything you do. It is your brain that decides whenyou get married and when you get divorced. It is your brain that manages yourmoney and helps you be successful at work. And it is your brain that determineshow healthy you are and whether or not your cravings are under control. Whenyour brain works right, you work right. When your brain is troubled, you aremuch more likely to have trouble in your life. Yet most women never really thinkabout their brains, which is a huge mistake, because success in everything youdo starts with a healthy brain.You don’t think about your brain because you cannot see it.You worry about the wrinkles in your skin because you can see them. You fretabout your waistline because zipping up your jeans is taking more and moreeffort. And you become concerned about the gray in your hair and make anappointment with the hairdresser because your roots stare back at you in themirror. Your body gives you feedback when it is not doing well. Your brain, onthe other hand, only gives you an indirect glimpse that something is not rightwhen your mood is off, you can’t sleep, or you start dropping words that used toroll off your tongue.I never really cared much about my own brain until I started my brain imagingclinical work. I had no problem doing jumps on my bicycle and falling on my headwhen I was ten. That’s what tough boys did. I just got back up. I had noproblems playing tackle football and using my helmet to make tackles. The helmetmade me feel invincible. I never gave one thought to the first bout of viralmeningitis (a brain infection) I had in basic training when I was in the U.S.Army or to the second bout I had during my medical internship. I didn’t see anyproblem with drinking a half gallon of soda a day, carrying around extra weight,or being constantly stressed in medical school and beyond. I was tough! Even asI progressed through my psychiatric training and starting a private practice, Inever really thought about my brain. If a physician who specializes in diseasesof the brain doesn’t really think about his brain, why would you?It all changed in the spring of 1991. At the time I was the director of a dualdiagnosis unit in a Northern California hospital, taking care of substanceabusers who also had psychiatric issues, and running a very busy practice. Everyweek, the hospital physicians met for “grand rounds,” our weekly educationalconference. One day, Dr. Jack Paldi, the chief of medicine at a local generalhospital, gave a talk on the practical application of a new brain imagingtechnology called SPECT, which is a nuclear medicine study that looks at bloodflow and activity patterns in the brain. CAT scans and MRIs look at the brain’sanatomy; SPECT looks at how the brain functions. Dr. Paldi said that SPECT andstudies like it would revolutionize psychiatry. Instead of using educatedguesswork to help patients, we would finally have more useful information on theorgan we were actually treating, the brain. He showed us SPECT scans of normalpeople and compared them to the scans of people with Alzheimer’s disease,strokes, brain trauma, and seizures.I was riveted. I had waited a long time for this day in psychiatry. We were theonly medical specialty that never looked at the organ we treated, and so I oftenfelt in the dark with my patients. I felt that I needed more information to helpme understand their brains so I could better target what I did for them. Thatlecture changed the trajectory of my personal and professional life.Over the course of the next few months, I ordered many SPECT scans on mypatients and found them extremely useful. They were so valuable that I alsostarted scanning people in my own family: my aunt who had a panic disorder, acousin who was suicidal and depressed, my children, and then myself. Like manymen, I had the belief that I was 100 percent normal, maybe even a little betterthan normal. Despite my history of playing football and meningitis, I expectedto see a very healthy brain. After all, I had never done any illegal drugs,didn’t smoke, and rarely drank alcohol.And yet my brain did not look healthy. In fact, it looked older than I was. Itactually had a toxic look.“Yuck,” I thought. “I need to do better.”That same week I also scanned my sixty-year-old mother, Dorie, who had anunbelievably beautiful brain. In fact, she later became our poster example of ahealthy brain. Her brain was full, even, symmetrical, and showed healthyactivity throughout. Her great brain function was reflected in the myriadhealthy activities and relationships she had. She has always been the bestfriend to her seven kids, twenty-two grandkids, and ten great-grandkids. I hadbrain envy. I wanted my brain to be like hers.From that moment on, I have thought about ways to optimize my brain and thebrains of my patients, readers, family, and friends. Working to improve my ownbrain function eventually led me to have a better body. With better function inthe front part of my brain that houses judgment and impulse control, mydecisions were better, as were my forward-thinking skills.Brain envy made my life better, and I want the same for you.[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_003_r1.jpg]It is clear that our society is going the wrong way in terms of female brainhealth.Most people just don’t care about their brains. We let our little girls hitsoccer balls with their heads, do dangerous gymnastic routines, and be flyers incheerleading, where they are much more vulnerable to brain injuries. There islittle brain envy because most people never look at or think about their brains.Since most people never get their brains scanned or tested, they have no ideawhen it starts to look troubled.When our patients see their own brain scans, they often develop brain envy andwant their brain to be better. I once treated a nineteen-year-old woman who wasa frequent cocaine abuser. But when she saw on the scan what the cocaine wasdoing to her brain, she immediately stopped! She was a very smart young lady,and as she looked at the scan, she said, “Uh-oh, my brain runs my life and it’snot doing a good job because I am hurting it!” And when I told her that herbrain would not finish developing until she was twenty-five and that her drugabuse might permanently delay her development, she said, “Oh, I don’t wantthat!” and just stopped using altogether. I was so proud of her, and I was evenprouder when years later she became a health care provider.I also treated an amazing woman whose mother and grandmother both had died withAlzheimer’s. In her family, the women had a higher incidence of Alzheimer’s, andthis woman wanted to know her own vulnerability. When she got scanned, she sawthe developing tendency and realized she was in trouble. As a result, shetotally shifted everything in her life—diet, exercise, sleep, and stress—to takebetter care of herself. Today, she is in her late seventies and is stillmentally alert, sharp, and clear-headed. I am very proud of her too.Women face some special challenges, but they also enjoy unique strengths, one ofwhich is admitting the need for help and seeking it when needed. If you are nottaking good care of your brain, you are probably going to face some bigproblems, either coming up soon or looming down the road. But the good news isthat if you develop brain envy, fall in love with your brain, and take bettercare of it, you can turn everything around.BOOSTING YOUR BRAIN’S RESERVE IS CRITICALOne of the most important discoveries I have made through our brain imaging workis a concept I call brain reserve, which is the extra cushion of healthy brainfunction you have to deal with when stresses come your way. The more brainreserve you have, the better you can cope with the ups and downs of your life.The less brain reserve you have, the harder it is for you to handle stress,hormonal swings, aging, and injuries. Without sufficient brain reserve, you arefar more likely to gobble up a bag of Oreo cookies or down multiple glasses ofwine as a coping mechanism. So developing as much brain reserve as possible isessential, and the program in this book will help you do just that.Brain reserve is not a static resource but one that changes constantly,depending on the challenges we face and the care we take of ourselves. From themoment we are conceived, if the environment is healthy, our brain develops witha great deal of reserve to handle the regular stresses of life. If your motherwas healthy when she was pregnant with you, took her vitamins, lived in a cleanenvironment, and was not under inordinate stress, you likely were born with agreat deal of reserve. If, however, she didn’t want you, was chronicallystressed, didn’t sleep, drank alcohol, smoked, used drugs, had poor nutrition,or was exposed to environmental toxins, such as mercury, lead, mold, orsynthetic chemicals, then you were born with less reserve and resilience.In the same way, the rest of your life either enhances or depletes your reserve.If as a child you were nurtured, mentally stimulated, nourished, and kept safein a clean environment, your brain had the chance to build and strengthen itsreserve. But if you were abused, neglected, or fed junk food, or if you playedcontact sports, had mono, or were chronically stressed, then your brain reservewas diminished.Again, as a teen and young adult, being well nourished and living in astimulating, healthy, socially connected environment continues to build yourreserve. But if you smoked pot, drank alcohol, ate poorly, were sleep-deprived,had a concussion, and/or suffered from mood swings or isolation, your reservewas continually being eroded.Throughout our lives, we are either building or stealing from our brain’sreserve. When women or men become symptomatic, such as when you struggle withyour mood, memory, or brain fog, it means your brain’s reserve has beendepleted. Many people erroneously believe that as we age, memory problems,depression, and brain fog are normal. They are not. They are a sign your brain’sreserve has been depleted.You always want to protect your brain’s reserve. You do this by first developingbrain envy: by caring about your brain. Then you need to avoid anything thathurts it while you engage in regular brain-healthy habits. By the end of thisbook, it will be crystal clear how to take good care of your brain. But first,you have to care. This is why I want you to develop brain envy. It will keep youmotivated to protect your brain’s reserve.[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_004_r1.jpg]PROTECT YOUR BRAIN’S RESERVEThink about your family, friends, and co-workers. When there’s a crisis, do someof them completely fall apart—racing for the candy bowl, reaching for a pack ofcigarettes, or searching for solace in drugs and alcohol—while others manage tomaintain their lives in a healthy way? Have you ever wondered why that is? Ihave. In my work, I have noticed that stressful events, such as the loss of aloved one, being laid off from work, or going through a divorce, can lead todepression, changes in weight, a lack of motivation to exercise, and bad dailyhabits in some people but not in others. Part of this difference is caused bythe level of brain reserve each person has developed over the years.Boosting brain reserve may even be more important for the female brain, becauseaccording to some studies, women are more prone than men to dementia illnesses,such as Alzheimer’s.I remember my patient Kimiko, a lovely young Japanese woman who struggled withlearning problems. As a result, she had always felt stupid, especially becausein her culture, education was considered critical and there was a lot ofpressure to perform. Under the circumstances, Kimiko had come to really hateherself.Her brain SPECT scan showed overall low activity. I discovered that her APGARscores, measurements of the health of a newborn in terms of appearance, pulse,grimace, activity, and respiration, were very low, indicating that she likelyhad oxygen deprivation at birth. When I shared that information with Kimiko, shewas so overcome that she couldn’t speak for a while. Then she said, so quietly Icould barely hear her, “The problem is not me. It is something that happened tome.” The scans had actually helped wash away her shame!A moment later, Kimiko asked me, “Can we make it better?” And as I explained toher the brain-healing steps she could take, the approach that you will learnthroughout this book, I could see her excitement begin to grow. Her anxietyturned into enthusiasm and her self-loathing gave way to an open spirit. You cansee her before and after scans below.Kimiko’s Scans Before and After Treatment[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_005_r1.jpg]HOW BRAIN HEALTH CHANGES EVERYTHING FOR YOU AND THOSE YOU LOVEFalling in love with your brain won’t just change your life. It can completelytransform the lives of everyone you love. Just consider the story of Fatima, whoworked with me on an important project to bring my work into corporations aroundthe world.At the time, she was repeatedly encouraging her husband to get healthy, but likemany husbands, Rob was not paying attention. He was forty-four and had backproblems, arthritis in his knees, insomnia, and a sluggish memory. After kneesurgery, his doctor told him that he would never run again. His father had hisfirst heart attack at age forty and died at fifty-eight. Fatima was concerned.In addition, their boys, aged ten and thirteen, were both struggling in school.As Fatima watched the DVDs of my program, Rob and the boys decided to join her.As they watched the shows, brain envy started to take over in their householdand everything in their family has changed, from their diet, to their activitylevel, to making smarter choices.From Fatima:After watching your program, we all fell in love with our brains, especiallyRob. He began following your brain-healthy nutrition plan and has lost 39 poundsin just a few short months. He feels great! He gave up virtually all refinedsugar, all juices and sweet drinks, drastically cut dairy and gluten, and hasdramatically increased his vegetable intake. He also began taking fish oil,vitamin D, a high-quality multivitamin every day and supplements for his brainand says his memory, brain function in general, creativity, and mood have allbeen boosted. He is also sleeping much better and doesn’t get restless legsyndrome anymore. Rob says that he really resonates with the way you explainbrain health. He says you are very logical and easy to understand, and becauseof you he has become much more “thoughtful” in his diet choices, seeing eachchoice of a “best value” for spending his calories. Rob’s pain is gone and hehas just finished his second triathlon this year, both times coming in first forhis age group. At work, in a meeting recently he was able to come up with thename of a client they had seen twelve years earlier.Kaden, age thirteen, was struggling in school, mostly C’s, a couple of D’s whichis alarming because he is really bright. All his teachers said although he was apolite kid, he was having trouble focusing and staying on task, and frequently“spaced” homework assignments. At home, Kaden was argumentative, complainedabout not being able to focus on homework, and had begun looking fordisagreements with his little brother which was out of character for Kaden.Sage, age ten, was a little crankier than usual and grades were A’s and B’s,although he is capable of straight-A work. His teachers said he was rushingthrough school assignments and not checking his work.We followed your recommendations for each and limited TV and video games to nomore than a combined total of a half hour per day. We upped their exerciseopportunities and put them on fish oil, a high-quality multi, and L-tyrosine,with a high-protein breakfast and regular protein snacks throughout the day.When we went to parent-teacher conferences one month later, all seven of Kaden’steachers commented that he had made “dramatic improvement,” and some of themsaid, “Whatever you’re doing different, please keep it up.” Kaden now hasstraight A’s in all of his classes, is listening really well at home and isgetting along much better with his brother.Sage has straight A’s and has been able to slow down and focus more on checkinghis work. He is much more amiable at home when he doesn’t play video games.Now that Rob had such great improvement, his mom and siblings also got on theprogram.Because of the changes in the household, I am less stressed and happier as well.Thanks so much for your life changing insights! Our family has really benefitedfrom your programs!I share this message because I want you to see the power that women can have tochange not only their own brains but also the brains and bodies of those theylove. The contrary is also true: If your brain habits are not healthy, it isless likely that your family’s will be.I don’t write this to make anyone feel guilty; so many women just don’t know theright things to do. I share these stories to motivate you to change and help mechange the world now that you have new information. It is common for women tocome up to me and say that they have been doing all the wrong things at home andthey are concerned about children who are overweight or struggle with behavioralproblems. They feel tremendous guilt and sadness. The bad feelings are nothelpful for you unless you use the new information to make a significant changefor yourself and those you love.When you get the message in this book, you, like Fatima, can transformeverything in your life, and in the lives of those you love. Mari is anotherexample.MariMari, forty-four, is an award-winning CEO of a fast-growing sheet metal company.She is a rare woman in a macho, man’s business world. Yet her road to the topwas not easy and had many horrifying turns along the way.Mari grew up as a latchkey kid with an unreliable, single mother in anunpredictable, chaotic environment that often left her anxious, stressed, andalone. As a way to show love, her mother fed Mari fast food, candy, or cookies.Perhaps as a way to gain some semblance of control over her life, as a teenagershe developed bulimia (a common eating disorder that often includes bingeing onhigh-carbohydrate foods and purging with self-induced vomiting, laxatives, andexcessive exercise). And she smoked marijuana and drank alcohol as a way tosoothe herself. Given her upbringing, it was not surprising that her firsthusband, Joe, a sheet metal contractor, had his own struggles with alcohol anddrugs.After they started having children, Mari’s maternal instincts told her that thedrugs and alcohol had to stop. “The party’s over,” she told Joe. But for him itwas not that easy. The tension and distance in their marriage escalated and afew years later she asked for a divorce. They tried to patch things up, but itwasn’t working, and to her regret Mari found herself involved in an affair.When Joe found out, his world crashed down around him. He told all of theirfriends and neighbors that Mari was a whore, including the psychiatrist theysaw. She was racked with guilt and shame. A year later, Joe was taking anantianxiety medication that lowers brain function and an antidepressant thatalso lowers brain function; all the while, he was still drinking (which alsolowers brain function), and he kept getting worse and worse. Mari’s intuitionwas that Joe would either hurt himself or someone else. She told her fear to thepsychiatrist at their last appointment. “She didn’t listen to me because I wasthe whore who caused all the misery.” A day later, Joe called Mari and pleadedwith her to come to his office. But her intuition told her it was dangerous andshe didn’t go. Later that evening, Joe shot and killed himself. The police latersaid if she had gone to the office, Joe would have likely killed her too.Mari’s life was a blur for the next few years. Before his death, Joe had stoppedpaying taxes, and the business was upside down. She had to deal with devastatedchildren, probate, a business that was in trouble, the IRS, and her own guilt.But through the help of her faith and friends, she was able to forgive herselfand she started to rebuild the business. She found that she had a knack for itand within three years the business turned a profit. Now her business isthriving and she has more than one hundred employees. In 2011, Mari was giventhe Orange County Business Journal’s Excellence in Entrepreneurship Award andthe National Association of Women Business Owners Innovator Award.Still, however, Mari struggled with bulimia and the feelings of anxiety andinsecurity. She learned about my work through her church and then saw myprograms on public television. She wanted to be better. One day I got a callfrom my sister Mary, who was one of Mari’s best friends. Mari left Mary a voicemail saying she wanted a better brain. “I totally have ‘brain envy’ and want todo everything I can to get truly healthy, physically and emotionally, formyself, my children, and my business.”Mari then attended one of the groups at Amen Clinics taught by my wife, Tana,who showed her how to eat right, exercise, take some simple supplements, and doall the things it would take to have a better brain and a better body. Theprogram also included information on controlling negative thought patterns andbehavioral issues. Within a few weeks, Mari said her brain was much sharper andthat she was better at work. In fact, during the class her business closed amillion-dollar deal, which Mari said was due in part to her better brainfunction. “If I had not gotten clear-headed, I might have missed the window ofmaking this deal.” Since being on our brain-healthy program Mari reports thatshe is more focused, stays on task better, holds people more accountable atwork, is less distracted, and less reactive to her day.Mari’s habits have rubbed off on her children, and she has started to implementchanges at work. Mari wants her employees to benefit from the program and hasstarted to take steps to create a brain-healthy company.Women like Mari can change their brains … change their lives … change theirworlds.Hour 1 Exercise—Boost Brain EnvyUnleashing the power of the female brain starts with brain envy. You have towant to have a better brain. When I say this in lectures, people laugh. It issuch a foreign, funny concept, but since your brain controls everything you do,getting it to function at its best will improve everything in your life fromyour relationships to work, finances, and physical health.For you to consistently make the right decisions regarding your brain, you musthave a burning desire to get it healthy. Why do you care about your brain? Writeit down and look at it every day.Write down at least five important reasons to get healthy, such as these: • Living longer • Looking younger • Feeling happier • Feeling calmer and more relaxed • Making better decisions • Having better energy • Increasing mental clarity • Being a better role model for my children • Having greater self-esteem • Looking better in jeans or a bathing suit • Being able to participate in sports and other activities I used toenjoy • Having a better relationship with my spouse • Reversing diabetes, heart disease, or other health risks • Decreasing my risk for Alzheimer’s disease and other diseases of aging • Having the confidence to apply for the job I really wantOnce you write these down, post them where you can see them every day. Knowingyour motivation is essential to wanting to do the right things for your brain.ANCHOR IMAGESFifty percent of the brain is dedicated to vision. Having visual cues andreminders about brain envy is a very effective tool to help you stay on track.For me, I have pictures that remind me why I need and want a great brain. I havepictures of my wife, four children, and five grandchildren everywhere. Plus Ihave special “anchor” images that remind me in an instant why I want a betterbrain.As I write this, one of my grandchildren is sick. Emmy has a very rare geneticdeletion syndrome, which causes bad seizures and developmental delay. In thefirst month of her seizures, in one day, she had 160 seizures. I need to be hereand be healthy to help Emmy and my daughter Breanne for as long as I can. If Iam not healthy, I will never be my best for the people who need me. I never wantto be a burden to my children. I want to be the leader of my family, but theonly way that is possible is if I have a good brain. I post my anchor imageswhere I can see them every day, to remind me why I need to stay healthy. Isuggest you do the same.My Anchor Images of Emmy[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_006_r1.jpg]THE FORK-IN-THE-ROAD EXERCISEOne of my favorite exercises with my patients is one I call the Fork in theRoad. Here I want you to vividly imagine a fork in the road with two paths.To the left, imagine a future of pain. If you don’t care about your brain andjust keep doing what you’ve always done, what will your life be like in a year?In five years? In ten years? I want you to imagine your brain continuing to getold and all that goes with that: brain fog, tiredness, depression, memory loss,and physical illness.To the right, imagine a future of health. If you care about your brain and dothe exercises I recommend, what will your life be like in a few days, in a year?In five years? In ten years? I want you to imagine your brain getting healthierand younger and all that goes with that: mental clarity, better energy, abrighter mood, great memory, a trimmer, healthier body, healthier skin, and ayounger brain."},{"pageContent":"2HARNESS THE UNIQUE STRENGTHS OF THE FEMALE BRAIN[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_L02_r1.jpg]USE YOUR INTUITION, EMPATHY,COLLABORATION, SELF-CONTROL,AND A LITTLE WORRY TO GIVE YOURSELFA GREAT ADVANTAGE[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_L03_r1.jpg]Nurturing your strengths and protecting against your vulnerabilities is thesecond step to unleashing the power of the female brain.[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_L03_r1.jpg]If you want anything said, ask a man. If you want anything done, ask a woman.—MARGARET THATCHERMale and female brains are different. I know some people will be irritated whenthey read this. They want us all to be the same. But after looking at nearly80,000 brain SPECT scans over the last twenty-two years, it is just so.In a research project in which we compared 26,000 healthy, age-matched male andfemale SPECT scans, the results showed that women had significantly overallincreased activity compared to men in seventy of the eighty areas tested. In theimages on the following page, the white shows the areas of increased activity inthe female brain compared to male brains. This is very consistent with ourextensive clinical experience. Women have busy brains; men’s are a lot quieter.One pattern is not better than the other; they are just different.We’re not completely different, of course, but we are different in subtle waysthat can have a big impact. These differences are often reflected in the way thetwo genders interact with each other; and may be why we so often misunderstandeach another and can so easily get on each other’s nerves.Comparison of 26,000 Male and Female Brains[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_007_r1.jpg]A word of caution: These are measurable differences that always fall within arange of responses with a lot of overlap between groups. Obviously, not allwomen are the same. Nor are all men the same. Some women have low activity intheir brains, some men (me, for example) have high activity. Some women’s brainsact more like the average man’s, and some men’s brains act more like the averagewoman’s. There is evidence that the brains of homosexual or bisexual individualsmay lie somewhere in between. Both men and women can be great mathematicians,engineers, doctors, lawyers, astronauts, cooks, real estate agents, parents, andcaregivers.But overall, there are significant brain differences between the sexes that canbe measured in a laboratory, seen on a brain scan, and observed in our everydaylives. Even when men and women succeed at the same task, they may call ondifferent strengths and areas of the brain to do it.WHY THE DIFFERENCES?At the very beginning of life, you can’t see any differences between male andfemale brains. In fact, in the early stages of development in the womb, male andfemale fetuses both have female brains. But they don’t stay that way for long.And it’s all because of a Y chromosome.We’re all born with a blueprint that provides the instructions for how we willdevelop. The individual instructions are in our genes, and the genes areclustered onto chromosomes. A human has twenty-three pairs of chromosomes, withone member of each pair coming from our mother and the other from our father.The sex of a baby is determined by one particular pair made up of either XX orXY chromosomes. If both chromosomes are of the X variety, the baby will be agirl. If one is an X and the other a Y, the baby will be a boy. Mothers alwayscontribute an X chromosome (that’s all they have). Fathers can contribute eitheran X or a Y chromosome (they have one of each), so it is the father whodetermines the sex of the baby.The Y chromosome in the male fetus is very important, because, among otherthings, it gives the instruction for the male testicles to wake up and startproducing large amounts of testosterone halfway through the pregnancy. As aresult, between eighteen and twenty-six weeks, an irreversible transformation instructure takes place that stamps the brain as recognizably male.Meanwhile, the hormone estrogen has been bathing the brain of the unborn female,influencing and feminizing its development. The difference is so profound thatby twenty-six weeks in utero, researchers can use ultrasound to distinguishbetween male and female brains.Psychologist Simon Baron-Cohen has been studying the effects of fetaltestosterone on brain and child development. In the late 1990s, he launched theCambridge Longitudinal Fetal Testosterone (FT) Project, a research program thatfollowed children of mothers who had amniocentesis, a procedure where fluid istaken from the womb sack during pregnancy, to study the long-term effects of FT.The study revealed that higher levels of FT are negatively correlated withsocial and language development.As fetal testosterone went up, eye contact, empathy, and the ability to readwhat was in someone else’s mind went down.THE SECOND BURSTHormones come into play again at puberty, when a second burst of testosteronetransforms a boy into a man. Around this time, a girl’s brain informs herovaries to produce greater quantities of estrogen and other female hormones thatbegin to transform her into a woman. With all these hormones surging throughtheir bodies, the adolescent boy and girl become extremely interested in eachother.As with boys, too much testosterone in females can cause social troubles. WhenDr. Baron-Cohen and colleagues gave testosterone to a group of sixteen youngwomen, it led to a significant impairment in empathy, even more so if they hadbeen exposed to higher levels of FT. I’ll tell you more about high testosteronelevels in women when we discuss polycystic ovary syndrome in chapter 4[Amen_9780307888969_epub_c04_r1.htm].SO MUCH ALIKE …Understanding some basic brain anatomy will help you know your brain andunderstand some of its uniquenesses.The human brain typically weighs about 3 pounds and is the consistency of softbutter. The most noticeable structure in human brains is the cerebral cortex,the wrinkly mass that sits atop and covers the rest of the brain. The cortex hasfour main areas, or lobes, on each side of the brain: frontal, temporal,parietal, and occipital.The frontal lobes consist of the motor cortex, which is in charge of movement;the premotor cortex, which plans movement; and the prefrontal cortex, which isconsidered the executive part of the brain. The PFC is the most evolved part ofthe human brain: It is the center of focus, forethought, judgment, organization,planning, impulse control, and empathy, and it allows you to learn from themistakes you make. It makes up 30 percent of the human brain. In contrast, ourclosest cousin, the chimpanzee, has a PFC that makes up only 11 percent of itsbrain; a dog’s PFC makes up just 7 percent, and a cat, only 3.5 percent. It’s agood thing a cat has nine lives, because its PFC isn’t going to do much to keepit out of trouble!As we will see, females typically have a larger PFC, which is associated withincreased empathy, focus, impulse control, and self-control.The temporal lobes, underneath your temples and behind your eyes, are the seatof auditory processing, naming things, getting memories into long-term storage,and emotional reactions. They are the “what pathway” in the brain as they namewhat things are. The parietal lobes, to the top side and back of the brain, arethe centers for sensory processing and direction sense. They are the “wherepathway” because they help us know where things are. And the occipital lobes, atthe back of the cortex, are concerned primarily with vision. Information fromthe world enters the back part of the brain (temporal and parietal lobes), isprocessed, and then passes to the front part of the brain for decision making.[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_008_r1.jpg]Sitting beneath the cortex is the deep limbic, or emotional, system. This is thepart of the brain that colors our emotions and is involved with bonding,nesting, and our sense of smell. It has been estimated to be larger in women.The cortex is divided into two hemispheres, left and right. While the two sidesoverlap in function, the left side in right-handed people is generally the seatof language, which is why it is considered the dominant hemisphere. The lefthemisphere tends to be analytical, logical, detail-oriented, and capable ofconceiving and executing plans.The right hemisphere is home to the poet within us. It sees the big picture, theforest to the left hemisphere’s trees. It sees patterns and is responsible forhunches and intuition. It allows people to recognize problems that need to beaddressed. The right hemisphere features connections from more distant parts ofthe brain, so it can draw on many different inputs to reach its conclusions.In his book The New Executive Brain, Dr. Elkhonon Goldberg describes that novelactivities are processed preferentially in the right hemisphere whereasactivities that are more routine become managed by the left hemisphere.Compared to the left hemisphere, the right hemisphere also tends to be morefearful, anxious, and pessimistic. The right hemisphere develops earlier andmore quickly than does the left. This may be why the default human positionseems to be negative (lots of ANTs—automatic negative thoughts). When we areyoung and helpless, we tend to experience the world through the right hemispherewith its negative bent.Damage to the right hemisphere has been shown to give people a higher level ofsubjective well-being (by damping down the anxious tendencies), and some ofthese people may end up in denial about serious problems. I think this is why atAmen Clinics we tend to see people who have left-sided brain problems more thanright-sided trouble.It’s almost as though there are two personalities with the human being, eachrepresented by one of the hemispheres. But fortunately, in healthy brains, thetwo sides do not work independently. Instead, they work in concert together tomake us who we are. This collaboration between the different sides of the brainis made possible by three nerve bundle connections that enable them to shareinformation; the largest of these is the corpus callosum.EQUALLY SMART, DIFFERENTLY WIREDThe most obvious difference between male and female brains is that the former islarger, about 8 percent to 10 percent on average. That’s no surprise, since malebodies are larger overall. However, even correcting for total body weight, ithas been estimated that men have 4 percent more neurons or brain cells thanwomen. When I was on Carolyn Davidson’s radio show in Dallas, she asked me, “Whydo men need 100 extra grams of brain tissue to accomplish the same things aswomen?” The size difference is not consistent across the entire brain; someparts of the female brain are larger than the corresponding parts of the male,and vice versa.Dr. Jill Goldstein of Harvard Medical School used MRI scans to compare male andfemale brains. She found that compared to men, women have larger volume in thefrontal cortices and limbic cortices. Remember, the frontal cortex is involvedin many of the higher cognitive functions, including language, judgment,planning, impulse control, and conscientiousness, while the limbic cortices areconcerned with emotional responses. This might explain why women tend to be lessimpulsive and more concerned with emotions than are men, as well as why theyhave “busy” brains that won’t stop worrying. It might also explain the source ofthe female brain’s key strengths: intuition, collaboration, self-control,empathy, and a little worry.Imaging also consistently shows that the hippocampus, one of the major memorycenters in the brain, is larger in women than in men. Men, on the other hand,have bigger amygdalas, the part of the brain that processes fear and anger,which may be why men often jump to those emotions in a crisis. Compared towomen, men have larger parietal lobes, which are concerned with the perceptionof space. Women use language (and collaboration) to ask for directions; men usetheir parietal lobes to find their own way. Men also tend to have larger volumein the hypothalamus, which is concerned with sexual behavior. It’s no wonderthat men have a greater interest in sex.Men and women are equally smart, but each sex tends to use different parts ofthe brain to solve problems or achieve goals. For example, researchers at theKennedy Krieger Institute found that male and female brains showed differentpatterns of lateralization, which sides of the brain they used, when performingdifferent types of tasks. During a language task, men seemed to rely almostcompletely on the left “language” side of the brain, showing more activitythere. However, during a visual–spatial task, such as constructing somethingwith blocks, men showed activity on both sides of the brain.Women, by contrast, showed more activity on both sides of the brain during alanguage task and were more “lateralized” to the right side during thevisual–spatial task. This could explain why women are more adept at language(they use both sides of their brain), while men are more adept at judgingdistances and making a beeline to where they parked the car.GRAY MATTER, WHITE MATTER:DOES IT REALLY MATTER?Well, yes, it does. The percentage of gray matter versus white matter is anotherkey difference between male and female brains. Gray matter is composed mainly ofbrain cell bodies; while white matter is made up of brain cell tracks (thinkcommunication cables) that provide the connections between cells. They appearwhite because they are covered in a fatty substance known as myelin. Myelin,like insulation on copper wires, helps nerve cells work faster and moreefficiently.A consistent finding is that females have a higher percentage of gray mattercompared to males, whereas males have a higher percentage of white matter. Butthese figures are for the entire brain, and the matter—gray or white—is actuallymore complicated than it first appears. It turns out that in the parts of thebrain that are related to intelligence, the proportions are reversed: Men havemore gray matter (6.5 times the amount found in women), whereas women have morewhite matter (10 times the amount found in men). This means men are likely to domore localized processing of information, using only a few key areas to workthrough a problem or task, while women draw on many areas at the same time.What does this mean? According to Richard Haier of the University of California,Irvine, “These findings suggest that nature has created two different types ofbrains designed for equally intelligent behavior.” You see, it’s the gray matterthat “thinks,” but it’s the white matter that connects different brain areas sothat thinking can benefit from a wider range of information and therelationships between them.Dr. Haier’s work also showed gender differences in the areas of the brain mostinvolved with intelligence. In women, 84 percent of the gray-matter regions and86 percent of the white-matter regions involved in intelligence were located inthe frontal lobes, the “executive” part of the brain that governs, among otherthings, planning, impulse control, empathy, and worry. Men’s front lobes heldonly 45 percent of their gray matter and 0 percent of their white matter.Instead, for men, the areas of the brain most associated with their intelligencewere more on the left side of the brain.INTUITION: WHY WOMEN JUST “KNOW” THINGSLike all creatures, we have built-in defense mechanisms. We are not the fastestor most ferocious, but we have big brains! And intuition, or knowing somethingwithout knowing how you know it, is one of our strongest assets. Without ourbeing aware of where the information came from or the reasoning process behindit, intuition presents a conclusion to the conscious mind. The unique structureand functioning of your female brain may give you an advantage here.As a woman, you tend to use broader connections in the brain, whereas a man’sbrain tends to be more localized. The greater density of white matter in theareas of the brain related to intelligence means that you are more likely makingmore connections between the different parts of your brain. Compared to a man,you dip more into your right side, which is thought to be the seat of theemotional and spiritual worlds—the source of extrasensory wisdom. This allowsyou to pick up on more cues and connect them without even being aware thatyou’re doing so.A woman also senses information based on gut feelings. She can sense when afriend or co-worker is depressed, a child is feeling overwhelmed, or a meetingis becoming tense. Brain imaging studies show that females have larger areas inthe brain dedicated to track gut feelings, specifically areas deep in thefrontal lobes called the insula and anterior cingulate gyrus. The female brainis generally quicker at assessing the thoughts of others based on limitedinformation, gut feelings, and hunches.For many people, intuition is hard to accept. Skeptics often describe it asemotional, unreasonable, or unscientific. But Einstein knew better. He wrote:The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a faithful servant.We have created a society that honors the servant and has forgotten the gift.Intuition, in combination with a rational mind, allows us to make predictionsthat will amaze us. “I knew it,” we will say later when our intuition bearsfruit.Throughout time and across cultures, humans have believed that women are able totap into special sources of knowledge that at times seemed uncanny. My motheralways seemed to have eyes in the back of her head and knew instinctively when Iwas not being 100 percent honest.Scientific research bears out this cultural wisdom, showing that women pick upmore on nonverbal cues, which allows them to be more intuitive and empathic.They also have been shown to be better than men at recognizing facialdifferences and changing vocal intonations. Ruben Gur, Ph.D., a psychologist andneuroscientist at the University of Pennsylvania, reported that “women arefaster and more accurate at identifying emotions.”Why would women develop this kind of interconnectedness leading to intuition toa greater extent than men? Researchers have surmised this skill may havedeveloped because of the special conditions women have always faced,particularly their unique tasks in the human family. First, as caretakers ofinfants, women have always needed special skills to pick up on the needs ofothers who could not use language to express themselves. An intuitive woman wasbetter able to help her babies survive. At the same time she had to read andproperly respond to the messages of more powerful—perhaps dangerous—males. Herintuitive skill was likely necessary for her survival.Not all researchers have found women more intuitive than men. In one fascinatingstudy, researchers found that men who were paid to pay attention to theirintuition actually were able to perform as well as women on intuitive tasks. Theproblem, of course, is that intuition can happen at any time, not just whensomeone else is paying us to pay attention to it.THE DARK SIDE OF INTUITIONLike all gifts, intuition has its downside. Sometimes intuitive women “know”things that simply aren’t true. Rather than check out their perceptions in otherways, they cling to their initial beliefs, which can cause serious problems forthemselves and their loved ones.It is likely best to strive to make decisions with both sides of your brain. Ifyou just make decisions with your intuition, you could get hurt! I have seenwomen who were married to abusive men, wanting to believe the trauma will nothappen again, and calling it intuition. Once you have an intuitive thought, askyourself, “What’s the evidence for it?”Women worry more than men, which makes them better at sniffing out potentialproblems—but this also makes them prey to negative thoughts that simply lie tothem. When you let the ANTs become undisciplined, they infest your mind, andbecome the seeds for anxiety and depression. If you have a feeling aboutsomething, check it out.LINDORA’S INTUITIVE FEMALE CEOMy good friend Cynthia Graff is the CEO of Lindora, a highly successful group ofweight-loss clinics in Southern California; it is primarily a femaleorganization. Cynthia places high value on intuition, which she believes offersher company a competitive advantage. “If you tap into your intuition,” she says,“you can get me the solutions faster than if you have to wade through all thedata.”“Of course, it’s important to validate women’s intuition,” Cynthia warns, assometimes women’s intuition can run away with them. A woman might walk by aco-worker and notice that her co-worker’s head is down and that she has a grim,preoccupied look on her face. The first woman can all too easily jump to theconclusion that her co-worker is mad at her, an intuitive read that isn’tnecessarily correct. Perhaps the co-worker is having a bad day, worried aboutsomething at home, or just having gas pains! The intuitive woman will sufferneedlessly if she “knows” the worst and doesn’t bother to check it out.This is a problem I have certainly run into with the women in my own life. Ioften have to say to my wife, daughters, and sisters, “Please don’t read mymind. I have enough trouble reading it myself!”Intuitions can be affected by a number of different biological factors, such ashow much sleep you’ve gotten, the time of your menstrual cycle, and whether yourblood sugar is high or low. Intuition is far more reliable when you’re rested,nourished, and relaxed. And you don’t always know when hunger, exhaustion, ormenstrual issues are distorting your judgment. Get both sides of your braininvolved. If you undervalue your intuition, you’re depriving yourself of aspecial gift; but if you overvalue your intuition, you may make importantmistakes.FACTORS THAT CAN DISTORT YOUR INTUITION • Hunger (low blood sugar) • Lack of sleep • Generally high stress levels • Specific stressful events (sick child, fight with partner, worry overparents, tough deadline) • Illness or pain (flu, headache, indigestion) • Time of your menstrual cycle • Continuous or unpleasant noise • Feeling crowded or invaded in your personal space • Feeling unappreciated or not listened to, which often amps up the needto “prove” your intuition right instead of keeping a more open mindWHY WOMEN MAY MAKE BETTER BOSSES • Increased empathy • Collaboration • Concerned about social cohesion of the group • Less risk-taking behavior • Greater volume in part of the PFC (executive part of the brain), whichis the center of judgment, planning, empathy, and impulse controlEMPATHY AND COLLABORATION:WHY WOMEN MAY MAKE BETTER BOSSESAnother key strength of the female brain is empathy, the ability to recognizeand share other people’s experiences, to put yourself in another’s position andfeel what they feel. Within both male and female brains, we have mirror neuronsthat are activated when we empathize or identify with another person. Mirrorneurons allow to us actually feel what another person is feeling, which is whywe get scared during scary movies and feel sad or even cry during sad scenes.Research demonstrates that women have stronger empathic tendencies than males,which is likely a function of their bulkier frontal lobes. Damage to this partof the brain impairs empathy.Research published in the journal Neuroscience in 2009 reported that females hadsignificantly more gray matter in the regions of the brain’s mirror neuronsystems compared to males.An article in the June 2011 Harvard Business Review had an intriguing title:“What Makes a Team Smarter? More Women.” The article reported on a study inwhich teams were given a number of tasks involving brainstorming, decisionmaking, and problem solving. Teams were given collective intelligence scoresbased on their performance.Guess which teams did better. If you guessed that it was the teams that hadhigher individual IQ scores, you would be wrong. The teams that had a higher“group IQ” were the teams with more women.Why this is so may be found in the work of Simon Baron-Cohen, who identifies twobrain types. The male brain relies on systemizing tendencies to figure out howthings work. A man searches for the underlying rules governing why a systembehaves as it does. The goal is to understand the system so he can predict whatwill happen next. The female brain is better defined by its empathizingtendencies, which are driven to identify what another is thinking and feeling sothat an appropriate response can be made. A woman’s goal in this case is tounderstand another in order to predict behavior and form an appropriateemotional connection.These differences may appear very early. Dr. Baron-Cohen’s research on infantsbacks previous findings by other researchers that girls are more “peoplecentered.” He studied one-day-old infants in the maternity ward by presentingthem with either the friendly face of a female student or a mobile that matchedthe color, size, and shape of the student’s face and included a scrambled mix ofher facial features. The experimenters, without knowing the sex of the babies,found that the baby girls spent more time looking at the student. The boys spentmore time looking at the mechanical mobile. There was a significant differencein social interest of boys and girls, and it was in evidence from the first dayof life.ACCORDING TO SIMON BARON-COHEN’S RESEARCH, HIGHER FETAL TESTOSTERONE ISASSOCIATED WITH • Less eye contact • Fewer words • Lower empathy • Higher tendency to systematize or collect things • Higher interest in constructing objects • Lower volume in the planum temporale, the brain area associated withlanguage • Lower volume in an area of the PFC involved with impulse controlMen may be more focused on problem solving, with less concern for the emotionalcohesion of a group. They may be less aware of one another and more isolatedwithin themselves. Women tend to be more sensitive to the emotional atmosphereand more inclusive. On the other hand, women can get overemotional and losetheir ability to function when negative emotions flare up.A woman’s enhanced empathic response may give her an advantage in building aconsensus within a group. Many women leaders encourage collaboration overindividual power. And all of this may serve to make them excellent leaders.Just as women have to be careful with the dark side of intuition, though, theymust watch out for the dark side of empathy: codependence or doing too much forothers. Another downside is something known as compassion fatigue. This iscommon among therapists and caregivers, where there is a much higher percentageof women both professionally (social workers, nurses, home health aides) andpersonally (such as the mothers of children who are physically disabled,learning-disabled, autistic, or struggling with ADD). After spending hours eachday caring for someone in pain, an empathetic person can feel overwhelmed,developing anxiety or depression as a result. It’s important to take time torestore yourself so you can continue to care for others and yourself.Of course, many men are intuitive, compassionate, empathic, and collaborative.It just takes more work and sometimes more incentives for us.THE STRENGTHS AND CHALLENGES OF A FEMALE WORKPLACEAt the Lindora weight loss clinics, 99 percent of the staff are female, as are85 percent of the patients, so Cynthia is quite aware of how the female brainoperates in the workplace. I asked her about the strengths and challenges ofwomen in the workplace, and this is how she responded:The culture of our company is very nurturing. We nurture one another so that wecan help both our staff and our patients. When I speak about our company culturewith some of my fellow male CEOs of health-services companies, they look at melike I am from a different planet. I talked about inspiring the staff toaccomplish a goal. They talk about having financial numbers and consequences ifpeople don’t produce. I talked about being positive so that negativeneurochemical responses don’t interfere with productivity. They talked abouttelling their employees they have to get the job done or they’re out of here.They don’t understand that if they speak that way to a health care giver, thatperson is going to spend the next couple of hours not able to care for theirclients at the same level.At Lindora we understand that each person is an essential part of Lindora’ssuccess. And that’s why each clinic is called a team. We all know that a team isonly as strong as the weakest member. One day, I’m strong, another day someoneelse is strong, and we all try to help one another.Cynthia explained that the culture in her company is so collaborative andempathic that team members are always checking to see who needs help at themoment. Maybe one day, a particular woman’s child is sick, so the others pitchin to cover her workload and cut her some slack. Another day, someone’s elderlyparent might need extra care, so that is the employee who gets extra support.“Our employees form an informal support network where even without being askedby a direct supervisor, they still volunteer to cover for one another!” she toldme. “Men look at our organization, and they can’t figure that one out!”But Cynthia agrees that compassion fatigue is also a challenge. “The nurturingpersonality type that goes into caregiver professions may have trouble settingboundaries,” she says.Likewise, empathy can be a challenge, as managers don’t want to ask their staffto do something that they themselves wouldn’t want to do. “As opposed to atop-down directive that says, ‘That person is gonna do it, and I don’t care whatthey’re thinking about or what implications that’s going to have on the rest oftheir day.’ ”Cynthia also views her own success in a collaborative way. “I want to win, but Iwant that to be by everybody winning,” she says. “You get joy by winning—and byhelping other people win!”SELF-CONTROL: LIVING SMARTER, LONGERRuben Gur, as others, has found that the PFC, the area of the brain used tocontrol anger and aggression, is larger in females than in males. And researchhas shown that women are better at keeping strong negative emotions in check.Possibly this is because women’s ability to pick up on emotional cues fromothers gives her the heads-up to defuse escalating situations. Also, her moreempathic brain may respond to others’ distress with a wish to calm thesituation. To be aggressive would require dampening the more natural empathicresponse. When she does turn aggressive, she’s more likely to produce a verbalattack rather than attack physically. At the end of 2004, of all the prisonersin the United States, only 7 percent were females, indicating females likelyhave better self-control over their behavior.In a series of fascinating experiments, Adrienne Raine and colleagues have beenlooking at brain function in people with antisocial personality disorder (ASD);these are people who chronically break societal rules. Incidence of ASD is muchhigher in males, as the crime statistics above indicate. When compared to ahealthy group, people with ASD had between 9 percent and 18 percent less volumein their PFCs. Women who had antisocial behavior or tendencies also had lowervolume in this part of the brain.A larger PFC may be the secret to a longer, healthier life. Back in the 1920s,American psychologist Lewis Terman initiated a longitudinal study on a largegroup of 1,548 gifted children. Even though Terman died in 1956, his students atStanford University, and then their students, continued following up on thesesubjects as they got older, all the way up until today. And they’re stillwriting about their findings, which give fascinating insight into such questionsas what life factors increase success, health, and longevity.Two of the current researchers, Howard Friedman and Leslie Martin, published anupdate of results in their recent book, The Longevity Project: SurprisingDiscoveries for Health and Long Life from the Landmark Eight-Decade Study. Whatwas the surprise? It was the conclusion that the secret to living a long lifehad nothing to do with happiness, a lack of stress, or avoiding hard work. Theyfound that the secret was living conscientiously and using forethought,planning, and perseverance in all aspects of one’s life. Conscientiousness wasthe number-one predictor of longevity.Friedman offers a number of reasons why conscientious people stay healthierlonger and outlive their more frivolous age mates. For one thing, they are lesslikely to smoke, drink immoderately, abuse drugs, or engage in risky behaviorlike driving too fast. They are more likely to take their vitamins, wear theirseat belts, and follow their doctors’ orders. Friedman also suggests thatconscientious people are likely to enter into situations and relationships thatare healthier. With regard to relationships, the finding is that being lovedisn’t as important as just having lots of other people in one’s life and caringfor and helping others. It turns out that it is in fact better to give than toreceive.Having a bigger, stronger PFC helps you live longer, because it is involved inconscientiousness, decision making, and impulse control. Protect your PFC andthe quality of your decisions at all costs.A LITTLE WORRY: A BENEFIT THAT KEEPS HER ON HER TOESBecause of their busier brains, women tend to be worrywarts. They worry overwhat they eat, how they look, what others think of them, what’s going to happen,ad infinitum. It makes sense. Their brains keep talking to them, presenting themwith scary scenarios. In our research, we have also seen that an area of thebrain called the anterior cingulate cortex is more active in the female brain.This is the part of the brain that helps you shift attention and recognizeerrors. When it is overactive, people tend to get stuck on negative thoughts ornegative behaviors and see what is wrong rather than what is right.On brain imaging studies, Dr. Mirko Diksic from McGill University found thatserotonin production was 52 percent greater in men than in women. Serotonin isone of the most potent calming neurotransmitters in the brain that is involvedwith mood, sleep, pain, and appetite issues. At Amen Clinics, we have seen lowserotonin levels associated with overactivity on brain SPECT scans in the worryand mood centers of the brain. Given that females tend to have less serotoninthan males, it helps to explain why they have a higher incidence of anxiety,depression, and worry. Researchers have shown that women, in fact, respondbetter to serotonin-boosting medications than men. Much more on this later.Of course, this doesn’t mean that men don’t worry or see problems. But men andwomen tend to worry differently. When women worry, their busy brains andassociative thinking powers kick in, which means one worrisome idea quicklyconnects with others to build momentum that can snowball out of control. A womanis more prone to anxiety so she tends to see negative outcomes in her futurerather than positive ones. Her husband’s worries are more likely to be confined.He is more likely to compartmentalize his problems.A woman’s brain never seems to rest, not even when she’s asleep. For many women,their sleep pattern takes a radical shift after they have their first baby. Awoman knows that now she is responsible for someone else, so the typical femalebrain becomes hyperalert to the responsibility. She must always be concerned forthe safety of her infant and herself. This keeps her much more attuned to what’sgoing on around her, taking in information and assessing what it means for thesurvival of herself and her children.But a woman need not simply suffer from worry. She can use it to benefit herselfand others. Her awareness of problems and her desire to keep her family safe canmake her more health conscious. If she channels her worry into action, she’s theone who directs the health of her loved ones and makes the home safe. Her worryalso gets her to seek help when it’s needed. Men are often overly optimistic andmay not see a problem that’s right in front of them. That’s one of the reasonsthat men don’t ask for directions. They don’t know they’re lost! It’s not just aproblem when driving. It’s a problem in relationships too. Men often simplydon’t realize there is trouble. Maybe that’s why women are more likely to filefor divorce or leave a relationship before men.To admit you’re lost, or in a troubled relationship, is to admit a failure, andmany men have trouble doing it. To admit you’re lost means having to ask forhelp, and that’s something women are good at doing, for themselves and thosethey care about.Lower serotonin levels are not all bad. Too much serotonin can be associatedwith lower motivation and the “don’t worry, be happy” syndrome. I haveprescribed medications that boost serotonin (selective serotonin reuptakeinhibitors, or SSRIs) since 1988, when Prozac was first released onto the U.S.market. One of the first side effects I noticed early on in some people,especially men, was a significant decrease in motivation and the ability to getthings done. One business owner told me he felt less anxious, but he was notgetting his paperwork done, and that was going to cause real trouble for him atwork. Also, on SPECT scans we see that SSRIs lower PFC function and have thepotential to disinhibit behavior, sometimes unleashing impulsive sexual oraggressive behaviors.THE STRENGTHS AND CHALLENGES OF THE FEMALE BRAINStrengthsLongevityTakes physical and mental health more seriouslyAdmits problems fasterSeeks help and community support fasterWorries more about her healthExhibits lower incidence of too-little anxiety, a condition that can get herinto troubleIs more likely to sign up for health programsIs more compliant in following brain-healthy recommendations, as demonstrated inthe Amen Clinics outcome studyIs less likely to be in the “don’t worry, be happy” group that dies earlyEngages in fewer high-risk behaviors, thereby resulting in a healthier brainHas stronger PFC, associated with greater judgment, empathy, and self-controlExhibits lower incidence of ADD, autism, substance abuse, antisocial behavior,and going to prisonChallengesLower serotonin levelsWorries moreHas trouble turning off her brainIs always thinking, thinking, thinkingRepeats the same issue again and againFocuses too much on problems, even when they are not thereStruggles more with sleep and feels pain more acutelyExhibits higher incidence of anxiety, depression, body image issues, eatingdisorders, physical stress symptoms, and perfectionismMen tend to have less anxiety and thus they tend to get themselves into moretrouble. In my lectures I often talk about the need for “enough” anxiety. Forexample, if someone gets the thought “I think I’ll go rob the grocery store,”the very next thought should be “That’s a very bad idea; you’ll spend the nexttwenty years in jail.” Some anxiety keeps you out of trouble. Too much, ofcourse, can make you sick.HOUR 2 EXERCISE—RECRUIT YOUR TEAM AND MAKE YOUR WORRIES WORK FOR YOU1. RECRUIT YOUR TEAMCollaboration is a significant advantage of the female brain. To truly optimizeyour brain, you need a group of like-minded women to help. In the first half ofthis hour, your task is to find and convince two other women to do this programwith you. Have them get a copy of the book or get it for them. If you do theseexercises with a small group of like-minded women, you will dramatically improveyour own success at boosting the power of your female brain. In medical schoolwe often had the saying of “See one, do one, teach one.” It is in the teachingwhere you always learn the most.2. MAKE YOUR WORRIES WORK FOR YOUStudies show that journaling is a powerful tool to help get worries undercontrol and out of your head. One of the most important exercises I give mypatients is to have them journal to manage their worries. It is a really simple,powerful exercise.Whenever you get a worry (a negative thought that won’t go away), write it down.The act of writing helps to crystallize it and get it out of your head. Theworry is now on the paper, a tablet, computer, or phone. Once the worry iswritten, evaluate it for its accuracy. Is it true or realistic? If not, smileand let it stay on the paper to get it out of your head. If the worry has merit,write down three or four things you can do about the worry, and equallyimportant, write down what you cannot do about the worry.For example, Jeanne had a daughter, Nina, with developmental delays and manymedical problems. Writing down her worries, and working through them, was veryhelpful for her.I worry Nina will not develop normally, that she will get sick and die, and thatI will not be a good enough mother.What can I do about these worries?Get Nina the proper medical care.Be on the lookout online for new resources to help her. Nurture her the best wayI can.Enlist my support group (husband, family, and church members to help).What can’t I do about it?I cannot fix her.I cannot will her to be well.I can’t make myself sick, as I will be no good for Nina."},{"pageContent":"3ADOPT AMEN CLINICS’ METHOD FOR OPTIMIZING THE FEMALE BRAIN[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_L02_r1.jpg]KNOW YOUR BRAIN, IMPORTANTNUMBERS, AND THE FOUR CIRCLES FORULTIMATE SUCCESS[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_L03_r1.jpg]Having a very clear, Four Circles plan to boost your brain is the third step tounleashing the power of the female brain.[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_L03_r1.jpg]The truth will set you free. But first, it will piss you off.—GLORIA STEINEMAnnette had called our clinics because her twenty-three-year-old daughter Katiehad gotten a dismal score on the Law School Admission Test (LSAT). Katie haddreamed of being a lawyer like her older sister, but she did not do well onexams owing to the intense anxiety she felt every time she took a test. Katiefelt anxious at other times as well. Whenever Katie faced a significantchallenge, such as a test or a job interview, she predicted failure. Her worryoften caused her to spin out of control when she studied, which kept her fromabsorbing information that she was intellectually able to master. She frequentlyfelt tense and struggled with numerous physical stress symptoms, includingheadaches, back pain, and stomach problems.All of these symptoms worried Annette, who learned about our clinics from afriend whose daughter had been nearly thrown off the basketball team for temperoutbursts. Through our help, that young woman was able to control her temper andlead her team to the state championship.Annette’s mother hoped that we could help Katie too, although she had alreadytaken her to three psychiatrists, a couple of psychologists, and the schoolcounselor. None of these professionals had been able to make significant inroadsinto Katie’s anxiety, and Katie was feeling hopeless about her future. Using avery clear method, we were able to boost Katie’s brain and improve every aspectof her life. She ultimately did much better on the LSAT and entered law school.This is the same approach you can use to boost your brain, even if you neversuffer from anxiety or other mental health challenge. It is Amen Clinics’approach to change your brain and your life.To truly unleash the power of your female brain, you need to make sure yourbrain is in the best shape possible.AMEN CLINICS’ METHODOur largest referral network for Amen Clinics is from our own patients and theirfamilies. Over the last twenty-two years at Amen Clinics, we have seen tens ofthousands of patients from all fifty states and ninety countries. The reasonpeople come from all over the world for help is that our process is verydifferent from our colleagues’ in mental health. We believe it is essential tothoroughly evaluate the brain before trying to change it. “How do you knowunless you look?” is a mantra we’ve been repeating for over two decades.In a large six-month outcome study that we performed on our patients at AmenClinics, 83 percent reported high levels of improvement in their quality of lifeand similarly high levels of improvements in depression and anxiety scores. Thenumbers were even better for our patients who were highly compliant with what weasked them to do.Our goal in running the clinics is to study what we do to continually improveour ability to help the people we serve. Certainly not everyone who comes to oneof our clinics gets better. There is still so much to learn, but compared to thepublished outcome studies in mental health, our success rates are exciting.The knowledge we have obtained to help our patients can also help you be yourbest, whether you or a loved one suffer with a mental health issue, traumaticbrain injury, PTSD, or you simply want to optimize the health of your brain.Unleashing the full power of your female brain starts by following our veryclear method for success: • Developing an in-depth understanding of where you are, using the FourCircles Approach, which assesses your biological, psychological, social, andspiritual health • Gathering current information on how your brain functions, throughbrain SPECT imaging or computerized tests and questionnaires • Knowing your important health numbers, including standard lab tests tomake sure your body is functioning properly (your brain and body areinterconnected) • Targeting help specifically to your vulnerable areas • Engaging in regular brain-healthy habits[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_009_r1.jpg]So let’s break down this method and, as an instructive example, apply it toKatie’s life. Apply it to yours as well.AMEN CLINICS’ FOUR CIRCLES APPROACH:A BIO/ PSYCHO/ SOCIAL/ SPIRITUAL ASSESSMENTWhen I was a first-year medical student at Oral Roberts University in Tulsa,Oklahoma, our dean, Dr. Sid Garrett, gave us one of our first lectures on how tohelp people of any age for any problem. That lecture has stayed with me for thelast thirty-five years. Dr. Garrett told us, “Always think of people as wholebeings, never just as their symptoms.” He insisted that whenever we evaluatedanyone, we should take into consideration the four circles: • Biology: how the physical body functions • Psychology: developmental issues and thought patterns • Social connections: social support and current life situation • Spiritual health: what life meansAt Amen Clinics we use these four circles to take a balanced, comprehensiveapproach to healing. These principles have impacted my own life and career, andonce you really understand them, they can help you get and stay powerful in themost balanced way possible.UNDERSTANDING YOUR VULNERABILITIES[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_010_r1.jpg]BIOLOGYYour biology comprises the first circle of health, illness, and optimization:the physical aspects of your brain and body and how they function together. Foryour biology to operate at peak efficiency, its machinery (cells, connections,chemicals, energy, blood flow, and waste processing) needs to work right. Thebrain is like a supercomputer, with both hardware and software. Think of yourbiology as your hardware. Within the biology circle are factors such as yourgenetics, overall physical health, nutrition, exercise, sleep, and hormones, aswell as environmental issues, such as toxins. When the brain’s biology ishealthy, all of these factors work together in a positive way to maximize yoursuccess. When trauma, toxins, illness, or deficiencies affect your biology, youfeel disrupted or out of sync.For example, when you don’t get enough sleep, you have overall decreased bloodflow to your brain, which disrupts thinking, memory, and concentration.Likewise, a brain injury hurts the machinery of the brain, causing you tostruggle with depression, memory issues, and temper problems. When you eat ahigh-sugar or simple-carbohydrate diet, your blood sugar often becomesdysregulated, causing you to feel sluggish and foggy-headed.KATIE’S BIOLOGYKatie’s biology played a significant role in her anxiety and her resulting poorperformance on tests. She had a family history of panic disorder, which is ahighly heritable problem and is associated with a tendency toward anxiety.Katie’s mother and grandfather struggled with anxiety, and she had an aunt whosuffered from panic disorder with agoraphobia and didn’t leave her house forfifteen years.Katie’s anxiety was made worse by other biological factors. Katie rarely sleptmore than six hours at night, which has been shown in many studies to affectlearning and mood. In addition, Katie’s diet, like that of manytwenty-three-year-olds, consisted of a lot of junk food and caffeinated drinksas she tried to stay alert. She rarely exercised, drank more alcohol than sheadmitted to her mother, and struggled with intestinal problems.At age five, Katie’s mother had gotten into an accident in which she rolled thecar five times. Katie had been in the car and had almost certainly received abrain injury that affected her development. Significantly, her high-performingsister had not been in the accident.I explained to Katie and her mother that an essential part of being her best wasto bring these biological factors into balance: healing past injuries andprotecting herself from future injuries; getting good sleep; avoiding toxins,such as drugs or excessive alcohol; eating a healthy, balanced diet; gettingplenty of exercise; and taking fish oil, a multiple vitamin, and any targetedsupplements or medications that may be needed. Without biological interventions,I told them, Katie would never perform at her best. Of course, with onlybiological interventions, especially if all I did for Katie was medicate heranxiety, her improvement would not be nearly as robust as if she followedthrough in all four circles.PSYCHOLOGYPsychological factors fall into the second circle of health, illness, andoptimization. This circle includes how we think and talk to ourselves, therunning dialogue that goes on in our minds, as well as our self-concept, bodyimage, past traumas, overall upbringing, and significant developmental events.Being raised in a reasonably happy home, getting positive messages growing up,and feeling comfortable with our abilities and our bodies all contribute topsychological health. When we struggle in any of these areas, we are less likelyto be successful. If we perceive ourselves as unattractive or less able than ourpeers, trouble starts to brew. If our thinking patterns are excessivelynegative, harsh, or critical, that will have a negative impact on our moods,anxiety levels, and ultimately on our ability to function successfully.Developmental issues, such as being adopted or experiencing a significant lossor trauma as a child, are also significant. Children often believe that they arethe center of the universe and that if something bad happens, such as if amother gets cancer, a child may think it is her fault and spend the rest of herlife racked with guilt. Past successes and failures are a part of this circle,as are hope and a sense of worth and personal power or control.Generational histories can also be very important in the psyche of a developingbrain. Children of immigrants or Holocaust survivors often get very differentpsychological messages from those of children whose families have beenestablished for generations. For example, many Holocaust survivors will neverspeak to their children or grandchildren about what happened. Nonetheless, themessages of the unspeakable horrors may be transmitted nonverbally to thesubsequent generations, and the younger generations can end up with anxiety andPTSD issues without ever hearing the actual stories. The trauma messages can beconveyed unconsciously through looks and gestures.KATIE’S PSYCHOLOGYKatie had an undisciplined mind. Her negative thoughts about impending failurecontrolled her mood and frightened her on a regular basis. It was as if she hada roving band of thugs in her head, taunting her by predicting the worstoutcomes for her life.Katie had an infestation of ANTs going on between her ears. In addition, she hada negative self-concept about learning, because school had been hard for her.Because she was unaware of the anxiety issue and potential head trauma issue,Katie thought that she was a lazy person who was just not very smart, eventhough she tried harder than any of her siblings. Because her parents didn’tunderstand the situation, they assumed Katie wasn’t making much of an effort.They often told her to try harder, which, of course, didn’t help.In fact, the more pressure Katie felt, the worse she performed. The competitionwith her older sister was painful and she always believed she could never liveup to her sibling’s success.As for all of us, understanding her psychological issues and learning not tobelieve every stupid thought she had was an essential part of Katie’s road torecovery, and a key aspect of the treatment plan I gave her.SOCIAL CONNECTIONSSocial connections comprise the third circle of health, illness, andoptimization and emphasize the current relationships and events in our lives.When we are in good relationships, experience good health, have a job we love,school we care about, and enough money, our brain tends to do much better thanwhen any of these areas stress or trouble us. Stress negatively impacts brainfunction, and dealing with difficult events makes us more vulnerable to illness.Depression is often triggered by current stressful life events, such as maritalproblems, family dysfunction, financial difficulties, health problems, work- orschool-related struggles, or losses. Plus, the health and habits of the peopleyou spend time with have a dramatic impact on your own health and habits.KATIE’S SOCIAL CONNECTIONSKatie felt constant stress about the LSAT and getting into law school. Inaddition, she was fighting with her boyfriend, who she felt didn’t understandher. Her parents tried to soothe her, but it never seemed to take. In fact, themore they tried to soothe her, the more anxious and frantic Katie became.Sometimes it seemed to Katie that everything stressed her: her family, herboyfriend, the LSAT, and the prospect of law school. Katie was working as anadministrative assistant to save money for school, but she felt stressed by thatjob too, which often required mandatory overtime and cut into Katie’s sociallife and study time in unpredictable ways. Katie worried about getting fired andnot being able to get another job. “How can I, if my boss won’t recommend me?”she asked me. Katie had a hard time distinguishing between her worst fears (Iwill get fired and my boss might not give me a recommendation) and reality(Sometimes my boss is annoyed with me, but mainly she appreciates what I do forher and will not fire me or give me a bad reference).Typical for an anxious person, Katie’s constant worries seemed impossible toresolve. After talking to Katie for hours, her parents, boyfriend, orgirlfriends might make small progress, but usually within an hour or two afterthe conversation, Katie would go right back to feeling anxious.Optimizing Katie’s present life, including helping her manage stress andeffectively deal with her relationships, was an essential part of her treatmentplan. Since decreasing the daily stress in your life also improves brainfunction, I told Katie that regular stress-management techniques were crucialfor her overall brain health and for unleashing the power of her female brain.SPIRITUAL HEALTHBeyond the biological, psychological, and social aspects our lives, we are alsospiritual beings. So to fully heal and recover, we must recognize that we aremore than just our bodies, minds, and social connections, and we must askourselves deep spiritual questions, such as the following:What does my life mean?What is my purpose?Why am I here?What are my values?Do I believe in God or a Higher Power?How does that manifest in my life?What is my connection to past generations, future generations, and the planet?Having a sense of purpose, as well as connections to past and futuregenerations, allows us to reach beyond ourselves to affirm that our livesmatter. Without a spiritual connection, many people experience an overridingsense of despair. Morality, values, and a spiritual connection to others and theuniverse are critical for many people to feel a sense of wholeness andconnection, and a reason to get up in the morning and to take good care ofthemselves.KATIE’S SPIRITUAL HEALTHKatie had never really asked herself why she was here or why her life mattered.She hadn’t even thought about what her life might be like five, ten, or fiftyyears down the road. As for many young adults, the present moment was whatmattered to Katie, not the future. Getting her to think beyond the moment andget in touch with her sense of purpose and meaning was crucial to her unleashingthe power of her female brain, and it is crucial for you too.GET YOUR BRAIN ASSESSEDYou can do a great job assessing your four circles but still not fully optimizeyour brain. You also need to understand how your brain functions. At AmenClinics, we have three ways to evaluate brain function: 1. Brain SPECT imaging 2. Questionnaires 3. Online assessmentsBRAIN SPECT IMAGINGAs mentioned earlier, we do a study called brain SPECT imaging, which looks atblood flow and activity patterns. SPECT gives a direct look at how the brainworks. SPECT scans are actually easy to understand because we basically look forthree things: • Areas of the brain that work well (normal activity) • Areas of the brain that work too hard (high activity) • Areas of the brain that do not work hard enough (low activity)A healthy SPECT scan shows full, even, symmetrical activity, with the highestactivity in the cerebellum, which is located in the back, bottom part of thebrain. In demonstrating SPECT scans at lectures, I generally show them in twoviews: an outside surface scan view, that helps us see low areas of activity,and an active scan view, which shows us areas of the brain that are working toohard. As I mentioned, women tend to have much busier brains than men.SPECT scans help us see vulnerable areas that need to be optimized, even yearsbefore trouble may actually show itself. It is now thought that functionalimaging studies like SPECT show evidence of Alzheimer’s disease, a form ofdementia, years before people have any symptoms. It is not just by helping usrecognize dementia and memory problems that SPECT can help. In a scientificstudy we published last year, getting a SPECT scan changed either the diagnosisor treatment plan in nearly eight out of ten patients. Having a scan helps ussee more clearly what is happening in the brain that may be the cause ofsomeone’s emotional and cognitive struggles, such as undiagnosed brain injuries(22 percent) or toxic exposure (22 percent).SPECT scans also help us see someone’s strengths and vulnerabilities. Forexample, if they have a tendency toward impulse control problems, we are morelikely to see low activity in the PFC, located in the front part of the brain.If they tend to be rigid and inflexible, we often see increased activity in anarea of the frontal part of the brain called the anterior cingulate gyrus.Researchers from Japan found that brain blood flow in certain areas of the brainwas positively correlated with both intelligence and creativity. Protecting thebrain’s blood flow is critical to having a healthy mind.Besides helping us make more complete diagnoses, SPECT helps lead us to directtreatment in the context of a bio/ psycho/ social/ spiritual assessment. Withouta scan or another measure of brain function, it is like throwing darts in thedark at someone’s brain. If you visit the Amen Clinics website(www.amenclinics.com [http://www.amenclinics.com]), you can see hundreds ofbrain SPECT scans and read over twenty-six hundred scientific abstracts on SPECTfor a wide variety of behavioral, mood, learning, and mental health issues.NINE WAYS SPECT WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING YOU DO1. You Will Develop Brain Envy—Upon seeing her scan, forty-five-year-old Betsyknew she had to get healthy. She had problems with drinking and drug abuse afterbeing in an emotionally traumatic relationship. After seeing her scan, however,she developed brain envy and completely changed her habits. A year later herbrain looked much better.[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_011_r1.jpg]2. You Will Be Careful with Many Psychotropic Medications—I am a classicallytrained psychiatrist and have used medications to help my patients for manyyears. However, when I started ordering scans, I saw that some medicationclasses like benzodiazepines (antianxiety medications) and opiate painkillersmade the brain look toxic, like our alcoholics’ brains. That was when I startedlooking for natural ways to heal the brain.[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_012_r1.jpg]3. You Won’t Let Your Kids Play Tackle Football or Hit Soccer Balls with TheirHeads—The brain is soft and the skull is hard with many sharp bony ridges. Braininjuries matter and may ruin people’s lives.[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_013_r1.jpg]4. You Will Take Sleep Apnea More Seriously—On a SPECT scan, sleep apnea, acondition in which a person snores loudly, stops breathing at night, and isoften chronically tired during the day, makes the brain appear very low inactivity. Sleep apnea doubles a person’s risk for getting Alzheimer’s. If youhave any symptoms, make sure to have your physician order a sleep study.[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_014_r1.jpg]5. You Will Take Your Weight More Seriously—There are eighteen studies now thatreport that as your weight goes up, the actual physical size and function ofyour brain go down. That should just scare the fat off all of us. Below is thescan of one of my patients with morbid obesity.[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_015_r1.jpg]6. You Will See That There Is Not a One-Size-Fits-All Treatment for Depressionand Other Illnesses—Based on our imaging work, we have discovered that illnesseslike ADD, anxiety, depression, and addictions are not single or simple illnessin the brain; they all have multiple types and thus multiple treatments.[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_016_r1.jpg]7. You Will Start Thinking About the Early Detection and Prevention ofAlzheimer’s Disease—SPECT scans show trouble years before people have anysymptoms of memory problems. Scans alert you when a problem may be brewing inthe brain.[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_017_r1.jpg]8. You Will Work Harder Not to Call People Bad Names—When people act badly, itis easy to just call them negative or derogatory names. But once you look attheir scans and realize they might have a damaged or toxic scan, it gives youmore understanding and empathy.[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_018_r1.jpg]9. You Will Think About the Brain if You Are Having Relationship Problems—I havelooked at the scans of over a thousand couples who are having seriousrelationship problems. Often, one or both of the partners has a brain challengethat no one is aware of. Helping to heal and optimize the brain helps people getalong better with others.[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_019_r1.jpg]Katie’s SPECT Scans[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_020_r1.jpg]Katie’s scans showed several important findings, including a mild brain injurypattern to the left side of her brain, which likely resulted from the caraccident. She also showed high activity in the anxiety and worry centers of herbrain, which was consistent with the anxiety issues she had reported. Thesefindings made even clearer the need to heal the past brain injury and treat heranxiety.AMEN SOLUTION BRAIN TYPE QUESTIONNAIREUnfortunately, not everyone is able to get a scan, either because of cost or alack of availability in your area. My books are translated into thirtylanguages, so if you read one in China or Brazil, odds are you’re not going tocome to one of our Amen Clinics to get a scan and evaluation. So, based onthousands of scans, I developed a series of questionnaires to help peoplepredict what their scans might look like if they could get one. Thequestionnaires are not as individually precise as the scans, especially whenthere are complex issues involved, but many people find them very helpful, andthey are used by thousands of mental health professionals around the world.You can take our Amen Solution Brain Type Questionnaire on our web coachingsite, the Amen Solution @ Home (www.amensolution.com[http://www.amensolution.com]). The questionnaire will help you evaluate yourbrain’s function in the following areas: • Flexible thinking • Focus/impulse control • Mood • Stress and anxiety • Memory • Sleep • Cravings • Brain-healthy habitsBased on your answers, we give targeted recommendations, including science-basednatural ways to boost the brain. Of course, it is important to talk to yourhealth care provider about any recommendations.24/7 BRAIN GYM ASSESSMENTAlso, on the Amen Solution @ Home site, we have a 24/7 Brain Gym, where you cantest and work out your brain at any time. It starts with a sophisticatedthirty-minute computerized assessment to determine the health of your brain. Itmeasures mood, attention span, impulse control, memory, reaction time, and more.Based on your score, the program will give you exercises tailored to enhanceyour specific brain. Spending ten minutes a day in the 24/7 Brain Gym is a greatway to unleash the power of your female brain by boosting your brain power!KATIE’S QUESTIONNAIRE AND 24/7 BRAIN GYM RESULTSKatie’s questionnaire showed likely problems with stress, anxiety, andinflexible thinking. The results from her brain assessment also showed evidenceof anxiety and stress and were consistent with her scan. The online program gaveher very specific exercises to calm her anxiety and begin to help her correctthe negative thinking patterns. For example, it recommended one of my favoritegames, “E-Catch the Feeling.” In this brain exercise, bubbles are shot in theair with “positive” words, such as joy, happiness, success, and relaxation, and“negative” words, such as despair, anger, frustration, and sadness. The task isto click on the positive words and ignore the negative ones. This game has beenfound to help focus people’s thoughts in a more positive direction. Theassessment also recommended another game, “MyCalmBeat,” which taught Katie tobreathe in a way to optimize the feeling of relaxation and well-being.I knew that the Four Circles Approach, brain assessments, and other tools couldhelp Katie get back on track.KNOW YOUR IMPORTANT NUMBERSAnother very important part of optimizing your brain is to know your importanthealth numbers. I often say you cannot change what you do not measure. Here isthe list of the key numbers you should know about yourself: 1. Body mass index (BMI) 2. Waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) 3. Average hours slept each night and an assessment of whether you havesleep apnea 4. Blood pressure1. Body Mass Index—The BMI is a measure of your weight compared to your height.A normal BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9. Overweight is between 25 and 30. Obese isgreater than 30. You can find a simple BMI calculator on the web.Knowing your BMI is important because being overweight or obese has beenassociated with less brain tissue and lower brain activity. Obesity doubles therisk for Alzheimer’s disease and depression. There are probably severalmechanisms that create this result, including the fact that fat cells produceinflammatory chemicals and store toxic materials in the body. I want you to knowyour BMI, because it stops you from lying to yourself about your weight.2. Waist-to-Height Ratio—Another way to measure the health of your weight is byusing the WHtR. Some researchers believe this number is even more accurate thanBMI. The WHtR is calculated by dividing waist size by height. For an example, afemale with a 32-inch waist who is 5 feet 10 inches (70 inches) would divide 32by 70 to get a WHtR of 45.7 percent. To be healthy your waist size in inchesshould be less than half your height. So, if you are 66 inches tall, your waistshould not be more than 33 inches. If you are 72 inches tall, your waist shouldnot be more than 36 inches.The WHtR is thought to give a more accurate assessment of health since the mostdangerous place to carry weight is in the abdomen. Fat in the abdomen, which isassociated with a larger waist, is metabolically active and produces varioushormones that can cause harmful effects, such as diabetes, elevated bloodpressure, and high cholesterol and triglyceride levels.Note: You have to actually measure your waist size with a tape measure! Going byyour pants size does not count, as many clothing manufacturers actually maketheir sizes larger than they state on the label so as not to offend theircustomers. In my experience, 90 percent of people will underestimate their waistcircumference. Don’t lie to yourself.3. The Number of Hours You Sleep Each Night—One of the fastest ways to hurt yourbrain is to get fewer than seven or eight hours of sleep at night. People whotypically get six hours or fewer of sleep have lower overall blood flow to thebrain, which hurts its function. Researchers from the Walter Reed Army Instituteof Research and the University of Pennsylvania found that chronically gettingfewer than eight hours of sleep was associated with cognitive decline. Strive toget at least seven or eight hours of sleep a night. There are hypnosis audios onthe Amen Solution @ Home.Chronic insomnia triples your risk of death from all causes.4. Blood Pressure—To keep your brain healthy, it is critical to know your bloodpressure. High blood pressure is associated with lower overall brain function,which means more bad decisions. Here are the numbers you should know:Optimal blood pressure: below 120/80Prehypertension: 120/80–139/89Hypertension: 140 (or above) / 90 (or above)Check your blood pressure or have your doctor check it on a regular basis. Ifyour blood pressure is high, make sure to take it seriously. Some behaviors thatcan help lower your blood pressure include losing weight, daily exercise, fishoil supplements, and if needed, medication.GET YOUR WEIGHT UNDER CONTROL:FEED YOUR BRAIN RIGHTYou’ll find a detailed explanation of the optimal way to feed your female brainto attain and maintain your optimal weight in chapter 5[Amen_9780307888969_epub_c05_r1.htm]. You can also find more suggestions for abrain-healthy diet on our website (www.amensolution.com[http://www.amensolution.com]), as well as loads of delicious brain-healthyrecipes.KATIE’S IMPORTANT NUMBERSKatie’s weight was normal and her blood pressure was fine, but her sleep habitswere not good. Her anxiety kept her from sleeping, and the lack of sleep madeher more anxious. It was a vicious cycle that needed to be stopped.GET KEY LABORATORY TESTSLaboratory tests are the next set of important numbers to know. Here are the keylab test numbers you need to know: 1. Complete blood count 2. General metabolic panel with fasting blood sugar and lipid panel 3. HgA1C 4. Vitamin D 5. Thyroid panel 6. C-reactive protein 7. Homocysteine 8. Ferritin 9. Free and total serum testosterone 10. Cortisol and sulfated DHEA (DHEA-S) 11. Estrogen and progesteroneThese tests can be ordered by your health care professional, or you can orderthem for yourself on websites such as SaveOnLabs.com [http://SaveOnLabs.com].1. Complete Blood Count (blood test)—This test checks the health of your blood,including red and white blood cells. People with low blood count can feelanxious and tired, and they can have significant memory problems.2. General Metabolic Panel with Fasting Blood Sugar and Lipid Panel (bloodtest)—This test checks the health of your liver, kidneys, fasting blood sugar,cholesterol, and triglycerides. Fasting blood sugar is especially important.Normal is between 70 and 90 mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter); prediabetes isbetween 91 and 125 mg/dL; and diabetes is 126 mg/dL or higher. According to alarge study from Kaiser Permanente, for every point above 85, patients had anadditional 6 percent increased risk of developing diabetes in the next ten years(87 = 12 percent increased risk, 88 = 18 percent increased risk, etc.). Above 90indicates that vascular damage has already occurred and a patient is at risk forhaving damage to the kidneys and eyes.Why is high fasting blood sugar a problem? High blood sugar causes vascularproblems throughout your whole body, including your brain. Over time, it causesblood vessels to become brittle and vulnerable to breakage. It leads not only todiabetes but also to heart disease, strokes, visual impairment, impaired woundhealing, wrinkled skin, and cognitive problems. Diabetes doubles the risk forAlzheimer’s disease.Cholesterol and triglycerides are also important. Sixty percent of the solidweight of the brain is fat. High cholesterol is obviously bad for the brain, buthaving it too low is also bad, as some cholesterol is essential to make sexhormones and help the brain function properly. According to the American HeartAssociation, optimal levels are as follows: • Total cholesterol (135–200 mg/dL, below 135 has been associated withdepression) • High-density lipoprotein (HDL) (>= 60 mg/dL) • Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (<100 mg/dL) • Triglycerides (<100 mg/Dl)If your lipids are off, make sure to get your diet under control, as well astaking fish oil and exercising regularly. Of course you should see yourphysician. Also, knowing the particle size of LDL cholesterol is important.Large particles are less toxic than smaller particles.3. HgA1C (blood test)—This test shows your average blood sugar levels over thepast two to three months and is used to diagnose diabetes and prediabetes.Normal results for a nondiabetic person are in the 4–5.6 percent range.Prediabetes is indicated by levels in the 5.7–6.4 percent range. Higher numbersmay indicate diabetes.4. Vitamin D (blood test)—Low levels of vitamin D have been associated withobesity, depression, cognitive impairment, heart disease, reduced immunity,cancer, psychosis, and all causes of mortality. Check your 25-hydroxy vitamin Dlevel, and if it is low, try to get more sunshine in a safe way and/or take avitamin D3 supplement. A healthy vitamin D level is between 30 and 100 ng/dL(nanograms per deciliter). Optimal is between 50 and 100 ng/dL. Personally, Inever wanted to be in the bottom of any class I was ever in. Two-thirds of thepopulation are low in vitamin D; this is the same percentage of U.S. residentswho are overweight or obese. According to one study, when vitamin D is low thehormone leptin that tells us to stop eating is not effective. One of the reasonsfor the dramatic rise in vitamin D deficiency is that people are wearing moresunscreen and spending more time inside working or in front of the television orcomputer.5. Thyroid Panel (blood test)—Abnormal thyroid hormone levels are a common causeof anxiety, depression, forgetfulness, confusion, and lethargy. Having lowthyroid levels decreases overall brain activity, which can impair your thinking,judgment, and self-control and make it very hard for you to feel good. Lowthyroid functioning can make it nearly impossible to manage weight effectively.To know your thyroid levels, you need to know these figures: • thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) • Free T3 • Free T4 • Thyroid antibodies (thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies)There is no one perfect way, no one symptom or test result, that will properlydiagnose low thyroid function or hypothyroidism. The key is to look at yoursymptoms and your blood tests, and then decide. Symptoms of low thyroid includefatigue; depression; mental fog; dry skin; hair loss, especially the outer thirdof your eyebrows; feeling cold when others feel normal; constipation; hoarsevoice; and weight gain. Most doctors do not check thyroid antibodies unless theTSH is high. This is a big mistake. Many people have autoimmunity against theirthyroid, which makes it function poorly, even while they still have a “normal”TSH. That’s why I think measuring the antibodies should also be part of routinescreening.6. C-Reactive Protein (blood test)—This is a measure of inflammation. Elevatedinflammation is associated with a number of diseases and conditions that areassociated with mood problems, aging, and cognitive impairment. Fat cellsproduce chemicals that increase inflammation. A healthy range is between 0.0 and1.0 mg/dL. This is a very good test for inflammation. It measures the generallevel of inflammation although it does not tell you what has caused thiscondition.The most common reason for an elevated C-reactive protein is metabolic syndromeor insulin resistance. The second most common is some sort of reaction to food,either a true allergy, a food sensitivity, or an autoimmune reaction such asoccurs with gluten. High levels of C-reactive protein can also indicate hiddeninfections. You’ll learn more about how to detect and overcome food reactions inchapter 5 [Amen_9780307888969_epub_c05_r1.htm].7. Homocysteine (blood test)—Elevated homocysteine levels (>10 mmol/L, ormicromoles per liter) in the blood have been associated with damage to thelining of arteries and atherosclerosis (hardening and narrowing of the arteries)as well as an increased risk of heart attacks, strokes, blood clot formation,and possibly Alzheimer’s disease. This is a sensitive marker for B vitamindeficiency, including folic acid deficiency. Replacing these vitamins oftenhelps return the homocysteine level to normal.8. Ferritin (blood test)—This is a measure of iron stores, a number thatincreases with inflammation and insulin resistance. Levels between 15 and 200ng/mL for females are ideal. Women tend to have lower iron stores than men,owing to blood loss from years of menstruation, since blood cells contain iron.Some theorize that this is one of the reasons that women live longer than men.However, you don’t want ferritin levels that are too low, as this is associatedwith anemia, restless legs, ADD, and low motivation and energy. Higher ironstores have been associated with stiffer blood vessels and vascular disease.Some research suggests that donating blood to lower high ferritin levels mayenhance blood vessel flexibility and help decrease the risk of heart disease.Plus, whenever you give blood you are being altruistic, which is also good foryour mind and body.9. Free and Total Serum Testosterone (blood test)—For both men and women, lowlevels of testosterone have been associated with low energy, cardiovasculardisease, obesity, low libido, depression, and Alzheimer’s disease. Normal levelsfor adult females are as follows: • Total testosterone in females (30–95 ng/dL) • Free testosterone in females (0.4–1.9 ng/dL)10. Cortisol (saliva test) and Sulfated DHEA-S (blood test)—These adrenal glandhormones are related to stress, and DHEA is a precursor to other hormones. Inthe blood I measure cortisol (11–14 µg /dL is optimal) and DHEA-S. Most normallab values are between 5 and 25, but you’re not striving for normal here; youwant optimal numbers. If I want to know more about cortisol, I will measurecortisol four times a day (morning, noon, dinner, and bedtime) using saliva.11. Estrogen and Progesterone—These are measured depending on the circumstancesin blood or saliva. Premenopause, they are usually measured on day 21 of thecycle; after menopause, they can be measured anytime. Estrogen is responsiblefor vaginal lubrication, helps with libido, aids in memory, and so much more.Progesterone calms emotions, creates a restful sleep, and acts as a diuretic.There is much more on hormones in the next chapter.BOOSTING YOUR BRAINIf your results on any of these tests are less than optimal, follow thesuggestions in this book, and also see your health care provider about specificsolutions.KNOW YOUR TWELVE MODIFIABLE HEALTH-RISK FACTORSKnow how many of the twelve most important modifiable health risk factors youhave, then work to decrease them. Here is a list of these factors compiled byresearchers at the Harvard School of Public Health. Circle the ones that applyto you. 1. Smoking 2. High blood pressure 3. Being overweight or obese 4. Physical inactivity 5. High fasting blood glucose 6. High LDL cholesterol 7. Alcohol abuse (accidents, injuries, violence, cirrhosis, liverdisease, cancer, stroke, heart disease, hypertension) 8. Low omega-3 fatty acids 9. High dietary saturated fat intake10. Low polyunsaturated fat intake11. High dietary salt12. Low intake of fruits and vegetablesKATIE’S LABORATORY TESTSKatie’s numbers showed that her diet and lifestyle choices were almost certainlycontributing to her brain problems. Although her weight was in the healthyrange, she often struggled with getting eight hours of sleep. She had a lowvitamin D level, and she had a low intake of fruits and vegetables. Because ofher high consumption of fast foods, she had a high intake of dietary salt andsaturated fats, along with few omega-3 fatty acids in her diet. Plus, she wassedentary.I knew that cleaning up Katie’s diet and improving her sleep would ease heranxiety and improve her mood. Altering these elements of her biology would go along way toward boosting Katie’s brain and unleashing its power.TARGETED HELP FOR YOUR VULNERABLE AREASOnce you have completed the Four Circles Approach, analyzed the health of yourbrain systems, noted your important numbers, and done the key laboratory tests,you are ready to get healthier than ever in your life by developing apersonalized, targeted plan that addresses your biology, psychology, socialconnections, and spiritual health. When you look at people through the lens ofbrain imaging, you realize that a one-size-fits-all approach to treatment makesno sense. The program needs to be tailored or personalized to your specificbrain and body.TARGETED HELP FOR KATIEThe Amen Clinics Method of integrated care was extremely helpful to Katie. Basedon what we found from Katie’s assessments, brain scans, questionnaires, keynumbers, and lab results, we created her individualized Four Circles treatmentplan.Biology—Here we focused on improving Katie’s sleep, diet, and exercise habits.Katie agreed to cut out the alcohol and the caffeinated sodas and to get rid ofthe junk, focusing instead on brain-healthy food, filtered water, anddecaffeinated green tea, all of which are terrific for boosting your brain.We also discovered that Katie had two common food sensitivities—to dairy and togluten (found in wheat and other grains)—so she cut out dairy products, wheat,barley, pasta, bread, and other items made with white flour. As you’ll see inchapter 5 [Amen_9780307888969_epub_c05_r1.htm], the intestinal tract isvirtually a second brain. The gut makes more neurotransmitters than the brain.Neurotransmitters are key biochemicals that regulate mood and energy.Within two weeks, Katie was more relaxed than she had been in years, and herintestinal problems were well on their way to clearing up. She also felt morefocused and alert.We also wanted to rehabilitate Katie’s head injury. The first step here washelping Katie to develop brain envy. As soon as she was able to compare her scanto that of a healthy brain, she reacted as so many people do, wanting to dowhatever she could to care for her brain. She was ready to follow thebrain-healthy habits I describe in the next section: Avoid anything that hurtsyour brain (bad food, insufficient sleep, chronic stress), and consistently dothings that help your brain (eating well, sleeping well, and correcting anyunderlying negative thought patterns).I also prescribed some simple dietary supplements for Katie. I believe thateveryone needs a multivitamin (as most people do not eat at least five servingsof vegetables and fruits a day) and about 2,000 mg fish oil, taken in supplementform. Katie’s tests showed that she was low on vitamin D—most people are—so Isuggested she take vitamin D supplements. I also suggested that Katie takeprobiotics, which support your digestion by replenishing healthy gut bacteria.And I gave Katie a special supplement I have designed that supports healthyserotonin levels to help her be less worried; I prescribed another one to helpsupport overall brain function.Psychology—Katie scored very high on the questionnaire that measured stress andanxiety and on the one that rated inflexible thinking. So it was very importantto teach her the Amen Clinics ANT therapy to help her drive out the negativethoughts that kept automatically cropping up in her head. I’ll teach you how todrive out ANTs in chapter 6 [Amen_9780307888969_epub_c06_r1.htm], or you can goto www.amensolution.com [http://www.amensolution.com] for more information.I also wanted to make sure to expose Katie to the meditation and hypnosis audioson the Amen Solution @ Home website. Self-hypnosis and meditation are veryhelpful for anxiety, and Katie found that using these brain-healthy tools madeher calmer and more focused right away. Katie also learned that when she feltstressed, she could soothe her brain by taking ten slow, deep breaths.Finally, I talked to Katie about making good decisions. People often ask me,“What’s the one thing I should do to boost my brain?” Start making betterdecisions today. How do you do that? Just plant in your mind these two littlewords: Then what?“I think I’m going to stay up late tonight and answer emails.” Then what? “Oh,if I do that, I’ll be tired and crabby the next day, and I won’t be able toenjoy that special family dinner we have planned. Instead, I’ll go to bed andget some good sleep.”“I think I’ll take a piece of that chocolate cake from the buffet.” Then what?“Well, twenty minutes from now, I’ll feel guilty, ashamed, and stupid. I don’tlike feeling that way! I guess I’ll grab an apple and walk out so I won’t betempted.” Keep these two words with you everywhere you go: Then what?Social Connections—Like many stressed and anxious people, Katie tended towithdraw and isolate herself in times of trouble. I encouraged her to reach outwhen she was upset, to find someone she trusted, take a walk, and talk it out.Her parents, her boyfriend, and her girlfriends all became trusted members ofKatie’s support system.Spiritual Health—In the Spiritual Health circle on this page, I list severalquestions for people to ask themselves. I encouraged Katie to really think aboutthese questions, asking herself what her life meant, why she cared, and why thethings that mattered to her were important. On our website, you will find a“One-Page Miracle” where you have the chance to think about what you truly wantin your life in relationships, work, money, and for yourself. Katie completedthis page, and that really got her thinking. She began spending time focusing onwhat her life means and what she wants her life to mean. She started each dayreviewing her “One-Page Miracle” so that she could focus on the things that werereally important to her.The essence of mental health is knowing what you want and then being able to actin a way consistent with getting it. For example, I ask myself, “If I want akind, caring relationship with my wife, what do I need to do to make thathappen?” Katie asked herself, “If I want to get into law school, what do I needto do to make that happen?”This question led Katie to realize that passing the LSAT was key to getting intolaw school, and not getting sick was key to passing her tests. Now she felt moremotivation to boost her brain.REGULAR BRAIN-HEALTHY HABITSDeveloping regular brain-healthy habits is a critical piece in boosting yourbrain and unleashing its power. You must take your habits seriously and puthabits into your life that serve you rather than steal from you. Through theyears I have come up with an incredibly simple way to boost brain health. Itreally takes just three strategies: 1. Develop brain envy. You have to truly want to have a better brain. 2. Avoid anything that hurts your brain. This includes drugs, alcohol,environmental toxins, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, sleepapnea, depression, negative thinking patterns, excessive stress, and a lack ofexercise or new learning. 3. Consistently do good behaviors that help your brain. Adopt a greatdiet, learn new things, exercise, develop accurate thinking habits, work onstress management, and take some simple supplements to nourish your brain.HIGH LEVELS OF SUCCESSTo be at your best, it is critical to put all of these pieces into place. Takingan integrated approach to boosting your brain gives you the best chance to feelgreat, look great, and to achieve your ideal weight.Hour 3 Exercise—Get AssessedReview the Four Circles—Make a copy of the Four Circles diagram on this page andmark the areas in each circle that apply to you, to see your strengths andvulnerabilities.Take the Amen Solution Brain Type Test—Log on to the Amen Solution @ Home(www.amensolution.com [http://www.amensolution.com]) to find out which of yourbrain systems might need help and what specific supplements might be of benefitto you.Take the 24/7 Brain Gym Assessment on Brain Health—Also on www.amensolution.com[http://www.amensolution.com], you will find an individualized set of exercisesin the form of fun games to optimize your brain.

Knowing how to test, balance, and optimize your hormones iscritical to unleashing the power of your female brain.“I just don’t feel right.”“I have brain fog.”“My memory is worse than ever.”“I hurt all over.”“I can’t sleep.”“I have no interest in sex.”“I just yelled at my teenage daughter for no reason. I hate myself.”“I feel like I am going to crawl out of my skin.”“I am hungrier than ever.”Of course, hormonal issues don’t apply just to females. Look at any teenage boy.And scientists are now talking about a male midlife change—andropause. But,having five sisters, three daughters, and a teenage granddaughter, I know thatmale swings are nothing like the wild ride of hormones that women face. For manymen, levels of the male sex hormone testosterone peak at around age eighteen andthen go into a long, steady slide through old age. For a woman, hormonal changesoften feel like a roller coaster that goes through peaks, valleys, quick turns,and abrupt stops.Females enter puberty with a shock. Probably every woman remembers her firstmenses. And that monthly reminder persists for years, driven by a hormonal cyclethat can affect your feelings and thought patterns and give you acne to boot.Then there’s the tsunami of hormones that comes with pregnancy, childbirth, andpostpartum changes. Finally, after years of hormonal cycling, you face theperfect storm of perimenopause and menopause with too many hormones here, notenough hormones there, and all of it out of whack.So what can you do?It turns out there’s a lot you can do. New research and clinical work now offersworkable solutions to women who are ready to take back control of their hormonesand their lives.YOUR BRAIN IS RUN BY HORMONESThe human body is an amazing assortment of organ systems. When everything workstogether, your body plays like a precisely tuned orchestra where your brain,ovaries, adrenal glands, pancreas, and thyroid do what they’re supposed to atthe right time. Your brain gets active or stays quiet as needed. Your organsplay a sweet, steady note together, and your sense of well-being reflects theharmony within. You feel happy and energetic. You sleep well and have gooddigestion. Your stress is under control. There are no sour notes. Life isbeautiful.But for that harmony to exist, all the different parts of the orchestra have tocommunicate with each other so they know when they need to play loud, soft, orstop playing altogether. And that’s where your hormones come in. Hormones arechemical messengers produced by certain organs that travel through thebloodstream, keeping cells and other organs informed of what’s going on soeveryone can come in on cue.Your hormones are a delicate system that can be affected by many factors, bothinside and outside your body. Problems start when hormones fall into a state ofimbalance. Maybe the thyroid produces too much hormone, or too little, andeverything else goes haywire. Women are more likely than men to have theseproblems.Fortunately, our knowledge of hormones and how to put them back into balance isgrowing. You have at your disposal many tools you can use to work with thechallenges your hormones put you through so you can put yourself back incontrol.But we have to start where we are, so let’s look at what happens when things arenot working right.There are two main issues women experience with hormone imbalances:uncomfortable symptoms that can begin to change how you think, feel, and act,affecting your quality of life, and an increased risk of illnesses, such asdepression, Alzheimer’s disease, heart disease, osteoporosis, diabetes, andcertain cancers.Do any of the following scenarios sound like you?You’ve been gaining weight and you don’t know why. You suspect it’s because ofthe bag of chips and salsa you eat every night with a couple of glasses of wine,but you don’t understand where these cravings are coming from and why you can’tstop yourself from giving in to them.Or maybe you feel depressed, anxious, or irritable for no apparent reason. It’stempting to blame your disrespectful kids or your unresponsive husband or yourannoying mother-in-law. But are they really the cause? Why do they becomeespecially irksome during certain times of the month?Or do you wake up in the middle of the night, racked with worry and plagued bythoughts that are going so fast they jam up against each other? Your husband ishappily snoring away right next to you. Why isn’t he as obsessed over the brokenwater heater as you are?There is a very strong mutual influence between hormones and the brain. Thebrain produces signals that trigger hormones, and hormones from other parts ofthe body also influence the brain. For example, when thyroid activity is low,brain activity is typically low as well. That’s why a low thyroid often goesalong with depression, irritability, and brain fog. Balanced hormones arecritical to your brain’s well-being.MEET THE CAST OF CHARACTERSThere are hundreds of hormones in the body that affect the brain. To keep itpractical, I am going to show you how to optimize seven of your most importanthormones:• Estrogen • Cortisol • Progesterone • DHEA • Testosterone • Insulin • Thyroid Owing to the importance and complexity of the topic, I have divided this chapterinto two parts.PART ONE: BALANCE ESTROGEN, PROGESTERONE, AND TESTOSTERONEWhen you have a deficiency of progesterone and an imbalance of hormones, itliterally feels like the “decision part” of your brain has been taken away fromyou. Women describe feeling like they are watching themselves handle situationswith anger and frustration, as if they were someone else.—TAMI MERAGLIA, M.D.,INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE PHYSICIANESTROGEN AND PROGESTERONE:THE FEMALE SEX HORMONESESTROGENEstrogen helps you think clearly. Progesterone helps you relax.Two of the major hormones that drive your menstrual cycle are estrogen andprogesterone. They are much more than just reproductive hormones. They actuallyaffect many systems in the body, including bones, cardiovascular system,reproductive system, and your brain. And they are not just found in women. Menalso have them, only in much smaller amounts, unless the males are obese or haveother estrogen-producing conditions.A woman’s menstrual cycle reflects the natural rising and falling of estrogenand progesterone during a typical twenty-eight-day cycle. When everything workscorrectly, estrogen rises and falls twice during that time frame, in a gentlerolling motion, while progesterone rises and falls once. The chart below showsthe cycle of estradiol, one of the key forms of estrogen, and progesterone. Moreabout the different forms of estrogen in a bit.[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_021_r1.jpg]Healthy levels of estrogen help you feel good. Too much estrogen can make youfeel as anxious and irritable as a wet cat. Estrogen withdrawal makes you feeldepressed and confused. It’s the rise and drop in estrogen that drasticallyaffects your mood, and the more erratic your particular fluctuation is, the moreupset it can make you. These problems become worse during perimenopause andmenopause, when estrogen levels wane.There are three different kinds of estrogen: estrone, estradiol, and estriol.According to my friend and colleague Dr. James LaValle, author of the MetabolicCode, estrone is the estrogen to worry about. Estrone can make you more prone tocancer.Your liver, gut, and adrenal health determine what types of hormones are made.Depending on how you take care of your body, you can push your body to makehealthy or unhealthy estrogens, which is why getting healthy is critical to allof your body’s systems, including your brain. As women age, their estradiol andestriol levels go down, and their estrone levels increase.Estrone—Estrone is the main estrogen made by women after menopause and isimplicated in breast and uterine cancer. Before menopause, women make all threeestrogens and progesterone. The majority of estrone is made in the liver,adrenal glands, and fat tissue. After menopause, the levels of estradiol,estriol, and progesterone drop drastically, and their health protective effectsare lost. It’s not surprising that the majority of breast cancer cases occur inpostmenopausal women. Obese women are at higher risk. Alcohol consumption alsoincreases estrone, which could be the reason there is an association betweenalcohol intake and breast cancer. Estrone production is also increased withexcess sugar, the antacid cimetidine (sold under the brand name Tagamet), birthcontrol pills, hypothyroidism, smoking, and pesticide exposure.Estradiol—Estradiol is the strongest estrogen; it helps you think clearly. It isproduced in the ovaries and has many protective effects, including maintainingbone density, improving growth hormone production and cardiovascular function,keeping your blood from getting “sticky,” supporting cognitive function andmood, assisting in growth hormone release, and improving your lipids profile.Too much estradiol can be associated with estrogen-related cancers, butdeficiencies can lead to osteoporosis, heart disease, dementia, and otherdiseases of aging. Estradiol keeps you looking and feeling young and vibrant. Italso provides antiaging protection for the skin. And it even helps preventweight gain. Researchers at Yale University have found that estradiol suppressesappetite using the same pathways in the brain as leptin, which is one of thehormones that regulate appetite. In perimenopause and menopause, estradiolbegins to decrease, which might be one of the reasons that menopausal women findit so difficult to control their weight. They’re just hungry all the time.Estriol—Estriol is the weakest of the three estrogens and has a protective rolein breast tissue. It is believed to protect vaginal tissue too. Estriol helps toreduce hot flashes in women, protects the urinary tract, and plays a role inretention of bone density. It can help increase “good” HDL and decrease “bad”LDL cholesterol. One compelling study showed that taking estriol can reversebrain lesions in women with multiple sclerosis.Estrogen is particularly needed in women to make serotonin function at its bestin the brain. Serotonin is one of the brain’s feel-good hormones. With noestrogen, your mood can change to anxious and depressed. Cognitive functions,such as critical thinking and short-term memory, are also eroded with the lossof estrogen production.Below is a list of symptoms related to low and high estrogen levels:Low EstrogenWeight gainBladder incontinence and infectionMood changes/depressionInsomniaLow libidoHeart palpitationsOsteoporosisPainful intercourseFoggy-headednessIrritabilityFatigueWeepinessHot flashesPainExcess EstrogenPuffinessHeavy bleedingFibrocystic breastsLow libidoCravings for carbohydratesWeight gain around the hipsVaginal or oral yeast (thrush)Mood swings / quick to tear upTender breastsHeadaches or migrainesIn a young, healthy woman, the estrogen ratio generally averages as follows:60–80 percent estriol, 10–20 percent estradiol, and 10–20 percent estrone. Whilethese levels vary from one individual to another, the goal of bioidenticalhormone restoration therapy (BHRT), discussed later, is to re-create a morenatural balance in the levels of estrogen and in combination with all the othersex hormones.Estrogens convert into several metabolites. Estrone, for example, may convertinto three different forms: • 2-hydroxyestrone, protective against cancer • 4-hydroxyestrone, promotes cancer • 16-alpha-hydroxyestrone, promotes cancer2-hydroxyestrone is considered a “good estrogen” metabolite, whereas4-hydroxyestrone and 16-alpha-hydroxyestrone have been associated with thedevelopment of certain types of cancer, like breast and ovarian. These “badestrogens” are also associated with uterine fibroids, ovarian cysts, andfibrocystic breasts.The main areas for estrogen breakdown are the liver and gastrointestinal tract.Diets high in refined sugar and low in fiber feed the unfriendly bacteria in theintestines, causing them to disrupt estrogen metabolism. One of the by-productsof the unfriendly “bugs” in the intestines is that the estrogen metabolitescan’t be excreted and they build up in your tissues over time, causing trouble.The relationship between 2-hydroxyestrone (good estrogen) and16-alpha-hydroxyestrone (bad estrogen) is expressed as the 2:16 ratio. Thehigher the ratio, the better. The minimum acceptable number ratio is 2 andideally it is greater than 4. Lower ratios are associated with breast andovarian cancers. You can easily be tested for this ratio with a simple in-homeurine test available online.DIETARY CHANGES TO IMPROVE THE 2:16 RATIOThere are great foods that can help improve the conversion of estrogen into goodmetabolites and away from the bad ones. These foods include insoluble dietaryfibers, such as lignin found in green beans, peas, carrots, seeds, and Brazilnuts. The reason that dietary fiber, especially lignin, is so beneficial is thatit can bind harmful estrogens in the digestive tract, so they can be excreted inthe feces instead of being reabsorbed. Dietary fiber also improves thecomposition of intestinal bacteria so that harmful estrogen metabolites can beexcreted from the body. It also decreases the conversion of testosterone intoestrogens, maintaining a healthy testosterone level.Sugar and simple carbohydrates cause unfriendly flora to grow in thegastrointestinal tract and disrupt estrogen metabolism. These foods also raiseblood sugar and insulin levels, resulting in adverse influences in sex hormonebalance. Too many simple carbohydrates have been associated with postmenopausalbreast cancer risk among overweight women and women with a large waistcircumference.Whenever possible, avoid animal protein that has been raised with hormones orantibiotics. Europe won’t accept hormone-laden U.S. beef because of the healthrisks. Look for grass-fed, hormone-free, antibiotic-free organic beef andchicken, which is richer in omega-3 fatty acids and will therefore act to reduceinflammation and help your hormone receptors to function properly. Also, eatorganic vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, beans, and grains.Pesticides are known to cause hormonal imbalances and some pesticides have beenshown to act as “endocrine (hormone) disrupters,” interfering with the body’snatural hormone systems and causing an array of health problems. While theEnvironmental Protection Agency began looking at this issue in 1999, littlechange has yet occurred in the marketplace, and women are well served byeducating themselves on this important issue. (I’ll discuss this more later inthis chapter.)LIFESTYLE CHANGES TO IMPROVE THE 2:16 RATIOYour lifestyle may expose you to environmental estrogens that can disrupt yourbody’s natural balance or interfere with proper therapy. Here are some tips fromDr. LaValle to reduce your exposure: 1. Limit drinking out of plastic containers, and when you do, drink onlyfrom containers that are free of bisphenol A, better known as BPA. 2. Do not microwave food in plastic containers or covered in plastic. 3. Avoid using personal care items such as face creams, cosmetics, shampoos,tampons, and toiletries that contain environmental estrogens and particularlyphthalates. Phthalates are synthetic substances found in many plastics. Theyhave estrogenic properties and are banned as a toxic substance in Europe.DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS TO IMPROVE ESTROGEN METABOLISMDiindolylmethane (DIM)—This is a phytochemical found in cruciferous vegetableslike broccoli and cauliflower. It shifts estrogen metabolism to favor thefriendly or harmless estrogen metabolites. DIM can significantly increase theurinary excretion of the “bad” estrogens in as little as four weeks. The typicaldose of DIM is 75–300 mg per day.Omega-3 Fatty Acids (fish oils)—These contain eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), whichhas been reported in laboratory studies to help control estrogen metabolism anddecrease the risk of breast cancer. Eating grass-fed organic beef also suppliesthese fats. I typically recommend 2,000 mg a day.Calcium d-glucarate—This natural compound is found in fruits and vegetables likeapples, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, and cabbage. Calcium d-glucarate inhibitsthe enzyme that contributes to breast, prostate, and colon cancers. It alsoreduces reabsorbed estrogen from the digestive tract. The dose for calciumd-glucarate is typically 500–1,500 mg per day.Probiotics—These help maintain healthy intestinal flora and healthy estrogenlevels. Make sure you get human-strain probiotics that have live cultures.Consider taking 10–60 billion units per day.Plant Phytoestrogens—These plant-based compounds have healthy estrogen-likeactivity and have been found helpful for a variety of conditions, includingmenopausal symptoms, PMS, and endometriosis. Phytoestrogens can be found in soy,kudzu, red clover, and pomegranate. Resveratrol is a bioflavonoid antioxidantthat occurs naturally in grapes and red wine and has been reported to inhibitbreast cancer cell growth in laboratory studies.Black cohosh—This herb has been used for centuries by Native Americans forhormonal balance in women. Over the last thirty years, European physicianshelping women through menopausal transition have used it extensively. In humanstudies, black cohosh has been found to decrease hot flashes associated withmenopause. Unlike conventional estrogen effects on individuals predisposed tobreast cancer, black cohosh has been shown in laboratory studies to inhibitcancer cells. Most studies used doses of 20–80 mg twice daily, providing 4–8 mgtriterpene glycosides for up to six months.Melatonin—This hormone is produced in the pineal gland that, among otherfunctions, helps sleep. Melatonin levels decline with age and may lead to thesleep disturbances common during menopause. Melatonin has been shown inlaboratory studies to inhibit the growth of breast cancer cells. Melatonin actsas an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant in the brain and other tissues like theintestine. Studies show that low melatonin levels increase breast cancer risk inwomen. So if you are having trouble sleeping consider 3–6 mg of melatonin beforebed. It may boost your immune system and help you sleep.ESTROGEN AND PAINA study in the Journal of Neuroscience tested pain sensitivity in women atdifferent times during their menstrual cycle—first during their period whenestradiol is at its lowest and then when their estradiol levels were at theirhighest. The women in the study were subjected to a controlled amount of painand asked to rate the level of their discomfort. At low levels of estradiol, thewomen reported feeling much more pain than when the hormone was at its highest.The implication is that when your estrogen levels are low, such as duringmenopause or during the premenstrual or menstrual phase of your cycle, you arelikely to feel pain more acutely, which is also likely true for emotional pain.Just one more reason a smart man is especially sensitive at this time!PROGESTERONEProgesterone can support GABA (gama-aminobutyric acid, a major calmingneurotransmitter in the brain) and the myelin sheath—it is much more than a sexhormone.The other major hormonal player in your cycle is progesterone. It helps toprepare the uterus for implantation with a healthy fertilized egg and supportspregnancy. If no implantation occurs, progesterone levels drop, and anothercycle begins.Progesterone receptors are highly concentrated in the brain. Progesterone cansupport GABA, the brain’s relaxation neurotransmitter; acts to protect yournerve cells; and supports the myelin sheath that covers neurons. I like to thinkof progesterone as the “feel-good hormone.” It makes you feel calm and peacefuland encourages sleep. It’s like nature’s Valium, but better, because instead ofmaking your brain fuzzy, it sharpens your thinking. It has also been shown tohelp with brain injuries by reducing inflammation and counteracting damage. Itis so much more than a sex hormone.Progesterone increases during pregnancy, which is why many pregnant women oftenfeel great. Some women with hormonal issues, in fact, feel so much better duringpregnancy that they will deliberately get pregnant over and over again justtrying to feel normal. Other than during pregnancy, it’s rare to see women withtoo much progesterone. However, women who are given too much progesterone (liketaking too much Valium) can get depressed and feel as they would during thefirst few weeks of pregnancy, with morning sickness, sleepiness, and a dullbackache.Progesterone is low in the first two weeks of the menstrual cycle. Then itfollows a rolling-hill pattern during the second half of the cycle, rising andfalling along with estrogen. A drop in progesterone means the loss of thefeel-good hormone. Calmness gives way to anxiety and irritability. Sleep isdisturbed. Things get a bit fuzzy. Along with estrogen, progesterone plummetsright before menstruation starts, and for some women, that’s when the bottomfalls out. Her hormonal mainstays have all fallen away. Here are some commonsymptoms:Low ProgesteroneAnxiety/depressionTrouble sleepingFibrocystic breastsPMSPremenstrual headachesPostpartum depressionBone lossProgesterone can fluctuate greatly in women who are in their late thirties andforties, making them feel anxious and irritable. Often, progesterone cream canbe very helpful under the care of an experienced health care provider.Progesterone production can decrease with low levels of thyroid hormone, the useof antidepressants, chronic stress, deficiencies in the vitamins A, B6, C, orzinc, and a diet high in refined sugar. Chasteberry has been found to helpsupport healthy progesterone levels. It can also be taken to reduce the symptomsof PMS and endometriosis (20–40 mg a day).PMS: THE MONTHLY CYCLE CAN BE MURDERI know that PMS is real. With all the estrogen in my world, I’ve experienced itfirsthand. One of my sisters or daughters can think I walk on water one week andthen want to throw rocks at me the next. But seeing PMS show up on a brain scanreally clinched it for me. My patients have proved to me that PMS is more thanjust a hormone issue. It’s actually a brain disorder, and Jesse was one of thewomen to show me what it looks like.JESSEI first saw Jesse after she split from her husband. During a fight, she pulled aknife on him and told him not to go to sleep. He left her that evening. Itturned out that Jesse had long-standing temper issues that paralleled hermenstrual cycle. Regularly in the week before her period started, she becamemoody, anxious, and aggressive. And she aggravated the problem by drinking alot. The incident with the knife had occurred at precisely this point in hercycle.When Jesse came to see me, I knew it would be helpful to find out what was goingon in her brain. I scanned her during the worst part of her cycle, and thenagain, two weeks later, when she usually felt her best. The results werestriking. The two sets of scans didn’t even look like they came from the sameperson. During the worst time of Jesse’s cycle, the “worry” region of her brainwas overactive, which caused her to become fixated on things, and the judgmentand impulse control part of her brain was underactive. The alcohol likelyfurther dropped her ability to control her behavior. That’s why she was sodistraught with her husband and why the idea of grabbing the knife wasn’tproperly processed and filtered out. During the best time of her cycle, Jesse’sbrain was much more balanced. The answer to this woman’s problem was not justanger-management therapy. It was to get her hormonal fluctuations under control.During the days prior to starting your period, estrogen and progesterone levelshit rock bottom. On scans, I see the worry center of the brain (the anteriorcingulate gyrus) start to fire up; as a result, women can get stuck on negativethoughts or give in to behaviors they think will make them feel better, such asreaching for wine or cookies. This makes sense, because the anterior cingulateis the part of your brain that helps you shift attention, be flexible, and gowith the flow.The anterior cingulate fires up as the end result of a series of events. First,estrogen levels fall. Meanwhile, serotonin, the feel-good neurotransmitter, alsodecreases. The deficiency in serotonin causes the anterior cingulate gyrus tofire up. To make things worse, just about this time the PFC tends to quiet down,which is why women may have a hard time focusing and controlling impulses. So wesee emotional difficulties, intensified feelings of sadness, and disturbedsleep.Jesse’s SPECT Scans[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_022_r1.jpg]This is hard enough to deal with on a monthly basis. But by the time you hityour late thirties, your body is less efficient at producing progesterone. Andin your forties, your progesterone curve stops creating that nice hill and looksmore like a bump. Research shows that progesterone levels start to decreaseeight years before a woman goes into menopause, and this is when progesteronewithdrawal symptoms can become more pronounced. Memory declines and it’s hard toconcentrate. You experience mood swings. Your brain has lost its naturalsleeping pill and antianxiety hormone. This can lead to marital problems andsometimes even addictions.The Myriad PMS Symptoms• Acne• Depression• Alcohol sensitivity• Distractibility• Anger• Fatigue• Anxiety• Forgetful• Appetite changes• Headaches and/or migraines• Bloating • Breast tenderness• Herpes outbreaks• Clumsiness• Impulsivity• Confusion• Insomnia• Constipation• Irritability• Cramps• Mood swings• Cravings for sweet or salty foods• Panic attacks • Suspiciousness• Crying spells• Tearfulness• Decreased sex drive• Weight gainPMS symptoms can be precipitated by oral contraceptives, pregnancies,miscarriages, abortions, tubal ligations, partial hysterectomies, aging, and lowmagnesium levels and exacerbated by low blood sugar, caffeine, poor diet, andskipping meals. Complicating matters, these symptoms are frequently misdiagnosedas psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression, panic attacks,agoraphobia, eating disorders, and personality disorders.Help for PMS—Low progesterone is often one of the culprits of PMS symptoms.Progesterone cream used during the last week of a woman’s cycle is oftenhelpful. I also recommend a combination of supplements to balance the brain,especially 400–500 mg calcium citrate twice a day, 200–300 mg chelated magnesiumtwice a day, vitamin A, B complex with 50 mg B6, and 500 mg evening primrose oiltwice a day. I also suggest 50–100 mg 5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan) twice a day tohelp to boost serotonin and decrease anxiety and worry. If focus is a problem,try green tea or 500 mg L-tyrosine two to three times a day. Chasteberry, 20–40mg a day, can also help for PMS symptoms of especially breast pain ortenderness, swelling, constipation, irritability, depressed mood or moodalterations, anger, and headache in some women. Boost exercise in the last weekof your cycle, and hold the sugar and alcohol.TESTOSTERONEMost people think of testosterone as the male hormone. It’s a shot oftestosterone during a critical time of fetal development that creates the malebrain. Another shot of this hormone during puberty leads to the deepening voice,facial hair, and many other features we associate with “maleness.” But femaleshave testosterone too (just as males have some estrogen), and testosterone cando wonderful things for a woman. It helps protect her nervous system and wardsoff cognitive impairment, depression, and Alzheimer’s disease. It also seems toprotect cells from inflammation, which some researchers believe is why men areless susceptible to inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis,and asthma than are women, and even why they suffer less from depression. Menwho have low testosterone are more likely to suffer from chronic pain, which ismore common in women.As many as 20 percent of women are low in testosterone and therefore havedecreased sensitivity to sexual pleasure, coupled with a low sex drive. Combinethat with poor memory and depression, and these hormonal fluctuations can meanbig trouble in a woman’s life: the quality of her engagement in relationships,her ability to be emotionally and physically intimate with a partner, herenjoyment of sex, and her effectiveness in her personal and professional work.Keeping the right level of testosterone is important for your health andwell-being. Too much can cause major health problems, but too little isassociated with depression, poor memory, and low libido. This is not a goodrecipe for intimate relationships. Many couples fall in love when their hormonesare balanced or at their highest levels. When testosterone levels drop, so doesa woman’s interest in sex as well as her sensitivity to sexual pleasure(testosterone affects the sensitivity of the nipples and clitoris), which cancause serious relationship problems.LOW TESTOSTERONE LEVELS?Besides increased libido, there are other benefits related to testosteronereplacement for women, including retention of muscle mass and bone density,improved mood, and reduced cardiovascular risks. Levels of testosterone in theblood should be checked to see if they are low before using any type ofbioidentical testosterone or even dietary supplements, such as DHEA (I’lldiscuss DHEA in the next part of this chapter), which can raise testosteronelevels.Before you let your doctor give you testosterone shots or pills, try to boost itnaturally by dramatically decreasing or even eliminating sugar, wheat, andprocessed foods from your diet. A sugar burst has been found to lowertestosterone levels by up to 25 percent.If you and your sweetheart share the cheesecake at the restaurant, no one islikely to get “dessert” when you get home!Another way to naturally boost your testosterone level is to start aweight-training program. Building muscle helps your body increase itstestosterone levels. The supplements DHEA and zinc can also help. Zinc isnecessary to maintain normal testosterone levels. Inadequate zinc levels preventthe pituitary gland from releasing hormones that stimulate testosteroneproduction. Zinc also inhibits the enzyme that converts testosterone intoestrogen. If these measures don’t work, you may need testosterone replacement.Get your testosterone level checked and start with natural ways to normalize itwhen it is low.What Steals Your Testosterone Levels • Abdominal fat • Stress • Excess sugar, processed foods, and insulin • Zinc deficiency • AlcoholPOLYCYSTIC OVARY SYNDROMEToo much testosterone is often associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS),in which multiple cysts appear in the ovaries. It is associated with irregularperiods, acne, excessive facial and body hair, and sometimes aggression. It hasbeen associated with serious health problems such as obesity, high cholesterol,high blood pressure, diabetes, infertility, and hypersexuality, which makeswomen more vulnerable to having affairs. The diagnosis of PCOS is oftensuspected in women who are heavyset (abdominal obesity) and prediabetic and whohave facial hair, balding, interstitial cystitis, irritable bowel syndrome, andhigh inflammatory markers. Their lab work often shows high levels ofdihydrotestosterone (DHT), high blood sugar levels, low progesterone levelsrelative to estrogen, and a high level of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).One of the best tests to diagnose PCOS is an ultrasound of the ovaries, whereyou can see multiple cysts on each ovary.Sometimes PCOS Can Fool You—None of the many physicians my wife saw evermentioned the possibility of PCOS to her, despite her complaining of irregularperiods. She just didn’t look like the typical female with PCOS. Tana isextremely fit and has gorgeous, thick red hair. At about thirty-eight years ofage, Tana went off birth control pills and she soon realized that something oddwas going on. Her face started breaking out and her menstrual cycles became veryirregular. Although it seemed she was too young, she thought she might be goingthrough perimenopause. It seemed best to see her doctor right away to determinewhat was going on—and the results were shocking. Tana was dismayed to learn thather cholesterol and triglycerides were high and that she was prediabetic. Howwas that possible? Tana is 5 foot 6 inches, weighs 121 pounds, and has about 15percent body fat. She works out like a nut and eats all the right foods. “That’scrazy,” she thought. “I’m the healthiest person I know.”We were both very concerned, and that’s when a friend introduced us to anintegrative gynecologist who did an ultrasound on Tana’s ovaries and found theyboth contained dozens of cysts. She diagnosed Tana with PCOS. How would herdoctor have known about Tana’s ovaries unless she looked at them? PCOS was alsolinked to Tana’s other symptoms, including irregular menstrual cycles, skinbreakouts, high cholesterol, and insulin resistance. We were lucky that we founda physician smart enough to check for this, since Tana doesn’t fit the typicalphysical profile of a woman with PCOS.Tana’s treatment was simple, but it led to dramatic changes. She was prescribedglucophage, a medication used to balance insulin, and that, in turn, reducestestosterone levels. In addition, she was given a bioidentical progesteronecream, saw palmetto to drive down her high levels of DHT, and a comprehensivestress-reduction program. Within a few months, Tana’s cholesterol dropped 50points, her insulin levels normalized, her skin cleared up, and her cycle becameregular. She was also less anxious and wanted to cuddle more. “Good for me,” Ithought.THE PILL: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOWTens of millions of women take hormones daily in the form of oral contraceptivepills (OCPs). In the United States alone, 43 million women of child-bearing agedo not want to become pregnant, and of those, 28 percent take OCPs.Over the years, OCPs have been both hailed as the best thing that ever happenedto the modern woman and vilified as a hidden health threat. Certainly they havegiven women considerable control over their destinies by allowing them to delayhaving children, limit the size of their families, and arrange the timing oftheir pregnancies. But there is also evidence that OCPs are not completelybenign. They have been shown to cause problems with blood pressure and bloodclots and to increase the incidence of strokes, especially in women who smoke orwho have a history of migraine headaches. Smoking while on OCPs can be extremelydangerous.Typically, birth control pills are formulated with estrogen and progestin (asynthetic form of progesterone). The estrogen is usually in synthetic form aswell. This combination functions by preventing ovulation. Nothing happens in avacuum, though, and this mix of hormones has additional effects on the body. Ifyou are on OCPs, you should be aware of these effects so you can take steps tocounter them if necessary.For one thing, oral contraceptives deplete some of the essential vitamins andminerals and can lead to deficiencies. If you are taking birth control pills,you should be supplementing your diet with B vitamins (folate, B6, and B12), andvitamin E. You should also be looking for signs of a magnesium deficiency, whichcan lead to a variety of symptoms: • Anxiety, nervousness, and insomnia • Depression, migraines, and low energy • Muscle cramps and spasms • Heart arrhythmias and palpitations • Constipation • Blood sugar dysregulation • HypertensionIf you find yourself suffering from symptoms like these, you can take amagnesium supplement. The usual dose is 300–800 mg elemental magnesium daily. Agood way to judge the dosage is to achieve a soft stool without taking it to thepoint of diarrhea. There are a variety of magnesium salts to choose from. Theright one for you is based on your specific needs: • Magnesium malate is good for fibromyalgia, leg cramps, and workoutissues such as lactic acid buildup. • Magnesium taurate helps with anxiety and arrhythmias. • Magnesium glycinate has the best absorption. • Magnesium citrate is inexpensive, if cost is an issue. • Magnesium carbonate and magnesium oxide are not the best choices, asthey do not absorb well.Another symptom reported by 16–56 percent of women on OCPs is bouts ofdepression. Scientists have argued for years over the role of the pill incausing depression. In a recent review of the literature, the authors cited theinconsistent use of the term depression and the varied formulations of the birthcontrol pills taken as making it difficult to draw firm conclusions. However,there have been studies with clear results. For example, a study by JayashriKulkarni of Monash University in Australia found that women who were on OCPswere almost twice as likely to be depressed as the women who were not on thepill. Non-users had a depression score of 9.8, whereas women who were on thepill had a depression score of 17.6. One reason for this effect may be thatprogestin acts as natural progesterone does to lower brain serotonin, animportant neurotransmitter for the regulation of mood. Another contributingfactor may be an increase in copper levels in women on OCPs.As with any drug you take, the effects may be far-reaching. Be aware of what’shappening in your body. As we have seen, a woman’s hormones significantly affecther mood and her body chemistry. Adding birth control pills into the mix is sureto shake things up. Be prepared to take supplements to counteract any negativeeffects, and if you start feeling symptoms of depression that interfere withyour life, discuss this with your doctor.THE BEGINNING OF A NEW PHASE: PERIMENOPAUSEBy the time you reach your thirties or forties, your hormones start undergoinganother change. Your body is preparing itself to go out of the baby-makingbusiness and that means shuffling around the hormone balance once more.It doesn’t all happen overnight. For eight to ten years before enteringmenopause (when your menstrual cycle ends completely), you will go through aperiod of adjustment known as perimenopause. Most women don’t think about beingin perimenopause until their estrogen levels have fallen to a point where theyget hit with hot flashes and night sweats, the most common symptoms. But by thetime you are having hot flashes, you’ve probably been going throughperimenopause for up to ten years.These years of adjustment can be a difficult time. Your hormone system doesn’twork as efficiently as it did, and the once (relatively) gentle ups and downs inyour hormone levels give way to estrogen spikes followed by a crash right beforeyour period begins. The result can be severe PMS symptoms, even if you’ve neverhad them before. When estrogen levels decline during the menstrual cycle,perimenopause, or menopause, you also have more trouble with your short-termmemory and are more likely to have crying spells and depression. You may findyourself forgetting where you put your keys or what you came to the grocerystore to pick up. Low levels of estrogen can also make you more sensitive topain. All these symptoms are exaggerated with the more erratic hormonal shiftsin perimenopause. The seesaw effect of going from estrogen dominance to estrogenwithdrawal becomes more pronounced. It isn’t fun for you (or those around you),and it can make you feel as though you are literally losing your mind.Your awareness of what’s going on can help you weather the hormonal stormsduring this time and even thrive. These are the years when you can maketremendous strides in your personal growth, deepen your relationships, and makeadvancements in your career. You don’t want hormonal shifts to interfere withreaching your full potential. To help you stay on top of the situation, it is agood idea to get your hormone levels checked when you are about thirty-fiveyears old so you have a baseline. Then get them checked every two to threeyears. This is much better than waiting—as many women we see in our clinic havedone—until you are ten years into the process, have already put on an extra 35pounds, and are on antidepressant and antianxiety medications. Interveningearlier in the process can help you avoid a lot of problems.Maintaining a brain-healthy lifestyle will improve your hormonal balance allaround. Committing to exercise, meditation, and the proper diet while avoidingnicotine, too much alcohol and caffeine, and unhealthy foods, will make thingsgo much more smoothly. If you and your doctor decide you could use more help inbalancing your hormones, bioidentical hormone replacement therapy (BHRT) isavailable in the form of creams, pills, and vaginal inserts (more on BHRT onthis page). If you’re having hot flashes, these can be effectively treated witha combination of estradiol and estriol. You can also find natural treatments inthe form of supplements, such as B vitamins, fish oil, evening primrose oil, andflaxseed oil.IT’S NOT YOUR GRANDMOTHER’S MENOPAUSEMenopause just isn’t what it used to be. When I think of my grandmotherMarcella, my father’s mother, whom I adored, she was already an old woman in herfifties and sixties. She often appeared tired and out of breath, was overweight,and wore simple clothes. She died at age sixty-two. In contrast, my mother, ateighty-one, remains vibrant and active. She still plays golf; dresses in astylish way; and is often found at the mall with one of my sisters, daughters,or nieces. Many women in menopause are at the peak of their careers and sociallife.If you’re going through menopause now, you realize that it’s not the end ofanything vital to who you really are. If anything, it’s an opportunity for newfreedom in the many decades of life ahead. But with the physical changes inmenopause, there are still some challenges to be faced. Your understanding ofwhat’s going on can help you make these the best years of your life.Menopause is the permanent end of your menstrual cycle. Technically it is theone-year mark after your last period. After that point you are said to bepostmenopausal. Of course, this is a rather arbitrary cutoff point and you maycontinue to experience many of the symptoms you had during perimenopause. Plus,since your estrogen and progesterone have probably fallen to very low levels,you can no longer benefit from their protective qualities. You’re now morevulnerable to conditions such as heart disease, stroke, and Alzheimer’s disease,and your bones may also be thinning. You may struggle with cognitive effects aswell. Because menopause often comes with lower overall brain activity, it can beassociated with depression, anxiety, insomnia, weight gain, and problems withconcentration and memory.It is even more critical during this time to take brain health seriously, asyour brain reserve has declined.When I was preparing for my last public television show, I called up my motherand asked her to get an audience for me so I could practice the script.Afterward, one of her sixty-year-old friends commented that at her age shedidn’t want to have to worry anymore about what she eats or exercising. If thatis your attitude too, you’ll just want to make sure you’re okay with theconsequences of having an older brain: less energy, brain fog, depression, andmore bad decisions. As we age, we have less room for error. To be better, youhave to be constantly vigilant for your health and not let others steal it.We now have proof that the sex hormones are in fact critical for brain health.Studies of women who have complete hysterectomies, in which their ovaries areremoved, show that without hormone replacement they have double the risk forAlzheimer’s disease. Recently, researchers studied the brain scans of a group ofwomen who were on and off hormone replacement. Over a period of two years, thewoman who did not take hormone replacement showed decreased activity in an areaof the brain called the posterior cingulate gyrus. This finding is especiallysignificant because that is one of the first areas in the brain that dies inAlzheimer’s disease. The women who were taking hormone replacement showed noreduced activity in that area of the brain.BIOIDENTICAL HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY—FOR BRAIN AND BODYHormones are derived from other hormones in a kind of family tree that isillustrated below. The first hormone in the series is cholesterol. We’ve allheard lots of bad things about cholesterol, but the fact is, it isn’t the enemy.Yes, when it’s too high, cholesterol is associated with heart disease. But whenit’s too low, it can be associated with homicide, suicide, and severedepression. You need cholesterol in your brain and your body. About 60 percentof the solid weight of your brain is fat. Your brain and your body need healthycholesterol levels to function optimally.[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_023_r1.jpg]From cholesterol, your body next makes a “mother” hormone called pregnenolonefrom which a host of others hormones are derived. Your doctor can influence yourhormonal balance at any point in the tree depending on your individual needs.For example, if you take pregnenolone, your body can choose on its own whichhormones are deficient and will make what it needs. Or your doctor may decide toprescribe testosterone, progesterone, or one of the estrogens. With our growingunderstanding of how hormones interact and the availability of safermedications, including bioidentical hormones and natural options, we can nowpinpoint treatments that can help you function at your best.Before we discuss BHRT, it is important to always remember that simply replacingany hormones without improving the way you process and utilize them can be veryproblematic. To maximize the benefits of BHRT, you need to make thebrain-healthy changes in your life. Eating healthier, taking supplements whereneeded, getting more sleep, and exercising will have a synergistic effect.Diminishing sex hormones during perimenopause and menopause have been shown tocause a number of disturbing symptoms. In the past, scientists worked on ways toreplace those hormones with therapeutic doses of natural or synthetic hormones.Many women found relief, and it looked as though hormone replacement therapy(HRT) would be the wave of the future. Then certain health problems began tocrop up. In 2002, the World Health Initiative (WHI) Study found that the use ofPrempro, one of the popular synthetic hormone replacement medications at thetime, increased the risk for breast cancer, heart disease, stroke, and bloodclots. It looked as though the cure was worse than the problem it had been meantto correct! Millions of women panicked and immediately tossed out their HRTprescriptions. That may have been a bit hasty. Here are the key concepts tounderstand in regard to the WHI study: • There was no individualized testing of the hormone needs ofparticipants. They took a one-size-fits-all approach. In psychiatry, this islike giving all depressed patients Prozac, which works about as well as givingeveryone sugar pills. • The synthetic hormones that were tested were not cycled like yourbody’s natural hormones. • Estrone (associated with a higher incidence of breast cancer) was inhigh concentration in HRT formulations. • Equilenin, or horse mare estrogen, also in the formula, is not easyfor your body to recognize, and its metabolites can create significant damage toDNA. • Taking oral estrogens has been found to increase C-reactive protein,an inflammatory marker that is associated with increased cancer and heartdisease risk. This same risk does not seem to apply to bioidentical transdermal(topical) estradiol. • Progestins (synthetic progesterone) have a long list of side effectsassociated with them. Progestins do not function in the body the same way asbioidentical progesterone. For example, progestins increase breast cancer riskwhereas bioidentical progesterone will lower breast cancer risk.When you look at the problems highlighted in the WHI study, they were specificfor the type of hormones given (synthetic) and how they were given. But theresult was that the study led to all hormone replacement being condemned. Themedia incited a fear in women that has potentially done more harm than good.Another problem seen with the use of synthetic female sex hormones isdrug-induced nutrient depletion. Synthetic estrogen replacement therapy candeplete the key nutrients, such as vitamin B6 and magnesium. Magnesium helpsbalance glucose and insulin regulation. Vitamin B6 is involved in the productionof serotonin for mood and appetite control. The synthetic progestins can causethe depletion of many nutrients including B vitamins, tyrosine, CoQ10, vitaminE, and folic acid. Taking synthetic HRT by mouth can also increase imbalances inthe natural gut flora, causing increases in Candida (yeast) populations. Thiscan not only lead to vaginal yeast disturbances but can put significant stresson your immune system too.I have seen estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone replacement withbioidentical hormones have tremendous value when administered correctly. BHRT isthe use of sex hormones derived from either plant sources (usually soy and wildyam) or processed from plant-based compounds by compounding pharmacists.Bioidentical hormones are exactly the same (molecularly) as those found in yourbody, and as such they are accepted and metabolized as if your body madethem—producing the same physiologic responses as those of the body’s naturalhormones. When used properly, BHRT can bring hormones back to a normal level andalleviate uncomfortable symptoms of deficiency. Bioidentical estrogens willoften be prescribed for women after blood, saliva, and urine testing showdeficiencies. BHRT has been found to be effective in reducing the number andintensity of hot flashes and in improving sleep and other negative symptoms ofperimenopause and menopause.But are there risks? The primary risk to be concerned about in hormonalreplacement for women is breast cancer. Low progesterone-to-estrogen ratios playan important role in that risk. If a woman has low progesterone levels, it iscorrelated with a fivefold increased risk of premenopausal breast cancer. Andprogesterone cream has been found to reduce the overproliferation of cells inbreast tissue. This protective, antiproliferative effect of bioidenticalprogesterone is not seen with synthetic progestins.Compared to the increased risks for cognitive decline while on HRT, naturalprogesterone has been found to enhance the repair processes in the brain, helpwith reducing anxiety, improve sleep patterns, and preserve cognitive functionwith age.So far, the studies on BHRT are limited, but they do look promising. One Frenchstudy looked at over three thousand women using natural progesterone andestradiol. This study found no increased health risks. Another larger Frenchstudy compared women using HRT to women using BHRT and found that those usingHRT had significantly greater risk of developing breast cancer than those onBHRT.When used properly, here are some of the benefits I have seen of BHRT for women: • Reduced or eliminated hot flashes • Decreased vaginal dryness • Improved skin elasticity • Improved energy and blood flow • Accelerated fat burning for improved weight loss • Reduced sleep disturbances (insomnia and night sweats) • Reduced emotional disturbances (mood swings, depression, nervousness,irritability, anxiousness) • Reduced breast problems reduced (tenderness, fibrocystosis, etc.) • Improved libido and sex drive • Improved mental acuity (lapses of memory, foggy thinking,concentration, etc.) • Reduced incontinenceWithout knowing your true hormonal status through appropriate testing, it’simpossible to get to the best balance for you. The reason BHRT may not work insome individuals is due to their health habits or the result of all theirhormones not being balanced. For example, just balancing the sex hormones willnot work if you are under chronic stress and your body is making excesscortisol. The excess cortisol can disrupt your metabolism, leading to furtherimbalances in sex hormones and other hormones like thyroid.NATURAL SUPPLEMENTS TO ALLEVIATE SYMPTOMSThe North American Menopause Society specifically recommends dietary isoflavones(found in soy and linseed products), black cohosh, and vitamin E for menopausalsymptoms. Of all the available supplements, black cohosh is the only oneconsistently found to offer relief from hot flashes. While its long-term safetyhas not been determined, it seems fine for short-term use. Also, phytoestrogens,found in many foods, seem to offer help. Good sources are nuts and oilseeds(like flaxseed oil). There is also interesting new work that shows that DHEA,discussed in the next part, can significantly improve sexual function inmenopausal women.PART TWO: BALANCE THYROID, CORTISOL, DHEA, AND INSULINLow thyroid doesn’t kill you. It just makes you wish you were dead.—RICHARD AND KARILEE SHAMES, THYROID MIND POWERTHYROIDAnne is a once-in-a-lifetime teacher. She is firm, kind, creative, smart, andorganized, and she has consistently earned the love and admiration of herstudents and parents year after year. Having practiced child and adultpsychiatry for decades, I have seen many excellent teachers and manynot-so-excellent ones. Anne is at the top of my list. She was my daughter’ssecond-grade teacher.When Anne confided to my wife, Tana, that she wanted to see me because she wasfeeling tired, in a mental fog, and felt like she had ADD, even though she neverhad symptoms of it in the past, I was willing to help. She was a vegetarian butcomplained of being sensitive to many foods and said that whenever she drankalcohol it would double her over in pain. If something in the morning set heroff, she felt “out of skew” and irritable for the rest of the day. In addition,she was sensitive to loud sounds and felt anxious a lot of the time. Her anxietyand the tendency to replay things over and over again in her mind kept her frombeing able to relax. Sometimes she found that she worried for days at a time.One of the first things I did was check her important numbers. It turned outthat she had very high levels of thyroid antibodies: Her thyroid peroxidaseantibodies were fewer than 1,000, when normal is fewer than 35. Having such ahigh level of thyroid antibodies meant that Anne had an autoimmune condition inwhich her body was attacking her own thyroid tissue. Anne also had a very lowvitamin D level, which is essential to the health of many organs, including thethyroid.Using our Amen Clinics Four Circles Approach, plus getting Anne’s vitamin Dlevel optimized and getting her thyroid properly treated, made a big differencein helping her focus and increasing her energy. She didn’t have ADD or any othersuch condition. Like many women, Anne needed her hormones balanced in a holisticway.WHEN A GOOD THYROID GOES BAD, THE BRAIN SUFFERSReproductive hormones aren’t the only hormones that affect how you look and feeland think. Among the most influential are the hormones produced by your thyroidgland.Too little thyroid, and you feel like a slug. Hypothyroidism makes you feel likeyou just want to lie on the couch all day with a bag of chips. Everything worksslower, including your heart, your bowels, and your brain. When we perform SPECTscans of people with hypothyroidism, we see decreased brain activity. Many otherstudies confirm that overall low brain function in hypothyroidism leads todepression, cognitive impairment, anxiety, and feelings of being in a mentalfog. The thyroid gland drives the production of many neurotransmitters that runthe brain, such as serotonin, dopamine, adrenaline, and noradrenaline. A lowthyroid can cause a compensatory rise in the adrenal hormones of adrenaline,which makes you feel wired, and cortisol, the hormone of stress. So people feeltired, wired, and stressed at the same time. In one group of patients with rapidcycling bipolar disorder, more than 50 percent had hypothyroidism. Expertsconservatively estimate that one-third of all depressions are directly relatedto thyroid imbalance. More than 80 percent of people with low-gradehypothyroidism have impaired memory function.Low thyroid is associated with a host of symptoms and problems, such as: • Feeling cold when others are hot • Weight gain • Constipation • Fatigue • High cholesterol • High blood pressure • Dry, thinning, or losing hair, especially the eyebrows, where theouter third are often missing • Dry skin • Dry eyes • Thin, cracking, or peeling nails • Menstrual irregularities • Endometriosis • Infertility • Recurrent miscarriages • Birth defects • Difficult menopauseEven if your thyroid is producing low-normal thyroid levels, you can still havesymptoms known as subclinical hypothyroidism. If you’re tired all the time, havegained weight, have dry skin, feel spacey, suffer from depression, feel cold allthe time, and have a body temperature that tends to be lower than 98.6, youcould have an underactive thyroid.An overactive thyroid, or hyperthyroidism, is also a problem, because noweverything in your body works too fast, including your heart, your bowels, andyour digestion. It’s like you’re in hyperdrive. You feel jittery and edgy, asthough you’ve had too much caffeine. If you suffer from sleeplessness, anxiety,irritability, racing thoughts, a fast pulse, breathlessness, weight loss despitean increased appetite, feeling too hot for no clear reason, and always feelingas though somebody set the thermostat too high, you could have an overactivethyroid. In extreme cases, you might see the classic systems of a goiter (agrowth on the thyroid), weight loss, bulging eyes, and an intense staring gaze.Your thyroid is a small butterfly-shaped gland located in your lower neck. Whenyour doctor runs her hands along the base of your throat, she’s checking to seeif there are any noticeable problems with the size of your thyroid. But youcan’t really tell what’s going on without a blood test. And it can take someadjusting to get your thyroid optimized. The main thyroid hormones—TSH, T3, andT4—all have to be in the right balance. It is estimated that tens of millions ofpeople worldwide (5–25 percent of the world’s population) have thyroid problems.Thyroid problems are more common as we age and they seem to be increasing in thepopulation. In their book, Thyroid Mind Power, Richard and Karilee Shames reportthat “the last 40 years have witnessed a massive increase in the amount ofhormone-disrupting synthetic chemicals, finding their way into our air, food andwater.… The most sensitive and highly susceptible of human tissues turned out tobe the thyroid gland.”Most thyroid issues are autoimmune, which means that the body is attackingitself. This can be due to the environmental toxins that are stored in ourbodies or allergies to the food we eat (gluten and milk products in particular)or to something in the air we breathe. Many physicians consider the thyroid tobe the “canary in the coal mine.” That is, the suspicion is that the recentskyrocketing rates of hypothyroidism may be related to ingested toxinsinterfering with the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3.Thyroid problems can occur at any time in a woman’s life. But having a baby isan especially vulnerable time. During pregnancy, certain parts of the immunesystem relax so that immune cells and antibodies will not reject the baby’splacenta, which is attached to the mother’s uterus. This is why many women withthyroid problems feel that pregnancy is the best time of their lives. Beingpregnant calms their thyroid issues. This happened to my wife, who has sufferedwith thyroid cancer and Hashimoto’s disease, an autoimmune disease that affectsthe thyroid. Like many women with thyroid issues, she said that she felt betterbeing pregnant than at any other time in her life.After nine months, the situation changes. The baby is delivered, the placentadetaches, and parts of the immune system that were turned down to prevent earlyrejection of the placenta are now turned back up with a surge. It is welldocumented that thyroid problems are very common within six months of givingbirth. According to researchers from Prague’s Charles University, 35 percent ofwomen who produce thyroid antibodies go on to have abnormal thyroid levels twoyears after giving birth.Having thyroid problems when you’re struggling with a two-year-old child is aprescription for disaster. Studies show that approximately 70 percent of womenwho were hypothyroid in the postpartum period were more careless, makingsignificantly more mistakes in the care of their babies than women whose thyroidfunction was normal.Nearly half of the women with postpartum hypothyroidism had significantnightmares compared to only 5 percent of women with normal thyroid function.Thyroid problems are a major cause of postpartum depression, anxiety, andpsychosis. In one study, 80–90 percent of postpartum depression was associatedwith thyroid abnormalities. And without effective thyroid treatment, it isimpossible to get well.Postpregnancy is not the only vulnerable time for thyroid issues. It has beenestimated that one in every four postmenopausal women has thyroid imbalances.According to Ridha Arem, M.D., editor of the journal Thyroid, nearly 45 percentof people over age fifty have some degree of thyroid gland inflammation. Dr.Arem suggests that minor thyroid problems cause more disability in the elderlypopulation than in the young, who have greater reserve. As we age, the thyroid,like many other active organs, becomes vulnerable to trouble.Checking your thyroid can be done with a blood test. Don’t settle for just a TSHtest, which only measures your thyroid-stimulating hormone. These levels can benormal even while you have an undiagnosed thyroid problem. Instead, if you haveany symptoms, insist your doctor order the following tests: • TSH (according to the American Association of ClinicalEndocrinologists, anything over 3.0 is abnormal and needs further investigation) • Free T3 (active) • Free T4 (inactive) • Thyroid antibodies ° Thyroid peroxidase antibodies ° Thyroglobulin antibodies • Liver function tests. Ninety-five percent of T4 is “activated” in theliver, so having a healthy liver is essential. • Ferritin level. Ferritin is like the bus that drives the active T3into the cells for the activity to occur. Ferritin needs to be above 90 for thisto occur.If your doctor refuses to order these tests, see someone else, or order themyourself at websites such as SaveOnLabs.com [http://SaveOnLabs.com].Consider Bernadette’s story:Hi Dr. Amen:I am a healthy, active thirty-two-year-old female who is very adamant on gettingmy yearly health and dental checkups, screenings and blood work. I have recentlylistened to (and read) Change Your Brain, Change Your Body, and I believewholeheartedly in your methods and helpful tips and tricks to stay well.I recently took your suggestion and had the more in-depth preliminary bloodtests done (thyroid, hormones, vitamins, etc.), even though I was questioned bymy doctor about why I wanted these ancillary tests when there was no apparentreason for conducting such research. I stated that I wanted to understand mynumbers more than just what is happening in my vascular system.Upon receiving the results of my blood work, I found that my “thyroglobulinantibodies” were high, indicating there was a problem. I immediately saw anendocrinologist, who did an ultrasound and found a 1.6 cm growth on my thyroid.The biopsy revealed I have papillary thyroid cancer, which has spread to mylymph nodes. If it hadn’t been for your advice, this issue may have goneundiagnosed for some time and worsened my prognosis. Without reading your book,I may not have had a chance to write this email.Thank you so much for what you do!Sincerely,Bernadette (get your important numbers checked!)Factors That Inhibit Thyroid • Excess stress and cortisol production • Selenium deficiency • Deficient protein, excess sugar • Chronic illness • Compromised liver or kidney function • Cadmium, mercury, lead toxicity • Herbicides, pesticides • Oral contraceptives, excessive estrogen productionIf you have thyroid issues, they can be effectively treated with a number ofthyroid medications. Your doctor needs to test your levels regularly to makesure you are not taking too much or too little. There are also a number ofnatural dietary supplements that support thyroid function, including the herbrosemary, zinc, chromium, potassium, iodine, L-tyrosine, vitamins A, B2, B3, B6,C, D, selenium, seaweed, and ashwagandha. Also, make sure to have healthytestosterone, insulin, and melatonin levels.Let me state clearly that while these thyroid tests can be helpful, in the finalanalysis your doctor, not the blood test, should diagnose you. I have seen toomany hypothyroid patients not treated by their physicians because their thyroidnumbers were low but “within normal limits.” It’s a little like saying a vitaminD level of 31 is normal (normal range is 30–100). I have never wanted to be atthe bottom of any class I was in. How a patient feels and functions (e.g.,energy, constipation, dry hair, dry skin, cognition, body temperature) is moreimportant in assessing thyroid function than just using arbitrary blood testnormal ranges.CORTISOL AND DHEA: OUR LADY OF PERPETUAL STRESSWe hear a lot of talk these days about adrenal fatigue, especially among womenwho are busy, stressed, and anxious. Is it possible for an organ to just wearitself out? Yes, it is. The adrenals are a pair of triangle-shaped glands thatsit on top of your kidneys, and they are critically involved in your body’sreaction to stress. The adrenals produce the hormones adrenaline, DHEA, andcortisol. Perhaps you’ve heard of the fight-or-flight response. It’s theadrenals that put you in one of these lifesaving modes by releasing thesechemicals.For example, suppose you’re hiking through the woods with your children when yousee a mountain lion; immediately your adrenals start producing adrenaline andthe other hormones you need to give you the burst of energy you can use toeither fight the lion or pick up the children and run away as fast as you can.The problem is, your body doesn’t really recognize the difference between onekind of stress and another. Whether it’s physical stress at the sight of thelion or mental stress caused by your raging teenager or catty co-workers, yourbody reacts the same way, pumping out those chemicals.When you run away from the lion, you process the chemicals and get them out ofyour system. But when you get stressed over the way your co-worker looked atyou, all you can do is go back to your office and stew. That leaves a dangerouscocktail of chemicals surging through your body until they’re finallymetabolized.In today’s world, you’re probably faced with that kind of psychological stresson a daily basis. You wake up to a blaring alarm, and the first thing you do ischeck your email to see what people are demanding of you now. Then it’s rushingoff to work, getting stopped in bumper-to-bumper traffic, and arriving late toface a slew of impossible deadlines. Then the school calls to tell you that yourson has been getting into fights. On and on it goes, causing your poor adrenalsto keep pumping out cortisol and other chemicals that your body doesn’t knowwhat to do with.Cortisol is made from progesterone. So if you make lots of cortisol,progesterone levels go down along with estrogen. Women could forever try tobalance out estrogen and progesterone, but without managing cortisol, they cannever get to a stable pattern of sex hormones. With elevations in cortisol,blood sugar and insulin levels also rise. And your brain doesn’t fare well.Serotonin (the “calming” brain chemical) levels drop, leading to anxiety,nervousness, or depression. Food cravings will also increase and your health canspiral out of control. Chronic exposure to stress hormones has been shown tokill cells in your hippocampus, one of the major memory centers in the brain,especially when DHEA is also low.This goes on for months and years, and finally the adrenal glands can just gettired. When they do, we call it adrenal fatigue, and now your body doesn’t havethe resources it needs to deal with all that daily stress. You can barely getout of bed in the morning or get yourself through the day.You could also be getting fat. Adrenal fatigue leads to an especially dangerousbuildup of fat in your abdomen. Not only do you ruin your chances for a flatbelly, but you’re at greater risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes too.Low cortisol also promotes inflammation, alters blood sugar control, affectsimmune function, and alters sex hormone production. When the adrenals are busymaking stress hormones, it depletes the reservoir of DHEA, which should haveeventually been converted to sex hormones.Doctors are seeing patients with adrenal fatigue more frequently lately, and abig reason is that so many of us are skimping on sleep. The human body needssleep, about seven to eight hours every night, and if it doesn’t get it, yoursystem automatically goes into a stress state. Then you self-medicate tocounteract the lack of sleep, and just make things worse. Drinking coffee orcaffeinated energy drinks to keep yourself awake adds to the stress load. Takingsome alcohol in the evening to quiet down after all that caffeine may be atemporary fix. But once the alcohol wears off, it puts your body into anotherstress response that wakes you up at two in the morning. Then you can’t sleepand you need more caffeine to meet the next day. Now you’re in a never-endingcycle of stress that exhausts your adrenal system and keeps you operating on theedge, and never at your best.How do you know if you might be suffering from adrenal fatigue? Here are somecommon symptoms: • Decreased ability to withstand stress • Morning and afternoon fatigue, lack of stamina • High blood pressure and rapid heartbeat • Abdominal fat that doesn’t go away no matter what you do • Mental fog with poor memory and difficulty concentrating • Low libido • Craving for sweets or salty foods • Hypoglycemic under stress • Dizziness when getting up from a sitting or lying position • Signs of premature aging • Lowered resistance to infection • Poor wound healingFrom Dr. Tami Meraglia, an integrative medicine physician in Seattle, who seesmany stressed-out women:My patients have an “aha” moment when I explain the difference between stress,lack of stress, and doing things that repair the damage and inflammation createdby stress. Most patients think that going home and “relaxing” is healing thestress from the day. It is not. That is merely the lack of stress, if you arelucky. My patients see results when they actively engage in activities like themeditation exercises on your online site to heal and rejuvenate the damage doneby the stress of that day. I remember asking my dentist when I was eleven yearsold if I had to floss all my teeth. He told me only the ones I wanted to keep. Ithink meditation is similar. Stress damages our health every day. You only needto meditate on the days that you want to heal that damage.To properly test for adrenal fatigue, you or your doctor can check your levelsof cortisol with a saliva test and DHEA-S with a blood test. Saliva cortisollevels should be measured four times during the day: when you first wake up,around lunchtime, around dinnertime, and just before you go to sleep. Ideally,your cortisol levels are high in the morning, to wake you up, and taper offslowly during the day and evening, allowing you to fall into a restful sleep atnight. When cortisol levels are too high, you feel wired. When they are too low,you feel exhausted, spacey, or sluggish.It’s possible to have cortisol levels that are too high for some portions of theday and too low for others. So a four-point test is needed to see what thesituation is.DHEA is a natural precursor hormone secreted by the adrenal glands, ovaries, andthe brain. It produces estrogen and, to a lesser extent, testosterone. DHEA alsoprotects brain cells from the beta-amyloid protein that is associated withAlzheimer’s. Studies show that higher levels of DHEA as you age are associatedwith longevity. Peak levels are typically reached when men and women are intheir thirties; they then begin to lose approximately 2 percent per year. Duringperiods of chronic stress, the release of the stress hormone cortisol candecrease levels of DHEA, lowering immunity and potentially accelerating theaging processes.Studies have found that DHEA therapy in women with adrenal fatigue can also helpboost a low libido during menopause. Low levels of DHEA have also been linked toweight gain and depression.One of the most important reasons to measure DHEA is that low levels incombination with high cortisol levels put you at risk for memory loss.Originally it was thought that high cortisol was the culprit in damaging thehippocampus, the brain’s major learning and memory center, but new studiesreport that people with Alzheimer’s have lower DHEA levels. When DHEA drops, theprotective effects of DHEA on the brain are lost.If your DHEA is low, it can be easily supplemented. There is good evidence thatvalidates DHEA supplementation to help support adrenal gland function, mood, andyour weight. Generally, we start with 10 mg and go up from there. DHEA isusually well tolerated, but there can be some unpleasant side effects like acneand facial hair owing to the tendency of DHEA to increase testosterone levels.These can be avoided by using a specific metabolite of DHEA called 7-Keto-DHEA.It is more expensive than simple DHEA, but it may be preferable in some cases.The dose of 7-Keto-DHEA is typically between 50 and 100 mg.A more serious concern with DHEA is that it partly converts itself into sexhormones like testosterone and estrogen. While this is actually a good thing forhealthy individuals who want to stave off aging, it can be a problem for womenwho have had hormone-dependent cancers, such as breast or ovarian cancers. Inthese cases, 7-Keto-DHEA can be a better solution. If you think DHEAsupplementation could be helpful to you, make sure to talk to a health careprofessional who is experienced in using hormone therapies.Natural supplements can also help. For example, B vitamins support the adrenalsystem and can help you deal with stress. 5-HTP is a calming supplement thatboosts serotonin levels and can support sleep, so that you feel less stress,which can also help with weight loss. Also, L-theanine (200 mg two or threetimes a day), Relora (750 mg two to three times a day), magnesium, holy basil(200–400 mg two to three times a day), ashwagandha (250 mg two to three times aday), and rhodiola (200 mg two to three times a day) have been shown to beuseful.Adrenal fatigue can also be helped by natural stress-management techniques, suchas laughter, deep breathing exercises, and regular relaxation exercises.Learning how to meditate, recognize, and correct negative thinking patterns(more on this in chapter 6 [Amen_9780307888969_epub_c06_r1.htm]), or useself-hypnosis can calm jittery nerves.INSULINHaving healthy insulin levels is one of the major keys to a clear mind and ahealthy female body. Insulin is a hormone that unlocks cell membranes so thatthey can absorb glucose and other nutrients. When insulin levels are high, thebody stores fat instead of breaking it down. Insulin is secreted by the pancreasin response to carbohydrates. Simple sugars and highly processed carbohydrates,such as baked goods, candy, bread, pasta, and crackers, demand a large releaseof insulin from the pancreas and can cause significant blood sugar highs andlows.Low blood sugar levels can make you feel foggy and sluggish. High blood sugarlevels, over time, are a disaster for your brain and body, causing blood vesselsto become brittle and easily broken. Insulin dysregulation can lead to diabetes,which harms every organ in the body and can lead to depression, dementia, and awide variety of illnesses. I have seen family members and friends with diabeteslose limbs and eyesight, and develop heart disease and dementia. You want tohave great respect for and optimize this hormone.Have your blood sugar and insulin levels tested, and if they are abnormal, thinkof it as a health crisis to take very seriously. Eliminating sugar and othersimple carbohydrates can help to regulate the body’s production of insulin andallow fat to be broken down for energy. In addition, high consumption of sugardepletes chromium, a mineral that is needed by insulin receptors. Withoutchromium, insulin receptors cannot recognize insulin. Sugar does not add anynutritional benefit to your diet but instead depletes chromium and othervaluable vitamins and minerals.Type 1 diabetes occurs when the body refuses to make insulin; type 2 occurs whenthe body mismanages it. Recently, scientists have reported new evidence linkingabnormal insulin levels to Alzheimer’s disease. The correlation is so strongthat some have labeled Alzheimer’s “type 3” diabetes. It was recently discoveredthat cells in the hippocampus actually produce insulin. The hippocampus is oneof the first areas in the brain to die in Alzheimer’s. Besides converting foodinto energy, the brain has other uses for insulin, including helping withlearning and making new memories. Brain cells have special receptors forinsulin, which it uses when making new memories. Insulin resistance in thesecells can cause a downward cognitive cycle. A 2009 study showed that givingintranasal insulin to people with mild cognitive impairment or early Alzheimer’shelped memory and attention and it helped to decrease the clumps of toxicchemicals thought to cause Alzheimer’s.Getting your insulin and blood sugar levels optimized will help not only yourwaistline but also your ability to learn and to remember your husband’s name.Fasting insulin and blood sugar levels, and HgA1c should be tested on a regularbasis.Diet Is Crucial in Insulin Regulation—To reverse insulin resistance, eliminateall simple sugars, wheat (including whole wheat), and processed foods and eat adiet high in smart carbohydrates (see this page[Amen_9780307888969_epub_c05_r1.htm#page152]), which are high in fiber and lowon the GI (glycemic index). Without the constant intake of simple sugars andhigh glycemic carbohydrates, the pancreas is not called upon to constantlysecrete high levels of insulin. Without these high levels of insulin, cellsbecome more insulin-sensitive. Eating fiber-rich whole grains can slow therelease of blood glucose and the rise of insulin, but until your blood sugar isunder control, it is better to eliminate them. A Swedish study compared theeffects on blood sugar of a grain-free diet (the Paleo diet) compared to theMediterranean diet, a diet that allows only whole grains, among other healthyfoods. After twelve weeks, the blood sugar rise was markedly lower in thePaleolithic group (–26%), whereas it barely changed in the Mediterranean group(–7%). At the end of the study, all patients in the Paleolithic group had normalblood glucose.Another reason whole grains may impact weight and insulin resistance is thatthey contain proteins called lectins, which some researchers suspect can promoteinflammation and halt weight-loss efforts. Aside from promoting weight loss andimproving blood sugar regulation, avoiding grains is very beneficial for overallintestinal health. Anti-inflammatory in nature, the Paleo diet promotes afavorable balance of good to bad bacteria in the gut. Many patients feel relieffrom minor digestive discomforts such as bloating, gas, and indigestion whenfollowing a low sugar, no-dairy, no-grain plan.Insulin resistance is closely related to metabolic syndrome, a cluster ofconditions—hypertension, high blood sugar levels, high cholesterol, and bellyfat—that together increase your risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.Adhering to a diet that includes only smart carbohydrates, healthy fats andproteins, and eliminates grains, potatoes, rice, sugar, and processed food isessential to reversing disease. Losing as little as 10 percent of your belly fatcan decrease cardiovascular risk by 75 percent.Managing Your Blood Sugar Is Critical to Looking and Feeling Young—Studies havefound that insulin resistance is a predictor of many age-related diseases. Onceinsulin is elevated, it can reduce the production of DHEA, which is needed tobuild sex hormones. And when insulin stimulates belly fat production, the fataccumulation can alter hormone function, by turning testosterone into toxicestrogens. Insulin resistance is also associated with inflammation.There is another way that insulin resistance can accelerate the aging process.It can lead to glycation—a process in which glucose reacts with protein in anundesirable way. This reaction results in sugar-damaged proteins (similar tobrowning food in the oven) appropriately called advanced glycation end products(AGEs). The formation of AGEs happens in everyone and is a major factor in theaging process itself. However, AGE formation is increased under the conditionsof hormonal imbalances, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance. AGEs may leadto premature signs of aging like wrinkles and brown spots and may eventuallylead to the development of type 2 diabetes, cataracts, macular degeneration,kidney disease, cardiovascular diseases, and even cancer.Insulin resistance can be improved with dietary changes and the use of dietarysupplements like magnesium, bitter melon extract, and chromium. The mineralmagnesium plays a critical role in carbohydrate metabolism and preventingmetabolic syndrome. Magnesium seems to influence the release and activity ofinsulin and helps balance glucose levels. Testosterone replacement has asignificant impact on improving blood sugar and reversing the trend towardinsulin resistance.BALANCING YOUR HORMONES NATURALLYAs I’ve suggested throughout this chapter, there are many well-established,natural steps you can take to balance your hormones. Here are three simple ones.1. Hormone Envy—As I mentioned in chapter 1[Amen_9780307888969_epub_c01_r1.htm], having brain envy is the first criticalstep to unleashing the power of the female brain. You have to care about thehealth of your brain. Likewise, to have a great brain, you have to care aboutthe health of your hormones. Make optimizing them a priority and your life willbe so much happier.2. Avoid Bad—To keep all of your hormones healthy, it is critical to avoidanything that hurts or diminishes them, such as synthetic chemicals, stress,processed food, high sugar, a bad-fat diet, wheat, a lack of sleep, cigarettes,excessive caffeine, more than a few glasses of alcohol a week, low vitamin Dlevels, obesity, inflammation, poor muscle tone, and a lack of exercise.Avoid toxins and toxic environments. Many of the chemicals and toxins we’reexposed to every day can have a disturbing effect on our health. For example,research shows that perfluorochemicals, the chemicals found in nonstick cookwareand some food packaging, are associated with endocrine disruption in women,leading to early menopause. The related chemicals perfluorooctanoic acid andperfluorooctane sulfonic acid are also found in cookware, stain guards, carpets,furniture, and paints. And chemicals like lead in your water can also beaffecting you. Plus, have you read the list of ingredients on some of those bodylotions? Or the cleaners used all over the house? Many natural products areavailable for you to use instead. Try to avoid toxic chemicals as best you can,and protect your daughters from them, as they have been associated with earlymenstruation.Don’t smoke. Of course the biggest environmental pollutant you should avoid iscigarette smoke. Recent research confirms that smoking lowers the age ofmenopause. It’s also associated with more severe hot flashes, specifically forits effects on sex hormone metabolism. Add to that the cardiovascular effectsand relationship to lung cancer and it’s impossible to ignore the truth: Smokingmakes you sick.Be careful with your weight. A study of Spanish women confirms the fact thatbeing obese adds to the severity of menopausal symptoms. Obesity is also relatedto diseases, such as diabetes. We’ve all heard (and perhaps seen firsthand) thatweight gain creeps up on us as we get older. Studies show that obesity,especially with visceral fat distribution, and mortality are directly related inmiddle-aged women. It may be that as women age and experience progressivedeclines in many hormones, such as the estrogens and DHEA, this leads to alteredbody composition and the associated weight gain. This, in turn, leads tometabolic disturbances and increased incidence of mortality.I know it’s hard to watch everything you eat when you’re feeling tired anddepressed. In chapter 5 [Amen_9780307888969_epub_c05_r1.htm], I will give you avery specific plan on how to feed your female brain to optimize your health. Eata brain-smart diet and you will look and feel younger and see results in aslittle as two weeks.Reduce inflammation. You may be suffering from chronic inflammation and not evenrealize it. Persistent exposure to free radicals from processed vegetable oilsin fried food, powdered coffee creamer, cookies, crackers, and all those otherprocessed foods we eat are one aggravating cause. Then there’s the exposure toheavy metals, pesticides, and other toxins in our environment. Or you could havea low-grade infection, the result of an old injury, root canal, or failure toget your teeth cleaned. Depending on your unique genetic makeup, the resultingchronic inflammation can lead to vascular disease, Alzheimer’s, diabetes,arthritis, bowel problems, and cancer.If you have chronic inflammation, now is the time to do everything you can toeliminate this dangerous condition. Clean up your diet and your environment.Take omega-3s and other anti-inflammatory oils, like olive oil. Stay away fromprocessed foods, additives, and artificial ingredients. Reduce your intake ofalcohol and caffeine. Don’t smoke. And find out if you have allergies to dairy,gluten, soy, nuts, and other reactive foods. Also, exercise and get plenty ofsleep. Don’t use the excuse that you don’t have the time. That’s an excuse thatcould be killing you.3. Do Good—Help keep your hormones in balance with physical exercise, includingweight training, appropriate sleep, a healthy diet, as described in chapter 5[Amen_9780307888969_epub_c05_r1.htm], and a clean environment.Exercise. Physical activity is important for helping you get through difficulttimes for a number of reasons. First, it raises levels of serotonin, theneurotransmitter that makes you feel good. Second, it improves your circulation.More blood to your brain makes you less foggy, and more blood to your sex organskeeps them functioning at their best. Third, it helps you control your weight byburning calories and suppressing your appetite, provided you don’t “reward”yourself after exercising with a cinnamon bun and double latte. Women have to becareful about that because they have been shown to increase their calorie intakeafter exercise, which undoes all the good of it. By the way, there’s beenfascinating research that indicates that yoga is an especially effectiveexercise at reducing menopausal symptoms like hot flashes and night sweats. Ifyou are in the earlier stages of adrenal distress, exercise can help you burnoff the anxiety and extra cortisol. But if you are in the “fatigued” stage, takeit easy. Women whose cortisol levels are too low shouldn’t push themselves toohard. In fact, I never recommend that my patients push themselves too hard.Consistent, reasonable exercise is the key.The regimen I give my patients is very simple. Walk like you’re running late forforty-five minutes four times a week. The faster you walk as you age, the lesslikely you are to die earlier. Also, lift light weights. The stronger you are asyou age, the less likely you are to get Alzheimer’s disease. In addition, weightlifting has been shown to boost testosterone levels. But do not hurt yourself orlet anyone else hurt you. If you are with a trainer who is yelling at you tolift heavier and heavier weights, fire him or her and get someone who isreasonable.Get enough sleep. You know that when you don’t get enough sleep you feel groggy,listless, and irritable. And that’s just what you see on the surface. Lack ofsleep affects your brain chemistry and has been shown to interfere withhippocampal-dependent memory, something you don’t need when you’re alreadysuffering from brain fog. Also, interesting new research indicates that REM(rapid eye movement sleep—the kind you have when you’re dreaming) is especiallyimportant for the health of the neural cytoskeleton, the structure supportingyour neurons. And lack of sleep has long been associated with weight gain. Aminimum of seven hours of sleep nightly seems to be the most effective amount.Eat a healthy diet. Eating a healthy diet is important at every stage of yourlife. But during menopause, in particular, you want your food to help you feelbetter, not put your body under additional strain. Stay away from processedfoods as much as possible and eat balanced meals, following the plan I sharewith you in chapter 5 [Amen_9780307888969_epub_c05_r1.htm].Keep your environment clean. Toxic chemicals are all around us, for example inthe toiletries we use on our own bodies and the cleaning solutions we applyaround our homes. Read labels and try to find less toxic alternatives whereveryou can.KEY VITAMINS, MINERALS, AND HERBS FOR HORMONE BALANCETo Support Multiple or All Hormones• Multiple vitamin• Fish oil (2,000 mg a day)• Probiotics for gut health to bind bad estrogens (10 billion–60 billioncolony-supporting units [CFUs])• Calcium citrate (400–500 mg twice a day) and chelated magnesium (200–300 mgtwice a day), to keep your nerves calm• Vitamin D (2,000 international units [IU] of vitamin D daily generally, butit’s important to get tested individually) to get the most benefit from calcium• Zinc for testosterone and thyroid (15 mg)• Melatonin (1–6 mg)• Selenium (200 µg)To Balance Estrogen• DIM (100–200 mg a day)• Calcium d-glucarate (500 mg a day)• Plant phytoestrogens, including black cohosh (20–80 mg twice daily)• Flaxseeds• Evening primrose oil (500 mg twice a day)• Black cohosh (20–80 mg twice a day)To Alleviate PMS• Calcium citrate (400–500 mg twice a day)• Chelated magnesium (200–300 mg twice a day)• Vitamin A, B complex with 50 mg of B6• Evening primrose oil (500 mg twice a day)• 5-HTP (50–100 mg twice a day) to help boost serotonin and decrease anxiety andworry• Green tea (600 mg twice a day) or L-tyrosine (500 mg two to three times a day)for focus• Vitex/chasteberry (20–40 mg a day to improve PMS symptoms; has aprogesterone-like effect)To Balance Testosterone• DHEA (depending on lab test)• Zinc (15 mg)• Saw palmetto to drive down high levels of testosteroneTo Balance Thyroid• Zinc (15 mg)• L-tyrosine (500 mg two to three times a day)• Herb rosemary• Chromium (100–400 µg/day)• Potassium• Iodine• Vitamins A, B2, B3, B6, C, D• Seaweed• Ashwagandha (250–500 mg once or twice a day)To Balance Cortisol• L-theanine (200 mg two or three times a day)• Holy basil (200–400 mg two to three times a day)• Relora (750 mg two to three times a day)• Ashwagandha (250 mg two to three times a day)• Rhodiola (200 mg two to three times a day)To Balance DHEA• DHEA (depending on lab test needs)• 7-Keto-DHEA (depending on lab test needs)To Balance Insulin• Chromium (100–400 µg/day)• Cinnamon• Bitter melonIt’s been said that your hormones make you who you are.

It is the mostexpensive real estate in your body. If you want your female brain and body tolive longer, look younger, be smarter, and feel happier, one of the mostimportant things to do is get your nutrition right. There is simply no wayaround it. You can exercise all you want, think all the right thoughts,meditate, and take dietary supplements, but if you continue to eat highlyprocessed foods laden with sugar, bad fats, and salt; made from ingredientsgrown with pesticides; flavored with artificial sweeteners; colored withartificial dyes; and preserved with artificial preservatives, there is just noway to keep your brain and body working at their peak. If your food is not thebest, you will never be your best. This chapter is about helping you eat rightto think right.In my experience, when you get your diet right, it has the potential to carryover to help other people in your family, community, place of worship, andworkplace. I have seen this happen repeatedly in my own practice and in my workwith corporations and churches.The typical Western diet, consisting on average of only fifteen different foodsthat contain an overabundance of bad fat, salt, and sugar—think cheeseburgers,fries, sodas, and candy bars—promotes inflammation and has been associated withdepression, ADD, dementia, heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and obesity. Thinkof what a cheeseburger consists of: a beef patty, lettuce, tomato, cheese,pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun (that’s two foods if you count the seedsseparately from the bun), plus mustard, mayonnaise, and ketchup, plus a servingof French fries and giant cola, and you’ve got twelve foods right there and, formany, a full day’s supply of fat, salt, and calories.If you start making better food choices today, you will quickly notice that youhave more energy, better focus, a better memory, better moods, and a flattertummy. A number of new studies have reported that a healthy diet is associatedwith significantly lower risks of Alzheimer’s disease and depression. Plus, whatreally surprises most women is that when they decide to get healthy, their foodoptions get better, not worse. It is the start of a wonderful new relationshipwith food.When it comes to food, so many people are like I used to be—a yo-yo. Crave badfood … overeat it … feel lousy … then hate yourself after the fact. It is waytoo much drama. When you decide to get healthy and get control of your food, youwill eat better than ever and it will affect everything in your life in apositive way.Tana has written several amazing cookbooks to help support our patients andreaders in their efforts to get healthy, and of course I get to try everythingfirst. I love her breakfast protein smoothies, which are loaded with vegetables;lentil soup; rack of lamb; and turkey bolognaise. I feel smarter when I eatfresh wild salmon, and I love her stuffed red bell peppers. I don’t want fast orpoor-quality food anymore because it makes me feel tired and stupid. I want theright foods that help me be at my smartest all the time, and I want that for youtoo. And, contrary to what most people think, eating in a brain-healthy way isnot more expensive; it is less expensive. Your medical bills will be lower andyour productivity will go way up. And what price can you put on feeling amazing?Moreover, eating in a healthy way is a sign of self-love. If you truly careabout yourself, how can you put poor-quality, health-damaging calories into yourbody that promote illness?Your mind-set here is critical. Ultimately, eating right is not aboutdeprivation; it is about abundance. You will realize that spoiling yourself, andgiving in to bad food cravings, is indeed spoiling your health and is definitelynot the sign of a rational mind.In this chapter, I am going to show you the Four Circles Approach to feeding thefemale brain. • Biology ° Nine rules of brain-healthy eating ° Fifty-two best brain-healthy superfoods ° How to manipulate your mind with food ° Foods to boost mood, focus, motivation, and memory ° How to heal your gut to boost your brain • Psychology ° Ways to make your thoughts around food helpful, instead of hurtful ° How to break the hurtful psychological food patterns from the past • Social Connections ° The health of the people with whom you eat significantly influencesyour longevity • Spiritual Health ° Honoring your food ° Respecting and replenishing food sources for generations to comeTHE FOUR CIRCLES APPROACH TO FEEDING THE FEMALE BRAINBIOLOGYAMEN CLINICS’ NINE RULES OF BRAIN-HEALTHY EATINGIf you are going to eat right to think right, it is critical to make sure yourfood is loaded with proper nutrients that your body is able to properly digest.Here are the nine rules we have refined and teach our patients at Amen Clinics.Rule 1. Eat “High-Quality Calories” but Not Too Many of Them—Don’t let anyonetell you that calories don’t count. They absolutely do. But it is not as simpleas calories in versus calories out. I want you to think about eating mostlyhigh-quality calories. One cinnamon roll can cost you 720 calories, and a smallquiche can be more than 1,000 calories and will drain your brain, whereas a400-calorie salad made of spinach, salmon, blueberries, apples, walnuts, and redbell peppers will supercharge your energy and make you smarter.I think of calories like money, and I hate wasting money. If you have a highmetabolism, like having a lot of money, you don’t have to worry much aboutcalories. If you have a low metabolism, which happens to a lot of us as we growolder, you have to be very wise in how you spend your calories.The research about calories is very clear. If you eat more calories than youneed, you will be fatter, sicker, and less productive. In one study, researchersfollowed a large group of rhesus monkeys for twenty years. The monkeys in onegroup ate all the food they wanted; those in another group ate 30 percent less.The monkeys that ate anything they wanted were three times more likely to sufferfrom cancer, heart disease, and diabetes; in addition, researchers sawsignificant shrinkage in the important decision-making areas of their brains.Further, the calorie-restricted monkeys had smoother skin and healthier hair.If weight is an issue for you, it is a smart idea to know how many calories aday you need to either maintain or lose weight. The average activefifty-year-old woman needs about 1,800 calories a day. You also need to know howmany calories a day you actually put in your body, just like you need to knowhow much money you spend. Overeating is the exact same thing as overspending.When you overeat you bankrupt your brain and your body. If weight is a problemfor you, keep a journal just like you keep a checkbook. Start the day with thenumber of calories you can spend and have a sense of where you are throughoutthe day. And don’t spend them all in one place! This strategy makes a hugedifference for my patients. When they actually write down everything they eatfor a month, it causes them to stop lying to themselves about their calories andovercome their “calorie amnesia.”In our online community (www.amensolution.com [http://www.amensolution.com]),there is a food journal to help you get started. Plus, in one of my favoritearticles titled “100 Ways to Leave Your Blubber,” we’ll show you how to cut yourcalories by 30 percent without feeling hungry.[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_024_r1.jpg]View “100 Ways to Leave Your Blubber.”Rule 2. Drink Plenty of Water and Avoid Liquid Calories—Your brain is 80 percentwater. Anything that dehydrates it, such as too much caffeine or alcohol,decreases your thinking and impairs your judgment. Make sure you get plenty ofwater every day.On a trip to New York City I saw a poster that read “Are You Pouring on thePounds … Don’t Drink Yourself Fat.” I thought it was brilliant. A study foundthat on average Americans drink 450 calories a day, twice as many as we didthirty years ago. Just adding the extra 225 calories a day will put 23 pounds offat a year on your body and most people tend not to count the calories theydrink. Did you know that some coffee drinks and some cocktails, such asmargaritas, can cost you more than 700 calories each? One very simple strategythat can help you lose a lot of weight is to eliminate most of the calories youdrink.My favorite drink is water mixed with a little lemon juice and a little bit ofthe natural sweetener stevia. It tastes like lemonade, so I feel like I’mspoiling myself, and it has virtually no calories. And many of my patients makespa water and really feel like they are spoiling themselves. Spa water is waterwith a few cucumber slices, lemons, or strawberries in it.Rule 3. Eat High-Quality Lean Protein Throughout the Day—Protein helps balanceyour blood sugar and provides the necessary building blocks for brain health.And it’s critically important throughout the aging process because it helps youmaintain your lean muscle mass, a real issue as we age. Great sources of proteininclude fish, skinless turkey or chicken, beans, raw nuts, and high-proteinvegetables such as broccoli and spinach. I use spinach instead of lettuce in mysalads for a huge nutrition boost. Protein powders can also be a good source,but read the labels. Many companies put a lot of sugar and other unhealthyingredients in their powders. It is important to start each day with protein toboost your focus and concentration skills. More on this in a bit.Rule 4. Eat Smart (Low-Glycemic, High-Fiber) Carbohydrates—Eat carbohydratesthat do not spike your blood sugar and that are also high in fiber, such asthose found in vegetables and fruits including blueberries and apples.Carbohydrates per se are not the enemy. They are essential to your life. But badcarbohydrates are the enemy. These are carbohydrates that have been stripped ofany nutritional value, such as simple sugars and refined carbohydrates. If youwant to live without cravings, eliminate them completely from your diet. I likethe saying “The whiter the bread, the faster you are dead.”Sugar is not your friend. Sugar increases inflammation in your body, increaseserratic brain cell firing, is addictive, and has been implicated in aggression.In a new study, children who were given sugar every day had a significantlyhigher risk for violence later in life. I don’t agree with the people who sayeverything in moderation. Cocaine or arsenic in moderation is not a good idea.The less sugar in your life, the better your life will be, period.Get to know the glycemic index. The glycemic index (GI) rates carbohydratesaccording to their effects on blood sugar. It is ranked on a scale from 1 to100-plus (glucose is 100) with the low-glycemic foods having a lower number(which means they do not spike your blood sugar, so they are generally healthierfor you) and the high-glycemic foods having a high number (which means theyquickly elevate your blood sugar, so they are generally not as healthy for you).In general, I like to stay with foods under 60.Eating a diet that is filled with low-glycemic foods will lower your bloodglucose levels, decrease cravings, and help with weight loss. The importantconcept to remember is that high blood sugar levels are bad for your bloodvessels, brain, and your waistline.However, you’ll want to be careful not to go only by the GI to choose yourfoods. Some low-glycemic foods aren’t healthy for you. For example, peanut M&M’shave a GI of 33, whereas steel-cut oatmeal has a GI of about 52. Does this meanthat it’s better for you to eat peanut M&M’s? No! Peanut M&M’s are loaded withsaturated fat, sugar, artificial food coloring, and other things that are notgood for your brain. Steel-cut oatmeal is a high-fiber food that helps regulateyour blood sugar for hours. Use your brain when choosing your food.In general, vegetables, fruits, legumes, and nuts are the best low-GI options. Adiet rich in whole, minimally processed low-GI foods not only helps you loseweight; it has also been found to help control diabetes, according to a 2010review of the scientific literature in the British Journal of Nutrition. Beaware, however, that some foods that sound healthy actually have a high GI. Forexample, some fruits like watermelon and pineapple have a high ranking. It iswise to consume more fruits on the low end of the spectrum. Similarly, somestarches like potatoes and some high-fiber products like whole wheat bread areon the high end of the list. Eating smaller portions of these foods, thinking ofthem more like a condiment, and combining them with lean proteins and healthyfats can reduce their impact on blood sugar levels.[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_025_r1.jpg]View the Glycemic Index of many foods.Choose high-fiber carbohydrates. High-fiber foods are one of your bestweight-loss weapons. Years of research have revealed that the more fiber youeat, the better for your health and weight. How does dietary fiber fight fat?First, it helps regulate the appetite hormone ghrelin, which tells your brainthat you are hungry. Ghrelin levels are often out of balance in people with ahigh BMI, so they always feel hungry, no matter how much they eat. New researchshows that high ghrelin levels not only make you feel hungrier, they alsoincrease the desire for high-calorie foods compared to low-calorie fare, so it’sa double whammy. But fiber can help. A 2009 study showed that eating a diet highin fiber helped balance ghrelin levels in overweight and obese people. This canturn off the constant hunger and reduce the appeal of high-calorie foods.Second, no matter how much you weigh, eating fiber-rich foods helps you feelfull longer, ensuring that you don’t get the munchies an hour after you eat.Third, fiber slows the absorption of food into the bloodstream, which helpsbalance your blood sugar. This can help you make better food choices and fightcravings later in the day. In fact, fiber takes so long to be digested by yourbody, a person eating a diet that provides 20–35 grams of fiber a day will burnan extra 150 calories a day and lose 16 extra pounds a year.These three things alone can go a long way in helping you avoid extra calories.Fiber-friendly foods boast a number of other health benefits as well, including: • Reducing cholesterol • Keeping your digestive tract moving • Reducing high blood pressure • Reducing the risk of cancerExperts recommend eating 25–35 grams of fiber a day, but research shows thatmost adults fall far short of that. So how can you boost your fiber intake? Eatmore high-fiber brain-healthy foods like fruits, vegetables, and legumes. Hereis a link to the fiber contents of some brain-healthy foods. Try to include someof the foods on this list at every meal or snack.[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_026_r1.jpg]View the fiber content of brain-healthy foods.Rule 5. Focus Your Diet on Healthy Fats—Fat is not the enemy. Good fats areessential to your health. The solid weight of your brain, after all the water isremoved, is 60 percent fat. When the medical establishment recommended we getfat out of our diets, we got fat. Bad fats are the enemy and you want toeliminate them, such as all trans fats. Did you know that certain fats that arefound in pizza, ice cream, and cheeseburgers fool the brain into ignoring thesignals that you should be full? No wonder I used to always eat two bowls of icecream and eight slices of pizza. Focus your diet on healthy fats, especiallythose that contain omega-3 fatty acids, found in foods like salmon, avocados,walnuts, and green leafy vegetables.High cholesterol levels are not good for your brain. A new study reports thatpeople who had high cholesterol levels in their forties have a higher risk ofgetting Alzheimer’s disease in their sixties and seventies. There is very goodscientific evidence that the B vitamin niacin helps lower cholesterol and raisethe level of HDL, the good cholesterol. Avocados and garlic can help as well.But don’t let your cholesterol levels go too low. Low cholesterol levels havebeen associated with both homicide and suicide. If I am at a party and someoneis bragging to me about their low cholesterol levels, I am always very nice tothat person.[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_027_r1.jpg]View a list of foods high in omega-3 fatty acids.Rule 6. Eat Natural Foods of Many Different Colors—This means you should eatfoods from all the colors of the rainbow, such as blueberries, pomegranates,yellow squash, and red bell peppers. This will boost the antioxidant levels inyour body and help keep your brain young. Of course, these rainbow colors do notinclude Skittles, jelly beans, or M&M’s.[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_028_r1.jpg]View a list of high-antioxidant foods.Rule 7. Cook with Brain-Healthy Herbs and Spices to Boost Your Brain—Here is alittle food for thought, literally. • Turmeric, found in curry, contains a chemical that has been shown todecrease the plaques in the brain thought to be responsible for Alzheimer’sdisease. • In three studies, a saffron extract was found to be as effective asantidepressant medication in treating people with major depression. • There is good scientific evidence that indicates rosemary, thyme, andsage help boost memory. • Cinnamon has been shown to help attention and balance blood sugar. Itis high in antioxidants and is a natural aphrodisiac. • Garlic and oregano boost blood flow to the brain. • Eat more ginger, cayenne, black pepper—the hot spicy taste comes fromgingerols, capsaicin, and piperine, compounds that boost metabolism and have anaphrodisiac effect.Rule 8. Make Sure Your Food Is as Clean as Possible—As much as possible, eatorganically grown foods, as pesticides used in commercial farming can accumulatein your brain and body, even though the levels in each food may be low. Also,eat meat that is hormone- and antibiotic-free; animals from which meat comesfrom should be free range and grass-fed. It is critical to know and understandwhat the foods you eat have eaten. In addition, eliminate food additives,preservatives, and artificial dyes and sweeteners. This means you must startreading the labels. If you do not know what is in something, do not eat it.Would you ever spend money on something if you did not know the cost of it? Ofcourse not. Now is the time to really get thoughtful and serious about the foodyou put in your body.Fourteen Foods with the Highest Levels of Pesticide Residues (Buy Organic) 1. Celery 2. Peaches 3.

Here are a couple of general rules to guideyou: (1) The larger the fish, the more mercury it may contain, so go for thesmaller varieties. (2) From the safe fish choices, eat a fairly wide variety offish, preferably those highest in omega-3s, like wild Alaskan salmon, anchovies,and Pacific halibut.[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_029_r1.jpg]View a list of eco-friendly fish.Rule 9. If You’re Having Trouble with Your Mood, Energy, Memory, Weight, BloodSugar, Blood Pressure, or Skin, Eliminate Any Foods That Might Be CausingTrouble, Especially Wheat and Any Other Gluten-Containing Grain or Food, Dairy,Soy, and Corn—Did you know that gluten can literally make some people crazy?There are scientific reports of people having psychotic episodes when they’reexposed to gluten, and when they eliminate wheat and other gluten sources (suchas barley, rye, spelt, imitation meats, soy sauce) from their diets, theirstomachs and their brains are better. One of my patients lost 30 pounds, and hermoodiness, eczema, and irritable bowel symptoms completely went away when shegot wheat out of her diet. Another one of my patients would become violentwhenever he ate MSG. When we scanned him on MSG, his brain changed into apattern more consistent with our aggressive patients.Autistic children and children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder(ADHD) often do better when we put them on elimination diets that get rid ofwheat, dairy, all the processed foods, food dyes, and additives.There are blood tests you can take to learn more about your sensitivities tofood.

Foodcan help you feel relaxed, happy, and focused, or downright dumb. How we feedourselves and our children in this country is backward.Generally, simple carbohydrates, such as those found in pancakes, waffles,muffins, bagels, or cereal, boost serotonin levels, which help us feel relaxed,calm, and less worried and motivated. Protein, found in meat, nuts, or eggs,boosts dopamine levels and helps us feel more driven, motivated, and focused.Yet many people eat simple carbs in the morning and have more protein-basedmeals at night.For example, it is very common to feed children (and ourselves) a breakfast ofdoughnuts, pancakes, waffles, sugary cereals, muffins, bagels, or toast, alongwith fruit juices (concentrated sugar). Then we ask our children to focus, whichcan cause real problems and make them look like they have ADD (attention deficitdisorder). These simple carbohydrate-based meals spike insulin, which can oftencause low blood sugar levels in a short period of time, causing brain fog. Inaddition, simple carbohydrates spike serotonin levels in the brain, so we feelhappier after the meal. The problem is that serotonin also can decrease ourability to get things done; it gives many people “don’t worry, be happy”attitude. Not exactly the best mind-set for school or work. Protein-based mealstend to do the opposite. They can boost dopamine levels in the brain, give usenergy, and help us focus.Therefore, it makes sense to eat a protein-rich meal at the start of the day—orat dinner if you still need to get work finished in the evening. If you want torelax in the evening and go to bed early, I recommend decreasing the protein andeating more healthy carbohydrate-rich foods.Often, when kids come home from school, parents give them a few cookies and asoda (a high- and simple-carbohydrate-based snack). Then they tell them to dotheir homework. Unfortunately, these parents have unwittingly diminished theirchildren’s ability to get their homework finished, and it causes a night ofstress for everyone.FOODS TO BOOST MOOD, FOCUS, MOTIVATION, AND MEMORYAs a reminder, serotonin is a neurotransmitter that helps soothe the brain. Itis intimately involved in sleep, mood regulation, appetite, and socialengagement. It helps decrease our worries and concerns. Based on research atMIT, foods rich in simple carbohydrates have been found to quickly boostserotonin. They cause a spike in insulin, which lowers most large amino acidswith the exception of tryptophan, the amino acid building block for serotonin,thereby decreasing the competition for tryptophan to get into the brain. This iswhy many people can become dependent on or even addicted to bread, pasta,potatoes, rice, and sugar. They use these as “mood foods” and feel more relaxedand less worried after they eat them. Unfortunately, because they boostserotonin, they can also lower PFC function and diminish a person’s internalbraking ability. I think this is precisely why restaurants serve bread andalcohol before a meal. If you consume them, you are much more likely to orderdessert.Brain-healthy foods that help to boost serotonin include smart carbohydratessuch as sweet potatoes, apples, blueberries, carrots, steel-cut oatmeal, andchickpeas. These cause a more gradual increase in serotonin. It is a myth thatfoods that contain high levels of tryptophan, such as turkey, actually raiseserotonin in the brain. Tryptophan is transported into the brain by a systemthat is geared toward larger protein molecules, and tryptophan, being smallerand less abundant, doesn’t compete well against the other proteins to get in thebrain. This is one of the main reasons that exercise helps people feel better.Exercise pushes the larger amino acids into your muscles and thereby decreasesthe competition for tryptophan to get into the brain. If you want to feelhappier, grab an apple and go for a walk.Dopamine is the neurotransmitter involved in motivation, emotional significance,relevance, focus, and pleasure. It helps you get things done. Protein generallyhelps boost dopamine levels, which is why if you need to focus, avoid sugar,bread, pasta, rice, and white potatoes. Foods that tend to increase dopamineinclude beef, poultry, fish, eggs, seeds (pumpkin and sesame), nuts (almonds andwalnuts), cheese, protein powders, and green tea. In addition, avocados and limabeans can help. Tyrosine is the amino acid building block for dopamine and isalso essential for thyroid function. Simple carbohydrates tend to depletedopamine.Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter involved with learning and memory. Liver,eggs, milk, salmon, and shrimp tend to boost these levels.HEAL YOUR GUT TO BOOST YOUR BRAINThe gut is often called the second brain. It is loaded with nervous tissue andis in direct communication with our big brain, which is why we get butterflieswhen excited or have loose bowels when upset. Anxiety, depression, stress, andgrief all express themselves with emotional pain (the brain) and quite oftengastrointestinal distress.Your gut is one of the most important organs for the health of your femalebrain. It is estimated that the gastrointestinal tract is loaded with about 100trillion microorganisms (bacteria, yeast, and others), about ten times the totalnumber of cells in the human body. To be healthy, the relationship of good bugsto bad bugs needs to be lopsided in the positive direction, around 85 percentgood guys to 15 percent bad guys. When it goes the other way and the bad bugsget a foothold, all sorts of physical and mental problems can arise. Keeping thegood and bad bugs in proper balance is essential to your mental health.There is new evidence that friendly gut bacteria actually deter invadingtroublemakers, such as E. coli, and help us withstand stress. If the friendlybugs are deficient, either from a poor diet that feeds yeast overgrowth (thinksugar) or through excessive use of antibiotics (even as far back as childhood)that killed the good bacteria, we are more likely to feel stressed. Disordersranging from ADD to autism in children, and depression to mental fogginess inadults, have been connected to intestinal bacteria imbalances that causeincreased gut permeability.The intestines provide an important barrier to bad bugs from the outside world.If they become too permeable, a condition referred to as leaky gut, inflammationand illness can be created throughout the body. Optimizing the “gut–brain axis”is critical to your mental health.Factors That Decrease Healthy Gut Bacteria • Medications (antibiotics, oral contraceptives, proton pump inhibitors,steroids, NSAIDs) • Refined sugar intake • Artificial sweeteners • Bactericidal chemicals in water • Pesticide residues in food • Alcohol • Physiological, emotional, and environmental stressors • Radiation • High-intensity exerciseThe greatest danger from antibiotics does not come from those prescribed by yourdoctor but rather from the foods you eat. The prevalence of antibiotics found inconventionally raised meats and vegetables have the potential to throw off thebalance of good to bad bacteria. It is estimated that 70 percent of the totalantibiotic use in the United States is for livestock. It is critical to focus oneating antibiotic-free, hormone-free meats from grass-fed, free-range animals.A FEW GOOD GERMS CAN BE GOOD FOR YOUAnimals raised in a germ-free environment show exaggerated responses topsychological stress. We all need the good bugs in our intestinal tract to boostour immune system, so be careful not to go overboard in keeping your childrenaway from the dirt. When researchers gave the animals probiotics (healthy bugs),their stress levels normalized.Stress, all by itself, decreases healthy gut flora. Early abandonment issues cancause increased stress, decreased healthy bacteria, and increased gutpermeability. When young rats were separated from their mothers, the layer ofcells that line the gut became more permeable, allowing bacteria from theintestine to pass through the bowel walls and stimulate immune cells to startattacking other organs. “In rats, it’s an adaptive response,” reports Dr. EmeranMayer from UCLA. “If they’re born into a stressful, hostile environment, natureprograms them to be more vigilant and stress responsive in their future life.”Dr. Mayer said that up to 70 percent of the patients he treats for chronic gutdisorders had experienced early childhood traumas like parents’ divorces,chronic illnesses, or parents’ deaths. “I think that what happens in early life,along with an individual’s genetic background, programs how a person willrespond to stress for the rest of his or her life.”TERESATeresa grew up in a single-parent home filled with stress. At the age of four,her uncle was murdered, and shortly thereafter her mother brought Teresa to thedoctor for gastrointestinal complaints. At age nine, Teresa started having panicattacks, especially when her mother came home late from work. As a teenager, shedeveloped bulimia, again with bad intestinal issues. Decreasing her stress,along with giving her probiotics to help boost the friendly bugs in her gut,made a positive difference for her physically and emotionally.In a recent study, Drs. A. Venket Rao and Alison Bested administered thirty-ninepatients with chronic fatigue syndrome either three doses of a probiotic(healthy bugs) a day or a placebo for two months. They found that 73 percent ofsubjects taking the probiotic experienced an increase in levels of good bacteriain the gut, which corresponded with a significant decrease in anxiety symptoms.The researchers found no significant change in anxiety for the placebo group.The researchers believed that probiotics “crowd out” the more toxic gut bacterialinked to depression and other mood disorders. Dr. Bested reported, “Thesubjects felt less anxious, calmer, better able to cope with their illness,sleeping better, had fewer heart palpitations, and less symptoms of anxiety.”What does this mean for you? Follow the brain-healthy food guidelines in thischapter carefully, especially by eliminating most of the simple sugars from yourdiet that feed the bad bugs. Focus on eating smart (low-glycemic, high-fiber)carbohydrates, which foster healthy flora. Also, consider taking a dailyprobiotic to give the good bugs a head start. Be careful with antibiotics. Ifyou’ve had to take a lot of them in the past, a probiotic and healthy dietbecomes even more important to the health of your brain.PSYCHOLOGYTo get your food under control, it is important to have the right thoughts andattitude about it. This is a critical mind shift to make. Being unhealthy oroverweight is a thinking disorder, as much as it is an eating disorder. Manywomen refuse to get well because they cannot stand the idea of deprivingthemselves.Once while I was doing consulting work for a large organization, the wife of theCEO told me that when we first introduced the brain-healthy program into theorganization, she told her husband she would rather get cancer than give upsugar. That was when she realized that she had a serious problem with sugar.Eating in a brain-healthy way is one of the strongest forms of self-love. If youtruly love and care for yourself, you’ll need to be diligent about putting onlyhealthy fuel inside your body. But it takes the right thoughts and attitudes tomake it happen. If you want to unleash the full power of your female brain, youhave to be a warrior for the health of your brain.GETTING YOUR THOUGHTS RIGHT ABOUT FOODHow you think dramatically affects how you feel and every decision you make. Andthe lies you tell yourself are one of the biggest factors that drive illness.Here are some of the common “little lies” I hear about food. • “I don’t want to deprive myself.” Doesn’t eating bad food deprive youof your health, your most precious resource? What is worth more—energy, a trimwaistline, and health, or the mountain of fries, sodas, cakes, cookies, and thelike you have consumed over the last decade? • “I can’t eat healthy because I travel.” I am always amused by thisone, because I travel a lot. It just takes a little forethought and planning. • “My whole family is overweight, so it’s in my genes.” This is one ofthe biggest lies. Genes account for only 20–30 percent of your health. The vastmajority of health problems are driven by the bad decisions you make. My genessay I’m likely to be fat, but I make the decisions to ensure that it will beless likely to happen. • “I can’t afford to get healthy.” Being sick is always more expensivethan getting healthy. • “I can’t find the time to work out.” With a sharper mind that comesfrom exercising, you will find that working out ultimately saves you time. • “Not today—it’s Easter, Memorial Day, Fourth of July, Labor Day,Thanksgiving, Christmas, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday,or Sunday.” There is always an excuse to hurt yourself.When you stop believing every thought you have, the quality of your decisionsand your health will go way up. So what are the lies you are telling yourselfabout food? Write them down now. In the next chapter, I’ll teach ways to talkback to them.HOW TO BREAK THE HURTFUL PSYCHOLOGICALFOOD PATTERNS FROM THE PASTIn a therapy session, Nancy-Lynn, a fifty-five-year-old woman who was working ongetting healthy, told me she felt sad because she would not be able to bake withher grandchildren. The time spent baking cookies, brownies, and cakes with hergrandmother was one of the most treasured parts of her childhood. As I listened,I could see the patterns from the past and negative thinking trying to hijackher brain and progress.“Let’s play this out,” I said. “You are feeling sad because it is not in yourbest interest to bake cookies with your granddaughters?”“Yes,” she replied.“Why would you not bake cookies with them?”“Well, for one, it would ruin my program. The smell of freshly baked cookies istoo much too resist.”“Any other reason?”“If I bake cookies with them, I am planting the seeds of illness in their minds,like my grandmother unknowingly did to me. Cookies and other baked goodies aremood foods for me. They totally remind me of my grandmother’s love.”With a smile I replied, “I suppose if you don’t bake cookies or cakes or othertoxic foods with them, then there is no other option for spending high-qualitytime with them?”“Dr. Amen, that is one of the dumbest things I have ever heard you say. Ofcourse, there are other things I can do with them. Actually, I am sitting herethinking I can teach them how to cook in healthy ways. They can help me makegreat smoothies, salads, guacamole, veggie trays, and low-glycemic fruit plates.I can give them a legacy of health that they can do with their grandchildren,and that way they won’t have these toxic, stupid thoughts.”My patients often say the smartest things. I just have to ask the rightquestions. Observe the patterns from your past that you are having troubleletting go of. Do they serve you or do they hurt you? Nancy-Lynn’s patternclearly was not only hurting her but also those she loved most.SOCIAL CONNECTIONSPreparing meals and feeding families is an important social activity. BeingLebanese, I know about this firsthand. We are known for great-tastingMediterranean food. It can be incredibly healthy (think hummus, tabouleh, andgrilled fish or lamb); or incredibly unhealthy (think butter cookies andbaklava). Throughout my life, it has been common for my mother, wife, aunts,sisters, daughters, and nieces to be in the kitchen together cooking greatmeals. When the mother leads the brain-health charge, she has a huge influenceon those who follow. The earlier you start, the better.Social ties are so strong that researchers have found that the health of ourfamily and friends is one of the strongest predictors of longevity. In 1921,Stanford psychologist Lewis Terman evaluated 1,548 ten-year-old children. He andsubsequent researchers then followed this group over the next ninety yearslooking for the traits that were associated with success, health, and longevity.One of the main findings of the research was that social relationships had adramatic impact on health. If your friends and family were unhealthy, you weremuch more likely to be like them. For people who want to improve their health,associating with other healthy people is usually the strongest and most directpath to change.This does not mean you have to give up all of your friends and family who arestruggling with their health; share this program with them and offer to do ittogether.Right now, I want you to think of the people you love most in this world. Whomdo you call when something good—or bad—happens? I call my wife, my parents, andmy children. For each of these people, ask yourself, “Am I their friend or theiraccomplice?” A friend is someone who helps their loved ones be successful; anaccomplice is someone who helps them maintain their bad habits. • “Oh, come on, it will be fine—it’s just one time.” • “I cooked for you all weekend. Have more.” • “Don’t be a party pooper.” • “It’s the weekend—you’ve worked hard, so you’ve earned it.”Are you helping those you love prevent devastating illnesses like Alzheimer’sand depression? Or are you unknowingly encouraging them to be sick? You can leadthe change in your family.SPIRITUAL HEALTH (SOUL FOOD)Your sense of spirituality underlies everything you do. As we have discussed, itis the fuel that provides your life with a deep sense of meaning, passion, andpurpose; it is your connection to God, past generations, future generations, andthe future of our planet. In regard to food, ask yourself, “What is theunderlying meaning and purpose for the food I eat and feed my family? Is it justfor basic nutrition? For pleasure? Fellowship? Is it to sustain my life so I canaccomplish why I am here on Earth?” If your life has meaning and purpose, it isbest served by a highly nutritious diet that nourishes your brain, body, andsoul.When I was first asked to be a consultant for the Daniel Plan, SaddlebackChurch’s plan for using religious organizations to get the world healthy, PastorRick Warren talked about the biblical directive to honor our bodies: “Do you notknow that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you havereceived from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Thereforehonor God with your body” (1 Cor. 6:19–20). The way many people eat isdefinitely not honoring their bodies.I like to use the acronym SOUL food to describe how to eat in a spiritual way.It stands for: • Sustainable. We can continue to grow the food indefinitely withouthurting our planet. • Organic. Our food is raised in a clean environment without toxins. • Unadulterated. We eat pure whole foods, without artificial food dyes,sweeteners, or additives. • Locally grown. Our food is fresh, and we can support our localcommunity by purchasing it.From a spiritual standpoint, think about how the food you ingest was raised. Ifyou eat meat, make it a point to know what the animals were fed, because you arealso consuming what they ate. Also, think about how the animals were raised andharvested. Is it humane? Would it make you sick if you knew? If you think ofeating as a spiritual discipline, these are essential questions.One thought that has concerned me for a long time is how animals are raised andharvested. Animals, like humans, release different chemicals in their bodieswhen they feel relaxed or stressed, happy or depressed, approachable or angry.If they are raised and then killed in a confined, toxic environment in whichthey feel stressed, angry, and depressed, then ultimately we are consuming thechemicals the animals released when they were stressed, angry, and depressed.How your food was treated matters to the health of your body.Eating as a spiritual discipline will help you not only give thanks for the foodyou have but also take a much more thoughtful approach to raising, harvesting,and consuming it.Hour 5 Exercise—Provide Therapy for Your KitchenJust as therapists explore the cabinets of your mind and help to clean them ofthe toxic memories, I want you to take an hour to remove any unhealthy or toxicfood from your kitchen. Refer to the nine rules of brain-healthy eating outlinedin this chapter. If the food doesn’t serve your health, get rid of it. Don’tdonate it to the poor. It will make them sick as well.[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_031_r1.jpg]View a video of Tana and me cleaning out the kitchen cabinets.[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_032_r1.jpg]View a video of Tana and Dr. Hyman on how to shop for food."},{"pageContent":"6SOOTHE THE FEMALE BRAIN[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_L02_r1.jpg]PUT AN END TO ANXIETY, WORRY,DEPRESSION, AND PERFECTIONISM[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_L03_r1.jpg]Calming and soothing your brain is the sixth step to unleashing the power of thefemale brain.[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_L03_r1.jpg]My mind perched on top of my head like a spider monkey and thought of morethings that could go wrong.…My mind is my main problem almost all of the time. I wish I could leave it inthe fridge when I go out, but it likes to come with me.—ANNE LAMOTTAs discussed earlier, your female brain has many unique strengths, includingintuition, empathy, collaboration, self-control, and a tendency to worry alittle. But it is also important to recognize that it has some specificvulnerabilities. Consider the following facts: • Females produce less serotonin than men, up to 52 percent according toone study. Although this likely helps them avoid the “don’t worry, be happy”mind-set that gets many men in trouble, it can also set up women to have moreproblems with anxiety, depression, and worry. • Estrogen inhibits the neurotransmitter GABA, which helps calm yourbrain, making females more likely to struggle with anxiety. • Testosterone boosts GABA, which can lead males to feel less anxiety.When testosterone levels are high, in men or women with PCOS, it can lead to lowlevels of anxiety and high-risk-taking behaviors. • When female mice are given testosterone as adolescents, they are lesslikely to have depression as adults. This implies that adolescent girls shoulddecrease their sugar intake (which lowers testosterone) and lift light weightsto boost testosterone levels. • Women, because of lower serotonin levels, have busier brains, and theyare more vulnerable to depression. Across many nations, cultures, andethnicities, women are about twice as likely as men to be diagnosed withdepression. The lifetime incidence of major depression is 21.3 percent in women;it is 12.7 percent in men. • Some researchers, however, believe that men experience depression indifferent ways than women, so they are not appropriately diagnosed. Instead ofsadness, a man’s depression is more likely to show up as anger, irritability,and recklessness. Plus, they are much less likely to seek help. A 2008 journalarticle titled “Women Seek Help, Men Die” highlights that men are four timesmore likely to kill themselves than women are. Seeking help is the strength ofthe female brain. • Women respond better to a class of antidepressants called SSRIs. • SSRIs do not work nearly as well in men, or when estrogen is notpresent in women, such as before puberty and after menopause. • Men and postmenopausal women do better on more stimulatingantidepressants, such as imipramine or buproprion. • Over their lifetimes, women experience more major emotional traumas,particularly sexual abuse, than do men. • With increased stress and trauma, women are more likely to develop aheightened stress response, which is worsened during times of hormonalfluctuations (e.g., premenstrual, after delivering a baby, and during thetransition phase to menopause). • Anxiety disorders, including panic disorder, PTSD, social phobia, andgeneralized anxiety disorder, are more common in women. • PTSD and substance abuse occur more commonly together in women.Getting sober may make PTSD symptoms worse in some women, as they lose theirform of self-medication. • Eating disorders are much more common in females than males. • Addictions often progress more rapidly in women. Women are moresensitive to the euphoric effects of stimulants, such as amphetamine andcocaine. • Female intelligence is more centralized in the brain’s frontal lobes.Therefore, injuries to the frontal lobe can be more detrimental to cognitiveperformance in women than they are in men. • Some studies report that Alzheimer’s disease disproportionatelyaffects women.This chapter will help you develop a plan to overcome these vulnerabilities andhelp you feel better overall.During the 2012 NBA playoffs, Tana and I went to a Lakers game. At half-time,there was a female Chinese performer who was amazing. The Staples Center wasdark, except for a large spotlight on her. With long, jet-black hair and asparkling white pantsuit and hat, she rode out to center court on a unicycle.Her assistant put a white bowl upside down on her right foot, which she promptlyflipped onto her head.“Wow,” I thought. “That takes skill.”There was mild applause from the distracted crowd, waiting for the game toresume. The assistant then placed two bowls on her left foot, and she did thesame thing. Now she was balancing three bowls on her head. There was moreapplause and people were a bit more attentive. Then the assistant put threebowls in her right foot, and seemingly without any effort she flipped them ontothe other three bowls on her head.“My goodness,” I thought.Then the assistant placed four bowls on her left foot, and again she flipped allfour bowls onto the other six. Ten bowls were now balanced on her head. Thecrowd roared with approval and were much more focused on the woman on theunicycle. Then the assistant put five bowls on each of her feet.“No way,” I said to Tana.Yet she flipped the five bowls on one foot onto her head and then the other fivebowls from the other foot. Now she was balancing twenty bowls on her head. Thecrowd jumped up and gave her a standing ovation, and she bowed, giving alltwenty bowls to her assistant.As I watched this amazing performance, I marveled at this woman’s mastery. Howmany years of practice had gone into her ability to turn her body into aninstrument of such skill? How much discipline was required to balance theunicycle and the bowls, where one wrong move might mean a dangerous fall or aserious injury? Her movements required physical control, yes, but they alsorepresented years of mental and emotional control.You are capable of this kind of emotional discipline and mastery. As we saw inchapter 2 [Amen_9780307888969_epub_c02_r1.htm], a woman’s busy brain can be areal advantage in many circumstances. But it can also lead you to feeloverwhelmed by worries, sorrow, and stubborn thoughts you can’t dismiss. Panicattacks, stress, suffering, and depression may be lessened or even completelyresolved by learning specific techniques to train and discipline your brain.Monkey mind is a Buddhist term for thoughts that run wild inside your skull.Here I will give you a clear road map to tame your “monkey mind”; soothe youractive brain; and decrease your risk of anxiety, depression, and eatingdisorders. Ultimately, they are all thinking disorders.In my work with women, I have seen many apply the same kind of discipline andmastery to their mind as this performer applied to her body and achieve amazingresults. Yes, it takes some consistent work, just as the performer had to do toachieve her amazing result. If you’re going to be competent at anything, toachieve either physical or mental mastery, you have to practice. Yet the rewardsare great.Studies report that cognitive therapy—learning how to discipline your mind—is aseffective as, or in some studies even more effective than, antidepressantmedications for anxiety, depression, and eating disorders. Better still, thereare no bad side effects. Calm, clarity, flexibility, and a vastly improved moodare the immediate rewards for soothing your brain. Long-term results include asense of calm, empowerment, and self-control.MONKEY MIND UNLEASHEDYou feel fat after eating too much, hate yourself, and make yourself throwup—and then hate yourself more.Your boyfriend doesn’t call when you expect him to, and you begin to worry thathe’s cheating on you or that he doesn’t love you anymore. When he does call, youstart to yell at him before he can explain what happened.Your husband forgets your birthday and your anniversary, and you feel sad,neglected, and lonelier than you ever thought possible. When he comes home, youjust ignore him, even though he asks again and again what you are upset about.Your kids need to be picked up, your boss needs you to stay late for a newdeadline, and your sister needs help with the family dinner she’s planning. Youfeel frantic about getting everything done and making sure everyone’s okay. Yourheart is racing and you start to have diarrhea.You think you are going to have a panic attack at the grocery store. Youvisualize fainting and the ambulance coming to take you to the hospital. Withoutprocessing the thought, you just leave your basket full of groceries and drivehome.Your widowed mother is getting older, and you are concerned that she can’t livealone much longer. You start to feel overwhelmed with sadness.Your sixteen-year-old daughter is just starting to date, and you worry about hermaking the same mistakes you made. Then you start to become very worried andforbid her from dating altogether, over her father’s objections, which causes abig blowup.You are single and worry that you will never find love, or perhaps you’re in arelationship and feeling sad because it doesn’t seem to be moving toward thecommitment you would ideally like. You begin to feel frantic and upset duringlarge chunks of the day.You want to get healthy, but you hate the idea of giving up cake and cookies.You don’t want to feel deprived. You feel sad and stuck either way you think,because you know you cannot get healthy eating them.Often you feel that if you can’t do everything right, you are a total failureand should just give up, but you can’t give up, because too many people arecounting on you.Sometimes it feels like your mind is truly out of control.Does any of this sound familiar? If so, you’re not alone.THE FOUR CIRCLES APPROACH TO DISCIPLINING YOUR MINDTo soothe your brain you need to get control over and discipline your mind. Aswe will see, you will have to turn your brain on in order to turn it off.Optimizing the four circles is the foundation of disciplining your mind.BIOLOGYTo soothe your mind, it is critical to avoid anything that hurts your brain andto engage in regular brain-healthy habits. Also, make sure to get your importantnumbers and labs checked. If your thyroid, progesterone, or gut flora levels areoff, the monkey-mind thoughts will screech wildly through the recesses of yourbrain. No amount of mental discipline will be fully effective.In addition, it is critical to keep your blood sugar stable and to make sure youget at least seven hours of sleep each night. Low blood sugar levels or a lackof sleep are both associated with lower overall blood flow to the brain, whichresults in bad decision making and an inability to inhibit the thoughts thattorture you. The PFC of the human brain serves in large part an inhibitoryfunction. It helps to settle down your emotional brain. When the frontal lobesare low in activity or blood flow, they cannot quiet the noisy thoughts; as aresult, you suffer. This is why it is also important treat ADD, which is oftenassociated with low PFC activity (more on this in chapter 8[Amen_9780307888969_epub_c08_r1.htm]), and to rehabilitate any past braininjuries that affected the PFC.KNOW YOUR BRAIN TYPEAmong other things, my brain imaging work has taught me that knowing about yourown specific brain type is critical to soothing your mind. Not everyone has thesame brain.When I first started to do our brain imaging work at Amen Clinics in 1991, I waslooking for the one pattern that was associated with anxiety, depression,addictions, or ADD. But I soon discovered there was clearly not one brainpattern associated with any of these illnesses. They all had multiple types. Ofcourse, I then realized that there would never be just one pattern fordepression, because not all depressed people are the same. Some are withdrawn;others are angry; still others are anxious or obsessive.The scans helped me understand the type of anxiety, depression, ADD, obesity, oraddiction a person had, so I could better target treatment to individual brains.This one idea led to a dramatic breakthrough in my own personal effectivenesswith patients, and it opened up a new world of understanding and hope for thetens of thousands of people who have come to Amen Clinics and the millions ofpeople who have read my books. In previous books, I have written about six typesof ADD, seven types of anxiety and depression, six types of addictions, and fivetypes of overeaters. Understanding these types is critical to getting the righthelp.Let me briefly review five of the brain types most important to soothing thefemale brain.Brain Type 1: Impulsive—People with an impulsive brain type have poor impulsecontrol, get distracted easily, and have trouble not saying or doing whatevercomes into their minds. Typically the SPECT scans show low activity in the PFC.Think of the PFC as the brain’s brake. It stops us from saying stupid things ormaking bad decisions. It is the little voice in your head that helps you decidebetween the banana and the banana split. The impulsive brain type is commonamong people who have ADD, which has been associated with low dopamine levels inthe brain. People with ADD struggle with a short attention span,distractibility, disorganization, restlessness, and impulsivity. Thinkhyperactive monkey thoughts here. Without boosting the PFC, it is nearlyimpossible to get the monkeys under control.My research team and I have published several studies showing that when peoplewith the impulsive brain type try to concentrate, they actually get lessactivity in the PFC, which will cause them to have even less control over theirown behavior. For these people, literally, the harder they try to lose weightthe worse it gets. Smokers and heavy coffee drinkers also tend to fit this type.This type is best helped by boosting dopamine levels in the brain to strengthenthe PFC. Higher-protein, lower-carbohydrate diets tend to help, as does exerciseand certain stimulating supplements, such as green tea, rhodiola, ginseng, orL-tyrosine, or stimulants like Adderall or Concerta. In general, I am verycautious with medications, and they are usually not my first choice. Anysupplement or medicine that calms the brain, such as 5-HTP or SSRIs, usuallymakes this type worse, because they lower PFC function and take the brakes offthe brain. I have treated dozens of women who had done things that they laterregretted, such as becoming hypersexual or spending money they did not have,when they were put on SSRIs. It turned out they had low activity in the PFC, andthe serotonin-boosting medications diminished the judgment part of their brains.Brain Type 2: Compulsive—People with a compulsive brain type tend to get stuckon negative thoughts or negative behaviors. They tend to worry and have troublesleeping. In addition, they tend to be argumentative and oppositional and holdgrudges from the past. People with this brain type generally have too muchactivity in the front part of the brain, in an area of the brain called theanterior cingulate gyrus, which functions as the brain’s gear shifter. It getssticky when there are low levels of a chemical called serotonin. When it isoveractive, people can get stuck on the same thought. It is like having a littlemouse on an exercise wheel in your head, and the mouse cannot get off. Thoughtstend to circle over and over and over.Because caffeine and diet pills are stimulants, they tend to make this typeworse, because this brain type does NOT need more stimulation, and women whohave this type feel as though they may need a glass (or two or three) of wine atnight to calm their worries. This type is associated with anxiety anddepression. I have also seen it commonly in my patients with anorexia andobsessive-compulsive disorder.The best strategy for calming this brain type is to find natural ways to boostserotonin, which is calming to the brain. Physical exercise boosts serotonin asdo certain supplements, such as 5-HTP, inositol, saffron, and St. John’s Wort.Medications that boost serotonin include the SSRIs, such as Prozac, Zoloft,Lexapro, Celexa, and Paxil.Simple carbohydrates also increase serotonin, which is why many women becomeaddicted to simple carbs like bread, pasta, and sugar. These are mood foods andare often used to self-medicate an underlying mood issue. Avoid these quickfixes as they help only in the short term but can cause long-term trouble.Brain Type 3: Impulsive-Compulsive—On the surface, this brain type seems almostcontradictory. How can someone be both impulsive and compulsive at the sametime? Think of bulimia. People with an impulsive-compulsive brain type arecompulsively driven to binge on food that is not healthy for them and yet havevery little control over their impulses to binge or purge. It is the same withthis type. Our scans tend to show too much activity in the anterior cingulategyrus, the part of the brain that helps shift attention, so people overthink andget stuck on negative thoughts, but they also have too little activity in thePFC or impulsive control area, which means they have trouble supervising theirown behavior.In my experience, the impulsive-compulsive type is common among the children andgrandchildren of alcoholics.People with this type benefit from treatments that increase both serotonin anddopamine, such as exercise with a combination of supplements like 5-HTP andgreen tea, or medications such as Prozac and Adderall. Using 5-HTP or green teaalone would make people with this type of brain worse.Brain Type 4: Sad—The sad brain type is associated with frequent feelings ofsadness, depression, low energy, low self-esteem, and pain symptoms. The SPECTscans tend to show too much activity in the limbic or emotional parts of thebrain, which is common in mood disorders. For this type, boosting vitamin D canhelp, as can exercise, fish oil, supplements such as SAMe(S-adenosylmethionine), and medications such as Wellbutrin.When women complain of depression to their primary care physicians, they arecommonly prescribed an SSRI such as Prozac or Lexapro. In large-scale studies,these medications have as much chance of working as a placebo. The problem isnot that these are not good medications; it is that depression is not any onekind, and one treatment will never work for all types of depression. In the sadbrain type, the SSRIs tend to work if these women are also compulsive oroverfocused. Absent those symptoms, however, these medications often make thingsworse.Brain Type 5: Anxious—Anxiety, tension, nervousness, conflict avoidance, and atendency to predict the worst are hallmarks of this anxious brain type. OnSPECT, we often see too much activity in an area of the brain called the basalganglia. This part of the brain is involved in setting a person’s anxiety level.When there is too much activity here, owing to low levels of a chemical calledGABA, people often have anxiety and a lot of physical tension.Soothing this type with meditation and hypnosis, plus using a combination of B6,magnesium, and GABA, our patients generally feel more relaxed and more incontrol of their minds. I avoid typical antianxiety medications, such as Xanaxor Valium, as they have caused problems with addictions. If I need to usemedications, I typically prescribe an anticonvulsant such as Neurontin to calmdown excessive brain activity.It is common to have more than one brain type. If that is true for you, work onthe most bothersome brain type first and then move on to the others.PSYCHOLOGYQuieting and soothing your mind requires more than sleep, good blood sugar,probiotics, and targeted supplements for your brain type. It also requirespracticing the habits of mental discipline and learning how to be honest withyourself. To help patients develop a disciplined mind, Amen Clinics often teachthe following psychological strategies: killing the ANTs, engaging in “theWork,” and practicing hypnosis and meditation.KILLING THE ANTSOne of the techniques that is the mainstay of helping our patients at AmenClinics is what I call ANT therapy, or learning how to kill the AutomaticNegative Thoughts that you feel you have no control over. Learning how to notbelieve every stupid thought you have is a critical skill to ending theunnecessary suffering experienced by so many women. ANTs pop up in your brainautomatically, seemingly out of nowhere, and when left unchallenged, they bite,nibble, torture, and infest your mind. When ANTs are left unchecked, they stealyour happiness and literally make you feel old, fat, depressed, andfeebleminded.The following exercise to kill ANTs is so simple that you may have troublebelieving how powerful it is, but I have seen it change many people’s lives,including my own. Your suffering diminishes, and your health and happinessimprove. A number of research studies have found this technique to be aseffective and as powerful as antidepressant medication for anxiety, depression,and eating disorders.ANT Therapy Directions 1. Whenever you feel sad, mad, nervous, or out of control, draw twolines vertically down a piece of paper, dividing it into three columns. 2. In the first column, write down the ANTs going through your mind. 3. In the second column, identify the type of ANT or negative thought.Therapists typically describe nine different types of ANTs (see the table onthis page). 4. In the third column, talk back, correct, and eradicate the ANTs. Ifyou were anything like me, you were good at talking back to your parents whenyou were a teenager. In the same way, you need to learn to be good at talkingback to the lies you tell yourself.ANTI will never be happy again.ANT TypeFortune-tellingANT KillingI am sad now, but I will feel better soon.ANTI am a failure.ANT TypeLabelingANT KillingI have succeeded at many things.ANTIt is your fault!ANT TypeBlameANT KillingI need to look at my part in the problem.ANTI should have done better.ANT TypeGuilt beatingANT KillingI will learn from my mistakes and do better next time.ANTI am old.ANT TypeLabelingANT KillingBy working this program I can feel younger every day.In our online community (www.amensolution.com [http://www.amensolution.com]),you can do exercises to strengthen your ANT-killing abilities in our “Kill theANTs” room.

Focusing on the negative: Focusing on what’s going wrong in asituation and ignoring everything that could be construed as positive 3. Fortune-telling: Predicting the future in a negative way 4. Mind reading: Arbitrarily believing you know what another personthinks, even though they have not told you 5. Thinking with your feelings: Believing your negative feelings withoutever questioning them. 6. Guilt beatings: Thinking in words like should, must, ought, or haveto 7. Labeling: Attaching a negative label to yourself or others 8. Personalization: Construing innocuous events as having personalmeaning 9. Blame: Blaming other people for the problems in your lifeEMPATHY: A BLESSING AND A CURSEAs we saw in chapter 2 [Amen_9780307888969_epub_c02_r1.htm], empathy is a uniquefemale strength. The downside to empathy is getting drawn into other people’ssorrows and pain. That can lead you to become sad right along with them, as youtake on their issues as if they were your own. You might also feel guilty aboutenjoying yourself and your own successes while people you care about are havinga harder time. Many women feel guilty or anxious about making time and space fortheir own concerns, especially if a loved one is in trouble.Any of us might be vulnerable to any of the ANTs. But empathy and a focus onyour own emotions makes you prey to two ANTs in particular:Thinking with Your Feelings—A key female strength is knowing what you’refeeling. But the dark side of that strength is thinking with your feelings. Forexample, “I feel like you don’t love me.” Or “I feel like I’m being treatedunfairly.” Maybe you do feel that way, but is it true? Sometimes feelings lie,especially when you are tired, hungry, worried about something else, under a lotof stress, deprived of the brain chemicals you need, or struggling with ahormonal issue. Don’t let your negative feelings rule your thoughts. Write themdown and look for the evidence behind them.Guilt Beatings—When you think in words like should, must, ought, or have to, youare likely beating yourself with guilt. I have heard this described as a “showerof shoulds.” Women are often taught to put other people’s needs first, so theyfeel guilty when they stand up for themselves or take time to de-stress. Guiltis frequently the result. I’m not saying you should ignore your own personalmoral code. But see if you can reframe the guilt beatings into statements ofwhat you truly want. Instead of “I should call up Casey and help her through herbreakup,” ask yourself if the behavior fits your goals and time. If the answeris no, call when it makes more sense for you. Having a process to free yourselffrom the guilt-beating ANTs will help settle down the noise in your head so youcan make better choices.INTUITION: A STRENGTH AND A WEAKNESSYour female intuition enables you to see things that others miss and to know agreat deal without being able to explain exactly how. Used correctly, yourintuition can be an enormous strength. But it also opens you up to a great dealof worry and anxiety. If you believe your intuition without checking it out, youmight end up “knowing” a lot that isn’t true. Yes, sometimes you are right, butsometimes you’ve just invented your own reality, which is perhaps colored bylack of sleep, low blood sugar, or brain chemistry that has run amok. You runthe risk of living in a world colored entirely by your own negative thoughts andfree-floating feelings, which creates a lot of unnecessary anxiety and disruptedrelationships. And you become prey to the fortune-telling and mind-reading ANTs.Fortune-telling—When you engage in fortune-telling, you arbitrarily predict theworst (“I am going to fail this class”; “I’m going to have a panic attack in thegrocery store”). When that happens, your heart beats faster, your breathingbecomes faster and more shallow, and your adrenal glands start pumping outcortisol and adrenaline. Fortune-telling thoughts instantly push your stresslevels higher. What’s worse, predicting bad things can actually help them cometrue. If you are about to go on a date and you predict it won’t go well, you’llfocus on the first negative thing about the guy you can find, and then you willbe less responsive, less cheerful, and less fun to be with. If you’re sure thatyou’ll have a bad day at work, you’ll be in a terrible mood as soon as anythingbad happens, and your day is certain to go downhill from there.Mind Reading—When you believe you know what someone else is thinking even thoughthey have not told you, you are mind reading. If someone looks at you funny, youmight think, “I know she doesn’t like me.” That is mind reading. Maybe theperson is just having a bad day! Drawing the line between your helpful intuitionand the poisonous mind-reading ANT isn’t always easy. But once you learn to killthis ANT, your relationships and mood will likely improve.COLLABORATION OR CODEPENDENCE?Collaboration is joining with another person in order to achieve a goal. That isusually a good thing and is a strength of the female brain. Collaboration hastwo dark sides, however. One is codependence, or the tendency to do for otherswhat they should do for themselves, protecting them from the appropriateconsequences of their own actions. The other is dependence: feeling that youcan’t do anything on your own without the permission or help of others. Atendency to either depend or codepend can make it difficult for you to assertyour own boundaries and maintain your own autonomy. You might end up feelinglike a victim, which opens your mind to the personalization and “always”thinking ANTs.Personalization—A key female strength is building relationships, but thedownside can be a tendency to personalize. “My husband didn’t call; he must notlove me anymore” is a classic example of personalization. Maybe the reason hedidn’t call has nothing to do with you: He’s stressed, distracted, or dealingwith a crisis. Another example is “My daughter at college failed her math test.I should have spent more time helping her with her homework in high school.”Taking your daughter’s failure personally is the act of an undisciplined mind,because by the time she’s in college, your daughter’s study habits should be herown responsibility, not yours. Neither blaming yourself for everything that goeswrong nor assuming that other people’s actions are all about you are accuratereflections of reality. They’re just ANTs.“Always” Thinking—Any time you think in absolutes, usually characterized by suchwords as always, never, no one, everyone, every time, or everything, yournegative thinking makes a temporary situation look like a permanent reality.Some examples: “He never listens to me.” “I always have to do what she wants.”“Everyone in this family gets their way except me.” This kind of thinking closesyour mind to other possibilities and keeps you focused on the negative, whichwill make you feel more anxious and/or depressed.Focusing on the Negative—Most people and most experiences are a blend ofpositive and negative. It’s important to use judgment wisely to avoid situationsthat are dangerous, abusive, unhealthy, or unpleasant, but it’s also importantnot to take one negative element and blow it out of proportion. Since focusingon the negative almost always makes you feel bad, and focusing on the positiveusually makes you feel better, a disciplined mind can focus on the positivewhile at the same time finding what is valuable in the negative. Where you bringyour attention determines how you feel. I do not want you thinking in positivepie-in-the-sky happy thoughts just to feel good and ignore your health andwell-being. I want you to be concerned when you need to be concerned, but alsofind the good in whatever situation you are in. An added benefit is thatfocusing on the positive opens you to a wider range of opportunities, whichmeans that you are more likely to find people and situations that work out wellfor you.Labeling—Attaching a negative label, whether to yourself or someone else, keepsyou from taking a clear look at the person or situation that you labeled. “He’sa jerk.” “I’m an idiot.” “What a stupid rule.” “What an awful thing to say.” Nowinstead of looking clearly at the specific person, rule, or comment, you arejust lumping it in with all the other “jerks,” “idiots,” “stupid rules,” and“awful remarks” you have known. Labeling won’t necessarily help you deal withthis particular issue, or to make accurate judgments about yourself. Avoidlabels and see things in their own terms.Blame—Sometimes another person takes an action that hurts us. But even so, blameis very harmful. When we say, “If only you hadn’t done x, I would have been allright,” we are really saying, “You have all the power over my life, and I havenone.” The “blame game” undermines your sense of personal power. That is why itis the most poisonous ANT of all. Focus on what you can do about a situation andon what you want to do next, and don’t allow those blaming ANTs any space inyour mind.JENNA: STUCK IN A RUTJenna was a graphic designer in her mid-twenties who faced increasing trouble ather job. Although she had won several prestigious industry awards, she couldn’tseem to get along with either her clients or her supervisor. She was frustratedat having to make compromises when she knew her opinion was correct, and sheoften found herself getting into arguments that she just couldn’t seem to drop.She fought with her boyfriend too. “Once we start,” she told me, “I just can’tlet it go. And then I remember every awful thing he ever did to me and I just goon the attack. I bring up stuff from three years ago, because it all feels likeit just happened to me yesterday. It’s like I get these thoughts into my head,and I just can’t get them out.”Jenna was a classic case of the compulsive brain type. She got stuck on negativethoughts that she could not dislodge. Jenna found 5-HTP helpful to calm heroveractive brain, along with exercise and a commitment to getting regular sleep.These biological approaches were not enough, however. Jenna also needed to learnhow to kill her ANTs.Jenna’s most poisonous ANT was blame. Whenever anything bad happened to her, shetended to leap to the conclusion that someone else was to blame, rather thanseeing how she had contributed to the situation, or at least viewing thesituation from the perspective of others. I didn’t want Jenna to shift fromblaming others to blaming herself. But I did want her to stop feeling like avictim from her undisciplined her mind.Here is how Jenna reframed her blame ANTs: ANT: I’m having trouble meeting this deadline. It’s because the clientkeeps changing his mind. I’m miserable, and it’s all his fault! TYPE OF ANT: Blame KILLING THE ANT: I have chosen to do this work, which I mainly enjoy.Dealing with client requests and staying late to meet a deadline is part of thejob. I’ll make sure to build regular breaks into my schedule and eat somehealthy snacks so that I stay motivated and fresh while I complete thisassignment. ANT: My boyfriend didn’t call on time, and now it’s too late to go tothat movie I wanted to see. He’s just ruined my night! TYPE OF ANT: Blame KILLING THE ANT: It’s still early. Maybe I can go to a later show … orwatch something on TV … or call a girlfriend and catch up with her on the phone.I don’t have to give up all my fun for a whole evening just because of a missedphone call.As Jenna disciplined her mind, she found an enormous side benefit: She no longerfelt at the mercy of her own thoughts. Her thinking became more flexible, shefelt calmer and less worried, and she began getting along better with herclients, co-workers, and loved ones. Disciplining her mind had allowed Jenna tosoothe her brain, and her life worked better as a result.MARLEY: LEARNING NOT TO BE PERFECTMarley was a fifty-two-year-old single mother of three with a high-level job inthe banking industry. Although she was highly successful at work and herchildren were doing fine, Marley worried constantly about what might go wrong.She often stayed awake for hours as her mind raced from one potential disasterto the next. Despite the many professional accolades she had received, Marleyoften felt like an impostor, and she frequently stayed late at the office tomake sure her work was “perfect.” When I looked at Marley, I saw a beautifullydressed woman with lovely clothes, impeccable hair, and bitten nails. While wetalked, she picked at her cuticles, jiggled her leg, and looked as though shewas going to jump right out of her chair. “I’m tired of always worrying aboutevery little thing,” she told me. “But I can’t seem to stop.”Marley was a prime example of an intelligent, accomplished woman who nonethelesshad an undisciplined mind and a busy brain. Because she always felt like animposter or a fraud, she drove herself relentlessly to perfection, hoping thatwould prevent others from “seeing through her” and somehow undermining herposition. Many women struggle with this problem, partly because they really doface opposition from both men and women at work, partly because they are prey toa number of ANTs.Marley’s worst ANTs were mind reading and personalization. She was constantlyassuming that a co-worker didn’t like her, an employee resented her direction,or a top executive was planning to get rid of her. She personalized companypolicies, seeing them as directed against her rather than understanding thatthey affected everyone and might have been instituted for reasons that hadnothing to do with her. Her ANTs brought her a great deal of needlessunhappiness, anxiety, and agitation.Once I showed Marley how to kill her ANTs, she set about disciplining her mindwith the same determination and energy that she had used to build her career inthe first place. Here are the mental habits that Marley practiced every day tokill some of her ANTs: ANT: She didn’t smile at me when I walked by her desk, she must be madabout what I said to her in the meeting yesterday. TYPE OF ANT: Mind reading KILLING THE ANT: I have no way of knowing what it meant that she didn’tsmile. Maybe she didn’t notice me. Maybe her child is sick. If I want to knowwhat she’s thinking, I have to ask her. ANT: I was late three times last week when my daughter was sick—this newmemo about lateness is obviously directed against me. I’d better make extra sureto come in on time, or I might not get a bonus this year. TYPE OF ANT: Personalization KILLING THE ANT: It’s a big company, who knows why they sent this memoat this time? I’m one of twenty vice presidents. It seems really unlikely thatmy being a few minutes late would cause them to send out a company-wide memo.I’m doing a great job, and everyone knows it. My bonus is probably safe.Adopting brain-healthy habits helped Marley soothe her brain, but it was alsodisciplining her mind that made a long-term difference. Although Marley told methat she had to work a lot at killing her ANTs, much like the performermentioned at the beginning of the chapter had to work at her craft, she feltcalmer, happier, and more empowered. As an extra bonus, her new sense ofself-confidence actually improved her job performance, giving her even morereason to feel confident. Marley had seen that soothing her brain created apositive cycle to replace the vicious one. When she saw the great results shegot, she knew they were worth all the discipline and hard work.THE WORK: ANOTHER TECHNIQUE“The Work” is another ANT-killing technique that I teach all of my patients. Itwas developed by my friend Byron Katie and is explained in Loving What Is: FourQuestions That Can Change Your Life, which she wrote with her husband, StephenMitchell. Katie, as her friends call her, described her own experience sufferingfrom suicidal depression. She was a young mother, businesswoman, and wife in thehigh desert of Southern California. She became severely depressed at the age ofthirty-three. For ten years, she sank deeper and deeper into self-loathing,rage, and despair, with constant thoughts of suicide and paranoia. For the lasttwo years, she was often unable to leave her bedroom or care for herself or herfamily. Then one morning in 1986, out of nowhere, Katie woke up in a state ofamazement, transformed by the realization that when she believed her thoughts,she suffered, but when she questioned her thoughts, she didn’t suffer.Katie’s great insight is that it is not life or other people that make us feeldepressed, angry, stressed, abandoned, and despairing: It is our own thoughtsthat make us feel that way. In other words, we can live in a hell of our ownmaking, or we can live in a heaven of our own making.Katie developed a simple method of inquiry for questioning our thoughts. Itconsists of (1) writing down any of the thoughts that are torturing us,including any of those in which we are judging other people; (2) askingourselves four questions; and (3) doing a turnaround. The goal is not positivethinking but rather accurate thinking. The four questions are: 1. Is this particular thought true? 2. Can I absolutely know that it’s true? 3. How do I react when I believe that thought? 4. Who would I be without the thought? (Or how would I feel if I didn’thave the thought?)Turnaround: After you answer the four questions, you then take the originalthought and completely turn it around to its opposite, and ask yourself whetherthe opposite of the original thought that is causing your suffering is not trueor even truer than the original thought. Then take the turned-around thought andapply it to yourself (and to the other person, if someone else is involved inthe thought).In my office I frequently find myself at my white board, writing these fourquestions as a way to help people talk back to the thoughts that make themsuffer.Celeste, forty-eight, was a divorced mother of eight children. She came to meafter being unable to shake feelings of depression and inadequacy. Since herdivorce five years prior, she had felt sad, lonely, and unlovable. She lovedbeing in a close relationship, so the divorce had really thrown her offemotionally. She told me, “No one would ever want an ‘older’ woman with eightchildren!” So we did the Work on that thought, and she responded to my fourquestions: 1. Is it true that no one would ever want a forty-eight-year-old womanwith eight children? “Yes,” she said, “No one wants that baggage.” 2. Can you absolutely know that it is true that no one would ever want aforty-eight-year-old woman with eight children? “No,” she said, “of course, Ican’t know that for sure.” 3. How do you feel when you think this particular thought? “I feel sad,hopeless, and very lonely.” 4. Who would you be or how would you feel if you didn’t have thisparticular thought? “I would feel much happier, more optimistic, and probablylook more available.”Turnaround: “No one would ever want a forty-eight-year-old woman with eightchildren.” What is the opposite? “Someone will want me and my family.”Okay … which is truer? “I suppose I don’t know,” she said, “but if I act like noone will want me, then no one will want me.” After cleaning her thoughts andgetting on the program to unleash the power of her brain, Celeste started datingagain.To her amazement, she had no problem finding nice men to date who were happy tospend time in a big family. Two years later, when I received Celeste’s weddinginvitation in the mail, there was a personal note that read, “No, it’s nottrue!”All of us need a way to correct our thoughts. Just think about what happens toall the women like Celeste who let the ANTs dominate their lives, whether intheir relationships or at work or with their money. I have seen these fourquestions dramatically change people’s lives and I know they can do the same foryou.ANIKO KILLS HER ANTSWhen Aniko came to our clinic, she was just dragging through the day. Aninformation technology specialist in her early thirties, she had been through apainful breakup with her boyfriend about six months before. Aniko had been moreserious about this man than she had about any previous partner, and she had evenbeen hoping to settle down and start a family with him, so when he left, it hither really hard. She found herself bursting into tears at odd moments,especially the week before her period. On the weekends, she was often soexhausted that she spent one or both days in bed. She had also gained 15 pounds,which made her feel even worse. “I should be able to shake this off,” she toldme. “But I just can’t.”Aniko’s SPECT scan confirmed that she had excessive activity in her anxietycenters, causing her to predict the worst. I gave her a regimen of abrain-healthy diet and started her on an exercise program, which I knew wouldhelp with her mood, her energy levels, and her weight. Aniko also needed tosoothe her emotions and discipline her mind. I worked with Aniko to identify theANTs that plagued her the most, which in her case were “always” thinking (“Noone will ever love me”), thinking with feelings (“I feel all alone; therefore Iam all alone”), and fortune-telling (“I’ll never have a baby or a family of myown”).Working with Aniko, I found she really gravitated to the four questions. So whenAniko told herself, “No one will ever love me,” I asked her to kill the ANT byusing Katie’s technique. Here’s how it worked: ANIKO: No one will ever love me! QUESTION 1: Is that true? ANIKO: Yes, I just said so! No one will ever love me! QUESTION 2: Can you absolutely know it’s true? ANIKO: Well, no, I guess not absolutely. I guess it might not be true.… QUESTION 3: What happens when you believe that thought? ANIKO: I feel sad, lonely, miserable, discouraged.… QUESTION 4: Who would you be without that thought? ANIKO: I might feel more confident. I might be a person who couldsomeday find love.Turnaround: Someone will love me.Questioning her negative thoughts helped Aniko to understand that they were onlythoughts, not reality. She also used another powerful ANT-killing technique thatI teach: identifying the ANT and reframing it into a more accurate statement.Here is how Aniko worked with her ANT “I feel all alone; therefore I am allalone.” ANT: I feel all alone; therefore I am all alone. TYPE OF ANT: Thinking with my feelings REFRAMING: Even though I feel alone, there are a lot of people who careabout me—my sister, my best friend, my favorite cousin, my parents. These peoplewould be there if I asked them for help or even just for a hug. I do miss myboyfriend. But I guess I am only alone if I decide to be.Killing the ANTs helped Aniko soothe her brain. Although sometimes she stillfelt sad about not being in a relationship, she generally felt much happier,calmer, and more optimistic. As a result, when a new co-worker asked her out,Aniko was able to imagine good possibilities for the relationship and to go onthe date in a cheerful, positive frame of mind. “Even if this relationshipdoesn’t work out,” she told me, “I would never even have given it a chance theway I was acting before. Being that negative meant I was never going to findanybody! Now … we’ll see.”Byron Katie’s brain provides the most powerful evidence of this technique. As Idiscussed earlier, before she found the ability to question her mind, shesuffered for many years. But the four questions gave her peace. I met Katie in2005 and we immediately became close friends. She worked with people I loved tohelp them discipline their minds and I worked with people she loved to helpbalance their brains. Over time, I scanned Katie’s brain. It looked like that ofa person who suffers greatly. Yet Katie was at peace. It was clear evidence tome that doing the Work can help override significant brain problems.VULNERABILITY TO ANT INFESTATIONSYou may find that you’re especially prey to your ANTs the week before yourperiod or during the hormonally challenging times of perimenopause andmenopause. Your brain-healthy habits are especially critical during those times!Try not to seek the easy answer by reaching for a sweet food or a drink or bypopping a pill. Instead, discipline your mind by killing the ANTs and using theFour Questions. Make these exercises part of your life to have a disciplinedmind.And while you’re at it, to really solidify them in your head, teach them to yourfriends, children, co-workers—anyone who will listen. Teaching others allowsthem to be anchored in your own mind.[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_034_r1.jpg]View the Four Questions.HYPNOSIS AND MEDITATION: TURN ON YOUR BRAIN TO TURN IT OFFHypnosis and meditation are both powerful ways to soothe your mind and help youcreate a state of deep relaxation. I have used them in my practice for overthree decades and know they are fast and easy ways to calm the mind.Interestingly, both of these “seemingly deep relaxation” techniques actuallystimulate or turn on the brain. Studies from Belgium and Canada have shown thathypnosis increases blood flow and activity in the attention areas of the brainand the left hemisphere. It also decreases the perception of pain in the areasof the brain that perceive pain. In our studies, and those done by others,meditation also boosts blood flow to the brain, especially to the PFC, the mosthuman, thoughtful part of the brain.The neuroscience research on both of these techniques fooled me. Since I haveseen myself and my patients obtain deep levels of relaxation using hypnosis andmeditation, I thought they would be calming to the brain and we would ultimatelysee lower overall activity. Yet the opposite proved true. It seems that you haveto turn your brain on in order to turn it off. These findings make sense whenyou consider that the PFC serves an inhibitory function and acts like thebrain’s brake.Hypnosis—The PFC helps to calm the more primitive, emotional brain centers (thelimbic system), which have been described by Joe Annabali, our psychiatrist inReston, Virginia, “as being like a bunch of wild horses—you really can’t totallycontrol wild horses, but if you can get a hand on their reins, you might be ableto influence which direction the horses are running.”Tana often uses my sleep hypnosis audio to slip into a peaceful slumber. Shetells me, “I can’t listen to the hypnosis audio and the chatter inside my headat the same time.” During stressful times, she says, “If I still hear thechatter, I just turn up the volume.”You can listen to my hypnosis audios for anxiety, sleep, pain, weight loss, andpeak performance online at www.amensolution.com [http://www.amensolution.com].[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_035_r1.jpg]Access audios in the “Relaxation Room/Hypnosis.”Alternatively, here are instructions on how to put yourself into a simplehypnotic trance to boost your brain and soothe your mind. Do not try to do thiswhile driving or operating heavy machinery. • Focus your eyes on a spot and count slowly to twenty. Let your eyesfeel heavy as you count and close them before or as you get to twenty. • Take four very slow, deep breaths, and as you do, feel your belly andchest rise and fall with each breath in and out. • Progressively tighten and relax the muscles in your feet, legs, arms,and then hands. • Imagine yourself walking down a staircase while you count backwardfrom ten (this will give you the feeling of “going down” or becoming relaxed). • Using all of your senses, imagine going to a beautiful place youassociate with relaxation, such as a lake, beach, or mountain. • After spending ten to fifteen minutes in your special place, allowyourself to come back to full consciousness. If you fall asleep during theexercise, it means that likely you are not getting enough sleep.I still use this technique when I am stressed, and recently, I had theopportunity to use it to help my daughter.On Fourth of July we had a party at our house. As the fireworks started outside,our eight-year-old daughter, Chloe, was creating her own fireworks in ourkitchen. My wife had created a new dessert for the party, a combination ofcoconut and almond butter. Chloe decided to heat it up, at her mom’s direction.But when she took it out of the microwave she tested it with her finger. That iswhen the screaming started. It was too hot and the concoction stuck to herfinger. She tried to shake it off, wiped it off with a towel, and then stuck herfinger in her mouth. Then she put her hand in ice water, aloe gel, and then icecubes. Her pain and frustration escalated as she unraveled and the ANTs startedto take over. “I’m so stupid,” she said. “Why did I do that?” She was havingtrouble calming herself down. Her mother gave her ibuprofen for the pain andstarted putting her to bed. But Chloe was not calming down.The ANTs were now coming in droves. “I can’t do this. It’s too much. I can’ttake it. I’m so stupid. I can’t believe I did it. I wish I could go back and doit over.”Tana tried to distract her by reading to her, but it didn’t work. She thenprayed with her, but Chloe couldn’t focus. Nothing worked, so Tana walked intomy office and said I needed to help.I sat on Chloe’s bed and assessed the situation. Like I had done for manypatients in the hospital, I used a simple hypnotic trance to calm her. Using theoutline above, I had her focus on a spot on the wall, close her eyes, and startto relax her body and slow her breathing. I then asked her to imagine walkingdown a flight of stairs as I counted backward from ten. Then I had her imaginegoing to a special park that she imagined with all of her senses, where it wassafe and she was with her mother and friends. Then I had her imagine going intoa warm pool. The water had special healing powers that soothed and helped herfinger, taking away the pain. The water helped to calm her thoughts and herbody. She did not need to be so hard on herself. We all make mistakes. Beingangry only made the pain worse.Visibly, Chloe was much more relaxed and started to drift off to sleep. The parkand special healing pool was a place she could go back to anytime she was upsetor needed to calm down. Then Chloe fell asleep. Quietly, we left her room,wondering how she would do. But we did not see her until the next morning, andeven though she had a blister on her finger, she said it didn’t hurt, and allwas well. “Everyone makes mistakes,” she said. “I guess that was one of mine.”This technique is very powerful with children and with adults too.Meditation—Decades of research have shown that meditation and prayer calm stressand enhance brain function. At Amen Clinics, we performed a SPECT study,sponsored by the Alzheimer’s Research and Prevention Foundation, with aKundalini yoga form of meditation called Kirtan Kriya. We scanned people on oneday when they were just letting their mind wander and then the next day during ameditation session. For the meditation, the participants recited the followingsimple sounds known as the five primal sounds: « sa, » “ta,” “na,” and « ma »the vowel a at the end of each sound is drawn out (like “ahhhh”) and isconsidered to be the fifth sound. The meditation involves touching the thumb ofeach hand to the index finger while chanting « sa, » the middle finger whilechanting « ta, » the ring finger while chanting “na,” and the pinkie fingerwhile chanting “ma.” The sounds and fingering are repeated for two minuteswhispering, four minutes silently, two minutes whispering, and two minutes outloud.Kirtan Kriya Fingertip Movements[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_036_r1.jpg]The SPECT scans taken after the meditation showed decreases in activity in theleft parietal lobes, which some believe indicates a decreased awareness of timeand space. They also showed significant increases in activity in the PFC, whichshowed in our group that meditation helped to tune people in, not out. We alsoobserved increased activity in the right temporal lobe, an area that has beenassociated with spirituality.Will, age forty-five, one of our Kirtan Kriya research subjects, got lost on hisway to the clinic and was forty-five minutes late to his appointment. His SPECTscan showed severe damage to the left front side of his brain. When I asked himabout it, he told me that at age twenty-one, he’d had a severe motorcycleaccident. It was after the accident that he started meditating. This finding onSPECT is often associated with depression and irritability. Yet he was happy andpeaceful, if directionally challenged. His story reminds me of Byron Katie’s,where using mind discipline techniques can significantly help to soothe braintroubles.My friend Andy Newberg at Thomas Jefferson University has also used brain SPECTimaging to study the neurobiology of meditation, in part because it is aspiritual state easily duplicated in the laboratory. He scanned nine Buddhistmonks before and during prolonged meditation. The scan revealed distinctivechanges in brain activity as the mind went into a meditative state.Specifically, activity decreased in the parts of the brain involved ingenerating a sense of three-dimensional orientation in space. Losing one’s senseof physical place could account for the spiritual feeling of transcendence,being beyond space and time, being everywhere and nowhere and united with Godand the universe. They also found increased activity in the PFC, associated withattention span and thoughtfulness. Meditation seemed to tune people in, not out.Another functional brain imaging study of transcendental meditation showedcalming in the anterior cingulate and basal ganglia, diminishing anxiety andworries and fostering relaxation.The benefits of meditation go far beyond soothing your mind. Studies have shownthat it also improves attention and planning, reduces depression and anxiety,decreases sleepiness, and protects the brain from cognitive decline associatedwith normal aging. In a study from researchers at UCLA, the hippocampus andfrontal cortex were found to be significantly larger in people who meditateregularly. Meditation has also been found to aid in weight loss, reduce muscletension, and tighten the skin.A lot of people think it takes years of practice to learn how to meditate. Itdoesn’t. A fascinating Chinese study done by the neuroscientist (and my friend)Dr. Yiyuan Tang showed that people who received just twenty minutes of dailymeditation training for five days showed a significant decrease instress-related cortisol. You don’t need to devote big chunks of time to thepractice of meditation. In my clinical practice, I often recommend meditation asan integral part of a treatment plan. Many of my patients have reported backthat they feel calmer and less stressed after just a few minutes of dailymeditation.If the whole concept of meditation seems a little too New Age-y for you, takenote that you can do it just about anywhere, anytime. You don’t have to sitcross-legged on the floor or burn incense or any of those things you mightassociate with meditation. If you are at work, you can simply close the door toyour office, sit in your chair, close your eyes, and relax for a few moments bytaking five to ten slow, deep breaths. At home, you can sit on the edge of yourbed after you wake up and spend a couple of minutes calming your mind by takingslow, deep breaths and imagining yourself in the most beautiful places in theworld.I give my patients the five-five-five rule. Breathe in slowly for five seconds,hold your breath for five seconds, and then slowly breathe out, taking fiveseconds. Repeat this five to ten times.You can do a twelve-minute meditation along with me online in the “RelaxationRoom” at www.amensolution.com [http://www.amensolution.com].[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_037_r1.jpg]Access a twelve-minute meditation in the “Relaxation Room.”Other mind-soothing and mind-discipline games and techniques found in our onlinecommunity include:MyCalmBeate-Catch the FeelingPositive Reflectionse-Self RegulateAffirmThought Challengere-Motion Well-beinge-Positive Spine-Motion HappySOCIAL CONNECTIONSIn soothing your mind, it is critical never to underestimate the power of beingaround the right people. Start to observe the moods and attitudes of thosearound you. Do your best to keep angry, irritable people and their moods andmind-sets from rubbing off on you.My sister Mary lost her husband to cancer, and then fifteen years later she losther fiancé to a sudden cardiac arrest. Yet Mary was able to stay strong, inlarge part because she had a supportive family and many, many friends whoreached out to her and nurtured her in her time of need. It was not an accidentthat Mary had so many supportive people in her life. For decades, Mary hadnurtured her relationships with her family and friends, and when she needed themmost, they were there. If you are feeling down and being infested by the ANTs,or you have monkey-mind thoughts running wildly through your mind, this is whenyou should get busy spending time with your support group. If you do not have asupport group, then consider developing your own at church, in yourneighborhood, or by volunteering for a worthy cause.SPIRITUAL HEALTHHaving a deep sense of meaning and purpose helps to keep you happy and motivatedand goes a long way to staving off the thoughts that try to steal yourhappiness.Stacie Mathewson suffered greatly when her son struggled with severe drug abuse.After he had a serious overdose and almost died, Stacie decided she had to dosomething about it. She started a sober college program at the University ofNevada in Reno and a similar program at a local community college. Then shestarted working on developing drug prevention programs in high schools. Otherstook notice of her work and asked her to be on the board of directors at theBetty Ford Center. Through Stacie’s efforts, she was able to get an amendment toa California law so that courts considering child custody would take intoaccount either parent’s continual or habitual use of prescribed controlledsubstances. We worked together on creating brain-healthy treatment programs.Stacie’s work gave her a deep sense of meaning and purpose, which helped tocorral her ANTs and diminish her own suffering, as well as the suffering ofcountless others.TO MEDICATE OR NOT TO MEDICATE?I am a classically trained psychiatrist and have prescribed medications for along time. I am not opposed to using medicine for emotional or behavioralproblems. I am just opposed to their indiscriminant use. Given the expense andside effects of medications for anxiety and depression, I prefer to first trynatural treatments such as exercise, meditation, ANT therapy, and naturalsupplements targeted toward a patient’s particular brain type. If medication isneeded, be cautious and proceed slowly. Use our brain-typing method from thispage as a guide to help you determine the type of medication best suited to you.Always consult with your health care provider.Hour 6 Exercise—Kill the ANTs and Answer the Work’s Four Questions1. KILL THE ANTS 1. Whenever you feel sad, mad, nervous, or out of control, draw twolines vertically down a piece of paper, dividing it into three columns. 2. In the first column, write down the ANTs going through your brain. 3. In the second column, identify the type of ANT or negative thought.Therapists typically describe nine different types of ANTs. 4. In the third column, talk back, correct, and eradicate the ANTs. Ifyou were like me, you were good at talking back to your parents when you were ateenager. In the same way, you need to learn to be good at talking back to thelies you tell yourself.2. ANSWER THE WORK’S FOUR QUESTIONSWrite down disturbing thoughts that upset you. Then ask yourself. 1. Is it true? 2. Can you absolutely know that it’s true? 3. How do you react when you believe that thought? 4. Who would you be without the thought? Or, how would you feel if youdidn’t have the thought?Turnaround: After you answer the four questions, you then take the originalthought and completely turn it around to its opposite, and ask yourself whetherthe opposite of the original thought that is causing your suffering is not trueor even truer than the original thought. Then take the turned-around thought andapply it to yourself and to the other person, if someone else is involved in thethought."},{"pageContent":"7GET CONTROL OF THE FEMALE BRAIN[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_L02_r1.jpg]CONQUER CRAVINGS, WEIGHT ISSUES,AND ADDICTIONS[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_L03_r1.jpg]Boosting self-control is the seventh step to unleash the power of the femalebrain.[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_L03_r1.jpg]The human race is challenged more than ever before to demonstrate our mastery,not over nature but of ourselves.—RACHEL CARSONTeri came up to me after a lecture. She was part of the Daniel Plan, ourcooperative program with Saddleback Church.“Before I met you,” she said, “I knew I was fat and I knew I was not attractive,but I always thought I had a great mind. Then I listened to you talk about the‘dinosaur syndrome’—as your weight goes up, the size and function of your braingoes down. That totally did me in. Last year, my father died of Alzheimer’sdisease, and I want no part of it. That was when I really got serious about myhealth. In the last eight months I have lost 90 pounds and feel better thanever. Thank you!”The dinosaur syndrome that Teri referred to is a term I coined as a starkreminder of the importance of keeping your weight under control. There areeighteen studies that report an inverse correlation between weight increase andbrain size and function decrease. Cyrus Raji and his team at the University ofPittsburgh published the first study and it caused me to lose 20 pounds. I amnot going to do anything purposefully that damages my brain.Teri’s Transformed Brain and Body[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_038_r1.jpg]A few weeks after reading Dr. Raji’s study, I was in Pittsburgh for a meeting ata large health care company, where we were considering a joint project. Themarketing director, Tom, was morbidly obese, which upset me. If you don’t livethe message of your organization, then you are not a good messenger, which isone reason why overweight physicians have trouble helping their patients getwell through lifestyle interventions. As part of the visit, Tom took me todinner at a local restaurant. When I heard him order two soufflés for dessert, Ijust couldn’t stand it anymore and told him that he wanted to avoid the dinosaursyndrome.Tom laughed and said, “What’s the dinosaur syndrome?”“Don’t you know that there are studies now that say as your weight goes up, theactual physical size and function of your brain go down? The first study wasdone in this very town.”“Really?” Tom replied.“Tom, do you want to progress in your career, or are you finished?”“I have a lot of work left to do. I am not anywhere near done.”“Then you need to have a healthy brain and get serious about your weight.”A month later, Tom wrote an email to me saying that he had lost 17 pounds. Hedidn’t want to be a dinosaur. After receiving that email I decided I had tostart talking about the dinosaur syndrome. I never want to hurt anyone’sfeelings, but I feel compelled to tell the truth. Being overweight or obese hasa significant negative impact on brain health. Learning about the dinosaursyndrome worked for Teri and Tom and countless others who have written to me.One of the greatest joys in my life has been helping people get control overtheir brains and lives. Like Teri and Tom, you can make your brain better, evenif you have been bad to it. We have proven this in our clinical practice againand again at Amen Clinics.Here are six very clear steps to gain control over your mind, your weight, andany addictions you may suffer: 1. Develop brain envy, and know why you care. Do you have anchor images toremind yourself every day why you must do the right things for your brain? 2. Get a comprehensive evaluation in which you learn your important numbersand your brain type. This step will allow you to target the help specifically toyour brain. One-size-fits-all approaches don’t work. 3. Get very serious about avoiding anything that hurts your brain. Youcannot be in control of your mind when your brain is in a toxic, traumatic, ormalnourished environment. 4. Engage in regular brain-healthy habits to boost your brain’s reserve andengage all of its healing processes. 5. Boost the quality of your decisions to gain more control over your life. 6. Learn and implement the science of change.None of these strategies is hard. They just take a little forethought and needto be applied consistently over time. This book has already covered the firstfour steps in detail. In this chapter, I will cover steps 5 and 6. But first,take a moment to read about Arianna. Her story highlights the importance ofavoiding anything that hurts your brain.ARIANNAArianna, twenty-three, struggled with bulimia. She hated herself whenever shegave in to the temptation to make herself throw up. After her evaluation andtreatment plan, she did much better, but after about four months of treatment,she relapsed. When I asked her to describe in detail what happened, she said, “Iwent with friends to a restaurant where we shared a bottle of wine. I had abouttwo glasses. Even though I promised myself I wouldn’t eat because I’d alreadyhad dinner, after the wine I ordered a plate of nachos. Then, about midnight Ireally hated myself, so I purged.”As Arianna and I discussed the situation, it dawned on her that the problemwould never have happened if she hadn’t drunk the wine. It was the alcohol thatlowered her impulse control, which led to the nachos, self-loathing, vomiting,and more self-loathing. When you avoid the things that hurt your brain, thequality of your decisions is much better. After that relapse, Arianna stoppedboth her drinking and her purging behaviors. Of course, bulimia is more complex,but it is often related to alcohol, poor sleep, poor nutrition, and low bloodsugar states, which lead to troubled behavior.BOOST THE QUALITY OF YOUR DECISIONSThe best way to reduce stress in your life is to stop screwing up.—ROY BAUMEISTER, PH.D.Many people face a number of obstacles that jeopardize high-quality decisions.These barriers can include food pushers, energy zappers, and financial concerns.Consistently making great decisions is not hard if you put your brain in aposition to help you make them. In order to boost the quality of your decisions,here are the most important steps: • Start with clear focus. Know your goals and look at them every day. • Make decisions about your health ahead of time. It is good to have afew simple rules, such as no bread or drinking alcohol at restaurants beforemeals, as they both lower PFC function and have a negative impact on decisions. • Make sure to eat breakfast, and include some high-quality protein tobalance your blood sugar levels. Low blood sugar levels are associated withlower overall blood flow to the brain and more bad decisions. Make sure to eatthroughout the day to maintain your blood sugar levels. • Eliminate sugar and artificial sweeteners. These often triggercravings and poor decisions. • Get at least seven hours of sleep at night. Less than that isassociated with lower blood flow to the brain and more bad decisions. • Don’t put yourself in vulnerable situations. Think ahead. If you knowyou are going to a party that is likely to serve unhealthy food, eat before yougo so you won’t feel hungry and lose control. My wife often brings food with herto gatherings, so she has something in case of emergency low blood sugar.When you start living a brain-healthy life, it can make those around youuncomfortable, especially if they have a lot of their own bad brain habits. Deepdown, some people, even those who love you the most, don’t want you to succeedbecause it will make them feel like more of a failure. For others, their habitsare so ingrained that they simply don’t know how to react to your new lifestyle.Many of my patients notice this kind of behavior with their families, friends,and co-workers. This is why it is so important for you to take control of yourlife. You need to be prepared for the obstacles that will come your way so youcan deal with them and continue to make good decisions.You will be better prepared to handle challenges if you live by the acronymHALT, which is a common term used in addiction treatment programs. HALT standsfor: • Don’t get too hungry. Eat frequent, small, high-quality meals and takenutritional supplements to optimize your brain and balance your blood sugar. • Don’t get too angry. Maintain control over your emotions and don’t letnegative thinking patterns rule your life. See chapter 6[Amen_9780307888969_epub_c06_r1.htm] for techniques to kill the ANTs. • Don’t get too lonely. Social skills and a positive social network arecritical to maintaining freedom from the bad habits that control you. Enlist ateam of supporters and healthy role models. • Don’t get too tired. Make sleep a priority to boost brain function andimprove judgment and self-control.Many people and companies, as well as our society, will try to push things onyou that threaten your brain health and trigger old destructive habits. As asociety, we’re bombarded with seductive messages about food, coffee, cigarettes,alcohol, shopping, and more. TV commercials, billboards, and radio ads areconstantly showing us images of happy, attractive people enjoying greasy fastfood, judgment-impairing cocktails, and dehydrating caffeinated drinks, all ofwhich reduce brain function and self-control. Movies depict gorgeous celebritiessmoking, drinking, fighting, and engaging in reckless behaviors, which can fireup those emotional memory centers in the brain and trigger a return to oldhabits.Corporations are highly skilled at pushing us to eat and drink things that arenot good for our brain health. Restaurants and fast-food places train employeesto “upsell” as a way to increase sales and, subsequently, expand our waistlines.Here are some of the sneaky tactics food sellers use to try to get you to eatand drink more:“Do you want to supersize that for only thirty-nine cents?”“Do you want fries with your meal?”“Do you want bread first?” (This makes you hungrier so you eat more!)“Do you want an appetizer?”“Do you want another drink?” (This decreases your judgment.)“Do you want a larger drink? It is a better deal!”“No!” is the brain-smart answer to all of these questions. Eating or drinkingmore than you need just because it’s more economical will cost you far more inthe long run.Unfortunately, spouses, friends, co-workers, neighbors, and even children canalso make it very difficult for you to stay on track regardless of the type ofbehaviors you are trying to conquer. A friend who smokes may light up in frontof you even though you are trying to quit. A neighbor might show up with a boxof home-baked brownies for your birthday when you are trying to curb your sugarintake. At work, your supervisor may invite your team to go to happy hour fordrinks, or someone in the operations department may offer you candy from thebowl on her desk.Recently, I came home to a houseful of girls. Chloe had just finished thirdgrade and she invited friends over to swim. As I walked into the house, a motherof one of her friends walked into the house with a box full of greasy Frenchfries, cheeseburgers, and large sodas. I thought to myself, “This is going to beinteresting.”The woman offered them to my wife with a look of pride. “I was at a party andthey had food, so I brought you some.”Tana politely said, “That is not the type of food we eat.”“Oh, come on, it’s fries, cheeseburgers, and sodas. Everyone likes them.”“Not everyone,” Tana said, still trying to maintain a friendly tone.The woman looked at me, “Don’t you eat this way?”“I don’t think I’ve seen this kind of food in our home for years. Thanks forthinking of us, but you can take it with you,” I said, trying less hard thanTana to be polite.“I’ll just leave it in case you get hungry.” And with that she left with herdaughter.I looked at Tana and she looked at me. “What just happened?” I said. “It waslike we just had a food-pusher invasion.” I took the food and promptly threw itout. I didn’t want to start craving after something that would hurt me.People aren’t the only pushers. Places and environmental cues can triggerproblem behaviors. Almost everywhere you go, you will see reminders that temptyou to engage in your old unhealthy behaviors. In the addiction field, they arecalled slippery places. Go to the movies and you’ll have to drive by thefast-food place where you used to hang out with your friends and get high. Takea cruise to Alaska because you want to see the beautiful scenery and you’ll haveto face unbelievably copious amounts of food and desserts at the buffet andfree-flowing alcohol. Join your colleagues at a convention in Las Vegas andyou’ll have to deal with all sorts of temptations that threaten your brainhealth and recovery.Learning to deal with and say no to all of these pushers in the home, on thetown, at work, and at school is critical to your success.Ten More Tips for Making Great Decisions 1. If you are going to a dinner with friends or family, call ahead toinform the host that you are on a special brain-healthy diet and won’t be ableto eat certain foods. 2. When invited to parties where people may be smoking, drinking, ordoing drugs, either don’t go or go with a friend who supports you in yourefforts and will take you home if you feel tempted. 3. Be up-front with food pushers. Explain that you are trying to eat amore balanced diet and that when they offer you cake, chips, or pizza, it makesit more difficult for you. 4. Instead of going out for a smoke break or drinks with friends, chooseactivities that aren’t centered on your unwanted behavior, such as going for awalk. 5. When people offer seconds, tell them you are pleasantly full. If theyinsist, explain that you are trying to watch your calories. If they continue topush extra helpings on you, ask them why they are bent on sabotaging yourefforts to be healthy. 6. I know some people who will accept a piece of cake or a cocktail andthen toss it in the trash or the sink as soon as the host turns away. It isbetter to be wasteful on occasion than to endanger your recovery. 7. Avoid people who are negative, gossipy, or complainers. They bringyou down. 8. Tell your host you don’t drink alcohol, period. 9. Take a healthy sack lunch so you don’t have to eat from the cafeteriaat work or school. 10. Commit to taking control of your own body and don’t let other peoplemake you fat and stupid.LEARN AND IMPLEMENT THE SCIENCE OF CHANGEScientists have studied how the brain can facilitate change, whether it is tolose weight, beat an addiction, or change personal habits. Here are seven steps.1. Decide What You Truly Want—This will help your PFC to lead the way. Yourbrain makes happen what it sees. Define the goal.Create a vivid and believable “future of success” in great detail. Ask yourselfhow you’ll feel in one, five, and ten years if you stay the course and succeed.The answer? Amazing, healthy, energetic, cognitively better than you have everbeen (wisdom plus mental energy).Create a vivid and believable “future of failure” in great detail. Ask yourselfhow you’ll feel in one, five, and ten years if you don’t stop your negativebehaviors. What will your life look like going forward? A smaller brain, earlydisease, and earlier death.2. Know Your Critical Behaviors—Ask yourself what you need to get healthy. Forany problem, such as obesity or an addiction, it is critical to know theimportant behaviors you need to do to reach your goal; then practice them overand over. Examples include: • Get your blood work done, so you do not miss something important, suchas low vitamin D, thyroid, or testosterone levels. • Know your brain type (impulsive, compulsive, sad, or anxious), and gethelp for it. • Get plenty of sleep—this is so important to maintain healthy PFCfunction. • Balance your blood sugar to kill the cravings. • Consistently eat whole, high-quality food but not too much. • Journal your calories, so you do not “overspend.” • Eliminate any foods you may have allergies to, such as milk or wheatproducts. • Avoid the places that trigger cravings. • Control your thoughts, so you don’t have to medicate them with food ordrugs. • Get consistent exercise. • Take proper nutritional supplementation. • Rely on group support.3. Identify Your Most Vulnerable Moments—Be curious about your behavior.Investigating your slipups and bad days can be so instructive if you take thetime to really think about them.Martha, fifty-three, a highly successful attorney, came into my office feelingsad and ashamed. I initially saw her for panic attacks and drinking excessiveamounts of alcohol. After a few months, she had made great progress and hadcompletely stopped drinking. But then she slipped and went on a weekend bingeafter she had a major fight with her husband.“I’ll never beat this,” she told me. Then she stopped herself and said, “I knowthat is not true.” We had worked on the four questions over and over. “I justget so frustrated when I fail.”I went to the whiteboard in my office and drew for her the graph on thefollowing page to show her how people change.“When people come to see me,” I told her, “they have good days and bad days, butusually their days are not very good. Then we work together to change things andthey get better. But it is never that they just get better and stay there. Thereis an up-and-down course. Over time, they feel much better and usually stay thatway. But it is the down times, the slipups, and the setbacks that teach us mostof what we need to know if we embrace them and take time to learn from them. Wehave to turn bad days into useful information.”[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_039_r1.jpg]Former White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel once said that you never want aserious crisis to go to waste. Slipups and setbacks are the same way. Studythem, learn from them, be curious. In my experience, the most successful peopleembrace their mistakes to learn from them.So Martha and I investigated her relapse from a brain science perspective. Theweek before her relapse she had stayed up late every night working on adifficult case. On three of the nights she got fewer than five hours of sleep.In addition, she became erratic in her eating habits, and she did not take timeto work out. She skipped her supplements and also started eating fast food,including gluten, which she knew she was sensitive to. An inappropriate amountof sleep, erratic eating habits, and a lack of exercise all contributed to loweractivity and blood flow to her brain. When those factors combined with adifficult interaction with her husband, who also had a stressful week, shebecame overwhelmed with a sense of hopelessness and more ANTs started to invadeher mind. Ultimately, she got drunk to shut up the noisy negative thoughts,which only then increased her self-loathing—and the relapse was on.Rather than judge herself as bad, I encouraged her to be a good student andlearn from the episode, as it was very instructive. She needed to be morediligent with sleep, exercise, and good food, along with questioning hernegative thoughts that easily got out of control.I asked Martha, “Do you have a GPS system in your car that talks to you?”“Yes,” she replied.“When you make a wrong turn, what does he or she say to you?”“Make the next legal turn, or something like that.”“Does it start yelling or swearing at you?”With a smile she said, “They wouldn’t sell many of those GPS systems. Of coursenot.”“But isn’t this what you are doing to yourself when you make a mistake? Wheneveryou make a mistake, learn from it, turn around, and go in a better direction.”Be the investigator and the subject!Change is a process that occurs in steps. If you pay attention, the bad timescan be more instructive than the good times. Journaling is key to helping keeptrack of the good times and the bad times. Know when are you most vulnerable(e.g., when you haven’t slept, have forgotten to eat breakfast, allowed too muchtime to pass between meals or while at parties or social gatherings).Create simple rules for vulnerable times, such as: 1. I’ll eat healthy foods before bad ones. 2. I’ll split my orders. 3. I’ll eat veggies first. 4. I’ll eat something before I go to the ball game to avoid being tempted bythe caramel apples. 5. I’ll use smaller plates. 6. I’ll allow myself to cheat on my diet—but only after reading mymotivation list and calling supportive friends. (This rule introduces a delayand a social support.) 7. I’ll be aware of the impulse and then focus on something else, liketaking a walk, repeating a poem, or drinking a glass of water, until the impulsegoes away.In Kerry Patterson and colleagues’ book, Change Anything: The New Science ofPersonal Success, there is a phrase to sum up these steps: “Turn bad days intogood data.”4. Learn to Love What You Hate—If you are ever going to succeed at changing, youhave to disarm your impulses and make the right choices pleasurable. Learn howto find what you love about not being inebriated, or identify great low-calorie,highly nutritious foods that you like. Learn to find what you love aboutexercise. One of my friends told me she hated exercise, but she loved walkingwith her children. Mind-set is key.The only way you can sustain change is to change what brings you pleasure!Connect to who you are becoming … think like a healthy person. How would ahealthy person order this meal or act in this vulnerable situation? Willpower isa skill; if you can distract yourself for just a minute, temptations often goaway.Be careful about giving in to your own bad behavior. You may be causing your ownbehavior disorder. I was once with a patient who was struggling with her weight.She said she often felt as though she had to give in to her cravings. She hadtwo teenage daughters, one of whom had tantrums whenever she did not get herway. “And if you were to give in to your daughter’s temper tantrums,” I promptedher, “would she get better or worse?” “Worse, of course,” my patient said. Whenyou give in to your own tantrums. you are creating your own internal behaviordisorder, which is ruining your health and killing you early. Be a loving,effective parent to yourself.5. Who You Spend Time with Matters!—Turn accomplices into friends. Cultivatingbad habits—and good ones—is a team sport. Habits need lots of accomplices tostart and sustain them. Friends, mentors, or coaches are people who support yourpositive behaviors. Ask for their help. Adding friends improves your chances forsuccess up to 40 percent, and this is especially true for weight loss andfitness.The nutritional gatekeeper of the family must become your friend and supporterin order for you to be successful. This is why it is important to stop spendingmoney on food that hurts your family, employees, or friends. It leaves themvulnerable to failure, it hurts their chances for success, and it is a matter ofyour own integrity.Accomplices are people who encourage or are complicit with your negativebehaviors. If you want to change your behavior, you need to change your friendsor turn accomplices into friends or people with whom you spend little or notime.Many accomplices can change into friends if you have crucial conversations withthem. Explain what these people can start doing to help you, and what they canstop doing, and what they can continue doing.6. Make Your Space Work for You—Most people are blinded by the myriad ways ourenvironment controls us. Our surroundings powerfully control what we think, howwe feel, and how we act. If you want to take control of your own life, you haveto take control of your surroundings.Build fences that keep good things in and bad things out: • Clean out the kitchen. • Put a fruit bowl on the table. • Shop the outside edges of the grocery store, where the fresh foodsare, and avoid the internal aisles as much as possible, where the packaged foodsare. • Put a mental fence across the middle of most restaurant menus wherethe high-calorie appetizers and alcoholic drinks are. • Eliminate alcohol and drugs in the house.Manage distance: • Place exercise equipment closer. • Place bad food far away. • Never go near your trigger places.Use cues to jolt you out of routine: • Use personal sayings, such as “Nothing tastes as good as healthyfeels.” • Cues should be placed so that they help you in the crucial moments.Use tools: • Track your walking with a pedometer. • Download apps for tracking calories. • Place a paper calendar in the bathroom to track your weight. • Use smaller pans, servings bowls, and plates to decrease yourportions.7. Stay in the Center of Your Purpose on Earth.—Pray for a blessing on thehealth of your children, grandchildren, employees, and friends. You are theirguide and your guidance will affect them for generations.THE MISSING LINKMost of the research and books on change miss a key point. You need a healthybrain to make it happen. If your brain is not right, you’re not right. Anysuccessful change requires your physical brain to work in a healthy way. If yourbrain has been hurt, it is essential to rehabilitate it. Avoiding anything thathurts your brain and engaging in brain-healthy habits is also crucial. Takingcare of your physical and brain health is a prerequisite to making andsustaining change.HOUR 7 EXERCISE—EMBRACE YOUR FAILURESNew neuroscience research reports that there is a significant brain differencebetween people who learn from their mistakes and those who don’t. Using brainscans, it seems that when some people make mistakes, the anxiety centers oftheir brains become more anxious, causing them to try to avoid thinking aboutthem, whereas for others, the pleasure centers of their brains activate, helpingthem to embrace their failures and learn from them. If you are going to thriveand improve your behavior to make great decisions and gain better self-control,it is essential to learn from your vulnerable times. For example, I tend to loveeating popcorn at movie theaters. But their popcorn is not on my health list. SoI have come up with strategies to deal with the popcorn monster, such as eatingbefore going to the movies and bringing in healthy snacks that I do like.For the next hour, list at least five repetitive mistakes you tend to make.Write about them, why you think they happen repeatedly, and then come up with alist of five strategies to help you overcome the vulnerable times. Here’s anexample from one of my recent patients: MISTAKE: When I go out with friends I often will have two or threeglasses of wine. Sometimes that causes me to overeat and I subsequently want tothrow up the extra calories. The next day I usually feel awful. WHY: I developed this habit so I would be accepted when I’m with myfriends and feel less anxious, as alcohol helps me relax.Five Strategies I’ve Planned Ahead to Break This Pattern 1. Have a clear goal for the evening before going out (e.g., fun,fellowship, self-control). 2. Order sparkling water with a lime (or the like) and nurse it throughoutthe evening. 3. Have a healthy meal or snack before we go out to have a healthy bloodsugar. 4. Bring healthy snacks with me. 5. Use the ANTs-killing technique or the Work’s four questions from chapter6 [Amen_9780307888969_epub_c06_r1.htm] if I feel anxious."},{"pageContent":"8ADD AND THE FEMALE BRAIN[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_L02_r1.jpg]THE HYPERACTIVE “BOYS’ CONDITION”THAT RUINS FEMALE LIVES[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_L03_r1.jpg]Overcoming focus issues is the eighth step to unleash the power of the femalebrain.[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_L03_r1.jpg]You mean I am not lazy, crazy, or stupid?—KATE KELLY AND PEGGY RAMUNDOCheck the statements that apply to you: 1.

Reading this chapter may have a profound positiveimpact on your life.CATHERINEI met Catherine when she brought her eighteen-year-old son to our clinic. He washaving trouble staying on top of his work in college, often missed classes, anddidn’t turn in assignments, even when he had done them. During our evaluationsof children and teenagers at Amen Clinics, parents fill out our intakequestionnaires on themselves. Mental health issues often run in families and wewant to make sure that everyone who needs help gets it. Catherine scored veryhigh on the ADD portion of the questionnaire. She decided to make an appointmentfor herself.Features of ADD (often referred to as ADHD) have been described since theeighteenth century. Philosopher John Locke described a perplexing group of youngstudents who “try as they might … cannot keep their minds from straying.” Itshallmark symptoms are short attention span, distractibility, disorganization,restlessness, and impulse control. It is commonly thought of as a disorder ofhyperactive, behaviorally troubled boys. Yet it afflicts many girls too, andthey are often overlooked, because they tend not to be as hyperactive and havefewer behavior problems. Missing ADD in females, however, can have devastatinglifelong effects on their health, mood, relationships, career, and finances.All of her life Catherine felt stupid. Even though she ended up finishingcollege, she was labeled as a slow learner in elementary school and junior highschool. She felt that she had to try harder than everyone else. Homework tookher longer to do than it took her friends. She often didn’t go out on weekendsbecause she was overloaded with schoolwork. Even now, she told me, chores aroundthe house took her longer than she (or her husband) thought they should.Catherine struggled with bulimia as a teenager and young woman, and shecomplained of a long-standing sense of anxiety and restlessness.She stopped going out to movies. “I can’t sit still for more than fifteenminutes at a time. Getting up all the time and walking around irritates others.”Because of her distractibility, she would often interrupt her husband in thetheater and ask what just happened or what was said.She had problems with follow-through, often having to pay late fees for herbills even when she had the money.Her husband complained that Catherine was conflict seeking. “Often I feel likeshe will just start problems to have a problem,” he said. “If we’re having anice day, she’ll start to pick at me or bring something up from the past to beupset about. I don’t think we have had a whole month in our twenty-five-yearmarriage without a bad fight.”In addition, Catherine was disorganized. She told me that her closets were a“disaster area.” “You have to wear a hard hat when you go in them,” was herhusband’s comment. She was also frequently late.As part of their evaluations, both Catherine and her son were scanned. They bothhad a similar SPECT pattern: reasonably healthy brain activity at rest, but pooractivity in the PFC with concentration. In my experience, the images of goodactivity at rest that decrease with concentration perfectly describe people withADD. The harder they try, the worse it gets for them.Catherine had a very nice response to treatment. She said her energy was better.She felt more focused and was more effective in her day-to-day life. Her anxietylevel settled down and she was able to sit through movies without having to getup or miss part of the plot. Her husband said that she was more relaxed, lessnegative, and less conflict seeking. Plus, Catherine told me with a smile,“There was a surprise added bonus.” I had seen that smile many times before andhad a sense of what she would say next. “Because I can focus better, my orgasmsare easier and much more intense.”[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_040_r1.jpg]“What do orgasms require?” I often ask audiences in my lectures. Someone willsay, “A competent lover.” Others may blurt out, “A great imagination.” I keepasking until someone says, “Attention.” You have to pay attention to the feelinglong enough to make it happen. As Catherine’s focus improved, her ability toexperience ecstasy improved as well.It is estimated that seventeen million people in the United States have ADD. Itis the most common learning and behavioral problem in children and one of themost common problems in adults, leading to job failures, relationship breakups,loneliness, drug abuse, and a tremendous sense of underachievement.This chapter will explore how ADD affects the female brain, including the mythsand misconceptions about ADD, its primary symptoms, different types, andtreatments.Unfortunately, many myths and misconceptions about ADD abound in our society.Here is a list of common falsehoods, as well as the truth, as I see it, aboutADD.The Myths About ADD • ADD is the flavor of the month illness. It is a fad diagnosis and just anexcuse for bad behavior. • ADD is overdiagnosed. Every child who acts up a bit gets placed onmedication. • ADD is a disorder of hyperactive boys. • ADD is only a minor problem. We don’t need to make such a fuss over it. • ADD is an American invention, made up by a society seeking simplesolutions to complex problems. • Bad parents or bad teachers cause ADD. If only our society were firmer andstricter with these people, there wouldn’t be these problems. • People with ADD should just try harder. We don’t need to give themexcuses. • Everyone outgrows ADD by the age of twelve or thirteen. • Stimulant medication for ADD is dangerous and highly addictive. • Medication alone is the best treatment for ADD.The Truths About ADD • ADD is not new. In 1902, pediatrician George Still described a group ofchildren who were hyperactive, impulsive, and inattentive. Unfortunately, hedidn’t understand that ADD is a medical disorder, and he labeled these childrenas “morally defective.” • ADD affects approximately 6 percent of the population, but fewer than 2percent receive treatment. Child psychiatrist Peter Jensen found that fewer thanone in eight children who met the diagnostic criteria for ADD were takingmedication. Many children, especially girls, with ADD go untreated. • Many people with ADD are never hyperactive. The nonhyperactive ADD groupis often ignored because they do not bring enough negative attention tothemselves. They are not a big enough problem. Many of these children,teenagers, or adults are just labeled as willful, lazy, unmotivated, or “notthat smart.” Females have ADD in high numbers, yet males are diagnosed three tofour times more often than females. Gender bias issues and the decreasedincidence of hyperactivity in females may account for these differences. • ADD is a serious societal problem. ° Girls with ADD suffer more than seven times the risk for bothantisocial and mood disorders, three times the risk for addictive disorders, andtwice the risk for anxiety disorders. They have a higher risk for eatingdisorders, such as bulimia and obesity. ° Girls with ADD have more conflicts with their mothers and strugglemore in romantic relationships. In one study, 75 percent of people with ADD haveinterpersonal problems. ° Teens with ADD are almost three times more likely to drop out of highschool (25 percent repeat at least one grade). ° One study reported that 52 percent of untreated ADD teens and adultsabuse drugs or alcohol. ° People with ADD smoke cigarettes at nearly double the rate of thegeneral population. ° People with ADD use medical services at three times the rate of thegeneral population. ° There is a higher percentage of motor vehicle accidents, speedingtickets, driving without a license, and suspended or revoked licenses amongpeople with ADD. ° Parents of ADD children divorce three times more than the generalpopulation. • ADD is found in every country where it has been studied. Our clinicsevaluate and treat people from all over the world. We have seen ADD patientsfrom Hong Kong, Lebanon, Ethiopia, West Africa, Israel, and Russia. Having ADDin a nomadic culture often causes the person afflicted to be ostracized fromtheir group, because they have trouble conforming to societal norms. • Poor parents or teachers certainly can make ADD symptoms worse, but theydo not cause it. Genetic features, poor nutrition, and environmental toxins leadthe list of causes. The behaviors of these children and adults often make evenskilled parents and teachers or spouses appear stressed and inept. • The harder many people with ADD try, the worse things get. Brain imagingstudies show that most people with ADD experience PFC shutdown duringconcentration tasks. This means that when they try to concentrate, the part oftheir brain involved with concentration, focus, and follow-through actuallyshuts down when they need it to turn on. In a sense, their brain betrays them. • Many people never outgrow ADD and have symptoms that interfere with theirwhole lives. The statistics say that at least half of those children diagnosedwith ADD will have disabling symptoms into adulthood.As I mentioned above, according to one study, 75 percent of people withuntreated ADD have interpersonal problems. Why? In my lectures I often ask theaudience the following question: “How many of you are married?” Many in theaudience raise their hands. I continue, “Is it helpful for you to say everythingyou think in your marriage?” The audience laughs. “Of course not,” I continue.“Relationships require tact. They require forethought. But when you have lowactivity in the front part of your brain, as most people with ADD do, you oftensay the first thing that comes into your mind, which hurts other people’sfeelings.”The brain is a sneaky organ. We all have weird, crazy, stupid, sexual, violentthoughts that no one should ever hear. It is the front part of our brain thatprotects us from saying those stupid thoughts out loud. It acts as the brain’sbrake. I was once at a conference with one of my friends who has ADD and a braininjury. Two obese women were sitting in front of us talking about their weightproblem. One woman said to the other, “I don’t know why I am so fat. I eat likea bird.” My friend looked at me and said, loud enough for everyone around us tohear, “Yeah, like a condor.” I looked at my friend in total embarrassment.Horrified, my friend put her hand over her mouth and said, “Oh my God, did thatthought get out?” I nodded yes as the women moved away from us in disgust.I agree that many physicians reach for stimulant medications too quickly andthat we should try natural treatments first. Yet, when used cautiously,stimulant medications such as Adderall or Ritalin, are generally safe andeffective. Ritalin was approved for use in the United States some fifty yearsago. We know a great deal about these medications. Work done at Harvarddemonstrated that children treated for ADD have a lower risk than nontreatedchildren for drug abuse. In Sweden, researchers report lower arrest records forpeople with ADD while they are taking their medication. Typically, untreated ADDhas more side effects than these medications when they are properly prescribed.But to effectively treat ADD, a comprehensive Four Circles approach to treatmentis essential and must include education, support, exercise, nutrition, dietarysupplements, and then, if needed, medication. Unfortunately, medications are theonly treatments given to the vast majority of people diagnosed with ADD inAmerica.Why are there so many myths and negative reactions about ADD when trainedphysicians know so much about it? The answer is simple. Until now you couldn’tsee ADD. Children, teens, and adults with ADD look like everyone else. Unlessyou know the story of an ADD person’s life, you can’t see that he or she hasADD.Based on our research with tens of thousands of ADD patients, using brain SPECTimaging, we have been able to see the systems in the brain that are troubled andwhy ADD has such a negative impact on behavior. By actually seeing ADD, themyths fade away and a new era of understanding and effective treatment unfolds.HALLMARK SYMPTOMS OF ADDThe hallmark symptoms of ADD are short attention span, distractibility,disorganization, procrastination, and poor internal supervision. Some femalesare hyperactive, but many are not.Short attention span is the key symptom of ADD, but it is not short attentionspan for everything. People with ADD have trouble with regular, routine,everyday attention—the kind of attention that makes life work, such as gettingyour homework done, paying bills on time, cleaning the house, doing your expensereport at work, listening to your spouse, or consistently taking yoursupplements or medication, extremely difficult. For things that are new, novel,highly stimulating, interesting, or frightening, people with ADD can payattention just fine. It is as though they need stimulation in order to payattention, which is why they go to scary movies, engage in high-risk activities,and tend to be conflict seeking in their relationships. Many people with ADDplay this “Let’s Have a Problem” game. If they are upset, they can focus and mayeven overfocus on the problem. This trait often fools people, even doctors,because if you can pay attention to things you love but not most other things,then people do not think you have ADD; they just think you are lazy.Distractibility is another common symptom. Most of us can block out things we donot need to think about. Not people with ADD. Their thoughts and conversationstend to bounce around. Their monkey mind is hyperactive. People with ADD alsotend to feel everything. They hate garment tags and their clothes have to bejust right or they get upset. They are often sensitive to touch and may needwhite noise at night to sleep; otherwise they hear everything in the house.Distractibility often affects a woman’s ability to have an orgasm. As mentioned,what does an orgasm require? Attention! You have to pay attention to the feelinglong enough to make it happen. After properly treating ADD, many people’s sexlives get much better.Many people with ADD are disorganized. Their rooms, desks, drawers, and closetsare often a mess. They are also often disorganized about time and tend to belate. You can tell the ADD people at work because they are always ten minuteslate and usually show up with a big cup of coffee in their hands. Many peoplewith ADD self-medicate with stimulants, such as caffeine and nicotine.And many people with ADD have what I call poor internal supervision. They don’tthink before they say things and they don’t think before they do things, whichgets them into lots of hot water. Many people with ADD also have trouble withlong-term goals. The moment is what matters to them, not five moments from nowor ten moments from now but now. They wait until the last minute to get thingsdone and have trouble saving for retirement. They also take what I call a crisismanagement approach to life. It seems as though their life goes from one crisisto the next.Our research shows that ADD primarily affects the following areas of the brain: • PFC—the brain’s controller of concentration, attention span, judgment,organization, planning, and impulse control • Anterior cingulate gyrus—the brain’s gear shifter • Temporal lobes—the brain’s housing for memory and experience • Basal ganglia—the area that produces and processes theneurotransmitter dopamine that drives the PFC • Deep limbic system—the brain’s mood control center • Cerebellum—the area of the brain that helps coordinate thoughts[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_041_r1.jpg]EFFECTIVELY TREATING ADDBelow I will talk about six different types of ADD and how it is important toknow your type in order to get the best help. However, there are a number oftreatments common to all people with ADD, for which no prescription is required.1. Take a multiple vitamin every day. Studies have reported that they helppeople with learning and help prevent chronic illness. No matter what type ofADD you or your child has, take a multiple vitamin and mineral supplement a day.When I was in medical school, the professor who taught our course in nutritionsaid that if people eat a balanced diet, they do not need vitamin or mineralsupplements. However, balanced diets are a thing of the past for many of ourfast-food families. In my experience, ADD families in particular have problemswith planning and tend to eat out much more frequently than non-ADD families.Protect yourself and your children by taking a multiple vitamin and mineralsupplement.In a 1988 study published in the British journal Lancet, ninety children betweenthe ages of twelve and thirteen were divided into three groups. One group tookno tablet, one group took a typical multiple vitamin and mineral tablet, and thelast group took a tablet that looked and tasted just like the vitamin andmineral tablet yet contained no vitamins or minerals. The results of thiswell-controlled study was that the group that took the vitamin and mineraltablet had a significant increase in nonverbal intelligence; the other twogroups showed no difference at all. The subclinical vitamin and mineraldeficiency may have contributed to these students’ performing below theirabilities.2. Supplement your diet with omega-3 fatty acids. People with ADD have beenfound to have low levels of omega-3 three fatty acids in their blood, and thereare three double-blind studies that indicate the value of omega-3s. Omega-3scontain two major components, EPA (eicosapetaenoic acid) and DHA(docosahexaenoic acid). EPA tends to be more helpful for people with ADD. Foradults, I recommend taking 2,000–4,000 mg a day; for children, 1,000–2,000 mg.3. Eliminate caffeine and nicotine. They both interfere with sleep and decreasethe effectiveness of other treatments.4. Engage in regular exercise for forty-five minutes four times a week. Long,brisk walks do just fine.5. Decrease television viewing, videogame playing, cell phone time, and use ofother electronic devices to no more than an hour a day. This may be hard forall, but it can make a huge difference.6. Treat food as a drug—because it is one. Most people with ADD do best whenthey follow the brain-healthy food program described in chapter 5[Amen_9780307888969_epub_c05_r1.htm]. In a 2008 study from Holland, researchersfound that putting children on a restricted elimination diet reduced ADDsymptoms by more than 50 percent in 73 percent of children, which is basicallythe same effectiveness of stimulant medication without any of the side effects.Elimination diets are not easy to do. Basically, during the study, the childrencould only eat rice, turkey, lamb, vegetables, fruits, margarine, vegetable oil,tea, pear juice, and water. But the results were stunning. Elimination diets maybe a place to start; later, other foods can be added back, which will allow youto see what items may be causing the abnormal behaviors. Working with anutritionist may make a big difference. In this study the researchers also foundthat the children’s moods and oppositional behaviors were improved as well.7. Never yell at people with ADD. Many people with ADD are conflict orexcitement seeking, as a means of stimulation. They can be masters at makingother people mad or angry. Do not lose your temper with them. If they get you toexplode, their unconscious, low-energy PFC lights up and likes it. Never letyour anger be their medication. They can get addicted to it.When you effectively treat someone with ADD, you can change their whole life.Then why are medications like Ritalin and Adderall so controversial? Becausethey work for some people with ADD, but they make other people much worse. UntilI started doing scans, I did not know why. What I found out from imaging wasthat ADD was not one type but could be at least six different types, and givingeveryone the same treatment helped some people but created disasters in others.Here is a brief description of the six types and treatments:Type 1: Classic ADD—Patients exhibit primary ADD symptoms (short attention span,distractibility, disorganization, procrastination, and a lack of forwardthinking) plus hyperactivity, restlessness, and impulsivity. On SPECT scans, wesee decreased activity in the PFC and cerebellum, especially with concentration.It is usually diagnosed earlier in life. For this type, I use stimulatingsupplements that boost dopamine in the brain, such as green tea, L-tyrosine, orrhodiola or, if they are ineffective, stimulant medications (such as Adderall,Concerta, Ritalin, or Strattera). I have also found that a higher-protein,lower-simple-carbohydrate diet can be very helpful.Type 2: Inattentive ADD—Patients exhibit primary ADD symptoms plus low energyand motivation, spaciness, and a tendency to be internally preoccupied. On SPECTscans, we see decreased activity in the PFC and cerebellum, especially withconcentration. Type 2 is diagnosed later in life, if at all. It is more commonin girls. These are quiet kids and adults, often labeled lazy, unmotivated, andnot that smart. For this type, I use stimulating supplements that boost dopaminein the brain, such as green tea, L-tyrosine, or rhodiola or, if they areineffective, stimulant medications (such as Adderall, Concerta, Ritalin, orStrattera). I have also found that a higher-protein, lower-simple-carbohydratediet can be very helpful.Type 3: Overfocused ADD—Patients exhibit primary ADD symptoms plus cognitiveinflexibility, trouble shifting attention, a tendency to get stuck on negativethoughts or behaviors, a propensity for worrying and grudge holding, and a needfor sameness; in addition, they tend to be argumentative and oppositional. Theseindividuals are often seen in families with alcoholism, addiction problems, orobsessive-compulsive tendencies. On SPECT scans, we see decreased activity inthe PFC with concentration plus increased anterior cingulate activity, whichcauses them to get stuck on negative thoughts or behaviors. Stimulants, bythemselves, usually make this type worse, as people become more focused on thethings that bother them. For this type, I often start with simple supplementsthat boost both serotonin, such as 5-HTP, and dopamine, such as green tea orL-tyrosine. If I need to use medications for this type, I generally start withEffexor, or use a combination of an SSRI, like Prozac, with a stimulant. I alsorecommend a diet balanced between healthy proteins and smart carbohydrates.Type 4: Temporal Lobe ADD—Patients exhibit primary ADD symptoms plus tend tohave short fuses, periods of anxiety, headaches or abdominal pain, darkthoughts, memory problems, and difficulties reading; they sometimes misinterpretcomments. Often there is a history of head injury in the past or a familyhistory of rages. On SPECT scans, we see decreased activity in the PFC withconcentration and decreased temporal lobe activity. Stimulants, by themselves,usually make people with this type more irritable. In considering supplementsfor this type, I generally use a combination of a stimulating supplement, suchas green tea or L-tyrosine, along with GABA to help calm and stabilize moods. Ifmemory or learning is an issue, I will use green tea or L-tyrosine withmemory-enhancing supplements such as ginkgo, vinpocetine, and huperzine A. Ifmedicine is needed, I generally prescribe a combination of anticonvulsantmedications (such as Neurontin) and stimulants, along with a higher-proteindiet.Type 5: Limbic ADD—Patients exhibit primary ADD symptoms plus chronic mildsadness, negativity, low energy, low self-esteem, irritability, socialisolation, and poor appetite and sleep patterns. On SPECT scans, we seedecreased activity in the PFC at rest and with concentration and increased deeplimbic activity. Stimulants, by themselves, usually cause problems with reboundor cause depressive symptoms. This type is generally effectively treated withthe stimulating supplement SAMe or the stimulating antidepressant Wellbutrin.Supplement alternatives to SAMe include L-tyrosine or DL-phenylalanine.Type 6: Ring of Fire ADD—Patients exhibit primary ADD symptoms plus extrememoodiness, anger outbursts, oppositional traits, inflexibility, fast thoughts,excessive talking, and sensitivity to sounds and lights. I refer to this type asring of fire because of the intense ring of overactivity that I saw on the brainscans of affected people. This type is usually made much worse with stimulantsif used alone. For this type, I usually start with a supplement combination ofGABA, 5-HTP, and L-tyrosine. Sometimes a stimulant may also be needed.Medication alternatives include a combination of an anticonvulsant (such asNeurontin), SSRI, and a stimulant.Knowing your type is essential to getting the right help for yourself. If thesedescriptions are not clear enough, consider contacting one of our clinics(www.amenclinics.com [http://www.amenclinics.com]).ADD IN INTIMATE RELATIONSHIPSCircle the statements that apply to your intimate partner (if you have one): 1. Do you feel your partner often does not listen to you? 2. Do you often feel that you cannot trust your partner to follow through onsomething he or she promised to do? 3. Do you feel your partner often puts things off until the last minute? 4. Do you feel your partner often embarrasses you in front of others bythoughtless words or actions? 5. Is your partner often late or in a hurry? 6. Do you feel your partner often starts problems just for the sake ofhaving a fight? 7. Do you feel that you’re always the one chasing down your partner to talkabout an important issue? 8. Does your partner often go into a rage with little or no provocation? 9. Is your partner sensitive to noise or touch? 10. Does your partner often make spur-of-the-moment decisions that he or sheregrets later on? 11. Does your partner get resentful or bored with the everyday tasks ofliving? 12. Is your partner especially hard to get up or grumpy in the morning? 13. Does your partner have trouble verbalizing his or her intimate feelings?If more than four statements are checked, there is a suspicion that adult ADDmay be affecting your partner. Getting the right help can improve yourrelationship.ADD can ruin relationships, as the following five vignettes illustrate.STORY 1: DISTANCE AND FRUSTRATIONRhonda was the office manager for her husband’s medical practice. Samuel was afamily doctor with a very busy practice. Samuel wanted his wife to work in thepractice to protect the family assets and oversee the employees. Initially,Rhonda was happy to help, but soon she found her work overwhelming. She hadtrouble managing the office and home life. The two children (Billie, age eight,and Sarah, age five) began to act up more with both parents gone during the day.Before Rhonda went to work with Samuel, she was able to do the housework andkeep some semblance of order at home. After going to work, however, she becamecompletely disorganized. Her lack of concentration at work caused her to put inextraordinarily long hours, which left her feeling always behind and frustratedat home. Samuel saw how disorganized his wife was and offered to help. Rhondasaw his gesture as a slap in the face of her ability “to be like all of theother women who work and maintain families.” Rhonda’s lack of focus andfollow-through caused things to slip through the cracks at work, and she becamecompletely overwhelmed by the disorganization at home. She came to see me whenshe was on the verge of quitting her job and maybe even quitting her marriage.It took work with both her and her husband to get things back on track.STORY 2: CHRONIC CONFLICTSally and George were very passionate about each other at first. They had a veryintense relationship. After their marriage, they spent nearly every wakingmoment with each other in a family business. Unfortunately, they started tofight, and over time the fighting became constant. The fights were mostly overlittle things, but they occurred at a continual level and always included anegative word or dig toward the other person. It seemed that there was somedrive in the relationship toward turmoil. Nowhere was this more evident than onthe day of an important business negotiation. Sally was the main negotiator forthe business. Before most important negotiations, Sally would deliberately picka fight with George. This caused tremendous uproar and pain. Yelling, cursing,throwing things, and threats of divorce were common events during theseblow-ups. “Sally thrived on the fights,” George said. “I never understood howshe could go from hating me to being as cool as a cucumber during thenegotiation meeting. She was a master at negotiation after fights.” George alsonoted that without a fight Sally wasn’t as calm during other business meetings.“It was like the fight was her drug,” he said. The conflict seemed to make herbetter at work, but it was tearing apart their marriage. It was only after theirmarital therapist recognized that Sally suffered from ADD (and after subsequenttreatment) that their marriage was able to make the turnaround that both of themso desperately wanted.STORY 3: SPOUSAL ABUSEThere seemed to always be trouble between Bob and Beth. Even their courtship wasrocky with many breakups and makeups. They met in high school, introduced byfriends at a party. Both of them had used a fair amount of drugs, includingmarijuana and alcohol. Bob also used a significant amount of cocaine. He said ithelped him study and do better at work. Both had family problems. And neitherone of them was much interested in school. They got married after Beth becamepregnant. Fighting became a regular part of their lives together, especially onthe nights when alcohol was involved. Beth was not one to back away from afight. In fact, her husband nicknamed her “the War Department” because, as heclaimed, she seemed to frequently start fights when no problems were present.Bob admittedly had a very short fuse, and the drinking and drug use totally tookaway any self-control he had. On several occasions, the police were called bythe neighbors who heard screaming coming from their home. After severalincidents of “mutual spousal abuse,” the judge ordered a psychiatric evaluationof both parties. At first, the couple laughed off the evaluation, but when thecounselor made them look at their lives together (the drug abuse, constantfighting, continued underachievement, and negative impact their behavior washaving on their son), they started to take the situation seriously. Both partiesmade significant improvements with a combination of treatments, includingtherapy, dietary supplements, and medication. After their rocky start, youwouldn’t recognize the couple now.STORY 4: DIVORCEHal and Kathy were very much in love when they first got married. They had a lotin common, were very passionate with each other, and seemed to share commongoals. At first, Kathy loved Hal’s spontaneity. She had some trouble looseningup, but Hal made her laugh and gave her permission to let her hair down. Afterseveral months of marriage, however, Kathy became very frustrated with Hal. Hewas often late coming home, forgetting to call her. He didn’t finish tasks hestarted. He refused to pick up his own clothes or his dishes from the table. Hesaid hurtful things to Kathy without thinking. Kathy found that she was becominga nag. She hated the feeling. The distance between Hal and Kathy grew to thepoint where both of them thought of having affairs. When Hal gave in to thetemptation, their marriage ended in divorce.STORY 5: SUICIDEJohn was described by his mother as “three boys in one.” He was very active andmischievous as a toddler. He was tested as intellectually gifted in the secondgrade but by fourth grade felt bored with school. His school performance took amajor nosedive after the ninth grade, and he dropped out of school in his junioryear. He then entered the Marine Corps, where he excelled with militarystructure. After he got out of the service, he married his sweetheart andstarted to work for the sheriff’s department in his small Midwestern hometown.Because of his restlessness he started to drink too much. There were nights whenhe was so drunk, he would beat his wife. On two occasions, he raped her. Shortlybefore his wife took his newborn son and left him, he was fired from his job asa sheriff for stealing a one-ounce shot glass while he was intoxicated. Aftershe divorced him, he married three other women. None of the relationships workedout. He drifted from job to job and could not settle down. Finally, out ofdesperation and feeling like a chronic failure, he shot and killed himself atthe age of thirty-six.ADD was a contributing factor in all of the above stories for one or bothparties. These are not unusual stories. Untreated ADD often has a seriousnegative impact on every aspect of a female’s life, whether she has it herselfor someone she cares about does.WHEN TREATMENT WORKSI keep a notepad in my desk to write down what people tell me during theirfollow-up visits to the clinic. The following are actual comments from women whowere treated for ADD:“I experienced an increased awareness of the world around me. I saw the hillsfor the first time when driving to work. I saw the bay when I crossed over thebridge. I actually noticed the color of the sky!”“I experienced a 180-degree difference in my attitude.”“My husband said he doesn’t have a knot in his stomach anymore.”“I look at my children and say, ‘Aren’t they cute?’ rather than complainingabout them.”“I could enjoy the moment. My thoughts are calmer, quieter, and easier to livewith.”“I could sit and watch a movie for the first time in my life.”“I am able to handle situations where I used to be hysterical. I am able to seewhen I’m starting to overreact.”“The lens on my life is much clearer.”“I was tremendously overscheduled. No sane person would do that!”“It amazes me that a simple treatment can take me from wanting to jump off thebridge to loving my husband and enjoying my children.”“It is like being given sight!”“I’m not running at train-wreck speed.”“For the first time, I felt in charge of my life.”“I’m better able to keep things in perspective.”“I used to think I was stupid. It seemed everyone else could do more things thanme. I’m starting to believe that there may be intelligent life in my body.”“My appetite is more normal.”“I’m out of the damned black hole I was in.”“I used to be the kind of person who would go walking by myself in downtownDetroit at 2 a.m. Now, on the medication, I would never do something so stupid.Before, I just wouldn’t think about the consequences.”“Now I can give talks in front of groups. Before, my mind would always go blank.I organized my life around not speaking in public. Now my brain feels calmer,clearer.”“I feel like I think everyone else feels.”“I’m not as intimidated by others like I used to be.”“My husband may not be as happy as before I was on treatment. Now I can thinkand he doesn’t win all of the arguments. I’m going to have to retrain him to notalways expect to get his way.”“I’m not losing my temper.”“It’s like waking up after being asleep your whole life.”“I feel in control of my life.”“Six months ago there was no way I would drive on L.A. freeways. Now I can driveon them with no problem.”“I can’t stand useless confrontation, and I used to thrive on it!”WHY I AM SO PASSIONATE ABOUT HELPING FEMALES WITH ADDOn the surface, Breanne, my oldest daughter, was the perfect child. She wasalways easy, always sweet, her room was always clean, and she worked hard inschool, but the truth is I never thought she was very smart. It deeply saddensme to write this, but that was how I felt. I had to teach her simple things overand over, and she did not learn her times tables until she was in fifth grade.When she was in third grade, I had her tested by a colleague, who basically toldme the same thing, that she wasn’t that smart. She didn’t say it that way, but Icould read between the lines. But the psychologist said Breanne would be okaybecause she worked so hard. In fact, in eighth grade Breanne won a presidentialscholar award, not for academics but for effort.In her sophomore year, however, things started to fall apart. She was in acollege prep school and stayed up every night until one or two o’clock in themorning to get her homework done. Then one night, while studying biology, shecame to me in tears and said she thought she could never be as smart as herfriends. It broke my heart. The next day I pulled up her original brain scanfrom when she was eight years old. When I first started to do scans in 1991, Iscanned everyone I knew. I had scanned my three kids, my mother, even myself. Atthe time, I only had the experience of someone who had seen fifty scans. Now,seven years later, I had seen thousands of scans. With experienced eyes, I washorrified with what I saw. Breanne had low overall activity, especially in thefront part of her brain.I came home that night and told Breanne what I saw and told her I wanted to geta new scan. Because of the injection required for the scan, she protested. “Idon’t want a scan, Dad. All you think about are scans.” But I am a childpsychiatrist. I know how to get my way with kids. I felt this was very importantand so I asked her what it would take to get a scan. She told me she wanted atelephone line in her room. I started to think that maybe she was smarter than Ithought. Her new SPECT study was virtually identical to the one seven yearsearlier. I cried when I saw it.The next night, after giving her a low dose of medication, I re-scanned her, andher brain normalized. Breanne’s learning struggles had nothing to do with herintelligence. The low activity in her brain was limiting the access she had toher own brain. I put her on a low dose of medicine along with specific dietarysupplements. A few days later she said that learning was much easier for her.She started bringing home A’s on her tests, which had never happened before.When she went to biology class, she said she understood concepts for the firsttime. Usually a shy child in class, she started raising her hand, and evenparticipated in debates. At dinner one night, she winked at me and said, “Ikicked butt in a debate today.” This was not the same child I knew. Four monthsafter her scan, she got straight A’s for the first time in her life. Sherepeated the feat all the way through high school and most of college. Aftercollege, Breanne was able to get into the University of Edinburgh, one of thebest veterinarian schools in the world. She has a completely differentperception of herself—one that fits her reality of being smart, competent, andable to look forward to a bright future. Even though Breanne decided not to goto the University of Edinburgh because she had just given birth to her firstchild, she knew she was good enough to be accepted, which made all thedifference in her sense of self.Whenever I tell Breanne’s story at lectures, many women come up to me afterwardwith tears in their eyes and tell me that they can relate to her. If only theyhad known, how life would have been different for them. “You cannot change thepast,” I tell them, “but you can certainly start where you are now and work hardto change the future.” I want your future to be the best it can be so that youcan unleash the power of your female brain, no matter where you start from.HOUR 8 EXERCISE—KNOW YOUR FOCUS AND ENERGY ROBBERS AND BOOSTERSFirst, if you think you might have ADD, talk to your health care provider.

It is the caring that shelovingly gives, the passion that she shows. The beauty of a woman grows with thepassing years.—AUDREY HEPBURNAfter a long trip, Tana and I landed at LAX, tired and ready to find our car sowe could head home. Ahead of us on the Jetway was an older woman who lookedconfused. She was trying to ask the uniformed flight attendant for help, but theairline employee was distracted and brushed her off. Tana, seeing the fear inthe elderly woman’s eyes, immediately stepped in. She established eye contactand took the time to listen to her. Her husband had just died, the woman toldTana, and she came to L.A. to be with her son. She said her husband usually tookcare of getting them where they needed to be. Tana grabbed her arm and guidedher to baggage claim to wait to meet her son. As I watched Tana take care ofthis woman, I thought to myself that she had never looked more beautiful. Eventhough most people think about beauty as a specific size, shape, or color, truebeauty is about attitude, connection, and making a difference.One day at work, I got a voice mail from a woman who was famous for her beauty.As I listened to the message, I remember catching my breath. Yet an hour aftermeeting her, I never thought of her as beautiful again. Her attitude, manner,and self-centeredness took away any attraction. I remember feeling odd at howfast any attraction to her I might have felt had vanished.No doubt, being beautiful on the outside makes men pay attention to you, but ifit is not consistent with beauty on the inside, it quickly fades and even turnstoxic.Likewise, I have met many women who were not stunning on the outside, but theirsense of humor, passion, caring, intelligence, and the way they carriedthemselves made me look forward to seeing them. Their ability to attract peopleto them was deeper and longer lasting.What does it mean to be beautiful? Artists, poets, and fashion designers havedebated the definition of beauty since the beginning of time. If you’re tryingto meet the ideal of any one of them, you’ll drive yourself crazy, make yourselfmiserable, and miss out on the most effective beauty treatment of all. That’sbecause the best way to become your most beautiful self is to work from theinside out to nourish and nurture your unique brand of beauty. That’s how youbecome irresistible.None of this implies, however, that appearance on the outside is irrelevant.Ultimately, men are attracted to women who appear healthy. A man tends to beattracted to a symmetrical, fertile, healthy-looking woman. His genetic brain islooking at a woman and deciding whether or not he wants his children to carryher genes. Unconsciously, we look for signs of health, such as clear skin andbright eyes. A number of scientists believe that body symmetry also plays acritical role in our view of beauty. The theory behind this notion is thatasymmetrical features give clues to underlying health problems that could yieldmore troubled offspring. In a study at the University of New Mexico, collegemales found symmetrical female faces more attractive than asymmetrical faces. Inaddition, women who were blessed with symmetry had a history of more sexualpartners and tended to lose their virginity at an earlier age.Having the best brain possible will help you be more beautiful on the inside andout. Did you know that the health of your skin is a reflection of the health ofyour brain? If you have healthy processes in your body, you will both look andfunction more vibrantly. Likewise, good health habits, such as sleep, greatnutrition, exercise, and some simple supplements boost attractiveness; poorhealth habits, such as smoking, overeating, and chronic stress, make you lookand feel older than you are.FROM BODY OBSESSION TO SELF-POSSESSIONYes, it’s true that men like to look at women. We can’t help it, any more thanyou can help looking at men. Fifty percent of both male and female brains arededicated to vision. Before a potential partner gets to enjoy your thoughtfuldisposition, sense of humor, or intelligence, he sees what you look like.Whether he decides to pursue you depends on whether he likes what he sees. Soyou want to take care of your physical appearance.But what he finds attractive about you may not be what you think.Every man has a unique ideal of beauty, and it probably has nothing to do withthat anorexic model on the cover of Vogue that many young women try to emulate.Some men like slender women, but many men prefer those who are more substantial.If you surveyed a large number of men from different cultures, you’d learn thatwhat they consider attractive covers a wide array of shapes and sizes, hair andeye color. What men say they want includes a broad spectrum of types.But what they say they like may be irrelevant. Research from the University ofSheffield and the University of Montpellier in France indicates that there arehuge differences between how people (both men and women) describe their idealpartner and whom they actually select as a mate. Love and attraction have alogic of their own that can completely override our conscious ideas of beauty.What actually draws us to one another is different from what we think. And yet,more than ever we seem to be obsessed with making ourselves fit someunattainable, narrow ideal image of beauty. And in the process we may beignoring what really counts.To get an idea of the extent of this obsession, all you have to do is look atsome of the most current statistics for plastic surgery. According to theAmerican Society of Plastic Surgeons, in 2011, 13.8 million cosmetic procedureswere performed, which was a 5 percent increase over the number of procedures in2010. This was during a recession. There were 1.6 million surgeries, includingface-lifts and breast augmentations, and 12.2 million “minimally invasive”procedures, including Botox injections, soft-tissue fillers, and laser hairremoval. Altogether, this represents expenditures of $10.4 billion.Women want to look younger, shapelier, and less hairy. And this includesteenagers ranging from ages thirteen to nineteen, who made up 2 percent of thetotal procedures, and women between ages twenty and twenty-nine, who accountedfor close to 800,000 procedures. The largest percentage of procedures involvedwomen between ages forty and forty-five, with 6.4 million procedures—peoplewanting to maintain their youth or perhaps correct issues that have botheredthem for years, like a bump on her nose or breasts that she feels are too small.But it must be that many of these procedures were not enough to fix “theproblem.” The number of patients returning for additional procedures increasedby 8 percent in 2011.So lots of work is taking place. But isn’t it ironic? If you were asked to tellabout the most truly beautiful women you’ve known in your life, the way youwould describe them probably has little to do with the shape of their noses orthe size of their breasts. You would more likely say things like this:“She exuded confidence and love.”“She seemed so alive.”“She had a wonderful energy about her. She seemed so healthy and vibrant.”“Her eyes shone. Her skin glowed.”“She was so alert and intelligent.”“She made me feel comfortable.”“She looked so happy.”“She made me feel good about myself.”What makes a woman truly unforgettable stems from her inner qualities that arethen reflected outwardly. And those qualities have their basis in the part ofher body that really runs the show: her brain.It isn’t that beauty is skin deep. It’s that real beauty is brain deep. A prettyface doesn’t hurt, but there’s more to being pretty than the size of your eyesor how full your lips are. A woman can have perfect features, but if she’sangry, sneering, depressed, or self-absorbed, she will not be nearly asattractive as she could be. On the other hand, a woman with irregular featuresand a crooked smile can be devastatingly beautiful if she has a beautifulattitude toward life.Many years ago I watched an interview with the French actress Jeanne Moreau. Shemust have been in her sixties at the time. She had never had plastic surgery orany cosmetic procedures, and she definitely looked her age. But there wassomething so appealing about her, and yes, sexy, because she was so honest,intelligent, sensuous, and confident in the person she was. She had enormousunderstanding of the world and the human heart. It would be hard to sayspecifically what made her so beautiful. The French would say she had a qualityof je ne sais quoi—that certain something that can never be described,explained, or fully understood but that others can sense unmistakably. That’swhat Jeanne Moreau had. You could tell that the interviewer felt it. He wasintrigued by her.The good news is that any woman can have those same attractive qualities. And itdoesn’t require any exotic treatments or expensive surgical procedures. Itstarts by working on your inner health instead, by developing brain-healthyhabits and nurturing a beautiful attitude toward yourself and your life.There is so much you can do, starting today, that can help you uncover thebeautiful, sensuous, wildly attractive woman who is already living inside youand is just waiting to be released. In this chapter, I’ll give you strategies tohelp your brain and body look amazing.So this is your choice. You can spend tens of thousands of dollars on plasticsurgery, which will likely just lead to more procedures. Maybe you’ll be happywith the results, but there’s no guarantee that you’ll ever look good enough inyour own eyes. And one thing you can be certain of is that it will involve agreat deal of time, money, and pain. Your alternative is to work on getting yourbrain, mind, and body as healthy as possible. The first place to start is withyour thoughts about your body.MOST WOMEN HATE THEIR BODIESIf you are like the vast majority of women, you hate your body. In a recentGlamour survey of three hundred women, a whopping 97 percent of women hadnegative things to say about their bodies in a typical day. Their typicalself-descriptions included:“You are a fat, worthless pig.”“You’re too thin. No man is ever going to want you.”“Ugly. Big. Gross.”Some of the survey participants reported that critical thoughts about theirbodies were “fleeting.” But for others the problem was more serious. Theysuffered from self-punishing thoughts about their bodies continually. Overall itwas reported that the average woman had thirteen of these negative thoughtsevery day. And some women were so prone to this form of self-abuse, theyexperienced up to one hundred such thoughts every day.Sadly, the negativity starts early. In a University of Florida study, nearlyhalf of girls from three to six years old thought they were fat, and nearly athird wanted to change something about their bodies. And it looks like many ofthem are doing something about it. A study of ten-year-old girls by the Keep ItReal campaign—a joint effort between Miss Representation, the SPARK Movement,Love Social, Endangered Bodies, and I Am That Girl—yielded shocking results. Upto 80 percent of them have been on at least one diet at some point in theirlives.If a guy said the awful things to you that you say to yourself, you would thinkhe was the worst human being alive and should be punished. Yet most womencontinue to talk that way to themselves.Another interesting finding from the Glamour study, which makes perfect sense tome, as a psychiatrist, is that if a woman was dissatisfied with her career orrelationship, she was much more likely to be unhappy with her body. Anyuncomfortable emotions, such as stress, loneliness, or even boredom, started tomagnify the negative body image chatter.UNBRIDLED THOUGHTS CAUSE RAMPANTFEMALE SUFFERINGShortly after we first met, Tana and I went to a workshop given by my friendByron Katie at Esalen in Big Sur, on the coast of north-central California. Tanais a beautiful woman on the outside and inside, and I am not saying that justbecause she will likely read this. It shocked me to learn of her insecurities.Toward the end of the weekend conference, Katie, as her friends call her, askedus to write down our thoughts about why we hate our bodies. With Tana’spermission, I quote from what she later wrote in her journal.FROM TANA’S JOURNALI sat with my eyes closed reclining in a cocoon of pillows, overlooking thecrashing waves of the Pacific Ocean. Hearing the deep, strained voice of a womandescribing the reasons she hated her body, I was abruptly jolted from mypeaceful state. Her list sounded almost identical to mine.“I hate my body because I’m too fat, I’m too old, I get sick too often, my bodybetrays me, I hate my thighs and my butt, I hate the skin around my eyes …”Her voice sounded older than mine, and I could tell that she was heavy. I openedmy eyes to see who was speaking. I was stunned. The woman speaking weighed atleast 300 pounds. How could her list be exactly like mine? I felt myselfbecoming tense and anxious, not understanding the root of my discomfort. I washaving a difficult time taking a deep breath. Trying not to let my emotionsshow, I closed my eyes again and focused on the sound of the waves outside.Slowly I regained my balance and began to relax.Another woman stood up and said, “I hate my body because I am fat, dumpy, andmiddle-aged, and my husband left me for a younger woman.” The woman wasconvinced that all of her problems stemmed from the fact that she wasn’t prettyenough, thin enough, or able to manipulate men enough! She actually said that!While these may not be the exact words, the dialogue went something like this:“I hate my life. I know it would be different if I could be skinny, younger, andmore beautiful.”“What do you hate about your body?” said Byron Katie, a beautiful woman in herearly sixties who exuded a sense of peace and joy.“It’s too fat, too old, and it sags. If I could be younger and have a hard body,my life would be different. My husband left me for a twenty-six-year-old woman.She’s skinny and beautiful. She can have any man she wants. Life is differentfor women like that.”“So you want to be able to have the same control over your husband that theother woman has?”“Yes. I want to be young and beautiful and have a beautiful body so I canmanipulate men.”“So you don’t necessarily want him to love you because he does; you want to beable to manipulate him.”“Yes. I want to be one of those women who are beautiful and able to manipulatemen and make them fall in love with me.”Daniel had been encouraging me to interact in small ways throughout the weekendand I told him he must have been smoking some of the hemp the hippies weremaking rope from! All weekend I had been listening to others stand up anddiscuss their past traumas, hang-ups, addictions, and I vacillated betweenenvying their candor and thinking they were completely nuts to expose themselvesin front of strangers.Unexpectedly, without forethought, I found myself on my feet! It was literallyas though someone was lifting me off the ground and a voice that was not minebegan to speak. I was a puppet and someone else was pulling the strings. Iseemed to have no choice in the matter. Trembling, I stood holding my journal inmy hand. There I was in my size 2 jeans, perfectly made up, with a body fat of16 percent. I stood facing the woman, resembling the beautifultwenty-six-year-old, manipulative woman she had been describing. Though a decadeolder, few people guessed my age as a result of my physical condition.Swallowing the boulder in my throat, I began to read to her from my journal withtears in my eyes, voice shaking.“I hate my body because it is not thin enough, it is not perfect enough, it gotcancer, it betrays me, and is getting old. I hate the scars I have from havingcancer and from my C-section. I hate the lines starting to form around my eyes.I hate that no matter how hard I work out, I always have a little loose skin onmy abdomen from having a baby. I wake up every morning and kick my own ass inthe gym regardless of how tired or sick I am, and then I stand in front of themirror picking myself apart, looking for flaws. It’s never good enough.”I paused for a moment before looking at the woman and continuing.“You think your life would be better if you could be a perfect size 4 and bemore beautiful, whatever that means. You would just have different problems. Butit’s never perfect enough.“Sometimes I’ve hated having so much pressure to look the way I did. There weretimes I wished I could go eat an entire pizza myself and not have peoplewatching and wondering if I was going to go throw it up! Sometimes I just wantedto blend in and not be seen at all. But then if you do blend in and no onenotices you, one day you go into a funk and wonder what’s wrong with you becauseyou’re so used to people giving you attention all the time. You can’t relaxeither way. Sometimes I just hate my body for getting older because I’mterrified that people won’t love me or value me any longer when I can’t keepthis up. I’m exhausted. And by the way, my first marriage still fell apart. Istill wasn’t good enough.”Biting back the tears threatening to spill onto my cheeks, I turned away as Inoticed every eye in the room watching me. Feeling incredibly foolish, Iregretted standing. The silence in the room was magnified by the pounding in myhead. I had never lost my cool and become emotional like that in front of agroup. I was sure these people were judging me and thinking I was just somebubble-headed bimbo who felt sorry for myself and who was looking for attention.I was formulating an exit strategy that would draw the least attention.Fortunately it was the last hour of the final day. I planned to bolt out thedoor without being noticed.It turned out that many women came up to Tana and told her what she shared wasvery meaningful to them. If, as a beautiful woman, she had exactly the samethoughts they had, they should accept their bodies and work on suffering lessand enjoying their lives more. I was very proud of Tana, but that conferenceseven years ago still sticks with me. Why do almost all women hate their bodies?And what can be done about it?Of course, the answer to the first question is not simple, and it is not justunrealistic images of thin women on television or magazine covers. The firstrecorded use of a corset was 2,000 BCE. As we have seen, a female’s brain isbusy, so many women are always thinking and worrying about what is not rightwith them. This is worsened by the lower serotonin levels females have comparedto males, which also ramp up worry. Then take the societal pressure and thecomparing women do with each other, and the negative thoughts set up a permanentresidence in your brain.The answer to the second question, what can be done about it, is morestraightforward. Here are four strategies to have a younger, more beautifulbrain and body.1. FOCUS ON BOOSTING THE HEALTH OF YOUR BRAINWith a better brain, you make better health decisions, which helps you look andfeel your best. I have had many women tell me that their partners report theylook years younger after just a few months on my brain-healthy program. It turnsout that what is good for your brain is also good for your skin. Here arestrategies that will help your brain and body look more beautiful.Get More Sleep—Sleep is one of the best beauty treatments there is. Well,consider the alternative. How do you feel after a night with not enough sleep?And how do you look? The puffy eyes. The listless expression. It’s hardly anappealing picture. And there are more serious consequences as well. Your brainreally suffers from chronic sleep deprivation, and that affects everything elseabout you, including your thinking, your mood, and your health. J. ChristianGillin, who studied the subject with his team at the University of California,San Diego, says lack of sleep can have serious effects on brain functioning. Hefound that on language-based tasks, his sleep-deprived subjects’ languagecenters shut down, even though overall their brains were very active, leading toa lot of work with little result.And not getting enough sleep can actually make you fat! Research from theUniversity of Chicago has found that people who are sleep-deprived tend to eatmore simple carbohydrates than people who have had adequate sleep. When you’resleepy, you head straight for the cookies and candy instead of the veggies,almond butter, and low-glycemic fruit. And it adds on the pounds. Researchers atCase Western University tracked the weight of more than 68,000 women over aperiod of sixteen years. The women who slept six hours or less per night weresignificantly heavier than those who slept seven hours or more. In fact,research from England’s University of Warwick found that sleep deprivationalmost doubles the risk of obesity in adults and children. Part of the reasonmay lie in the higher ghrelin levels (which stimulates appetite) and lowerleptin levels (the hormone that lets you know when you’re full) in people whosleep less. This was the finding in a Stanford University study that also foundhigher BMI levels in those not getting enough sleep. Other studies have shownincreased insulin resistance in the sleep deprived, leading to a greater risk ofdiabetes. Diabetes negatively affects blood flow, which can make you look olderand less attractive.So lack of sleep makes you puffy, cranky, stupid, and fat. Enough sleep—at leastseven hours a night—makes your skin glow, improves your mood, makes you smarter,and helps you lose weight.Remember that the next time you’re tempted to force your eyes to stay open soyou can watch that old movie on TV or finish reading your text messages. Askyourself who you really want to be the next morning. If you want to be beautifultomorrow, sleep tonight.Here are a few ideas that can help: • Maintain a regular sleep schedule. • Create a soothing, relaxing bedtime routine. • Avoid naps during the day. • Reserve your bedroom for sleeping and sex. Take out the phones,computers, and video games. • Avoid eating foods late in the day that could upset your system anddisturb your sleep. • Avoid caffeinated beverages in the late afternoon or evening. Theywill keep you up at night, and the next day you’ll need to drink more to stayawake—and the whole cycle will begin again.Boost Blood Flow to Your Brain and All Your Organs—Blood feeds your brain andbody oxygen and nutrients and takes away toxins. It helps to keep you vibrant,healthy, and working properly. Decreased blood flow can make you look old andwrinkled. If you want to look pretty and feel sexy, you have to be aware ofanything you might be doing that could be interfering with your circulation. Themost obvious culprits include smoking, drinking too much caffeine, sufferingfrom excessive stress, taking certain medications, and abusing drugs. One lessobvious cause may be in the food you’re eating. Trans fats, processed flours,sugar, and chemical additives can be reducing your blood flow. Plus, you mayhave hidden food allergies or intolerances that are adding to the problem.Keep Moving—Physical exercise is like a natural wonder drug for your brain andbody. It gets your heart to pump life-giving blood into your brain, supplyingmore oxygen, glucose, and nutrients that your brain needs to function at itsbest. The benefits of exercise are tremendous: • It encourages the growth of new brain cells. • It enhances cognitive ability. • It improves your mood, calms anxiety, and helps alleviate depression. • It fends off cognitive decline while helping to prevent, delay, andlessen the effects of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. • It enhances the ability of insulin to prevent high blood sugar levels,reducing the risk of diabetes. • It burns fat. • It helps ward off osteoporosis, breast cancer, and colon cancer. • It improves muscle tone and endurance, which lowers the risk of fallaccidents. • It reduces the symptoms of ADD. • It improves sleep. • It can help women better cope with hormonal issues. • It reduces the risk of high blood pressure, stroke, and heart disease.That’s a lot of benefit just for putting aside forty-five minutes four or moretimes a week to get your body moving. Plus, once you get over any initialresistance, it feels great. And those positive feelings seem to spill over intoother areas of your life too, and you’ll find yourself making healthier choices.People who are more physically active are also more likely to eat brain-healthyfoods, get more and better-quality sleep, seek out health-minded social supportsystems, and just take better care of themselves in general.So just get started. My exercise plan is really simple. Walk like you’re latefor an important meeting for forty-five minutes four times a week. In addition,you should lift light weights, working out each major muscle group twice a week.I never want you to hurt yourself, because it can put you out of commission formonths. My program is no pain, but lots of gain over time. Consistent exercisewill boost your circulation. Not only will your skin glow, the exercise willimprove the comfort you feel in your own body and builds your confidence. Andthat makes you beautiful.Balance Your Hormones—As we saw in chapter 4[Amen_9780307888969_epub_c04_r1.htm], a properly functioning brain and bodyrequire balanced hormones. When your hormones are optimized, you are much morelikely to look and feel happy, energetic, and at the top of your game. Your skinis tighter and looks younger. When your hormones are off, you can look and feelconfused, irritable, tired, and unable to concentrate. For example, low thyroidhormone is often accompanied by overall decreased brain activity, leaving youirritable, depressed, and unable to think clearly. It is also associated withdry skin, which makes you look older. Low testosterone levels in women not onlycan reduce interest in sex, but can also have a negative effect on memory. And,of course, the roller-coaster ride of female hormones related to PMS, and thenmenopause, can wreak havoc with a woman’s mood, her physical well-being, and hermemory and thought processes. Food cravings and weight issues also go hand inhand with hormones that are out of whack.More Sex?—You are thinking, “Of course a guy would think that,” but the researchalso backs it up. Sexual activity can boost hormones like estrogen and DHEA, andthat can promote smoother, tighter skin. Sex also increases levels of oxytocin,the bonding and trust hormone, and decreases levels of the stress hormonecortisol. Not only does this feel good immediately, but tests of longevity inmen show that greater frequency of orgasm is associated with increased lifespan. And women who have regular sex have been shown to have significantlyhigher levels of estrogen in their blood compared to women with infrequent or nosex. Estrogen helps maintain a healthy cardiovascular system, reduces badcholesterol, and increases good cholesterol and bone density and enhances skin.It also is beneficial to brain function.Another hormone that spikes during orgasm is DHEA, which is believed to improvebrain function, balance the immune system, and help maintain and repair tissuewhile it promotes healthy skin. It may also have a positive effect oncardiovascular health. Testosterone is also increased through regular sexualactivity. Testosterone helps strengthen bones and muscles, and it offers manybenefits to the brain and the cardiovascular system.Don’t forget that sexual activity is great exercise and burns calories. And therelease that comes with orgasm can have a calming, sedative effect. It’s oftenfollowed by great sleep. All of this can be a wonderful beauty treatment.According to research by David Weeks, a clinical neuropsychologist at the RoyalEdinburgh Hospital, engaging in intercourse three times a week in a stress-freerelationship can make you look ten years younger. So don’t say no to loving sexin a safe relationship. It can improve your brain and make you look great!Hydrate—To be beautiful, you need to keep yourself hydrated. That’s what keepsyour skin plump and juicy and youthful appearing. Good hydration helps preventwrinkles and fine lines. And it goes deeper than that. Your body is 70 percentwater, and your brain is 80 percent water. When you aren’t drinking as muchwater as you should, your brain function is reduced. And even a little bit ofdehydration will cause your body to release stress hormones. That makes youirritable and reduces your ability to think clearly. Over time, elevated levelsof stress hormones can lead to memory problems and obesity. You’d never thinkit, but your bad mood and confusion can be due to something as unexpected as notstopping for thirty seconds to drink something. Waiting until you’re so thirstyyou can’t ignore it anymore is waiting too long. If you feel thirsty, you’realready dehydrated.Get Some Sun, but Don’t Get Overexposed—The sun is necessary for life on earth,but too much can do a number on your skin. That’s especially true today when athinning ozone layer means that more of the sun’s harmful rays are reaching uson the ground. Some sun is a good thing and promotes healthy skin by boostingthe vitamin D levels in your body. But too much sun can lead to premature agingand brown spots. Try to achieve the right balance by getting no more than thirtyminutes of sun exposure during the day. If you’re going to be out any longer,protect yourself with clothing or sunscreen. But be careful with sunscreen as itcan have toxic chemicals. I recommend plant-based natural sunscreens with zincoxide.Supplements to Pamper Your Brain and Skin—Certain supplements can boost yourbrain and skin at the same time. Here are some of the ones I recommend: • Vitamin D: This is an essential nutrient for your brain and your skin.Low levels are associated with depression and memory problems, and problems withyour skin like psoriasis. Get your vitamin D level optimized. • Fish oil: This supplement is great for your brain, heart, skin, andyour hair. One way it keeps your skin looking younger and more vibrant isthrough its anti-inflammatory properties. The typical dosage is 1–2 g a day forhealth maintenance. I recommend higher dosages to support healing. • Evening primrose oil: This supplement is often taken by women who arefacing hormone issues. But it also contains GLA, an essential fatty acid.Scientific evidence indicates that GLA can help support healthy skin. • DMAE (dimethylaminoethanol): Also known as deanol, this analog of theB vitamin choline is a precursor of the neurotransmitter of acetylcholine.Research shows it has anti-aging properties that diminish wrinkles and improvethe appearance of skin. A 3 percent DMAE facial gel has been found to beeffective in mitigating forehead wrinkles and fine lines around the eyes. Italso improved lip shape, fullness, and the overall appearance of skin. Thesepositive effects seem to be maintained even after treatment stops. In addition,DMAE has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects; it increases skinfirmness and improves facial muscle tone. It may also help improve theappearance of age spots. The typical recommended dosage is 300–500 mg daily. • Phenylalanine: This amino acid has been shown to help support mood andpain control. It may also help with a skin condition called vitiligo, thatcauses white patches of skin as the cells responsible for skin pigmentation dieor lose their ability to function. • Alpha-lipoic acid: Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is naturally in the bodyand may protect against cell damage under a number of conditions. Research showsthat a cream containing 5 percent ALA was associated with significantimprovement in facial skin aging. The typical dose recommended for adults is 100mg twice a day. • Grape seed extract: When wine and grape juice are processed, grapeseeds are cast off as a waste product. An extract made from those seeds may be amagic elixir for your skin and brain. Grape seeds contain flavonoids andoligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPCs). OPCs have been shown to have antioxidantpower that is twenty times greater than vitamin E and fifty times greater thanvitamin C. Grape seed extract has the antioxidant effect of bonding withcollagen, which promotes youthful skin, elasticity, and flexibility. It alsoseems to improve brain function while decreasing the beta-amyloid plaques thatare associated with Alzheimer’s disease. In other research, proanthocyanidinshave been shown to help protect the body from sun damage. It also improves bloodcirculation by strengthening capillaries, arteries, and veins. There is alsostrong scientific evidence that it can help with skin edema, venousinsufficiency, and varicose veins. The typical adult dose of grape seed extractis 50–100 mg daily.2. CORRECT THE ANTS ABOUT YOUR APPEARANCE BY WRITING THEM DOWN AND TALKING BACKTO THEMByron Katie’s four-question technique, discussed in chapter 6[Amen_9780307888969_epub_c06_r1.htm], is very powerful in helping you make peacewith your appearance.Here are two examples from patients. The first one was in her mid thirties,single, and about 30 pounds overweight. ANT: You are a fat, worthless pig.Is it true? “No, obviously, I am not worthless or a pig.”Can you absolutely know that it is true? “No.”How do you feel when you believe the thought? “Terrible, worthless, like no onewill ever want me. I hate myself and want to be someone else. I then start toovereat chips, cookies, and ice cream as a way to soothe the anxiety and thedepression and hopelessness I feel.”Who would you be or how would you feel without the thought? “So much better,happier, less self-critical.”Turn the thought around. “I am not a fat, worthless pig. I have worth in so manyareas … work, family, spiritually. It is true I need to work on gettinghealthier, that is true, but abusing myself has not and will not be helpful.”The following patient was a sixty-two-year-old divorced woman who wanted tostart Internet dating. ANT: I am old and no one will want me.Is it true? “Yes. I have not dated in decades and no one will want to see my oldnaked body.”Can you absolutely know that it is true? “No. Of course, I cannot know that forsure.”How do you feel when you believe the thought? “Lonely, ugly, and I hate myself.I get depressed and withdrawn.”Who would you be or how would you feel without the thought? “I would feelexcited about the potential of meeting someone new, someone to have fun with.But if I am so negative, no one will have fun with me. I don’t have fun beingwith me.”Turn the thought around. “I am young and someone will want me. Actually, peoplein my family tend to live into their eighties and nineties. If I take care ofmyself, I can live thirty more years. It is time to get healthy and meet someonefun.”3. GET THE STRESS OUT OF YOUR EYES AND SKINYour skin is the brain on the outside. Numerous studies have shown that when youexperience psychological stress, your brain responds by sending signals to yourskin to react as if it is under physical attack. This can result in a rash,flushing, blushing, or an increase in the production of protective oils and adecrease in the skin’s less-critical functions, such as hair growth. More oiland less hair growth typically equals more blemishes and thinning hair. If youare stressed out about your new job, a test, or a big date, your skin is morelikely to break out.The brain–skin connection is so strong that some people have begun calling theskin “the brain on the outside.” In fact, the skin has been found to producemany of the same neuropeptides—including melatonin, serotonin, cortisol—used bythe brain. It is clear that the health and appearance of your skin are areflection of the health of your brain.There’s nothing attractive about a wrinkled brow, the nervous darting of anxiouseyes, or the ring of dangerous belly fat caused by emotional overeating and toomany stress hormones circulating in your blood. And here again, the effects godeeper than you can see. Chronic stress constricts blood flow to your brain.That lowers overall brain function, impairs memory, and causes your brain to ageprematurely. Decreased activity in your hippocampus, amygdala, and the PFCupsets both your cognitive function and your emotional balance.Chronic stress also directly affects the way you look by causing your skin tolose collagen and elastin, two proteins that add support and elasticity to giveyour face that youthful, firm appearance. The result is sagging skin andwrinkles. In a cruel twist of fate, at the same time it can upset your hormonesand lead to adult acne.If you want to look younger and enjoy your life more, it’s critical that youcalm your stress. And that means paying attention to yourself. When things gowrong in our lives, we tend to look outward to fix or complain about theproblem. We don’t realize that the way we see the situation, and how we respondto it emotionally, is a big part of the problem. When we start putting ourattention back on ourselves we can calm the stress reaction, and that actuallychanges the situation. See chapter 6 [Amen_9780307888969_epub_c06_r1.htm] forways to soothe the female brain.WHAT HURTS YOUR SKIN—AND WHAT MAKES IT BEAUTIFULSkin DamagerToo much caffeineSkin EnhancerLimit caffeine intake.Skin DamagerAlcoholSkin EnhancerRestrict alcohol consumption.Skin DamagerSmokingSkin EnhancerQuit immediately.Skin DamagerPoor dietSkin EnhancerEmbark on a brain-healthy diet.Skin DamagerToo much sugarSkin EnhancerReduce sugar intake.Skin DamagerYo-yo dietingSkin EnhancerMaintain stable weight.Skin DamagerDehydrationSkin EnhancerDrink plenty of water (half your weight in ounces every day for people under 250pounds).Skin DamagerLack of sleepSkin EnhancerGet adequate sleep, at least seven hours per night.Skin DamagerLack of exerciseSkin EnhancerEngage in physical activity at least four days a week.Skin DamagerChronic stressSkin EnhancerMeditate and practice deep-breathing exercises.Skin DamagerPTSDSkin EnhancerSeek therapy.Skin DamagerHormonal imbalancesSkin EnhancerBalance hormones.Skin DamagerThyroid conditionsSkin EnhancerBalance thyroid levels.Skin DamagerPsychiatric conditionsSkin EnhancerSeek appropriate treatment, such as therapy and medication.Skin DamagerMemory problemsSkin EnhancerPractice brain-healthy habits or seek treatment, such as medication.Skin DamagerSun exposureSkin EnhancerLimit sun exposure to twenty minutes before applying sunscreen.Skin DamagerAgingSkin EnhancerSupplement with vitamin D, fish oil, DMAE, phenylalanine, ALA, and grape seed.4. YOU WILL BE MORE BEAUTIFUL WHEN YOU SEE THE BEAUTIFUL IN LIFESpend time focusing on the things you are grateful for in your life. It willactually make your brain work better and make your eyes and smile brighter!After decades of social psychology research, Dr. Martin Seligman at theUniversity of Pennsylvania believes that happiness can be cultivated. It startsby focusing on what is right in your life. He reported that if his researchsubjects wrote down three things they were grateful for every day, they wouldnotice a significant boost in their level of happiness in just three weeks. Ifyou do this exercise on a daily basis, you will not only feel better but alsolook prettier and be more fun to be around.If you have been suffering because you think you are not pretty enough or notgood enough, reconsider your thoughts and ideas about what is beautiful. Theharmful habits and wrong ideas that have been ingrained into you since you werea child may be preventing you from fully living the beauty that is youressential nature. You were born to be beautiful, inside and out. How you livephysically and emotionally will determine if you leave someone wanting more ofyou, or less.HOUR 9 EXERCISE—GET A MASSAGE AND ENJOY A SAUNATaking time to relax and care for your body is essential to looking and feelingbeautiful. Get a relaxing massage to loosen up your muscles and then spendfifteen minutes in an infrared sauna, which has been shown to increasecirculation; lower blood pressure; increase the workload on the heart at therate of a brisk walk; and help with relief of pain, chronic fatigue, weight, andaddictions. During a sauna, blood flow increases to the skin, which bringsnutrients to subcutaneous and surface skin tissue, helping to keep your skinhealthy. The increased sweat gland activity helps to remove toxins. If youcannot find an infrared sauna, a regular one is the next best."},{"pageContent":"10SEX AND THE FEMALE BRAIN[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_L02_r1.jpg]OPTIMIZE YOUR BRAIN FOR GREATERPLEASURE, DEEPER RELATIONSHIPS, ANDLASTING LOVE[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_L03_r1.jpg]Boosting your brain for lasting connections is the tenth step to unleashing thepower of the female brain. The female brain is the largest and most importantsex organ in the universe.[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_L03_r1.jpg]Sweetheart. Babe. Hon. I love you. These are the words we all long to hear, thatwe all long to say—and mean them! We say them from the bottom of our hearts, andto hear them makes our hearts sing. Oops. I should have said brains instead ofhearts. It’s our brains that light up and send rewarding hormones throughout ourbodies when we hear those magic phrases. And it is our brains, not our hearts,that break when love is lost.If you want more love in your life, you should be paying attention to yourbrain. As a woman, you have a whole system built right into your physiology thatis designed to prepare you to love and be loved and to have thrilling,fulfilling relationships. Everything you do to cooperate with that system bykeeping your brain healthy and your hormones in balance will help you love moreand be more loved. Then nature will take its course, and you will have amazingconnections.Here are the facts you can use to optimize your brain and invigorate your lovelife.THE STORY OF LOVEACT 1: LUSTIf you’ve ever been in love, you know that there are different kinds of love,and the kind you feel can change over the course of a relationship. What you maynot know is that each kind of love is guided by its own brain system andinvolves a different set of hormones and neurotransmitters.Dr. Helen Fisher, an anthropologist from Rutgers University, has beenresearching the subject for years and is one of our prime authorities on it. Sheidentifies three different kinds of love, along with the specific braincorrelates and system of hormones and neurotransmitters that go with each. Thesethree kinds of love all occur within one relationship, at different stages.The first type of love is lust—the kind of bodice-ripping passion you feel whenyou first notice that handsome stranger staring at you across the room, or thatman in the office you’ve been working alongside for six months, but whom yousuddenly see very differently as you watch him come back all sweaty from hislunchtime workout at the gym.According to research by Syracuse University professor Stephanie Ortigue, thatprocess of falling in love takes about a fifth of a second and involves twelvedifferent brain areas. Under the powerful driving force of androgens andestrogens, you feel an intense desire for sexual gratification with thatindividual. Other feel-good chemicals that add to the party are dopamine,oxytocin, adrenaline, and vasopressin. It’s a very heady combination that makesyou feel thunderstruck, and it actually affects you cognitively. The worldreally does look different to you. And that man you’re lusting after? You can’teven see his flaws. He’s bathed in the same glow that surrounds the heroes onthe covers of romance novels.The part of your brain that’s primarily involved in all this is yourhypothalamus, which also controls your other physical needs, like hunger andthirst. And the drive for sexual union is just as powerful. It has to be. It’swhat makes the human species survive!ACT 2: ROMANCEIn most animal species, lust has its way, mating occurs, and the two individualsgo their separate ways. But for humans it’s very different. The initialattraction is the trigger that leads into one of the most wonderful andsought-after experiences of life: romance.This is the passionate, all-consuming emotion that makes you feel on top of theworld when everything is going well, and that throws you into the depths ofdespair when love is thwarted, unrequited, or rejected. It is for romance thatlovers swim across oceans, scale mountains, and slay dragons to impress,delight, or simply be with the beloved. According to Dr. Fisher, it’s morepowerful than lust. People don’t kill themselves for sex—but they will for abroken romance.In fact, Dr. Fisher says, that love is not just a feeling. It’s actually agoal-directed drive that affects our behavior and thinking by improvingperformance where the lover is involved. In one of Ortigue’s studies, subliminalexposure of the beloved’s name during a decision task dramatically improved theperformance of her women subjects who were in love. The women may have beensleepless, fluttery, and unable to concentrate on other things, but anythingrelated to their beloved made them very attentive indeed.Brain imaging studies of subjects in the early stages of this kind of crazy loveshows very high activity in the ventral tegmental area and the nucleusaccumbens. These, it turns out, are the centers of reward that are activatedwhen a person inhales cocaine. In lovers, these areas are bathed in dopamine,which drives us to attain the reward we’ve fixed our aim on. Other chemicalsthat are elevated and related to stress and excitement generally are cortisol,phenylephrine, and norepinephrine. By the way, phenylephrine is also found inchocolate, which is why chocolate is related to love and why eating it is acommon source of solace to the love-starved.Once you’re hooked like this, even the sight of his belongings makes theatmosphere electric. As you drive into the parking lot at work, you searcheagerly for his car. And when you see it, the area takes on a quality ofinterest, importance, and excitement that is in sharp contrast to the drabnessof every other part of the world. There is no place else you want to be.While all this is going on, the neurotransmitter serotonin is at low levels. Lowserotonin is also related to obsessive thinking, which is certainly a commonsymptom of this kind of love, where you can’t get that person out of your mind.ACT 3: AFFECTION AND LONG-TERM COMMITMENTNo one can stay madly in love forever. You’d exhaust yourself and never getanything else done. Plus, if a child results from all this excitement, anotherset of hormones kicks in to prepare you to take care of this newresponsibility—hormones that are also driven by the survival needs of thespecies.No, you can’t stay madly in love indefinitely, but another kind of love developsthat is also under the guidance of your brain and your hormones. The switch-overseems to come somewhere between eighteen months and four years of therelationship. Once again, the hypothalamus becomes important, but the hormonesinvolved now are oxytocin and vasopressin, and these lead to bonding and a senseof belonging. All the love hormones have to strike the right balance, and hereis a perfect example. Oxytocin and vasopressin are thought to interfere with thepathways for dopamine and norepinephrine, and vice versa. But when mad lovepasses, and dopamine and norepinephrine are suppressed, the bonding chemicalsstart coming more into play, helping ensure the continuation and evolution ofthe relationship.Testosterone also interferes with oxytocin and vasopressin secretion. In fact,studies have shown that men with higher levels of testosterone marry lessfrequently, have a greater tendency to divorce, and can be more abusive inrelationships. It may come in handy to remember that men with highertestosterone tend to have ring fingers that are longer than their index fingers.If you want to know if a potential mate is a good bet for a long-termrelationship, look at his hands!WIRED FOR LOVEThe brains of people in love light up when they look at pictures of theirbeloved. Dr. Fisher confirmed this in MRI studies of men and women who were inthe throes of early love. But when she compared her male subjects to her femalesubjects, she discovered some very interesting differences.The men showed most of their activity in parts of the brain associated with theintegration of visual stimuli. These were parts of the visual cortex and visualprocessing areas, some of which were directly related to sexual arousal. Formen, visual stimuli are very important for arousal. They are always assessingthe attractiveness of females as their primary impression of them. Women sensethis and spend a great deal of effort to make themselves visually appealing.Also, it’s no surprise that men are much more interested in pornography thanwomen. Those visual stimuli really get their juices flowing.But for women, it’s very different. For the women in her study, Fisher foundthat looking at the pictures of the men they loved caused comparatively moreactivity in the caudate nucleus. This is an area of the brain that is involvedwith memory, emotion, and attention. Other areas that lit up were the septum,which is sometimes called the brain’s pleasure center, and the posteriorparietal cortex, which is associated with producing mental images. In addition,parts of the brain involved with memory recall were also activated.So men are more visually oriented in sizing up a potential mate, and they aremore likely to fall in love at first sight. From an evolutionary perspective,they’re looking for a healthy-looking woman to bear their babies, and at thispoint, they’re not thinking much beyond getting their seed planted.But from the very beginning, a woman is integrating the image of her belovedinto areas of her brain associated with memory. Women seem more likely toremember events in a courtship, and they may never forget that first fight andall the details of who said what. Again, this could give her an evolutionaryadvantage. It’s not enough that her suitor is good-looking. She’s not justlooking for one night of passionate love. She’s looking for someone who willstay with her and help her raise their young. So it’s very important that sheremember all the details of her interactions with him. Has he demonstrated ahelping attitude? Does he seem to be loyal? Does he like her family and do theylike him? She’s always picking up on cues that reveal his character. And sheremembers all of it. Plus, she remembers the events along with the emotionalcontent of the moment. This makes for very powerful memories that bond her tothe person she loves right in the very fiber of her brain.So, while he may be quicker to fall in love, she will be ready to commit herselfto the relationship and start thinking about a future together much sooner.What this means for you is that in the early stages of your relationship, theman in your life may overwhelm you with his passion. Every time he sees you,he’ll get turned on all over again. But that doesn’t mean he has the same ideasabout a committed future that you’re already beginning to form as you build astructure of emotional memories. As long as you understand him, you won’tmisread his cues and think he’s ready for more than he may be. And you can bepatient. Eventually his oxytocin and vasopressin will kick in and you will bothhave the same goals.THE BIG OThe French have an expression for it (of course): le petit mort, “the littledeath.” Shakespeare referred to it as “die in thy lap.” It is achieving orgasm,that amazing, convulsive release that is the climax of sexual intercourse. Thecenter of all the sensation you feel is in your genital area, from whence itradiates throughout your body; but, in fact, its origin is in your brain. Andsex researchers who have studied the brain during orgasm have found that it’snot inaccurate to call it a little death—especially for women.Researcher Barry Komisaruk of Rutgers University has found that the subjectiveexperience of orgasm is very similar for men and women. But more recent workfrom the Netherlands shows that what happens in the brain is very different.Dutch neuroscientist Gert Holstege used positron emission tomography (PET) scansto study what was going in the brains of men versus women during orgasm. In men,the part of the brain that was most highly activated was the ventral tegmentalarea, which, as it turns out, is responsible for releasing dopamine. As you’llrecall, dopamine is a neurotransmitter that is part of the brain’s rewardcircuit and is integral to the pleasure felt by cocaine and heroin users. Infact, while this part of the brain is related to orgasmic pleasure felt by drugusers, it may be the overstimulation of this part of the brain by addictsthrough their drug use that leads to suppressed sexual drive.When Holstege studied his women subjects, however, he was in for a surprise. Toa much greater degree than in the men, the women’s brains went strangely silentduring orgasm. Specifically, the left lateral orbito-frontal cortex and thedorsomedial PFC seemed to be deactivated. These parts of the brain are involvedin self-control and social judgment. He also found more greatly suppressedactivity in the amygdala, so there was an even greater reduction in vigilanceand emotion compared to the men. Holstege concluded, “At the moment of orgasm,women do not have any emotional feelings.” They completely abandon themselves tothe sensation in their bodies.Other research has found that in women during sex, there is decreased activityin the amygdala and hippocampus. These are areas associated with fear andanxiety. It seems that during sex a woman’s brain suppresses these negativeemotions so she can feel safe and relaxed, both necessary conditions for her torelease into orgasm. Interestingly, areas of the cortex associated with pain arealso activated, which means there appears to be an association between pain andpleasure in the woman, partially explaining some sadomasochistic practices.Professor Komisaruk explains that orgasm (as opposed to sex) can block painsignals. In his research with both laboratory animals and humans, he found thatorgasm can inhibit the release of pain transmitters from the spinal cord. As aresult, the signals can’t reach the neurons in the brain that are activated inresponse to pain.Oxytocin is also released in the brains of both men and women during and afterorgasm. It is believed that this builds bonding and trust, and therefore it’snot surprising that many a male, who would not say it at another time, will say“I love you” during or right after intercourse. Some women sense this and don’ttrust an “I love you” spoken during sex. She wants to hear it while they’retaking a walk or eating dinner.HOW TO HAVE BETTER ORGASMSIf you want to have better orgasms (and who doesn’t?), or you have problemsreaching orgasm at all, there are some things you can do to help you enjoy amore intense experience.Love Your Partner—Researchers at the University of Geneva and the University ofSanta Barbara have found evidence for what we all suspect is true: The more awoman loves her partner, the more easily she reaches orgasm and the more intenseit is. Not only is this what women self-report, but when their brains werestudied through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans while they were beingpresented with the names of their lovers, the more love the women reported, thegreater activity there was in the left angular gyrus, an area related to memoryand emotion. They also had more activity in an area of the left-brain hemisphereresponsible for addiction. So it appears that for women, love is a greataphrodisiac.Make Sure Your Feet Are Warm—For a woman to relax enough to have an orgasm, it’snecessary for her to feel safe and comfortable, and having warm feet is a bigpart of that. According to the researchers from the University of Groningen,having warm feet increases a woman’s chance of having an orgasm by 30 percent.Possibly that’s because the area of your brain concerned with sensation in yourfeet is located right next door to the area concerned with sensation in yourgenitals (this might help explain foot fetishes in some). So if your partnerwants you to be more open to sex and more likely to climax, suggest that hemassage your feet as part of foreplay. Even better, have him do it with somewarming gel. That should help get both of you in the mood.And while you’re at it, have him kiss you on the right side of your neck orspine. (And you can try it on him too.) It is much more arousing than a kiss onthe left side.Focus Your Attention—Compared to a man, as a woman you have a special power whenit comes to orgasm. Many women are able to bring themselves to orgasm just bythinking, without any physical stimulation at all. Komisaruk’s research may haveexplained why. He found that when women thought about a part of their body beingstimulated—a finger, a toe, a nipple, or their clitoris—the corresponding partof the sensory cortex of their brain would be activated, just as if they wereactually being touched. This is a pretty powerful ability, and you can possiblyuse this information to increase your pleasure during sex if you are havingtrouble becoming aroused. Instead of thinking about your grocery list or yourschedule the next day, bring your attention back into the moment and think aboutthe building sensation in your clitoris. Focus on it, and you can intensify whatyou’re feeling. A little bit of imagination could result in a very real increasein pleasure.Breathe Deeply—There are certain smells that are more likely to turn you on. Andit differs for every woman. A man’s musky odor can make some women swoon. Butothers may find it objectionable. Determine the smell that is most erotic toyou, and then find a way to make your man wear it. It might be a cologne youlike or the smell of fresh laundry. Many women grow weak at the scent of babypowder. If that’s you, put a little on him after you shower together, andbreathe in deeply.Kiss—There’s a reason women need foreplay. It takes longer for you to getaroused, and you have to be brought to a peak of excitement closer to yourlover’s if intercourse is going to be pleasurable for you. Kissing is a veryimportant part of the process. Your lips are extremely sensitive and packed withnerve endings. They have one hundred times more nerve endings than yourfingertips have. When you kiss, multiple mechanisms in the brain are triggered,which in turn release the chemicals of love that relax you, reduce your levelsof anxiety, and make you much more receptive as the intensity of lovemakingproceeds.Tell Him What You Want—In case you haven’t noticed it, he can’t read your mind.And if you stay passive in your lovemaking, he will never know what to do orwhat you’re craving. He wants to please you, but to him, your body is a mystery.He can only go by what pleases him, but that’s not much of a guide to whatactually works for you. And he has no idea of his own strength. What seems tohim like a gentle touch may in fact be far too intense to cause you anything butdiscomfort. So tell him what you want. Guide his hand. Say to him, “It feels sogood when you _____,” and then you fill in the blank. Then be prepared to tellhim again. And again. He may not remember, and it’s not because he doesn’t careabout you. It’s because he’s a man and has a sleepier brain. So don’t get madbecause he’s not listening to you. Be patient and remind him what you like.Eventually he’ll get it. And taking a more active role in your lovemaking willnot only increase the sexual pleasure for both of you, it will strengthen anddeepen your relationship too.Talk to Your Doctor—If you are on an antidepressant drug like Lexapro, Celexa,Zoloft, Prozac, or Paxil, it may be interfering with your ability to orgasm.This class of drugs boosts serotonin, which suppresses the production ofdopamine, the hormone that is so essential to achieving orgasm. Your doctor maybe able to switch your medication (Wellbutrin, for example, is a morestimulating antidepressant) or adjust your dosage or use other strategies, suchas “taking a drug holiday” if you know that sex is going to happen during acertain time. Ginkgo or ginseng can also be helpful.And if sex is painful, see your gynecologist. He or she can see if anything iswrong and can help you by perhaps prescribing a hormone cream or othermedication.WHEN LOVE MAKES YOU CRAZYUnrequited love can be a killer—literally. Love can turn people into stalkers.It can make them commit suicide or homicide. It can make them grieve a lost lovewithout respite.In short, love can make you crazy. And the reason is the cocktail ofneurotransmitters (especially dopamine) and hormones that make you react to lovelike a hit of cocaine and make you suffer its withdrawal like a junkie who’sbeen denied a fix. According to Dr. Fisher, studies show that 40 percent ofrejected lovers become clinically depressed—at least for a while.Much like Fisher’s work, researchers Andreas Bartels and Semir Zeki usedfunctional MRI (fMRI) scans to look at the brains of people in love as theylooked at pictures of the ones they loved and pictures of acquaintances. LikeFisher, they found that when subjects looked at the object of their romanticattachment, brain activity increased in areas associated with happiness. At thesame time, there was less activity in parts of the PFC and in areas associatedwith fear, sadness, and depression. It seems that people in love have a brainthat makes them happy and stupid. It was especially interesting that some of theareas that lit up had high concentrations of dopamine receptors. These brainareas are generally associated with addiction to drugs like heroin and cocaine.The authors noted the “potentially close neural link between romantic love andeuphoric states.” Of course, the similarity between love and addiction, withtheir cravings, single-mindedness, and symptoms of withdrawal, has long beennoted by scientists and nonscientists alike.While being happily in love makes us crazy, it’s the withdrawal symptoms ofrejected love that can make us crazy and dangerous. It can lead to clinicaldepression and sometimes violent behavior. Fisher and her colleagues studied thefMRI scans of people suffering over rejection of their love as they looked atpictures of the rejecter. They found activation of areas associated with gainsand losses, craving, and regulation of emotion. Activation of the forebrain wassimilar to that seen in cocaine craving and addiction and may explain theobsessive behaviors associated with being rejected in love.And we now have scientific evidence that proves that love hurts. Research at theUniversity of Michigan shows that people suffering over a romantic breakup havebrain areas activated that are the same areas involved in feeling physical pain.Anyone who has ever been through a breakup knows how distressing it can be. Yourthinking becomes obsessively focused on the person who rejected you. You can’tthink of anything else. And it hurts physically. You’re going through thesymptoms of withdrawal that are akin to what you’d be feeling if you were a drugaddict trying to quit cocaine.Now’s the time to take care of your brain by following all the brain-healthymethods we’ve been talking about. And try to remember that the pain you’refeeling is largely the result of chemicals rushing through your brain but thateventually everything will balance out again. It won’t be long before yourealize he wasn’t right for you in so many ways, and you probably were aware ofthat all along.You can even help the healing process by making a list of all the things youdidn’t like about him and all the little signs you’d been ignoring while youwere trying to convince yourself that he was the one.As a woman, you have tremendous powers of love and commitment and willingness tosacrifice for others. Yes, a broken heart hurts. But it’s better than having noheart. Every heartbreak can lead to greater understanding and compassion, andthat can be very attractive to the right person.THE POWER OF LOVELove feels good. Not only that, it’s good for you. Love has the power to keepyou healthy, both physically and mentally. Let us count the ways.Love Reduces Stress and Improves Well-Being—Love and sex, like other behaviorsthat are necessary for species survival, involve naturally rewarding andenjoyable activities. They involve feelings of well-being with stress-reducingand health-promoting potential. The effects on the brain of pleasurableexperiences may inhibit activity in areas normally related to the production ofanxiety, so you just feel happier and more relaxed.The release of oxytocin and endorphins during and after orgasm has atremendously calming and relaxing effect. That’s why you sleep so well aftersex. It’s as though you took a sedative. And after a good night’s sleep, youjust feel better and less stressed the next day.Love Reduces Negative Emotions—You know that when you’re in love, little thingsdon’t bother you like they normally do. You’re much more tolerant of thatannoying kid behind the cash register at the grocery store. Even your motherdoesn’t bother you as much as she usually does. There’s a reason for it. Beingin love reduces your autonomic reactivity in the face of negative emotion, andthe source of this new openness to the daily experiences of life involves thevagus nerve—a nerve that runs from your head through the trunk of your body.Research indicates that regulation of the vagus nerve is one of the ways inwhich love reduces stress and promotes well-being.If you have a tendency to become depressed, be aware that orgasms can have anantidepressant effect. Semen itself contains chemicals like prostaglandins andfatty acids that a woman absorbs through her vagina, which can modulate herhormones and moods.Love Builds Your Brain—As we get older, we lose brain cells. According toresearch at Princeton University, however, sexual activity may actually help usgrow new brain cells. At least in studies of mice, sex is associated with thegrowth of brain cells in the hippocampus, one of the main memory centers of thebrain. So, while stress and depression reduce cells in this area, sex seems tostimulate growth.There is also evidence that people who are sexually active as they grow olderare less likely to develop dementia. Barry Komisaruk thinks this may be relatedto increased blood flow to the brain and the associated higher oxygen levels.Komisaruk says that MRI scans indicate that brain neurons are more active duringorgasm and use more oxygen. Oxygenated blood brings fresh nutrients to the area,keeping it healthy, nourished, and growing.Having sex can boost brain power in another way too. Orgasm increases levels ofestrogen and testosterone, both of which are good for your brain. Testosteronebenefits concentration and reaction times, as does estrogen.Love Makes You Healthier—More sex is related to greater longevity, boostedimmunity, and fewer sick days. It can enhance your fertility, regulate yourmenstrual cycle, and relieve menstrual cramps. Putting more youth-inducinghormones into your blood, like DHEA, estrogen, and testosterone, can benefityour cardiovascular system, lower your cholesterol, increase your bone density,and give you smoother skin.When you engage in sex, you trigger the production of a human growth hormonethat helps keep you looking younger, and all that activity keeps your bloodcirculating, especially to the skin. Sex is a toning, calorie-burning exercisethat keeps you fit and helps you keep your weight under control. According toresearch at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital, having sex regularly (three times aweek) can make you look up to ten years younger!And there are additional benefits. Orgasm can help alleviate certain types ofpain. This is due to the surge in oxytocin, which, in turn, releases endorphins;these are natural pain reducers. Moreover, estrogen can help relieve the pain ofPMS. Even migraines can be helped. Research with migraine sufferers shows thathaving an orgasm can alleviate, and in some cases completely eliminate, migrainepain. So, rather than using a headache as an excuse not to have sex, you maywant to use it as an excuse to have sex. The results are immediate: It costsnothing, there are fewer side effects, and you and your partner can both enjoyit.GETTING READY FOR LOVEGetting ready for love means more than picking out the right outfit to wear andapplying a new color of lipstick. The most important beauty regimen you shouldbe thinking about is getting your brain in order. When your brain works right,you work right. You can be loving, thoughtful, attentive, consistent, romantic,and playful. But there are many “brain issues,” like ADD and depression, thatcan get in the way of great sex and satisfying relationships.If you are having problems in the bedroom, it may be a good idea to look at theother aspects of your life and take care of those first.For example, if you’re riding the PMS roller coaster every month, or goingthrough perimenopause or menopause, you may want to look into balancing yourhormones, discussed earlier.Being out of shape and overweight can interfere with your energy level and bodyimage and, therefore, your enjoyment of sex. Get on a program of healthy eatingand exercise, and take brain-healthy supplements, like fish oil. You may besurprised how your interest in sex grows as your BMI goes down.Untreated brain trauma may be causing a variety of symptoms from inability toconcentrate to anxiety, confusion, forgetfulness, and promiscuity—all of whichcan interfere with bonding and being a caring, reliable partner. If you suspectyou are suffering from brain trauma owing to injury or toxic exposure, have itchecked out. There are a variety of treatments available that can get your brainback into shape.Drug and alcohol abuse are relationship killers. And it all starts with theirnegative effect on brain function. If you take illegal drugs, or even many legalones, such as alcohol or prescribed painkillers or benzodiazepines, they willhave a negative effect on your relationships. You may be medicating yourselfwith drugs and alcohol to dull the pain of your life, but they are actuallyincreasing the pain and preventing you from experiencing closeness with thoseyou love. Seek help if you need it. It will open the door to the love you reallywant.THE POWER TO MAKE LOVE LASTIs it possible for love to last for decades? There are couples who seem to stayromantically interested in one another throughout their married life. What’stheir secret?Research by Bianca Acevedo and Arthur Aron, who are part of Helen Fisher’s team,used fMRI scans to study the brains of happy couples in stable relationships foran average length of 21.4 years. The couples’ brain activity was measured bothwhile viewing facial images of their partner and while viewing images of afamiliar acquaintance and a close friend. They found that greater satisfactionin marriage was related to activation of several brain areas specifically whileviewing their partner. These included areas involved with reward and motivation,empathy, stress control, and the regulation of emotion. Greater maritalsatisfaction also was correlated with the area of the brain that regulates mood.Altogether, it’s clear that couples with better relationships have brainsassociated with greater health and well-being. What is the direction ofcausation? We don’t know from this research, but it is clear that relationshipscan be soothing or they can make you crazy.Over my years working with patients, I’ve seen a variety of relationship types.I can also draw from my own personal experience—and the experiences of myfriends and family—to know that love that lasts is the result of partnersembedding themselves in each other’s brains in a positive way. Memory circuitsand pleasure get all wound up together so that the other person becomes integralto the very structure of your brain, and you become part of the structure ofhis.Embedding yourself in your partner’s brain is not hard to do. It does requiremotivation, dedication, and a little knowledge. I’ve come up with a list oftwelve things you can do to make a lasting impression on the one you love andkeep that love alive and growing. These are powerful actions. Don’t use themunless you’re serious about your relationship and intend to commit yourself toit.Take Your Partner’s Breath Away—Do something amazingly thoughtful and out of theordinary. And let there be an element of surprise to it. A loving note tuckedinto a pocket. A special dinner on an otherwise ordinary night. A playlist madeup with his favorite songs. These thoughtful acts will embed you in his memory.Do Something Special on a Regular Basis—Call him every day to touch base and gethis nervous system used to hearing your voice. Make his favorite meal once aweek. Once he begins to expect these things, you will always be close to hisawareness. Also, do something special intermittently. Random reinforcement isthe most powerful form of conditioning. Plan romantic evenings on a randomschedule so that he doesn’t know when they’ll happen but will always have afeeling of excited anticipation.Engage in Lots of Eye Gazing—New couples seem to do this naturally, but don’tdrop this strong bonding behavior just because the relationship has progressed.This is one way to keep the romance alive and is especially powerful when makinglove.Learn What Pleases Your Partner Sexually—Make it clear that his pleasure is yourpleasure, and you want to discover everything about what turns him on. He’ll behappy to have you experiment on him. Not only will you get more adept atpleasing him, but he will see that you are willing to make a special effort justfor him.Teach Your Partner What You Like—For most partners, pleasing you makes him feelgood about himself. And research shows that the sexual pleasure of one partnerincreases the pleasure of the other partner. Dr. Irwin Goldstein cites evidencethat when men take an impotence drug (Levitra), their partners have better sexbecause their bodies work better, with better lubrication and more intenseorgasms. We sense our partner’s level of arousal and are turned on by it. So bygetting him to do what you want, he will sense your greater arousal, and he willbe more aroused as well.Boost Lasting Love with Sexual Novelty—When things get humdrum and routine,there is not going to be as much of a hormonal/neurotransmitter reaction, andarousal is lessened. A little novelty increases anticipation, more hormones aresecreted, and more thrilling sex is the result. Keep this up throughout yourrelationship and the temptation to stray will be reduced.Do Something a Little Edgy—If you get your partner’s heart rate up, he mayassociate the feeling of excitement with you and he may develop more powerfulfeelings for you. Going on a roller-coaster ride, taking a balloon trip,shooting the rapids—anything with a touch of danger to it—can make him fall moredeeply in love with you. No head injuries, of course.Use Every Sense—Your partner has five senses. You can embed yourself in each oneof them. For vision, wear sexy clothing that you know he likes, add the softglow of firelight during your dates, and put a picture of the two of you on hisdesk. For sound, speak in a pleasing tone, and use music you know he likes. Fortouch, find out what pleases him when you’re intimate. But even when you’re justspending time together, touch him while you’re talking, brush your hand on hisarm as you walk by him, give him affectionate kisses. For taste, make sure yourmouth tastes good when you kiss him. And smell is extremely important as it islinked to the most primitive part of his brain. Find out what smells helikes—and, more important, what he doesn’t like. Whether he likes a certainperfume on you or he prefers your natural scent, find out what smell drives himcrazy, in a good way. That’s what you want to wear.Do Something Great for Someone Your Partner Loves—If you show kindness and lovefor someone he loves, you will earn major points. When you enter a relationship,you also enter a relationship with all his family and friends. He wants you toenhance the lives of those he loves. So show him that the people who areimportant to him are important to you. This includes children from a previousmarriage, parents, friends, employees and employers, and pets. Your acts ofkindness toward them are a powerful bonding technique that appeals to his limbicbrain and embeds you deeply in his consciousness.Summarize and Immortalize Loving Moments—Don’t be afraid to give voice to yourlove. Tell him how you feel. Write a loving note or a poem. Lovers have beendoing this from the beginning of time because it works.Learn from Parrots—Barbara Wilson is a neurologist who keeps and trains parrots.She says they have taught her important lessons about relationships that manyhumans could benefit from: Share your food with the one you love, groom eachother, sing constantly, build nests together, and repeat each other’s words andactions. The repetition validates the other person and attests to your interestin one another. It’s a powerful way of saying, “We’re in this together. Irecognize you, you’re important to me. We’re one.”Boost the Chemicals of Love—There are many brain chemicals that go into thefeeling of love and attachment. Here is information on what you can do toenhance two of these chemicals. Oxytocin is known as the bonding, trust, andcuddle hormone. It works to increase our sense of connection and closeness toothers. Oxytocin is enhanced by watching romantic movies together, holdinghands, cuddling, and long, loving eye contact. Women usually have more oxytocinthan men, but according to one study, a man’s level of oxytocin goes up 500percent after making love. Withholding sex or being too busy to make love pushescouples apart. Work to stay close. It is good for your attachment to each other.There is even a company now that makes an oxytocin spray to enhance love. I mayhave to get some to help me at home for the times I say stupid things and getmyself into trouble. There is another love chemical called phenylethylamine, orPEA, which works deep in the brain to alert you that something fun is about tohappen. Dark chocolate increases PEA, as do almonds and cheese. Cheese actuallycontains more PEA than chocolate. Hmmm. Has anyone besides me ever wondered whyFrench restaurants have cheese on the dessert menu? Now you know. You are morelikely to get “dessert” when you get home if you have cheese. Another sure wayto boost the attachment chemicals in your brain is to focus on what you lovemost about your partner. If you’re like most people, you have “the list” of thethings you love about your partner and the things that irritate you. Where youfocus your attention determines how you feel. If you focus on the things thatbother you—say, that he is a slob—you will definitely feel bothered. If youfocus most on what you love, such as he is one of the kindest people you haveever met, then you are so much more likely to feel loving toward him. Make alist of seven things that you are grateful for about your partner, and thenmeditate on just one of them a day. You will notice a positive difference inyour relationship in less than a week.The secret to being a great lover is to know the brain tendencies of yourpartner and then match your behavior to fit his or her brain.There is not one “loving” strategy that works for everyone. Why? We all havedifferent brains. Some of us are extroverts; some of us are introverts. Some ofus have low activity in the front part of our brains, which makes us excitementseeking. So we are likely to love scary movies, motorcycles, a good argument,and need novelty in the bedroom. Others of us have too much activity in thefront part of our brain, which makes us seek predictability. So we are likely tohate scary movies, hate motorcycles, hate a good argument, and hate novelty inthe bedroom.Knowing your partner’s brain is essential! For example, if your partner has an“anxious” brain, likely he needs reassurance, a warm bath, soft music, and afoot rub in order to relax into being intimate. If your partner has an obsessivebrain, you will get more love by being predictable, making sex his idea, playingsoothing music, and watching what you say, because he never lets go of hurts.Different brains need different strategies. Even the time of a woman’s cyclematters, as your brain changes. At some times in your cycle, you might want yourpartner to be assertive and just take you; at other times, if your mate triesthe same move, you will hit him upside his head.Unfortunately, most people have no clue about the brain, so when they strugglein a relationship, they just think that they have fallen out of love and startlooking for a new partner.Most females want love and have built-in mechanisms for lasting, lovingrelationships. With a healthy brain and healthy hormones, you feel happier andsexier, and you can act in a consistent loving way that will attract more loveinto your life. You have the power to create amazing connections. And the rulesand suggestions in this chapter can help you make the most of this inbornability.ASK FOR WHAT YOU WANTAre you embarrassed to ask your partner for what you want? Try this exercise byfilling in the blank for each item. Have your partner do it too. Then practiceon each other. You can’t read each other’s minds. You have to learn to ask.I like it when you ________ my hair.I like it when you ________ my ears.I like it when you ________ my eyes.I like it when you ________ my nose.I like it when you ________ my neck.I like it when you ________ my upper back.I like it when you ________ my lower back.I like it when you ________ my breast/chest.I like it when you ________ my belly.I like it when you ________ my genitals.I like it when you ________ my butt.I like it when you ________ my thighs.I like it when you ________ my lower legs.I like it when you ________ my feet.GRIEF AND TOUCHAngela and Jose are one of my favorite couples. I initially saw them severalyears ago as part of a show on Dr. Phil about compulsive cheaters. Jose hadserious problems, but through our work together he has made remarkable progressand has been sober for over three years. Two and a half years into treatment,Jose’s father died suddenly. Like most people, he went through a period ofgrief. He was becoming more short-tempered and withdrawn. Angela was incrediblysupportive. Over time, however, she didn’t know whether to get irritated withhim or to soothe him. She did not want to encourage his bad behavior, and sheasked for my help.When we lose people we love, our limbic or bonding centers tend to becomeoveractive, making us more vulnerable to depression. As mentioned earlier, mentend to express depression as anger and social withdrawal, rather than sadness.My advice to Angela was that Jose needed more tenderness and touching andlovemaking. Oxytocin, the hormone of bonding, is less active in men, but it goesup after he has an orgasm. There is research from my colleague Dr. K. PaulStoller, who has had very good success using intranasal oxytocin to help withgrief. He discovered it in himself, after experiencing suffocating grief afterlosing Galen, his sixteen-year-old son, in a train accident. I suggested Angelatry touch and lovemaking to naturally boost oxytocin. If that didn’t work, wewere going to try intranasal oxytocin. The touch worked, and Angela and Jose’srelationship continues to grow and strengthen.HOUR 10 EXERCISE—BE THE DIRECTOR OF YOUR PLEASUREOne-hour practice session with your partner, if you have one who is cooperative,or with a masseuse: The goal of this exercise is to learn about your body, to becurious about what you like and don’t like. Make this an hour of uninterruptedtime. Do not bring any expectations or pressure to the session, just yourcuriosity.Directions with a love partner: Start with a brief general massage, head tofeet, front and back; include all the areas you wish. Set a timer to massageeach area for thirty seconds. Pick out the massage oil with a scent you love.Rate each area on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the most pleasurablefeeling. Recommended areas lying facedown: scalp, neck, shoulders, upper back,lower back, buttocks, back of upper legs, back of knees, back of lower legs,feet. Lying faceup: face, shoulders, arms (including inside of elbows andwrists), hands, breasts, belly, genitals (do not just tell him to stop here),inside of thighs, upper legs, lower legs, feet. Have your partner record yourratings for each area; that way he will know which areas you like the best.During this exercise, get out of your head and focus on the sensations in yourbody to learn what you like the most.Directions with a masseuse: Follow the same procedure but do not include breastsor genitals.

A motheralways has to think twice, once for herself and once for her child.—SOPHIA LORENIf you get your brain healthy, you are much more likely to encourage those youlove to get healthy as well. Nowhere is this more true than when consideringhaving and raising children. The information in this chapter will help you takecontrol of the most important aspect of your pregnancy, which is your own health(especially your brain health), and the health of your baby.GETTING READY FOR PREGNANCYTo give your baby the best start possible, you want to create a good environmentwithin your body for it to grow in. You should begin working on this as early aspossible. As soon as you decide you’re going to try to become pregnant, beginfollowing the brain-healthy plan you’re learning here.Begin a Healthy Diet Before You Become Pregnant—Having healthy babies requireseating a healthy diet. And a good diet needs to start before conception for themost benefit. Studies show that mothers who have poor diets prior to conceptionare more likely to have babies who have reduced birth weight and are at greaterrisk for developing obesity and type 2 diabetes. So if you’re thinking ofbecoming pregnant, now is the time to start watching what you eat. That meanslots of lean protein, good fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and not alot of sugar and processed food. Drink lots of pure water.Take Supplements—Don’t forget your supplements, including a good multivitaminand 400–800 µg of folate. Folate is a form of B vitamin that is essential tohelp prevent neural tube birth defects in developing babies. Dutch researchersreport that the risk of emotional problems in children was significantly lesswhen their mothers had adequate levels of folate. It’s advisable to start takingit before you become pregnant and to continue taking it all through yourpregnancy and while nursing. Beef liver, lentils, spinach, asparagus, avocados,green peas, broccoli, and papaya are good food sources of folate. I recommendthat my patients also take a high-quality multivitamin to make sure they aregetting the folate and other needed nutrients.Quit Smoking—There is evidence that women who smoke not only have less chance ofbecoming pregnant, but they are at increased risk of having an ectopicpregnancy, in which the fertilized egg implants itself in a fallopian tube orelsewhere outside the uterus.Engage the Help of Your Own Health Team—Have a checkup with your doctor early onto make sure there are no obvious problems. It is a good idea to do this early,while you’re still thinking about getting pregnant. Have your doctor do a testto check if you’ve ever had German measles (rubella), which can cause seriousbirth defects if you become infected while pregnant. If you haven’t, and you’renot yet pregnant, your doctor may suggest you get vaccinated against thedisease. Also, gum disease can cause systemwide inflammation, so get your teethcleaned and floss regularly.It really isn’t hard. The more you can do before you get pregnant to get fit andhealthy, the more you’ll be helping your baby get a good start in life.DEALING WITH INFERTILITYObviously, there are many causes of infertility, including infections, trauma,ill health, low hormone levels, allergies, and many other possibilities. One ofthe most common causes of infertility is stress. Being unhappy, frequentlyupset, tense, or angry can clamp down on your fallopian tubes, making it harderto conceive. Scientific evidence shows that chronic stress causes hormonalchanges that disrupt reproductive function.The same way that stress prematurely ages your body and skin, it also speeds upthe aging process of your reproductive system. For women, it is harder toconceive as age advances, whether the aging is natural or stress-induced. Womenaren’t the only ones who suffer from infertility owing to stress. Researchers inIndia have found that emotional stress damages sperm cells. In addition tocausing problems for natural conception, elevated stress levels also impact thesuccess of fertility treatments, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF). Fertilitytreatments by themselves are universally enormously stressful!A study published in Human Reproduction investigated the effects of stressfullife events on IVF treatment. The researchers asked 809 women to complete aquestionnaire about stressful and negative life events during the twelve monthsprior to undergoing fertility treatment. Women who became pregnant followingtreatment reported fewer stressful events than women who didn’t conceive. Theresearchers concluded that stress may reduce the chances of a successful outcomefollowing IVF treatment.There’s a commentary I love in the same journal from a psychologist on thefaculty at UNED University in Madrid, Spain. He is convinced that stress is toblame for many cases of infertility and suggests that stress reduction should bethe first course of treatment for infertility rather than expensive and invasivetreatments, such as IVF. It makes sense to me. Stress reduction poses no sideeffects and doesn’t involve any of the ethical or religious quandaries that comewith some fertility treatments.PREGNANCYA ROLLER-COASTER RIDE OF HORMONESCreating a baby is one of life’s greatest miracles, and it takes a majorrevamping of your hormone balance to accomplish it. During pregnancy, and in theperiod following delivery, we see the largest fluctuation in hormones that awoman will ever experience in her life. A number of different hormones playmajor roles in the transformation, and understanding what’s happening to yourbody will help you cope with the changes.Estrogen and progesterone are two of the most important hormones duringpregnancy, and they are both produced in abundance during this time. However,the first hormone that comes into play is human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG),which is only released early in pregnancy and is not present at any other timein a woman’s life. It is hCG that stimulates the ovaries to start producinggreater quantities of estrogen and progesterone, and it is the presence of hCGthat is picked up on by those home pregnancy tests.As the pregnancy progresses, the placenta itself starts producing copiousamounts of estrogen and progesterone, and at that point the quantity of hCGdiminishes as it is no longer needed. Estrogen prepares the womb to receive thefertilized egg and readies the breasts for nursing. It also regulates theproduction of progesterone.Progesterone builds the wall of the womb so that it can support the placenta. Italso helps reduce randomly occurring contractions. In both these ways, it helpskeep the womb from spontaneously aborting the fetus.The pituitary gland produces the hormone prolactin, which is essential for milkproduction and nursing. As with much of the hormone system, it is the balanceamong different hormones that is essential for the harmonious execution of thebody’s functions. Estrogen and progesterone prevent prolactin from bringingabout the production of milk prior to birth. After birth, estrogen andprogesterone levels drop dramatically, which clears the way for prolactin toinitiate milk production.Oxytocin is a hormone that serves a number of important functions. It is heavilyinvolved in labor by directing contractions. In fact, oxytocin is the drug thatdoctors use to artificially induce labor. But the hormone is also related topleasurable feelings. Sometimes referred to as the cuddle chemical, it appearsto be the hormone that underlies social bonding in general and is an importantfactor in a mother’s bonding to her infant. The hormone, which is released inthe brain during sexual arousal and orgasm, is also released when an infantnurses, building a bond of trust and pleasure between mother and baby.Researchers at Israel’s Bar-Ilan University have found that greater amounts ofoxytocin in the blood of pregnant women predicted stronger bonding betweenmothers and babies after birth as measured by gazing, touching, and vocalizing.THE MOMMY BRAIN: DOES IT EXIST? AND IS IT A MINUS OR A PLUS?I knew a woman who had only two fender benders in her life. And both of themtook place while she was pregnant with each of her two children. Her take on thesituation was “I just can’t drive when I’m pregnant.”Many women who are pregnant claim that they feel like there are lots of thingshappening to their brains that they don’t understand. Their memories get foggyso it’s hard to carry on a conversation or remember whether or not they put thebaking powder into the cake batter.Some researchers pooh-pooh the idea of a “mommy brain,” but many otherresearchers, and women around the globe, claim that it’s as real a phenomenon inpregnancy as a swelling belly. In fact, after reviewing the research, theAmerican Psychological Association has concluded that 50–80 percent of womenreport decreased concentration and memory during pregnancy. But the paradoxicalconclusion that some researchers are coming to is that some of these “symptoms”may actually be signs of changes in the brain that may end up making the womansmarter and better equipped to keep her child healthy and safe. The flood ofreproductive hormones may actually prepare the brain for the demands of being amother, making her a more sensitive and effective caretaker who is lessdisturbed by stress and more attuned to the needs of her infant. PsychologistLaura M. Glynn surmises this is why mothers are easily aroused when their babiesstir, whereas their fathers stay blissfully asleep.Glynn also reports that when the fetus moves in the womb, it raises the mother’sheart rate and skin conductivity, which are signs of an emotional response. Thismay ready the mother to bond to her baby even before it’s born. Fetal cellsenter the mother’s bloodstream through the placenta. “It’s exciting to thinkabout whether those cells are attracted to certain regions in the brain,” Glynnsays, which would mean the fetus is influencing the changing brain of itsmother, preparing her to love it.One surprising finding from fMRI scans is that a woman’s brain may physicallyshrink during the third trimester of pregnancy. Anesthesiologist Anita Holdcrofthas found that pregnant women’s brains shrink an average of 3–5 percent.However, there is more here than first meets the eye. Dr. Louann Brizendineexplains that the shrinkage does not seem to be the result of a loss of braincells. Instead, it is due to changes in cellular metabolism. The shrinkage is asign of brain circuits that are being restructured in preparation for theirbeing changed from “one-lane highways” into “superhighways.” And as research hascontinued to show, the brain does not shrink uniformly. Some very significantareas of the brain grow larger.Don’t worry: A few weeks postpartum, the brain starts getting bigger again andis usually returned to its normal size within six months. So it’s bigger again,and better, because its improved circuitry is maintained. In animal studies,mother rats are better, more efficient learners who are less fearful and aretherefore better providers for their families compared to females who have notborne a litter.Researcher Craig Kinsley reported in 2011 that his mother subjects were moreresistant to stress and had enhanced memory and cognition. Kinsley explains thatthe maternal brain undergoes a revolutionary change. At first it feels like adisorganized construction zone, which may account for the fuzzy thinking andother symptoms of the mommy brain. However, once the infant is born and theneuronal changes start taking hold and become organized, the result is a betterbrain that is more efficient and focused and that has been transformed from aself-centered organism to an other-focused caregiver.Here’s one example of an important change: Early in pregnancy, a woman’solfactory system changes, making her more aware of odors. It is believed thatthis makes her more sensitive to the smell of food that may be bad for her andthe child growing inside her, and it is a critical mechanism for survival.Interestingly, that same change in her sense of smell makes her actually likethe smells given off by her baby, including the smell of baby poop. It’s allpart of the bonding process that is guided by a number of neurological changesoccurring in her brain.Kinsley points out that the bonding process, all of which is designed to improvethe survivability of the next generation, leads to other positive changes in themother, including improvements in spatial memory and enhanced learning ability.And, according to the results of animal studies, these changes are essentiallypermanent, lasting well into old age.So the finding is that the brain appears to shrink as it “rewires,” but at thesame time very important areas of the maternal brain grow. And these areas aredirectly related to increasing the mother’s ability to take care of her babies.According to the American Psychological Association review of the literature,the main changes seem to involve increased size of the midbrain.In research with humans, Pilyoung Kim, now at the National Institutes of MentalHealth in Bethesda, Maryland, scanned the brains of new mothers a few weeksafter giving birth and then again three to four months later. Her findings wereconsistent with earlier findings from animal studies: There were size increasesin the hypothalamus, PFC, and amygdala. According to Kim, these areas of thebrain are the seat of motivation and reward. She concluded that size increasesin these areas are important for motivating the mother to care for her infantand make her feel rewarded by her interactions with her baby, especially by eyecontact and smiles. In fact, the mothers who had the largest increases in thesize of these areas were also the most enthusiastic about rating their babies asspecial, beautiful, ideal, and perfect. These areas of the brain are alsocritical for planning and foresight. They help the mother both anticipate herbaby’s needs and make the plans that are necessary to take care of them. This isthe basis of “maternal instinct” with its love, fascination, worry, and need toprotect. It’s what helps her plan visits to the pediatrician in the middle ofher busy workweek, sit in the waiting room and carefully watch anyone whoapproaches, prepare her list of questions to ask the doctor, and at the righttime, dip into her tote bag filled with snacks and toys.But if this is so, why the brain fog during pregnancy and postpartum? Somespeculate it’s just due to lack of sleep. But Kim, herself a new mother, hasanother idea, and she thinks it has to do with changing priorities. “We areclearly showing that mothers have better memories about things related to theirinfants. There are a lot of things going on, and mothers might feel forgetfulabout things that are not related to their infants. It’s just dependent on whatis really important for us to remember at the time.”A thorough review of available research was compiled by Katherine Ellison andpresented in her book The Mommy Brain: How Motherhood Makes Us Smarter. As aPulitzer Prize–winning reporter, she turned her skill for ferreting outinformation on the topic after noticing changes in herself as the result of herown two pregnancies. Ellison concludes, “The brain changes when you become amother. It becomes more efficient, perceptive, motivated and empathetic—alluseful skills in the workplace. Rather than a deficiency, as our cultureemphasizes, it’s actually an asset.”So, it appears there really is a mommy brain, but rather than being a problem,it may actually be a tremendous asset to a new mother. The transformation in awoman’s brain may be designed to prepare her to be a better, calmer, moreefficient mother, and the changes may benefit her for her entire life.Apparently a little fogginess may be the prelude to a new level of focus andintelligent action. There are many sacrifices in motherhood, but the entireprocess also contributes significant rewards to the mother’s brain.A HEALTHY PREGNANCY: WHAT TO DOFor thirty years, I’ve been talking about what all of us need to do to have ahealthy brain. And, of course, what’s good for the brain is good for the body.When you’re pregnant, what’s good for your brain and your body is also what’sgood for the little brain and body that are growing inside of you. Diligentlyfollow the program in this book.Exercise—In the old days, pregnant women were treated as though they had somekind of illness. They were often advised that exercise was not a good idea, andback in the fifties and sixties, exercise wasn’t high on anyone’s list of thingsto do anyway.Today many women exercise like crazy, and they’re not about to give that up whenthey get pregnant. They’re highly motivated to stay in shape. They think they’llhave an easier time of pregnancy and the birth process itself if they stayactive and fit. And research backs them up. Studies out of the PolytechnicInstitute of Madrid show that low-level physical exercise throughout pregnancyhas beneficial effects on the health of both mother and baby. They also foundthat exercise helped reduce some of the effects of the tendency of heaviermothers to give birth to heavier babies. Babies who are born with excessiveweight face greater complications at birth and are more at risk of developingillnesses as adults, such as diabetes and some cancers. In the study, overweightmothers who were sedentary tended to give birth to heavier newborns. However,overweight mothers who exercised during pregnancy did not give birth to heavierbabies.Exercise can help your body weather some of the changes it is going through. Forexample, it can help you maintain good posture, which can reduce backaches andother discomforts. It also reduces stress, and it builds your stamina to helpyou better get through labor and delivery. And some studies show that women whoexercise are less likely to get gestational diabetes, a temporary form ofdiabetes that develops in some women during pregnancy.If you’ve had an exercise plan prior to becoming pregnant, you can modify it asneeded to make sure you don’t put a strain on you or your baby. If you becomeexhausted or breathless, you may be compromising the supply of oxygen to yourbaby, so cut back. Don’t let your heart rate get above 140 beats per minute orit may put your baby in distress. If you have not been exercising but want tobegin, start slowly and work your way up. Keep yourself hydrated and don’texercise if it’s too hot. Don’t engage in contact sports, and don’t run on roughterrain or do anything that might make you fall. Use weights to tone, but don’tlift anything heavy over your head. Basically, use common sense so that yourexercise keeps you in shape without doing any potential harm to you or yourbaby.There are certain medical conditions that may make it inadvisable to exercisewhile pregnant, so do check with your doctor. But if he or she says it’s okay,exercising can bring many benefits.And when it comes to one very special kind of exercise, a review of theliterature shows that sexual activity during pregnancy does not harm the fetus,provided there are no risk factors involved, such as sexually transmitteddiseases. Some research indicates that one of the benefits of sex, especiallyduring the late stages of pregnancy, is that it seems to ward off earlydelivery. And a full-term baby has the best chance for a healthy delivery and agreat start in life.WHAT TO AVOIDDon’t Ignore Your Weight—It is very important to maintain an optimal weightduring pregnancy, and that means not allowing yourself to put on too manypounds. You know all the health problems associated with obesity for yourself.But did you know that you can pass all those problems along to your unbornchild? Recent research indicates that overweight mothers are more likely to havechildren who are born overweight and who are more likely to be obese inadulthood. Obese mothers are also more likely to have children who suffer withADD in childhood. So try to follow the healthy guidelines for eating we justlooked at, and help your child enter the world at a healthy weight.Don’t Smoke—When you smoke, not only are you putting poison in your body thatgets carried through to the baby inside you, but you are cutting back on thefetus’s supply of oxygen. The results can be devastating. In one recent studythat appeared in the British Journal of Psychiatry, women who smoked whilepregnant had children who were at greater risk of exhibiting psychotictendencies as teenagers. In another study based on animal research, smokingduring pregnancy produced offspring with faulty production of myelin, the fattysheath that insulates brain connections. Without healthy myelin, impulses arenot transmitted properly. The researchers concluded that this may explain thefinding that mothers who smoke are more likely to have children who develop ADD,autism, tendencies to drug abuse, and a host of psychiatric disorders.Mothers who smoke also have more complications during pregnancy and may deliverpreterm. Their babies often show low birth weight, and when they grow up theyare more likely to show physical symptoms like asthma, sudden infant deathsyndrome, colic, and respiratory infections.Smoking is a terrible thing to do to yourself and your baby.Hold the Alcohol—Just as you stop smoking for your baby, you should also abstainfrom alcohol. There is evidence that abusing alcohol during pregnancy can leadto birth defects and fetal alcohol syndrome. It is also associated with behaviorproblems in childhood. But does that mean cutting out alcohol altogether? Somedoctors say yes, that you should cut it out completely while you’re pregnant. Iagree. It is not giving you or the baby any benefit.Don’t Do Drugs—As with cigarettes and alcohol, anything you do, your baby doesas well. If you are on prescription drugs, discuss your pregnancy with yourdoctor to see if any dosage changes are warranted. And if you are usingrecreational drugs, please stop. If you don’t, your baby could pay the price forthe rest of her life.And what about caffeine? There is evidence that too much caffeine duringpregnancy can lead to some birth defects, preterm delivery (and in some studies,but not all, miscarriages), and low birth rate. You know how your heart raceswhen you have too much caffeine? Well, your baby’s heart races as well. Somedoctors say you should cut it out altogether while pregnant (and that includesthe hidden caffeine in sodas, chocolate, and Excedrin). Some doctors say thatunder 150 mg caffeine a day is okay (about one and a half cups of coffee). A cupof green tea can be very satisfying, at just 40 mg. But to be on the safe side,cut out the caffeine altogether. It’s a small sacrifice that could mean a lotfor your baby’s health.Watch Cell Phone Use—For years some scientists have warned that the radiationemitted by cell phones can damage the brain. But more research has been needed.Now research is under way, and recent studies on mice at the Yale School ofMedicine provide the first experimental evidence that exposing fetuses to cellphone radiation does in fact affect their behavior as adults. The researchersfound that compared to a control group, mice that were exposed to cell phoneradiation in utero suffered from hyperactivity and demonstrated problems withmemory. The researchers said that studies with humans were necessary beforedrawing any final conclusions; however, they said it may be advisable to limitfetal exposure to this form of radiation.Let Your Partner Clean the Kitty Litter Box—A common parasite, Toxoplasmagondii, can lurk in the cat litter box. It is spread through cat feces,undercooked meats, and unwashed vegetables, and it has been known to causestillbirths or brain damage if transmitted from the mother to the baby. In arecent international study of more than 45,000 women, being exposed to thisparasite also made women more prone to suicide. Washing your hands when dealingwith animal waste is always important to your health but even more so whenconsidering getting pregnant.I know this may sound like a lot to give up for the sake of your baby (exceptfor giving up cleaning the kitty litter box, which should be easy), but it willbe well worth it to have a healthy baby and a healthier you, who will be betterable to take care of your family and meet the many other challenges we all faceevery day.THE EMOTIONAL CONNECTION: IT STARTS EARLIER THAN YOU THINKMany women talk about the special bond they feel with their children. There’sscientific evidence that not only backs it up but that also indicates theconnection starts very early in the relationship.Laura Glynn explains that just as the fetus influences the development of themother’s brain, the influence goes the other way as well. Intrauterine signalsinfluence the developing brain structure of the fetus as well as cognitivefunction and physiological stress regulation that will affect the childthroughout his or her life.For example, research at the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursingindicates that violent behavior in adulthood partially may be a function of theenvironment a fetus experiences in the womb. Specifically, prenatal andpostnatal exposure to toxic elements like tobacco smoke or lead and poormaternal nutrition are related to delinquent behavior in teenagers, which isfurther related to violence in adults. Additional risk factors are maternaldepression and stress, birth complications, traumatic brain injury, and childabuse.With regard to maternal depression, a longitudinal study conducted byresearchers at Cardiff University, King’s College London, and the University ofBristol provided evidence that a mother’s depression prior to birth is linked toviolence in her children. Women who are depressed while pregnant are four timesmore likely to have children who are violent at age sixteen. This held for bothsons and daughters. Somehow the mother’s depression creates a chemicalenvironment in her womb that predisposes her children to express violentbehavior later in life.When you are pregnant, lines of communication and influence are opened betweenyou and your baby, and whatever is communicated can have untold consequences onthat baby’s further development. If you are having any emotional problems, orproblems with any addictions, don’t ignore them. Seek the help you need now, andyou may alter for the better the course of your child’s future life.POSTPARTUMDEPRESSION AND PSYCHOSISDuring pregnancy, a woman’s body is stoked with hormones. Then comes the birth,which is accompanied with a sudden, major shift in her hormone balance. All thatestrogen and progesterone fall off a cliff. That sharp reverse in itself wouldbe enough to throw anyone into a tailspin. But add to that the disruption insleep with a newborn to care for, the stress of perhaps not knowing what to do,and concerns over not being a good enough mother (especially if this is a firstchild), and a completely new family dynamic, and the stage is set for a huge(negative) emotional response.If the response is not too extreme and doesn’t last too long, we call it thebaby blues. This is so common that it may occur in 45–80 percent of women withinthe first ten days of giving birth. Symptoms include depression, spells ofcrying, broken sleep, disturbed appetite, and perhaps most distressing, lack ofaffection for her baby. In most cases, these symptoms disappear as hormones comeback into balance and conditions “normalize.”But sometimes the symptoms don’t go away, and postpartum depression develops. Ithappens about 10 percent to 15 percent of the time. And it’s even more prevalentamong teenage mothers, up to 26–32 percent. When it occurs, it’s verydistressing to mother, baby, and the entire family network. Serious symptomsoften appear about four weeks postpartum, although they can sometimes firstappear even months later. One day everything seems to be fine, and then sixmonths later the bottom falls out and the mother feels like she just can’thandle everything anymore.Even more serious is a very rare condition, postpartum psychosis, which occursabout once or twice in one thousand births. Here the symptoms are more extremeand can lead to suicide or infanticide.There are a number of contributing factors to postpartum depression, althoughthe exact cause has not been determined. To the degree that hormone imbalancemay be involved, anything a woman can do to maintain a healthy lifestyle, withgood nutrition, adequate sleep, and avoiding toxins, can help. Also, keepingstress at a minimum and having good support from family and friends can have apositive effect. Avoid isolation at this difficult time.Seek professional help if your symptoms don’t start to fade after two weeks butstay the same or get worse, if your symptoms interfere with your work and makeit hard to care for yourself or your baby, or you have thoughts of harmingyourself or your baby. Getting your thyroid (as well as your other importantnumbers) checked is essential. Counseling can help, as can exercise, simplesupplements according to your brain type (see chapter 6[Amen_9780307888969_epub_c06_r1.htm]), hormone therapy, or antidepressants fordepression or antipsychotics for delusions or hallucinations. It is veryimportant for you to be under the care of an experienced health care provider ifthese are issues for you or someone you care about.It’s important not to ignore the problem, because it not only affects you butyour baby and husband as well. Children of mothers who have untreated postpartumdepression can experience a disruption of emotional attachment and exhibitproblems later in life. They often have difficulty with eating and sleeping,they can be hyperactive and have temper tantrums, and they can show delayedlanguage development. And depression that is untreated can last up to a year orlonger and even lead to chronic depression or later episodes of severedepression. So don’t write off the condition as being “normal.”GENERATIONS OF HEALTHY BRAINS: UNLEASHING THE POWER OF YOUR CHILD’S BRAINNow that you’ve done everything you can to make sure that your brain is in thebest condition for your own sake and the sake of your baby, it’s time to thinkabout the next generation and what you can do to keep your child’s brain in goodshape.1. Take Good Care of Your Own Brain and Your Relationship with Your Baby’sFather—Too many women ignore their own needs or their primary love relationshipin favor of taking care of the children, but it is a mistake. Of course you needto take care of the children’s basic needs, but if you neglect your own, yourown unhappiness will leak through and affect their development.2. Create an Enriched Environment Full of Attention, Eye Contact, Touching, andPlay—Just the right amount of stimulation helps the baby’s brain develop.Singing, music, toys, and movement are all important to brain development.3. Pass Along Your Healthy Eating Lifestyle—When it comes to eating behavior,children tend to eat the way their mothers do. In a study at Michigan StateUniversity, toddlers were less likely to eat a healthy amount of fruits andvegetables if their mothers did not. And we know that food preferencesestablished in childhood persist through life. Anything that’s good for you isgood for your child. Eat a balanced diet with lean protein, plenty of freshfruits and vegetables, moderate amounts of healthy fats (children need them tokeep their brain in optimal shape), with a minimum of processed foods and sugarand little to no caffeine. Work together on planning meals and snacks that willnourish body and brain.4. Start Healthy Habits Early—Since our daughter Chloe was two years old, sheand I have been playing “Chloe’s Game.” This game is based on a very simplequestion: “Is this good for my brain or bad for it?” For example, if I said,“Avocado,” she would say, “Two thumbs up!” If I said, “Chocolate cookies,” shewould respond, “Thumbs down. Too much sugar.” If I said, “Boxing,” she wouldsay, “Two thumbs down. The brain is too soft to put it in a helmet and slam itup against other people.” If I said, “Blueberries,” she would question, “Arethey organic? Blueberries hold more pesticides than any other fruit. But organicblueberries are great.”One day when Chloe was seven and we were in line for the Pirates of theCaribbean ride at Disneyland, she and I wrote a list of those things that weregood and bad for the brain. We started by thinking of words, using the lettersof the alphabet. It is a great exercise to do with children to get them thinkingabout their brains.For example:GoodAlmond milk Berries Almonds Bowling Anteaters (to eat the ANTs) Broccoli ApplesCarrots Apricots Cauliflower Arithmetic Cinnamon Avocados Cooperation BadmintonCreativity Bananas Cucumbers Baseball Cuddling Basketball Dancing Beans DoodlingBell peppers DrawingBadAbuse Brain injuries Alcohol Bullying Anger Candy ANTs Churros Anxiety CookiesBad attitude Cotton candy Bad behavior Driving too fast Being too bossy DrugsBoxing [images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_042_r1.jpg]View Chloe’s entire list.5. Promote Brain-Healthy Exercise and Protect Them from Brain Injuries—Thestatistics are frightening. Did you know that every fifteen seconds, right herein the United States, someone experiences a traumatic brain injury? That’saccording to the Brain Injury Association of America. Brain trauma, even thosethat are considered mild, have been linked to aggressive behavior, depression,learning problems, panic attacks, and drug and alcohol abuse later in life. Upto 70 percent of injuries affect the PFC, the part of the brain concerned withplanning, decision making, and impulse control. Damage to this part of the braincan not only lead to learning deficits, but can also result in problems withcontrolling emotions and reading and responding appropriately to social signals.Brain injuries come in many sizes. It’s obvious that a trauma that leads to lossof consciousness is bad and requires immediate attention. But a series of smallinjuries can also add up to a major problem. Repetitive falls, head banging, orrepetitive blows or concussions in football or soccer can be just asdebilitating over time as one big blow.It turns out that when it comes to the severity of symptoms following braintrauma, girls are at a disadvantage. In the most extreme cases of trauma inchildren under ten years of age, girls are more than four times as likely asboys to die from severe brain trauma. It’s thought that higher levels oftestosterone in boys protects their brains by building brain mass in the sameway that it makes their muscles bigger and stronger. Estrogen in girls, however,makes them more susceptible to injury. Interestingly, whatever the cause of thisdifference, it reverses later in life. Among people in their fifties toseventies, women are twice as likely to survive serious brain trauma as men.It’s extremely important to protect developing brains. Of course children shouldwear helmets when riding bicycles, and they should not hang upside down onmonkey bars placed above a concrete slab. But please also consider injuries thatcould take place during common sports. It isn’t good for any child to engage incontact sports involving head butting or possible blows to the head. Footballand soccer are not safe for anybody’s brain, let alone a child’s. This used tobe primarily an issue for boys, but today girls are engaging more and more inthese activities, and as we just saw, their brains are even more vulnerable thantheir brothers’ and male classmates’ are.Flying soccer balls are a real menace. It is estimated that a ball that’s beenkicked hard can impact a player’s head with a force of 175 pounds! Now thinkabout your daughter’s delicate little skull and the precious brain that’sresting inside. Does that sound like a good idea to you? She’s meeting thatmissile with her frontal lobes, and she needs those frontal lobes for the restof her own life so that she can be a good mother to your granddaughters as thenext generation comes along.And even cheerleading, which used to be a fairly safe, fun activity, is becomingpotentially very dangerous as it is being turned into an extreme sport. Nowgirls are “flyers” who are tossed up into the air, and if they don’t stick thelanding, there can be serious injury.There are many healthy, enjoyable sports that will not compromise yourdaughter’s brain health and her future. Tennis, Ping-Pong (my personalfavorite), swimming, basketball, and volleyball, are all wonderful ways toexercise a growing body. And there are always ballet and other forms of dance.Encourage your daughter to have fun doing what’s good for her.6. Get Treatment for Any Emotional Issues or Learning Challenges Right Away—Ifyou suspect your child has a behavioral, emotional, or learning issue, have itchecked in to. Small problems left untreated can turn into large problems. Butearly treatment can nip difficulties in the bud and change the entire course ofyour child’s life. Sometimes all that’s needed is a lifestyle change or the useof natural supplements. The sooner you get your child on a brain-healthyprogram, the better. A good place to start is by mentioning your concerns toyour child’s physician.HELPING YOUR DAUGHTER THROUGH ADOLESCENCE: KEEPING HER SAFE UNTIL HER PFC KICKSIN!Now that you’ve gotten your daughter safely through childhood, the next hurdlelooms: adolescence. That’s when your sweet little girl turns into a texting,tweeting, eye-rolling teenager who suddenly knows much more than you ever didand doesn’t have the time or interest in any advice you may want to give her.However, without having a fully functioning PFC, the decisions she makes can bea little scary.The PFC, the CEO of the brain that analyzes, plans, and controls impulses, isone of the last regions of the brain to fully develop. That means the girl whois learning to drive, who is going on dates, and who is being faced with allkinds of new situations and temptations is not working with the full capacity ofthe part of her brain that can anticipate consequences, regulate intenseemotions, and balance short-term gratification against long-term goals. Thatpart of the brain doesn’t fully mature until she reaches around twenty-fiveyears of age. That allows a good ten years or so during which she has the meansto take actions she may later regret.And that’s not good, because adolescents are especially vulnerable to permanentbrain injury as a result of risky behavior.Amphetamine Abuse—Information presented at the Society for Neuroscienceindicates that amphetamine abuse during adolescence “permanently changes braincells.” According to research on animals, changes in electrical properties ofcortical brain cells occurred after drug exposure during adolescence but notyoung adulthood. Other research shows that adult rats exposed to amphetamines inadolescence showed deficits in their working memory. It now appears that thechange in cognitive behavior may be partially the result of changes to thefunction of neurons in the PFC as a result of amphetamines, which disrupt thenormal process of brain development.Cigarette Smoking—UCLA researchers have looked at brain function in adolescentsmokers, focusing on the PFC. They found that the more a teen was addicted tonicotine, the less active the PFC. They concluded that smoking affects brainfunction, and the PFC is especially vulnerable because adolescence is a criticaltime for development of this brain region.Marijuana—Researchers at the University of Cincinnati have concluded that thebrains of teens who use marijuana work harder than the brains of their peers whodo not use the drug. According to Krista Medina, the lead researcher, “Chronic,heavy marijuana use during adolescence—a critical period of ongoing braindevelopment—is associated with poorer performance on thinking tasks, includingslower psychomotor speed and poorer complex attention, verbal memory andplanning ability.” Her findings also indicate that while there may be partialrecovery of verbal memory functioning within three weeks of starting abstinence,there are long-lasting effects as “complex attention skills continue to beaffected.” She also found that compared to boys, girls have a greater tendencyto have cognitive problems, including poor executive function and a decreasedability to plan, make good decisions, and stay focused.Eating Disorders—Another big problem girls are facing today is the growing levelof obesity and eating disorders, both of which can interfere with proper brainfunction. Your relationship with your daughter is crucial in helping her developgood eating habits, healthy self-esteem, and a positive body image. A studyreported in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine found that thedesire of teenage girls to maintain a good weight was partly based on how theyperceived their mother’s goal for them. That means if you instill in them thevalue to stay at a healthy weight, that will influence them positively. I thinkwe can also conclude that if you have an overcritical view of your daughter’sweight, it could lead to poor body image and perhaps even encourage thedevelopment of eating disorders. Be aware of the messages you are giving yourdaughter. You may not be aware of the messages you are presenting, but she willbe aware on some level. Make sure your influence is for her good and yours.Sleep Deprivation—According to the National Sleep Foundation, the average sleeprequirement for a thirteen- to nineteen-year-old teenager is nine hours. Howmany teens even come close to that? I would wager not very many. But not gettingenough sleep disrupts hormone regulation and can lead to putting on weight. Itinterferes with focus and willpower, reduces athletic performance, and isassociated with depression and ADD; in other words, it creates havoc witheverything important to a teenager’s life. And sleep deprivation is rampantamong teens. Sleep cycles change when kids reach their teen years. They are moreapt to want to go to sleep later and wake up later. But school schedules thatstart early in the morning make it impossible for them to make up for the hoursof sleep lost from texting and playing video games into the wee hours. Researchwith mice suggests that even short-term sleep restriction during adolescence caninterfere with the balanced growth and depletion of brain synapses, which arethe connections between nerve cells where communication occurs. The researcherssurmise this can lead to long-term problems with the wiring of the brain.Adolescent girls may think that going to bed early “is for babies,” a beliefthat can have lasting consequences.Depression—Depression can hit anyone, but adolescent girls seem to be especiallyprone to it. They are twice as likely to experience bouts of depression comparedto their male peers. Canadian researcher Nancy Galambos of the University ofAlberta found that one in five teenage girls admit to undergoing periods ofdepression, as compared to one in ten boys. She goes on to say that depressionis associated with anxiety, eating disorders, disruptive conduct, failure inschool, and difficulty in relationships. Hormonal changes in girls may be acausal factor. Watch for signs of depression, like moodiness, isolation, andself-harming behaviors such as cutting or hair pulling, and seek help whenbehaviors begin to raise red flags.Alcohol—Alcohol abuse by teens is an obvious problem when it leads to drunkdriving and accidents. A recent report from the Mayo Clinic reveals thathospitalizations resulting from underage drinking have an estimated price tag of$755 million each year. Mayo Clinic addiction expert and psychiatrist TerrySchneekloth says, “When teenagers drink, they tend to drink excessively, leadingto many destructive consequences, including motor vehicle accidents, injuries,homicides and suicides.”Perhaps we associate this tendency with boys more than girls, and in fact boysdo make up 61 percent of alcohol-related hospitalizations of teens. But thatmeans that 39 percent were girls, a significant amount. This is very troublingbecause not only do girls face the usual dangers associated with alcohol abuse,but they face another danger that they, and you, may not even be aware of:Adolescent girls and young women who drink alcohol have increased risk of benign(noncancerous) breast disease. This is not as benign as it sounds, as it is anincreased risk factor for breast cancer later in life. And further researchshows that the risk increases for adolescent girls from families with a historyof breast cancer.Risky Behavior in General—Researchers from the Netherlands have investigated thedevelopment of addictive behavior. Their conclusion? Addictive behavior has agreater likelihood of being initiated during adolescence than during any otherperiod of life. It appears that the differential developmental trajectories ofthose brain regions specifically involved in motivation and self-control tend tomake adolescents generally more prone to risk taking. And these tendencies areaggravated by the consequences of using drugs. Neuroimaging studies ofadolescent brains show an imbalance between the impulse-controlling PFC and thedeeper regions that are related to motivation. It is this imbalance duringadolescence, when the PFC is not yet mature, that may be the cause of morerisk-taking behavior at this time.In related studies, the researchers looked at anticipation of reward in ten- totwelve-year-olds, fourteen- to fifteen-year-olds, and eighteen- totwenty-three-year olds. They found that of all the groups, the adolescentsappeared to be hypersensitive to rewards. Everything just seems to promise somuch more pleasure to them, possibly contributing to their greater risk-takingbehavior.So what’s a mother to do? At a time when your daughter’s brain is mostvulnerable to negative influences that could interfere with proper development,she is also most tempted to engage in risk-taking behaviors that could causelasting damage. How do you protect her?First, your understanding of what’s going on inside your daughter’s head willhelp you in your dealings with her. You expect her to act like an adult, and shewants to be treated like an adult, but now you know she doesn’t have the brainof an adult. So you are the one who has to be the adult. Instead of losing yourcool and seeing her as trying to provoke you, keep your head and understand thatshe has a less mature perspective. Then give her the facts that can help hermake better decisions. This is an excellent time to instill in her a littlebrain envy. Explain to her that there can be negative consequences to the thingsshe now sees as fun and help her see the bigger picture, including the kind offuture she really wants to have. Show her the brain scans in this book and onour website that clearly demonstrate the effect risky behaviors have on thebrain. And engage her cooperation in a mother-daughter pact whereby the two ofyou work together to both have better brains. That means a better diet,exercising, and helping each other avoid harmful activities.As each generation takes the responsibility of preparing for the next, the giftof brain health will be passed along, and all of us will benefit.HOUR 11 EXERCISE—INDULGE IN SPECIAL TIMEI have taught parenting classes for many years. “Special Time” is one of themost effective exercises I have ever given to parents. It takes just twentyminutes for each child, but will make a huge difference in your relationshipwith your children. The exercise strengthens the parent–child bond.Here it is: Spend twenty minutes a day with your child/teen doing something thathe or she wants to do. During that time, issue no commands, ask no questions,and offer no directions. It is not a time to talk to her about her messy room,homework, or lack of respect. It is just a time to be together. The best time tostart this is with young children, but I have also seen it be very powerful forolder children and teenagers. Tell the children you miss them and just want tospend more time with them and that you want to make this a regular date, daily,if possible. Allow them to choose what you do together as long as it is safe,brain-healthy, and you can do it in twenty minutes. If you can do this everyday, you will notice a significant boost in bonding within two weeks.If you don’t have children, do it with your partner. Bonding prolongs life andmakes it worth living."},{"pageContent":"12CHANGE YOUR FEMALE BRAIN, CHANGE THE WORLD[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_L02_r1.jpg]REALIZE THAT IT’S NOT ABOUT YOU—IT IS ABOUT GENERATIONS OF YOU[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_L03_r1.jpg]Creating a brain-healthy family and community is the twelfth step to unleashingthe power of the female brain.[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_L03_r1.jpg]Be the change you want to see in the world.—MAHATMA GANDHIWhile I was leaving church with my wife recently, a woman came up to us and saidshe had lost 45 pounds on the Daniel Plan, the health plan we helped to createat Saddleback Church. As she got healthy, her husband, who was 300 pounds at thebeginning of our program, was also down 75 pounds. He did not start right away,but as he saw his wife’s success, he decided to join her. She had told him thatshe was sorry he would not be around to enjoy a wonderful life with her. Therewas no nagging or belittling. She showed by example that a better life ispossible if you do the right thing.I hope you know from your own experience that you, as an individual woman, canchange your own life and the lives of your friends and family. But let’s take aminute to look at the bigger picture and get a more global perspective. Aroundthe world, women are trying to do the same thing you are: Build a better life bychanging themselves and the conditions around them. And when one woman unleashesthe power of her brain, it’s a huge stride forward for the betterment of all ofus—male and female, young and old.In their remarkable book Half the Sky, married journalists Nicholas Kristof andSheryl WuDunn describe the heart-wrenching conditions of poverty and abuse underwhich women live around the world. They provide amazing stories of survival andtranscendence in which brave, passionate women have turned tragedy to triumph tobring unimaginable healing change to themselves and their communities.Leaders everywhere are realizing that the hope of the world lies in givingopportunity to women. As Kofi Annan, former secretary-general of the UnitedNations, said in his address to the “Women 2000” special session of the UNGeneral Assembly, “Study after study has confirmed that there is no developmentstrategy more beneficial to society as a whole—women and men alike—than onewhich involves women as central players.”In worldwide efforts to eliminate poverty, it has been found that helping womenfirst to develop their own businesses creates a wave of prosperity that liftsthe entire community. From microfinance loans to women through the Grameen Bank(founder Muhammad Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize for his work), to the effortsof BRAC (the largest antipoverty organization in the world) to save lives andraise incomes of the poorest women, it’s been proven again and again that womendo not just benefit from the poverty-fighting efforts of others on their behalf,but they themselves become the most effective agents of the desired change.And, in fact, if you look around the world you can see women leading efforts tobring about social changes that not only improve conditions for themselves, butalso benefit their families and the larger community. They are calling forfairness in honoring water and land rights. They are pushing for improvements ineducation and health care. They are speaking up for better treatment of peoplewho have no voice to speak for themselves. And they are working to bring aboutthe resolution of conflict through better communication and understanding.There’s a growing acknowledgment by governments and aid workers that if you wantto improve a community, you’d best start by giving more power and economicfreedom to the women. When Kristof and WuDunn mentioned the politicallyincorrect opinion that women in Africa “typically work harder and handled moneymore wisely than men” to Festus Mogae, the enlightened former leader ofBotswana, he agreed wholeheartedly: “You couldn’t be more right. Women do workbetter. Banks were the first to see that and hired more women, and now everybodydoes. In homes too, women manage affairs better than men.” It’s widely acceptedthat when women are given more power, the lives of all the people improve.It is critical that you recognize the power you have—not only to change yourselfbut those around you. Your female brain is compassionate and caring. Yourintelligence is characterized by the ability to see the bigger picture and makeconnections. And whether you’re looking to change the quality of life in thelarger world around you or within your own home, you have the unique perspectiveand passion that can make you turn any situation into a better one. Given theright tools, you can be unstoppable.THE POWER OF COMMUNITYYou can do remarkable things on your own. But you can be an even greater agentfor change when your efforts are magnified by the power of community.Dr. Linda Wagener, a leadership consultant from Marigold Associates says, “If Ican only give people one piece of advice about how to make a change, I’llrecommend that they surround themselves with people who embody that change.” Shegoes on to give a number of specific reasons why being part of a community thatsupports change is so helpful. First, it provides a mirror to us, so we seeourselves more truly without underestimating or overestimating our strengths andweaknesses. We can use that information to make our actions more effective.Working with others also gives us the encouragement to go beyond what we thinkwe can do. This is important when we’re nervous about trying something new.Community also provides accountability to follow through on what we promise.We’re more likely to visit the gym every day or take that brisk walk if we havea friend who is waiting for us to show up. And community gives us the support weneed when we get discouraged and want to quit.Many cultures are aware that change happens with the support of others. In herbook Join the Club: How Peer Pressure Can Transform the World, Tina Rosenbergtalks about the “social cure.” She explains that usually when people try tobring about change, they do it by sharing information in an attempt to convinceothers. But the social cure takes a more direct approach. It changes behavior byhelping people get what they care about most, which is the respect of theirpeers. Rosenberg believes that social pressure through a peer group—what shemeans by a club—is the best way to influence behavior. The peer group is sostrong and persuasive, it can cause a woman to adopt a new identity as a memberof the club. And she emulates the behavior of other club members: “I can be likemy friend whose life has changed.”Possibly the most famous and successful of these “clubs” is AlcoholicsAnonymous. Weight Watchers is another great example. Put someone with others whohave the same goal, and together they form an entity that pressures eachindividual to meet the group goal.Researchers give us some insight into why working in a group can be soeffective. First, being part of a community helps relieve chronic stress. Thatremoves a key factor in obesity, memory problems, cardiovascular and digestiveissues, insulin dysregulation, and a weakened immune system. On the positiveside, being in a supportive group elevates stress-reducing hormones likeoxytocin. That’s why getting together with your friends for a chat where lots ofbonding is going on can lead to a euphoric kind of peace.Rosenberg believes that much of the dissatisfaction people have in life is dueto feeling isolated. People are seeking community and connection. The socialcure may involve a sacrifice of time for meetings, and a loss of privacy, but itsolves important personal problems and adds meaning to people’s lives. Gettingothers to join you in your endeavors is a great way to improve your chances ofsuccess.Whether it’s tackling personal health goals, trying to improve the environment,or bringing about social change, working with others first multiplies yourefforts and, second, helps keep you on track. And women’s brains are especiallysuited to effective action within a group setting. You have excellentcommunication skills, you easily make connections between ideas, you’re great atmultitasking, and you are empathic and compassionate. Also, friends can providerealistic, positive feedback when your own thoughts become negative,self-judgmental, and let’s face it, a bit unreasonable.As much as good company keeps you on track, bad company can derail you, so do beaware of the kind of company you keep. The power of social influence cuts bothways, and if you spend time with people who are unhappy, negative, or who engagein unhealthy habits, they can bring you down instead of raise you up.There have now been a number of studies that show that unhealthy habits can becontagious. For example, research published in the New England Journal ofMedicine found that one of the strongest associations in the spread of obesitywas who you spend time with. This multigenerational heart study looked at datafrom over 12,000 subjects over a thirty-year period. Subjects who had a friendwho was obese had a 57 percent chance of also being obese. If the twoindividuals identified each other as being strong friends, the figure shot up to171 percent. And this relationship held even if the subjects didn’t live in thesame area. Sibling relationships also proved important. Having an obese siblingwas related to a 40 percent increase in the chance of obesity.Clearly, we influence each other for good, or for bad. Be aware of theinfluences around you. But also take this as a powerful motivator to be a goodrole model and a positive influence on the people with whom you interact. Weknow that when health-conscious friends improve their own health, their friends’health also improves. You can be the one who encourages others to do better bydoing better yourself.And the more you help others, the more you will help yourself. I like to thinkof it this way: You have to give it away to keep it.I saw a great example of this one evening at an event in my own home. My wiferuns a group through Amen Clinics that helps women lose weight and get healthy.To celebrate the last class of the session, Tana was holding a party for thegroup members. They sounded like they were having so much fun, I couldn’t resistjoining in.I got into a conversation with one of the woman who told me she had taken theclass to learn how to deal with fibromyalgia and brain fog. Within two weeks ofstarting the program, the fibromyalgia symptoms were gone and her mind was muchclearer. She had also dropped 11 pounds, which had been her goal. She said thatshe felt our program had changed her life.I congratulated her on her progress and told her that to keep improving she hadto give the program away by teaching others what she had learned. She repliedthat she had already begun. Her husband and children had started to eat better,and instead of sharing cookies with her co-workers, she was sharing informationabout healthy food. She had learned for herself that when you share yourknowledge with others, you more firmly embed that wisdom into your daily life.This is how you can be the agent for change. Reaching out to others so you canget healthy together helps both of you. And there are many benefits to yourhealth, your well-being, the way you look and feel, and the quality of yourrelationships. It’s a win-win for everyone—and it all starts with you.A PRACTICAL APPLICATION: THE DANIEL PLANBeing involved with the Daniel Plan at Saddleback Church has been one of thehighlights of my life. The program was specifically designed to use the power ofcommunity to help individuals achieve healthier, more productive lives. TheDaniel Plan is named after the biblical prophet who refused to eat the king’sbad food. The fifty-two-week program has had remarkable success. One of thereasons it works so well is that we take advantage of a long-standing structureat Saddleback, where thousands of people meet each week in small groups. Fewpeople can make major changes alone. Getting people into small groups enhancesthe commitment and learning of individuals by providing ongoing encouragementand emotional support. In fact, people are 50 percent more successful at weightloss and wellness improvement if they work in the context of a community ratherthan on their own.The entire Daniel program is directed by Dee Eastman, a fitness and wellnessexpert with vast experience in small-group leadership. Dee stresses the power ofcommunity that develops in groups as members watch others they trust followingthe program, share information with one another, and engage in “water-coolertalk” that keeps group interests uppermost in members’ minds. And when peoplehave a bad day, the group environment encourages members to pause and reflectwithout self-judgment and then ask for support to help bring balance into theirlives.Dee offers some great tips for making small groups succeed. You should keepthese in mind if you’re thinking of joining or creating your own support group.They can help make your efforts much more effective.Be Authentic—The success of the group depends on the level of authenticity itencourages, and group members always follow the level of vulnerability andopenness shown by the leader. In that regard, then, the speed of the leader isthe speed of the team. Do not feel like you have to have it all togetheryourself to lead a group. Just being a woman who is open to growing and actingin a community setting is enough. You don’t have to be the strongest in thegroup to lead. The focus should be on coming together in an open and honestplace where there is a common desire to grow, change, and keep moving forward.Have Some Accountability—Each group must decide what level of accountabilitymembers feel comfortable with, but there do need to be tangible goals thatinspire members, and all members should be “behind” everyone’s achieving.Accountability can be implemented by giving reports at meetings, regularlychecking in with one another, or any other system that works effectively.Keep It Fresh—Don’t get into a rut of going over the same material at everymeeting. Vary the material studied, whether it’s a new book, a DVD series,magazine articles, or anything else that’s relevant, informative, and inspiring.Keep the material fresh and interesting so members will feel they’re alwaysgetting something new and important, and their interest level is kept up.Variety is the spice of life when it comes to small groups!Be Great Listeners—Group members should be great listeners for one another. Theyshould seek to understand and come alongside one another; they should not try tosolve the problems of people in the group. A comfortable, open atmosphere allowsfor openness and sharing. Feeling judged, or that others who think they knowmore are trying to fix you, is what closes people down.Give Back—Your program should include ways of giving back to the church,culture, or community. Looking and giving outward balances the effort to growinwardly. Sharing what has been learned extends the reach of the group’spositive developments.Draw Out Each Individual’s Strengths—Dee says one of her favorite parts of thesmall-group experience is seeing each individual’s passion and calling revealedand then creating a platform where those gifts can be shared within the groupand with the larger world. She creates opportunities for people to shine,perhaps by asking them to host a workshop or a food demonstration, appear in avideo, write an article, and so on. She is always providing new leadershipopportunities for others to serve within the group, to the benefit of theindividual and the group. She works to foster these growth experiences anddiscourages competition. She says, “As women we can truly champion otherwomen—draw out each other’s strengths, provide opportunities for others togrow—so everyone wins and we operate as we were designed to live.”One of the most exciting outcomes of the Daniel Plan is seeing the group membersspread what they’ve learned outside their small groups to their families andcommunities, thereby becoming a significant influence for healthy living. Thereis a tremendous domino effect for the positive. Dee gives an example of onegroup member, Chloe, who has lost an amazing 155 pounds. Not only has she becomea new person, but she’s sharing her new knowledge by writing on wellness andstarting a healthy line of cupcakes. “And they are so delicious—go figure!” Deeadds.YOU ALWAYS GET BETTER FASTER WHEN YOU ENGAGE THE FOUR CIRCLESOne of the problems with change is that it doesn’t always last. You stick toyour diet until the holidays roll around, and then you lose all control. Youkeep up with your exercise plan for a full month, and then you start skippingdays and finally forget all about it.You want more than a temporary change. You want change that lasts. And thatrequires change that radiates through your whole being and involves every partof you to become “locked in.” For that kind of change to occur, it is criticalthat you engage each of the Four Circles talked about throughout the book(biology, psychology, social connections, and spiritual health).Find a way to hook the change you want into each of those four aspects of yourbeing, and it will be much more likely to be permanent. Do the same for thepeople you want to influence, and they will also see change that becomesingrained into their nature.DEVELOP GREAT COMMUNICATION SKILLSTo be an agent for change, you have to communicate effectively. Here are sixways to become a better communicator: 1. Assume the other person wants to communicate with you. Drop anynegative attitudes on your part that may be setting you up for a bad outcome. 2. State what you want in a clear, positive way. Don’t make demands thatcan be met with hostility. Don’t be weak, which can lead to your beingdismissed. Be firm, kind, and confident. 3. Decrease distractions and make sure you have each other’s fullattention. 4. Ask for feedback to make sure the other person understands you andthat you understand the other person. 5. Be a good listener. Unless you both express what you want to say,there will be no communication, but there may be resentment and hard feelings. 6. Follow up on your communication. Even if you thought you reached anunderstanding, people forget, get distracted, or change their minds. If theoutcome you want is important to you, follow up to see if the change you want isbeing implemented.IT’S NOT JUST ABOUT YOU—IT’S ABOUT GENERATIONS OF YOUYour behavior influences the expression of your genes and the health ofsubsequent generations. As Americans, we covet our freedom. We don’t like anyoneelse telling us what to do, especially if it involves our own bad habits. Butthe unfortunate truth is that your behavior is not just about you. It isultimately about generations of you. When Tana and I first figured this out, webecame much more serious about our own behavior and what we did and did notallow in our home, and subsequently at Amen Clinics.A new field of genetics has grown up in the last twenty years calledepigenetics. Epigenetic means “above or on top of the gene” and refers to therecent discovery that your habits and emotions can impact your biology so deeplythat there are changes in the genes that are transmitted to the next severalgenerations. It is these epigenetic “marks” that tell your genes to switch on oroff, to express themselves loudly or softly. It is through epigenetics thatimmediate environmental factors like diet, stress, toxins, and prenatalnutrition can affect your genes that are passed to your offspring and beyond.It is not just about you, it is about generations of you. For instance, a recentstudy has shown that boys who started smoking before puberty (say at age elevenor twelve) caused their sons to have significantly higher rates of obesity. Thismeans that a dumb decision at age eleven can cause disastrous results for latergenerations. And obesity is just the beginning. Some researchers believe thatepigenetics holds the key to understanding some cancers, forms of dementia,schizophrenia, autism, and diabetes.In groundbreaking research, Dr. Lars Olov Bygren, a preventive-health specialistfrom Sweden studied the offspring of families who had experienced both feast andfamine. Children and grandchildren of mothers who were malnourished had a higherincidence of heart disease. Counterintuitively, boys and girls who were born intimes of feast (abundant food) produced children and grandchildren who livedsignificantly shorter lives. Eating too much, it seems, can be as bad onsubsequent generations as eating too little. In these times of abundant food andepidemic overweight and obesity, this study should give all of us serious pause.What we eat can affect future generations. So you’re not only what you eat butpotentially what your mother and father and even grandparents ate too.Another example of epigenetics is stress. When mothers-to-be are stressed theyproduce more of the hormone cortisol than they otherwise would. Some of thecortisol is transmitted to the baby through the placenta. The elevated stresshormones prematurely reset the baby’s brain to be more sensitive orhyperresponsive to subsequent stressful events. For example, there is a veryhigh incidence of depression in children of Holocaust survivors. Learning tomanage your stress is important for you and your children and grandchildren.Clearly, your behavior matters beyond yourself and is an important reason to gethealthy now.UNLEASH THE POWER THAT CAN CHANGE YOUR WORLDI am not a big believer in baby steps. I think that for you to get healthy andstay that way, you need to make a serious commitment. Tana, who is not only mywife but also my partner in helping people get well, says that to get reallyhealthy, people have to jump the canyon, which you cannot do in baby steps. Ittakes a leap to leave behind a toxic lifestyle.Live your own best vision for yourself, and you can’t help but better the livesof those you care about. As a woman, you bring special skills and talents toevery task and every relationship. Unleash that power and there’s no telling howfar that positive influence can go.Here are just three ways in which you can exert your amazing power of positiveimpact:Be a Positive Role Model—Your children are watching you. They are modeling theirbehavior after you—in areas that you may not even suspect. For example,according to a scientific poll commissioned by CreditCards.com[http://CreditCards.com], when adults were asked which family member had thegreatest effect on their knowledge of finances and how they managed their money,they most often cited their mothers as being the person with the most influence.And “influence” wasn’t necessarily good. If mothers handled their moneyfoolishly, that’s what affected their children most. And no, it’s not enough tojust give lip service to wise money behavior. It was what the mothers actuallydid with their own money, not what they advised their children to do, that wasmirrored by the behavior of their children.Use Your Unique Qualities to Better the World Around You—Your powerful femalebrain suits you to work with others to help bring about positive change. Yourstrong communication skills and ability to see the bigger picture enable you tobring people together to improve situations. Your greater understanding ofothers and ability to empathize makes you caring and compassionate and able tohelp your family, your friends, and the larger community.For example, research out of the University of Cincinnati indicates thatcompared to men, women starting new businesses are more likely to considerindividual responsibility and more likely to use their business as a vehicle forsocial and environmental change. You’re always thinking of others, even whilebettering yourself.This doesn’t mean you have to go on the world stage. Just by doing the tasksthat come to you, and taking care of the issues that you face each day, you canbecome a positive influence on everyone you meet.Influence the Men in Your Life to Be Their Best—Your brain is different from thebrains of the men in your life, but by using this fact, you can begin tounderstand and communicate with one another in ways that foster your deeper loveand ability to work together for the good of your relationship and your family.Research shows that involvement of fathers in the family can be predicted basedon the involvement of mothers, but the reciprocal influence was not significant.It is mothers who can encourage fathers to be more involved. Help your man byencouraging him to communicate more effectively, to be more engaged in the lifeof the family, and to live a healthier lifestyle.For you to have this positive effect, you need to do everything you can to makesure that your own brain is healthy and working in top condition. I call itbeing a brain warrior for yourself and those you love. It requires: • Keeping your brain safe by avoiding toxic foods, chemicals, and drugs,and staying away from dangerous activities that could traumatize your brain • Stabilizing your weight at a healthy level • Getting exercise that keeps your blood flowing—especially to yourbrain • Getting sufficient sleep every night, and resolving issues like sleepapnea • Avoiding bad fats and eating good, healthy fats like olive oil, andomega-3s (through supplements or eating toxin-free fish) • Keeping your brain flexible and active by exercising it and learningnew skills. Did you know your brain actually can grow new neurons? It will ifyou do your part by feeding it new information and keeping it healthy. • Resolving issues like ADHD, depression, anxiety, and stress by gettingappropriate help. I typically like to start with natural methods before turningto drugs. • Surrounding yourself with a network of supportive people who willencourage your efforts and help you stay on your healthy programThese things won’t happen on their own, and no one will do them for you. Youmust be conscientious of your own health, biologically, psychologically,socially, and spiritually. Not only is this for your own good, but it is for thegood of everyone you influence too.There’s only one time when you can make the necessary changes to boost the powerof your brain and improve your health, and that time is right now. Putting itoff until tomorrow usually means putting it off indefinitely. How long have youbeen intending to start living differently? Hasn’t it been long enough?What keeps you from getting started? Is it concerns that you won’t succeed? Ornot wanting to make the effort? Or thinking it doesn’t matter?I hope that the information in this book has proven to you that you have amazingpowers to succeed built right into the very structure of your brain. Your femalebrain is equipped to understand what you need to do and make connections acrossyour entire brain to call on unexpected resources to help you succeed. You havethe ability to love and feel true compassion that can motivate you to achievegreat things. Any voice that tells you that you can’t do it is just an ANT. Getit out of your life.How could you not want to make the effort when you can see the problems thatarise from not making it? Obesity, toxic exposure, and untreated injuries canlead to decreased quality of life, Alzheimer’s disease, and early death. Thiscan’t be what you want for yourself and those you love. Make a list of yourgoals. Post the pictures of the people you love where you can see them everyday. Let the love you feel help you get over your initial resistance, and thepleasure of feeling better and better will begin to take over as a powerfulmotivating factor.It does matter. It matters not only for you but for everyone around you. Womenin particular have incredible powers to influence others for the good. Beencouraged by the stories of women everywhere who are beginning to step forwardin their societies and are transforming their worlds.

To start this beautiful process of transformation, I hope you will takeeverything that you’ve learned in this book to unleash the incredibly positiveand influential power of your female brain.GIVE BRAIN HEALTH AWAYCan one female brain change the world? Yes. I want you to meet my friendYuk-Lynn from Hong Kong. Yuk-Lynn read a copy of my book Change Your Brain,Change Your Life. At the time she was battling low energy, a difficult marriage,and a teenage son who was struggling emotionally and academically. Even thoughshe lived a Pacific Ocean away from one of our clinics, it did not deter her. Atfirst, she sent her husband and son for evaluations, which made a dramaticdifference in their lives. Her son, Jonathan, had a hard birth. His scan showedevidence of physical trauma. He told his mom the scan was so helpful. He couldsee why he was struggling so much. “It’s not me,” he said. “It was what happenedto me.” After the scan, he was compliant with the treatment plan and showedsignificant improvement. Yuk-Lynn’s husband, Roy, also helped, whichstrengthened their marriage. Then Yuk-Lynn came for help, as did her mother,sister, brother, father, and many other family members and friends. She alsointroduced brain health concepts to her family and friends and has had a hugeinfluence on her community. She and Roy brought together a team of physicians tobring brain SPECT imaging to Hong Kong, in the context of a brain-healthytreatment program. Yuk-Lynn took what she learned and applied it to the good ofmany other people.My prayer for you is to do the same. Take this information and pass it on. Theworld needs your healthy female brain more than ever before.HOUR 12 EXERCISE—CREATE YOUR OWN GENIUS NETWORKMy good friend Joe Polish is a master at relationship building. He has anexercise, “Create Your Own Genius Network,” which he generously allowed me toshare with you. It can help you thrive and keep you on track toward your goals,in a way similar to that of the small groups at Saddleback. Research hasdemonstrated that strong relationships are associated with health, happiness,and success. The health of your peer group is one of the strongest predictors ofyour health and longevity. This exercise will help you create and sustain yourown network.What are your health goals? (Be specific)Write down five names of people who can help you reach your goals and besupportive of your efforts to get and stay healthy:Write down exactly how these people can be helpful to you. What wisdom do theyhave (health advice, exercise buddy, support, etc.)?How can you be helpful to them? (Giving back is a key ingredient to making agenius network work.)Set aside time each week to connect with the five people in your genius network,whether in person, by phone, or by email or text. If you do this one exercise,you will start to build a great network to help you look better and live ahealthier, longer life. Even though this exercise is very simple, it is alsopowerful. Keep your genius network up-to-date and make sure to support others intheir efforts to use their brains to change their health and their lives. Youwill be supporting yourself in the process."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIXNATURAL SUPPLEMENTS TO HELP YOU UNLEASH THE POWER OF YOUR FEMALE BRAIN[images/Amen_9780307888969_epub_L02_r1.jpg]I’m a great believer in the value of natural supplements. I personally take ahandful of supplements every day, and I feel they add significantly to thequality of my life. I recommend them to my family, and I often plan a regimenfor my patients based on their individual needs. In my own experience, naturalsupplements have enhanced the health of my brain while boosting my energy andimproving my lab values.I recommend supplements to my female patients to help with the various issuesinvolved with mood disorders, hormonal imbalances, pregnancy, and thediscomforts of perimenopause and menopause. They’re also valuable in assuringthat developing fetuses receive the building blocks of a healthy body.Some physicians say that supplements are not necessary if you eat a balanceddiet. That would be true if the food we bought in the store had full nutrientvalue. But does it? As Dr. Mark Hyman wrote in The Ultra-Mind Solution: Fix YourBroken Brain by Healing Your Body First, if people “eat wild, fresh, organic,local, non-genetically modified food grown in virgin mineral- and nutrient-richsoils that has not been transported across vast distances and stored for monthsbefore being eaten … and work and live outside, breathe only fresh unpollutedair, drink only pure, clean water, sleep nine hours a night, move their bodiesevery day, and are free from chronic stressors and exposure to environmentaltoxins,” then it is possible that they might not need supplements.But who lives like that? When was the last time you ate an apple that wasfresh-picked from the tree? We live in a fast-paced society where we grab foodwherever we can get it quickly, skip meals and then fill up on sugar-ladentreats and heavily processed foods, and give little thought to eating foods thathave been chemically treated. Even if your produce came from an organic farm,it’s likely been left on the store shelf (or in your refrigerator) for so longit’s lost most of its nutritive value. That’s why it’s so important to fill inthe gaps with a multiple vitamin/mineral supplement.I like to recommend natural supplements because they can be highly effective,with dramatically fewer side effects than most prescription medications (andusually at significantly less cost). In addition, you don’t have to report theiruse to your insurance company. It’s unfortunate, but taking prescriptionmedications can affect your insurability. I know many instances in which peopletook certain medications and were then denied insurance or charged a higherrate. Wherever natural alternatives are available, their use should beconsidered.But even with my enthusiasm for natural supplements, I must point out that theycome with their own set of considerations. First, as great as supplements are,they can’t work on their own. They can make a significant difference—but onlywhen they are used as part of a complete program whose other elements include ahealthy diet, exercise, beneficial thoughts, a supportive peer group, and awholesome environment.Also, while they tend to be less expensive than prescription medications, theyusually are not covered by insurance, so they can mean more money out of yourpocket. And just because something is natural does not mean it is innocuous.Arsenic and cyanide are natural, but they aren’t good for you. And naturalsupplements can have side effects that shouldn’t be ignored. For example, St.John’s Wort can be a wonderful natural antidepressant, but it can cause sunsensitivity. It can also decrease the effectiveness of a number of medicationssuch as birth control pills. Oh, great! Get depressed, pick up some St. John’sWort from the grocery store, and now you are unexpectedly pregnant. That’s not agood solution to depression.Another major concern about natural supplements is that they often lack qualitycontrol. It’s very important to use quality brands that you trust. Arecommendation from a professional is helpful here, but many people get theirsupplement advice from the health food store clerk, who may be a summer hirewith little background in the field. However, there are supplements availablethat have been well researched and developed by individuals who are highlyknowledgeable and devoted to offering effective, safe products. A littleresearch on your part can help you identify excellent supplements.Now let’s look at how supplements can help with issues that are specific towomen.Help for PMS • Low progesterone is often one of the causes of PMS symptoms.Progesterone cream used during the last week of a woman’s cycle is oftenhelpful. • In addition, the following supplements can help balance the brain forsymptom relief: ° Calcium citrate (400–500 mg twice a day) ° Chelated magnesium (200–300 mg twice a day) ° Vitamin A (5,000 IUs) ° B complex (with 50 mg of B6) ° Evening primrose oil (500 mg twice a day) ° 5-HTP (50–100 mg twice a day), which may help to boost serotoninand decrease anxiety and worry ° Green tea or L-tyrosine for focus (500 mg two to three times a day) • Chasteberry can also help for PMS symptoms, especially breast pain ortenderness, swelling, constipation, irritability, depressed mood or moodalterations, anger, and headache in some women (20–40 mg a day).Boost Estrogen to Help Relieve Symptoms of Menopause • Diindolylmethane (DIM) is a phytochemical found in cruciferousvegetables like broccoli and cauliflower. It shifts estrogen metabolism to favorthe friendly or harmless estrogen metabolites. DIM can significantly increasethe urinary excretion of the “bad” estrogens in as little as four weeks (75–300mg per day). • Omega-3 fatty acids (fish oils) contain EPA, which has been reportedin laboratory studies to help control estrogen metabolism and decrease the riskof breast cancer. Eating organic beef from grass-fed animals also supplies thesefats (2,000 mg per day). • Calcium D-glucarate is a natural compound found in fruits andvegetables like apples, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, and cabbage. It inhibits theenzyme that contributes to breast, prostate, and colon cancers. It also reducesthe reabsorption of estrogen from the digestive tract (500–1500 mg per day). • Probiotics help maintain healthy intestinal flora and healthy estrogenlevels. Make sure you get human-strain probiotics that have live cultures (10–60billion units per day). • Plant phytoestrogens. The North American Menopause Societyspecifically recommends dietary isoflavones (found in soy and linseed products),black cohosh, and vitamin E for menopausal symptoms. These plant-based compoundshave healthy estrogen-like activity and have been found helpful for a variety ofconditions including menopausal symptoms. (They can also help with PMS and mayhelp prevent endometriosis.) ° Phytoestrogens are found in many foods. Good sources are nuts andoilseeds (like flaxseed oil), soy, kudzu, red clover, and pomegranate. ° Resveratrol is a bioflavonoid antioxidant that occurs naturally ingrapes and red wine and has been reported to inhibit breast cancer cell growthin laboratory studies. ° Black cohosh is an herb that’s been used for centuries by NativeAmericans for hormonal balance in women. Over the last thirty years, Europeanphysicians helping women through menopausal transition have used it extensively.In human studies, black cohosh has been found to decrease hot flashes associatedwith menopause. Unlike conventional estrogen effects on individuals predisposedto breast cancer, black cohosh has been shown in laboratory studies to inhibitcancer cells. While its long-term safety has not been determined, it seems finefor short-term use. Most studies used 20–80 mg doses twice daily, providing 4–8mg triterpene glycosides for up to 6 months. • Melatonin is a hormone produced in the pineal gland that, among otherfunctions, helps us sleep. Melatonin levels decline with age which may lead tothe sleep disturbances common during menopause. Melatonin has been shown inlaboratory studies to inhibit the growth of breast cancer cells. Melatonin actsas an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant in the brain and other tissues like theintestine. Studies show that low melatonin levels increase breast cancer risk inwomen. If you are having trouble sleeping, consider taking 3–6 mg melatoninbefore bed. It may boost your immune system and help you sleep. • SAMe has also been shown to support healthy joints and decrease pain.The typical dose is anywhere from 400 mg to 800 mg twice a day. It is usuallybetter to take earlier in the day, as it can be energizing. Research suggestsyou should be cautious with SAMe if you have bipolar disorder. • There is also interesting new work that shows that DHEA (discussedbelow) can significantly improve sexual function in menopausal women.Help for Stress • DHEA is a natural precursor hormone secreted by the adrenal glands,ovaries, and the brain. It produces estrogen and, to a lesser extent,testosterone. DHEA also protects brain cells from the beta-amyloid protein thatis associated with Alzheimer’s. During periods of chronic stress, the release ofthe stress hormone cortisol can decrease levels of DHEA, lowering immunity andpotentially accelerating the aging processes. Low levels of DHEA have also beenlinked to weight gain and depression. There is good evidence that validates DHEAsupplementation to help support adrenal gland function, mood, and your weight.Generally we start with 10 mg and go up from there. DHEA is usually welltolerated, but there can be some unpleasant side effects like acne and facialhair owing to the tendency of DHEA to increase testosterone levels. These can beavoided by using a specific metabolite of DHEA called 7-Keto-DHEA. It is moreexpensive than simple DHEA, but it may be preferable in some cases. (The dose of7-Keto-DHEA is typically 50–100 mg.) • L-theanine (200 mg two or three times a day) for simultaneousrelaxation and focus • Relora (750 mg two to three times a day) • Magnesium (natural relaxant) (200–300 mg twice a day, especiallybefore bedtime) • Holy basil (200–400 mg two to three times a day) • Ashwagandha (250 mg two to three times a day) • Rhodiola (200 mg two to three times a day)LOW TESTOSTERONE LEVELSThere are benefits, besides increased libido, related to testosteronereplacement for women, including retention of muscle mass, bone-densityretention, improved mood, and reduced cardiovascular risks. Levels oftestosterone should be checked in the blood to see if they are low before usingany type of bioidentical testosterone or even dietary supplements, such as DHEA.Before letting your doctor give you testosterone shots or pills, try to boost itnaturally by dramatically decreasing or even eliminating sugar, wheat, andprocessed foods from your diet. A sugar burst has been found to lowertestosterone levels by up to 25 percent.Another way to naturally boost your testosterone level is to start aweight-training program. Building muscle helps your body increase itstestosterone levels. The supplements DHEA and zinc can also help. Zinc isnecessary to maintain normal testosterone levels. Inadequate zinc levels preventthe pituitary gland from releasing hormones that stimulate testosteroneproduction. Zinc also inhibits the enzyme that converts testosterone intoestrogen. If these measures don’t work, you may need testosterone replacement.THYROIDIf you have thyroid issues, they can be effectively treated with a number ofthyroid medications. Your doctor needs to test your levels regularly to makesure you are not taking too much or too little. There are also a number ofnatural dietary supplements that support thyroid function, including rosemary,zinc, chromium, potassium, iodine, L-tyrosine, vitamins A, B2, B3, B6, C, D,selenium, seaweed, and ashwagandha. Also, make sure to have healthytestosterone, insulin, and melatonin levels.INSULIN • Chromium (200–400 µg) to help balance blood sugar • Cinnamon (1–6 g; a teaspoon is 4.75 g) to help balance blood sugarKEY VITAMINS, MINERALS, AND HERBS FOR OVERALL HORMONE BALANCEFor overall good health, I recommend the following supplements for just abouteverybody: • Multiple vitamin • Fish oil (2,000 mg a day) • Probiotics for gut health to bind bad estrogens (10 to 60 billionCFUs) • Calcium citrate (400–500 mg twice a day) • Chelated magnesium (200–300 mg twice a day) to keep your nerves calm • Vitamin D (2,000 IU of vitamin D daily generally, but it’s importantto get tested individually) to get the most benefit from calcium • Zinc (15 mg) for testosterone and thyroidAMEN SOLUTION SUPPLEMENTSAt Amen Clinics we make our own line of supplements, the Amen Solution, thathave taken over a decade to develop. The reason I developed this line was that Iwanted my patients and my own family to have access to the highest quality,research-based supplements available.Research shows the therapeutic benefit of using supplements to support a healthymood, sleep, and memory. I strongly recommend that when purchasing a supplement,you consult a health care practitioner familiar with nutritional supplements todetermine which supplements and dosages may be most effective for you. Ourwebsite (www.amenclinics.com [http://www.amenclinics.com]) contains links to thescientific literature on many different supplements, so you, as a consumer, canbe fully informed on the benefits and risks involved. Please remember thatsupplements can have very powerful effects on the body and caution should beused when combining them with prescription medications.There are three supplements I typically recommend to all of my patients becausethey are critical to optimal brain function: a multivitamin, fish oil, andvitamin D.MULTIVITAMINSAccording to recent studies, more than 50 percent of Americans do not eat atleast five servings of fruits and vegetables a day, the minimum required to getthe nutrition you need. In addition, people with weight-management issues oftenare not eating healthy diets and, as a result, have vitamin and nutrientdeficiencies. I recommend that all of my patients take a high-qualitymultivitamin/mineral complex every day. In an editorial in the Journal of theAmerican Medical Association, researchers recommended a daily vitamin foreverybody because it helps prevent chronic illness. And research suggests thatpeople who take a multiple vitamin actually have younger-looking DNA.NeuroVite Plus is the multivitamin we make at Amen Clinics. It contains acomplete range of brain-healthy nutrients. Four capsules a day is the full dose,which contains: • Vitamin A and high levels of Bs, plus vitamins C, D (2,000 IU), E andK2 • Minerals—zinc, copper, magnesium, selenium, chromium, manganese,calcium, and magnesium • Brain nutrients—ALA, acetyl-L-carnitine, and phosphatidylserine • Equivalent nutrients to: ° 1 apple (quercitin) ° 1 tomato (lycopene) ° 1 serving fresh spinach (lutein) ° 1 serving broccoli (broccoli seed concentrate) ° 2 L red wine (resveratrol, without the alcohol) ° 1 cup blueberries (pterostilbene) • A full dose of a stabilized probioticFISH OILFor years, I have been writing about the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids, whichare found in fish oil supplements. I personally take a fish oil supplement everyday and recommend that all of my patients do the same. Research has found thatomega-3 fatty acids are essential for optimal brain and body health.For example, according to researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health,having low levels of omega-3 fatty acids is one of the leading preventablecauses of death and has been associated with heart disease, strokes, depression,suicidal behavior, ADD, dementia, and obesity. There is also scientific evidencethat low levels of omega-3 fatty acids play a role in weight control.Research in the last few years has revealed that diets rich in omega-3 fattyacids help promote a healthy emotional balance and positive mood in later years,possibly because DHA is a main component of the brain’s synapses. A growing bodyof scientific evidence indicates that fish oil helps ease symptoms ofdepression. One twenty-year study involving 3,317 men and women found thatpeople with the highest consumption of EPA and DHA were less likely to havesymptoms of depression. Omega-3 fatty acids have also been shown to benefitcognitive performance at every age.My recommendation for most adults is between 1 and 2 g high-quality fish oil aday balanced between EPA and DHA.Omega-3 Power is our brand to support healthy brain and heart function byproviding highly purified omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) from the mostadvanced production, detoxification, and purification process in the industry.It is produced under the natural product industry’s most rigorous standards.Each batch of our oil is independently analyzed by the third-party lab Eurofinsfor more than 250 environmental contaminants, including PCBs. Our oil iscertified to be over twenty times lower than California’s Proposition 65requirement of less than 90 nanograms per day. Our brand also exceeds all otherdomestic and international regulatory standards. Two softgels contain 2.8 gramsof fish oil, and 860mg of EPA and 580mg of DHA.VITAMIN DVitamin D, also known as the sunshine vitamin, is best known for building bonesand boosting the immune system. But it is also an essential vitamin for brainhealth, mood, memory, and your weight. While classified as a vitamin, it is asteroid hormone vital to health. Low levels of vitamin D have been associatedwith depression, autism, psychosis, Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis,heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and obesity. Unfortunately, vitamin Ddeficiencies are becoming more and more common, in part because we are spendingmore time indoors and using more sunscreen.Vitamin D is so important to brain function that its receptors can be foundthroughout the brain. Vitamin D plays a critical role in many of the most basiccognitive functions, including learning and making memories. These are just someof the areas where vitamin D affects how well your brain works, according to a2008 review that appeared in the FASEB Journal.The lower your vitamin D levels, the more likely you are to feel blue ratherthan happy. Low levels of vitamin D have long been associated with a higherincidence of depression. In recent years, we’ve seen evidence that vitamin Dsupplementation can improve moods.The current recommended dose for vitamin D is 400 IU daily, but most expertsagree that this is well below the physiological needs of most individuals andinstead suggest 2,000 IU of vitamin D daily. I think it is very important totest your individual needs, especially if you are overweight or obese since yourbody may not absorb the vitamin D as efficiently if you are heavier. Our vitaminD3, comes as 1,000 IU tablets, 2,000 IU tablets, or as 10,000 IU liquid.BRAIN AND MEMORY POWER BOOSTThis is the supplement formulated to help in our brain enhancement work withactive and retired NFL players. When used in conjunction with a brain-healthyprogram, we saw evidence of significant improvement in memory, reasoning,attention, processing speed, and accuracy. It was so effective that I take itevery day.Brain and Memory Power Boost includes the super-antioxidant N-acetylcysteine(NAC), along with phosphatidylserine to maintain the integrity of cellmembranes, huperzine A and acetyl-L-carnitine to enhance acetylcholineavailability, and vinpocetine and ginkgo biloba to enhance blood flow. This is anovel combination of powerful antioxidants and nutrients essential in enhancingand protecting brain health. It supports overall brain health, circulation,memory, and concentration.CRAVING CONTROLThe key to successful weight management is eating a brain-healthy diet andmanaging your cravings. In support of this goal, Craving Control was developed,a powerful new nutritional supplement formulated to support healthy blood sugarand insulin levels while providing antioxidants and nutrients to the body. Ourformulation includes NAC and glutamine to reduce cravings, chromium and ALA tosupport stable blood sugar levels, and a brain-healthy chocolate andDL-phenylalanine designed to boost endorphins.This is the formula we use at Amen Clinics in our own weight-loss groups. In onegroup, participants who used the craving formula lost an average of 10 pounds inten weeks.RESTFUL SLEEPSleep is essential to healthy brain function. Restful Sleep is formulated with acombination of nutrients designed to support a calm mind and promote a deep,relaxed, restful night’s sleep. This supplement contains both immediate andtime-released melatonin to keep you asleep throughout the entire night, plus thecalming neurotransmitter GABA, a combination of the essential elements zinc andmagnesium, and the herb valerian, which together may produce an overall sedativeeffect to help support sleep. At Amen Clinics we refer to Restful Sleep as “thehammer” because so many people have told us it has helped them.SAME MOOD AND MOVEMENT SUPPORTThere is scientific research suggesting that SAMe helps support mood, movement,and pain control. It is intimately involved in the creation of the keyneurotransmitters, serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine that support healthymood. As an added advantage, SAMe has also been shown to support healthy jointsand decrease pain. The typical dose is 400–800 mg twice a day. It is usuallybetter to take earlier in the day, as it can be energizing. Research suggestsyou should be cautious with SAMe if you have bipolar disorder.SEROTONIN MOOD SUPPORTSerotonin Mood Support promotes normal serotonin levels by providing 5-HTP, adirect precursor of serotonin, along with a proprietary extract of saffron,shown clinically to support a normal mood. Vitamin B6 and inositol are includedto provide additional synergistic support. Serotonin Mood Support is useful tosupport a healthy mood when serotonin levels are suspected to be low. It seemsto be especially helpful for people who tend to get stuck on negative thoughtsor negative behaviors. It has also been shown to help support healthy sleeppatterns.FOCUS AND ENERGY OPTIMIZERFormulated without caffeine that makes people jittery, Focus and EnergyOptimizer supports both focus and healthy energy levels. It is formulated withgreen tea and choline to help with focus, along with three powerful adaptogens,which act synergistically to enhance endurance and stamina. The adaptogensashwaganda, rhodiola, and panax ginseng have been scientifically shown toimprove the body’s resistance to stress and support a healthy immune system.EVERYDAY STRESS RELIEFEveryday Stress Relief promotes natural relaxation and calm by providing aunique blend of natural ingredients at clinically tested levels to help reducestress, restore calm, and support the body’s natural response to the rigors ofeveryday life. It contains magnesium taurate, Relora, L-theanine, and theadaptogen holy basil."},{"pageContent":"NOTE ON REFERENCESThe information in Unleash the Power of the Female Brain is based on more than250 references and sources, including scientific studies, books, interviews withmedical experts, statistics from government agencies and health organizations,and other reliable resources.
