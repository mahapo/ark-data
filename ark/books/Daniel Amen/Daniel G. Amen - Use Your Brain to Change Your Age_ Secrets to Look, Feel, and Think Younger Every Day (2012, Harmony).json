In the seat next to me was an elderly woman, Mary, whorecognized me from my public television shows. As I was opening my computer tostart obsessing over the debate, Mary leaned toward me and asked, “Is it evertoo late?”“Too late for what?” I said, trying to get my mind focused on the task tomorrow.“I am seventy-six years old,” she whispered. “Is it ever too late for me to havea better brain?”“Only if you just plan on living until you are seventy-seven,” I said with asmile, now looking into her pretty green eyes. “If you want to live until you’reninety, now would be a good time to start!”She chuckled. I relaxed. People like Mary have always fueled the passion I havefor my work.“The fountain of youth is between your ears,” I continued. “It is your brainthat makes the decisions that keep you healthy, happy, and on track to live along time, and it is your brain that makes the bad decisions that ruin yourhealth and send you off to the undertaker early. If you want to live a long,happy life, the first place to start is by having a better brain.”Mary told me she loved my television shows because they were so practical andshe had already made many changes in her life. She also told me about her sonwho was a problem drinker but who stopped imbibing after watching my programs.He saw he wanted no part of the damage he saw on the SPECT scans that alcoholcan do to the brain.At the Amen Clinics we use a sophisticated brain imaging study called SPECT tohelp us understand and treat our patients. SPECT stands for single photonemission computed tomography, a nuclear medicine study that looks at blood flowand activity patterns. It looks at how the brain works. It is different fromcomputerized axial tomography (CAT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans,which are anatomical scans that show what the brain physically looks like. SPECTshows how the brain functions. Over the last twenty-one years, Amen Clinics hasbuilt the world’s largest database of brain SPECT, now totaling over seventythousand scans on patients from ninety different countries.SPECT basically shows three things:1. Areas of the brain that work well2. Areas of the brain that are low in activity3. Areas of the brain that are high in activityA healthy scan shows full, even, symmetrical activity in the brain.From looking at all of these SPECT scans it is very clear to me that you caneither accelerate the aging process and make your brain look and feel older thanyour chronological age, or you can decelerate it and have a brain that looks andfeels much younger than your age.Even though getting older is not optional,having a brain that looks and feels old is!Here are three SPECT scans of sixty-year-old brains. One is healthy, one hasAlzheimer’s disease, and one is from a person who is overweight and has sleepapnea.Normal Brain[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_001_r1.jpg]Full, even, symmetrical activityAlzheimer’s Disease[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_002_r1.jpg]Back half of the brain dyingOverweight and Sleep Apnea[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_003_r1.jpg]Multiple areas of decreased activityBrain SPECT is a nuclear medicine study that evaluates blood flow and activitypatterns. The image on the top left of each scan is looking underneath thebrain. The image on the bottom right is looking down from the top. The top rightand bottom left images are looking from the sides of the brain. The holes inscans are not physical holes; they indicate areas of significant low blood flowand activity patterns.Of these three brains, which do you want? Who will live the longest and have theyoungest and most effective brain? The choice should be obvious.It is very clear from our imaging work that as we age brain activity decreasesacross the whole surface of the brain. If we are not thoughtful in how we live,the myriad bad decisions a person makes over a lifetime influence aging in anegative way. Lousy diets, chronic stress, health problems, a lack of sleep, toomuch alcohol, illegal drugs, high-risk behavior, being around environmentaltoxins, and many other factors contribute to our brain’s early demise.Unfortunately, most people just accept a decline in cognitive functioning asnormal aging.I recently recorded an interview with a high-level business executive, Todd. Hetold me his memory was terrible at age fifty-three. “I am sure it is just myage. I am just getting older,” he said. “I often have no idea where I put mykeys and sometimes find them in the refrigerator, next to the eggs.”“It is definitely not normal,” I replied. “I am fifty-seven and my memory is asgood as it has ever been. It is one of the little lies people tell themselves tojustify their memory problems and bad habits. The denial prevents them fromgetting the help they need. Tell me about your diet and exercise.”When Todd heard me mention exercise, he perked up. “I exercise five times aweek. I run long distances and am in great shape.”Something wasn’t making sense to me. “And your diet,” I persisted.He looked down. “It’s not so great. Every morning I have a Diet Coke andPop-Tarts in the car on the way to work. The rest of the day doesn’t get muchbetter.”Putting toxic fuel in a car will definitely decrease its performance. Puttingtoxic fuel in your body will definitely hurt your brain, no matter how muchexercise you do.“If you had a million-dollar racehorse,” I asked, “would you ever give it junkfood?”“Of course not,” he said.“You are so much more valuable than a racehorse. It is time to treat yourselfwith a little love and respect,” I encouraged.Three months later, Todd told me his memory had significantly improved. He alsosaid I haunt him at every meal. I am hoping to do the same for you.Bill, age eighty-five, had a typical brain scan for someone his age. He was aretired business executive and complained of being tired. He struggled with hismemory and was on four medications for hypertension, cholesterol issues, andchest pain. “I hate getting older,” he said. (The language we use around gettingolder, as we will see, is very important.) His brain SPECT, not surprisingly,depicted an old brain, with overall low activity.Bill’s Scan, Typical for an 85-Year-Old[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_004_r1.jpg]Multiple areas of decreased activityThrough our brain imaging work, we have also discovered a group of older men andwomen who have stunningly beautiful-looking and functioning brains, and they allhave lives that reflect their healthy brain function. Their lives are much morevibrant, energetic, and thoughtful than those with poorer-functioning brains. Inaddition, they all maintain many of the brain healthy habits that you will learnabout in this book. Interestingly, you never hear them saying they hate gettingolder. They appreciate their experiences and relationships, and they lookforward, not backward.Dr. Doris Rapp is a great example. She is an eighty-two-year-old pioneeringphysician who has dedicated her life to helping others. She has been called the“Mother of Environmental Medicine and Allergies.” She maintains a healthyweight, exercises vigorously, eats a nutritious diet, and has spent her lifepursuing learning opportunities. She has a sharp mind and many friends, and shestill consults with patients and professionals. I often call her when I amstumped with a patient, especially if I suspect a problem with environmentaltoxins or food allergies. Both her SPECT scan and her life reflect herhealthy-looking brain. If you make brain smart decisions, you can definitelyslow and, as we will see, in many cases reverse the aging process.Doris, 82[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_005_r1.jpg]A stunningly beautiful SPECT studyIn this book I am going to show you how to have a younger-looking brain andbody. It is based on the lessons that we have learned at the Amen Clinics. Ifyou follow the steps in the program you will dramatically increase your chancesof living longer; looking younger; decreasing your risk of dementia; andboosting your memory, mood, attention, and energy. I know this is a big promise,but I have seen that when people engage in this process, everything in theirlife changes in a positive way. You just have to spend some time to “dial in”the program and make it part of your everyday life, but once you do, thebenefits will be lifelong.CARLOSWhen we first saw Carlos, he was forty-eight years old and filled with worries,negative thinking, depression, and anger, and he had trouble focusing. He hadundiagnosed dyslexia as a child and struggled with heavy drinking in the past.His health habits were terrible, he weighed 266 pounds, and his brain was introuble, all of which were not helping his emotional issues. Below is Carlos’sinitial brain SPECT scan.Carlos completely bought into the program we laid out for him. He is ananalytical man, so the logic of the program made sense to him. It is the sameprogram I am going to give you in this book. After ten weeks he lost 24 pounds,and after thirty weeks he was down 50 pounds. More important, his mood, energy,and memory were better as well. And he looked and felt ten years younger.By learning and doing the techniques in the program, he no longer overate tomedicate his sadness and irritability. And by eating brain healthy foods atfrequent enough intervals, he no longer had the energy crashes that made him sovulnerable to stress.He looks like a different person on the outside, but we saw the same dramaticdifferences on the inside as well. His follow-up SPECT scan showed overallincreased activity. By following this program, he changed his brain and in theprocess changed his life!Normal Brain SPECT Scan[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_006_r1.jpg]Full, even, symmetrical activityCarlos’s Brain SPECT Scan[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_007_r1.jpg]Overall decreased activity[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_008_r1.jpg]266 pounds[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_009_r1.jpg]243 pounds[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_010_r1.jpg]216 poundsThis is the part I love most about Carlos’s story. After seeing her husband’ssuccess, his wife, who was not overweight, started our program to learn how tocreate a brain healthy family and ended up losing 10 pounds herself. Then hisfourteen-year-old daughter embarked on our program. Carlos’s success influencedeveryone he loved. As I was writing this book I saw Carlos in our waiting room.Two years after I first met him he still looked fabulous. I asked him how hekept it going.“It’s not hard,” he said. “I have the program dialed in.”You can do this too. None of what I will ask you to do is hard. It just takesconsistent effort.Carlos’s Initial Brain SPECT Scan[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_011_r1.jpg]Overall decreased activityCarlos’s Follow-up Brain SPECT Scan[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_012_r1.jpg]Overall improved activityThe brain imaging work that we do at the Amen Clinics has guided our practicefor more than two decades. Over the years I have crystallized our work intoseven very simple principles. These principles guide all of the work we do, andthey provide the foundation for this program.SEVEN PRINCIPLES FOR CHANGING YOUR BRAIN AND IMPROVING EVERYTHING IN YOUR LIFE1. Your brain is involved in everything you do, including how you think, how youfeel, how you act, and how you get along with other people. Your brain is theorgan of personality, character, intelligence, and every decision you make. And,as we will see, it is the quality of your decisions that help you live a longtime or kill you early.• It’s your brain that tells you to stop eating when you’ve had enough …or letsyou dive into that second bowl of ice cream so that you end up feeling bloated,groggy, and depressed.• It’s your brain that reminds you to drive carefully …or urges you to race downthe highway at speeds that can cause tickets, crashes, or fatalities.• It’s your brain that keeps you focused, motivated, and successful …or holdsyou back with attention or anxiety issues.• It’s your brain that keeps you calm, happy, and loving …or disrupts your moodsand creates conflicts in your relationship.• It’s your brain that works as the “control center” for your entire physicalsystem.• And it’s your brain that deserves credit, attention, and care for everythingit does to run your body, your mind, and your life!2. When your brain works right, you work right; when your brain is troubled, youare much more likely to have trouble in your life.With a healthy brain you are• Happier• Healthier• Wealthier• Wiser• More effective• Able to make better decisions, which helps you live longerWhen the brain is not healthy, for whatever reason, you are• Sadder• Sicker• Poorer• Less wise• Less effective• More likely to make bad decisions3. The brain is the most complicated organ in the universe and thus the mostvulnerable to damage and aging. There is nothing as complicated as the humanbrain. Nothing. It is estimated that the brain has a hundred billion cells. Eachbrain cell is connected to other brain cells by thousands of individualconnections between cells, which means that you have more connections in yourbrain than there are stars in the universe! A piece of brain tissue the size ofa grain of sand contains a hundred thousand neurons and a billion connectionsall communicating with one another. The brain is 80 percent water. Hydration is critical to the brain’s health.The solid weight of the brain is 60 percent fat, so any abnormalities in thebody’s fat content can wreak havoc on the brain. Even though your brain consistsof only 2 percent of the body’s weight, it uses 20–30 percent of the caloriesyou consume. Of the breakfast you had this morning or the dinner you hadtonight, approximately a quarter of it went to feed your brain. Your brain alsoconsumes 20 percent of the oxygen and blood flow in the body and it never rests(even during deep sleep). Because of its high metabolic rate, it produces a highlevel of free radicals, which can damage the brain, if the antioxidant capacityof the brain is low. Your brain is the most energy hungry and expensive realestate in your body. And, for good reason, it is the command and control centerthat runs your life.4. Your brain is very soft, about the consistency of soft butter, tofu, orcustard, and it is housed in a hard skull, which has multiple sharp, bonyridges. Brain injuries matter. They can ruin people’s whole lives. Very fewpeople understand just how much brain injuries matter, because brain imaging isonly just now starting to gain wider usage. In a 2008 front-page article in theWall Street Journal, writer Thomas Burton quoted researchers who found thatundiagnosed brain injuries are a major cause of the following:• Homelessness• Psychiatric illness• Depression and anxiety attacks• Alcoholism and drug abuse• Suicide• Learning problemsIf you want to stay healthy, protecting your brain should be one of the firstthings you do.5. Our brain imaging work has clearly shown that there are many things you do toaccelerate the aging process, making your brain look and feel older. And thereare many things you can do to decelerate the aging process, helping you and yourbrain look and feel younger. This one fact, based on tens of thousands of scanswe have seen at the Amen Clinics, is the major reason I am writing this book.People need to know that every day through their behavior they are eitherhelping or hurting the health of their brain.Most people have a lot more say in their long-term health than they givethemselves credit for. Certainly, having the right combination of genes can behelpful, but most genes get turned on or turned off based on your behavior.According to recent research, only about 30 percent of longevity is determinedby your genetics. The other 70 percent is up to you. Your habits determine howold your brain is and, subsequently, how long you will live and how well youwill live.The bottom line of brain health can be summed up in four words:AVOID BAD • DO GOODOf course, the details underlying these four words require a little more detail.Here is a list of problems and behaviors that accelerate the brain’s agingprocess and can take years off your life. If you want to live a long time withyour brain intact, avoid these as much as possible:• Inconsistent, thoughtless behavior and decisions that negatively affect yourhealth• Unhealthy friends or a lack of a positive support system. The people you spendtime with matter. People are contagious, and if you spend time with unhealthypeople, you are much more likely to pick up their brain-damaging ways. Thisdoesn’t mean you get rid of all your friends and family if they have unhealthyhabits, but limit the amount of time you spend with them and get a new,healthier group if you want to live long.• Brain injuries• Toxins◦ Drugs, illegal and many legal drugs, such as benzodiazepines and pain killers◦ Alcohol, more than a few glasses a week◦ Smoking◦ Excessive caffeine, more than 300 mg (milligrams) a day (three normal-sizecups of coffee)◦ Environmental toxins, such as pesticides, organic solvents, phthalates, andmold◦ Cancer chemotherapy or chemo brains. As chemotherapy kills cancer cells, itcan also be toxic to normal cells as well. If you have had or need to havechemotherapy (please discuss this with your health-care provider), make sure toembrace a brain healthy life.• Inflammation. Inflammation that becomes chronic is now considered to be amajor cause of many diseases of aging, including cancer, diabetes, heartdisease, and Alzheimer’s. Inflammation is promoted by free radicals formation,low levels of vitamin D or omega-3s, high levels of omega-6s, high-meat and/orhigh-sugar diets, diabetes, long-term infections, gum disease, and stress.• Exposure to free radicals, or molecules that can cause damage in the body. Notunlike the way rust attacks a car, free radicals attack our cells, damage ourDNA, and accelerate aging. Things to avoid: cigarettes, trans fats, excessivesun exposure, charred meats, pesticides, excessive exercise, overactive thyroidgland, and inflammation. Although fruits and vegetables are great sources ofantioxidants, which fight free radicals, avoid buying the “dirty dozen” (producewith the highest chemical residue: peaches, apples, blueberries, bell peppers,celery, nectarines, strawberries, cherries, imported grapes, spinach, kale, andpotatoes), and buy their organic counterparts instead.• Damaged DNA and telomeres. At the end of each long strand of DNA is a capcalled a telomere, which is much like the plastic seal on the end of a shoelace.The DNA cap’s purpose is to keep DNA from unraveling. Each time a cell divides,a little piece of the telomere is eroded. After about sixty divisions, it iscompletely gone, allowing the DNA to unravel. Inflammation, free radicals,vitamin deficiencies, and a lack of omega-3 fatty acids can all chip away at thetelomere, shortening the cell’s life span. Geneticist Richard Cawthon andcolleagues at the University of Utah found that shorter telomeres are associatedwith shorter lives. Among people older than sixty, those with shorter telomereswere three times more likely to die from heart disease and eight times morelikely to die from infectious disease.• Medical problems◦ Gum disease◦ Heart disease◦ Diabetes◦ Hypertension◦ Gum disease◦ Intestinal or stomach problems◦ High or low testosterone hormone levels◦ High or low thyroid hormone levels◦ Low omega-3 levels◦ Low vitamin D levels◦ High iron levels, which increase oxidative stress◦ Allergies◦ Chronic insomnia or sleep apnea• Unhealthy weight gain or obesity. As your weight goes up, the size of thebrain goes down. (That should scare the fat off anyone!)• Standard American diet◦ Sugar. When too much sugar mixes with proteins and fats, it forms moleculescalled advanced glycation end products, which promote aging. The American HeartAssociation now recommends that women consume no more than 100 calories per dayof added sugars and that men consume no more than 150 calories per day.◦ Trans fats◦ Excessive calories• Lack of exercise, endurance, and strength• Lack of new learning• Mental health issues and/or chronic stress◦ Depression◦ Negative thinking patterns◦ Excessively high or excessively low levels of anxiety◦ Excitement seeking or impulsive behavior◦ Negative messaging around aging• Lack of brain rehabilitation strategies when needed• Lack of proper supplementation or the indiscriminate use of supplements• Lack of meaning and purpose in your life• Lack of knowledge on how your brain is functioningBUT HOW CAN I HAVE ANY FUN?We have a high school course called Making a Good Brain Great that is inforty-two states and seven countries, which teaches young teenagers how to takecare of their brains. After we teach the part of the course on things to avoidin order to get and keep a great brain, invariably an “attitudinal” teenage boywill blurt out in class, “So, how can I have any fun?” We then do an exercisewith the class called “Who has more fun, the person with the good brain or theperson with the bad brain?”Who gets the date with the pretty girl and gets to keep her because he doesn’tact like an idiot? The guy with the good brain or the guy with the bad brain?The guy with the good brain!Who has more freedom because he has more consistent behavior and his parentstrust him more? The teen with the good brain or the teen with the bad brain? Theteen with the good brain!Who gets into the college he wants to get into because he has good grades andconsistent behavior? The person with the good brain or the person with the badbrain? The person with the good brain!Who gets the job, has more money, has more lasting meaningful relationships, andlives longer because of the better decisions that are made throughout theirlives? The person with the good brain or the person with the bad brain? Theperson with the good brain!This exercise sort of takes the wind out of the sails of the teenager who wantsto justify brain-hurtful behavior.Here is a list of strategies and behaviors that decelerate brain aging. If youwant to live a long time with your brain intact, engage in these behaviors:• Make good decisions. Consistent, thoughtful, conscientious behavior is thenumber-one predictor of longevity!• Surround yourself with a positive, healthy support system made up of friendsand family.• Protect your brain from injuries.• Keep your surroundings free of toxins.◦ Limit alcohol consumption to no more than four glasses a week.◦ Protect yourself from excessive free radical formation.• Seek healthy DNA repair mechanisms and ways to grow telomere length. Fish oil,taking a multiple vitamin, and drinking green tea have been associated withlonger telomere length.• Maintain physical health.◦ Strive for low levels of inflammation.◦ Avoid gum disease and intestinal problems.◦ Maintain healthy levels of thyroid, testosterone, and other essentialhormones.◦ Maintain healthy levels of nutrients, such as vitamin D and omega-3s.◦ Get physical exercise, and include endurance and strength training.◦ Get quality sleep, seven to eight hours each night.◦ Maintain a healthy weight and expend calories wisely.• Focus on great nutrition that serves your brain and body.◦ Eat high-quality calories and not too many of them.◦ Drink plenty of water and avoid liquid calories.◦ Eat high-quality lean protein.◦ Eat “smart” (low-glycemic, high-fiber) carbohydrates.◦ Limit fat consumption to healthy fats, especially those containing omega-3s.◦ Eat natural foods of many different colors to boost anti-oxidants.◦ Cook with brain healthy herbs and spices.◦ Avoid sugar.• Engage in physical exercise, building endurance and strength.• Continue lifelong learning.• Practice effective stress management practices, such as deep breathing andmeditation.• Promote good mental health and avoid severe anxiety or de-ression.◦ Maintain a healthy level of anxiety to keep your behavior on track.◦ Maintain an optimistic mood.◦ Promote positive messages around aging.• Pursue brain rehabilitation strategies when needed, such as neurofeedback andhyperbaric oxygen therapy.• Get proper nutritional supplementation.◦ Take a multivitamin.◦ Take an omega-3 supplement.◦ Take a vitamin D supplement.◦ Consider taking individualized supplements to fit your brain type.• Protect and repair your DNA—controlling oxidation and inflammation andavoiding toxins are all part of protecting your DNA, plus nutrients like greentea, omega 3s, multiple vitamins, and superfoods such as grains like chia andquinoa; seaweeds and algae; and many spices may help.• Develop meaning and purpose in your life.• Know the state of the health of your brain.6. How do you know unless you look? Brain SPECT imaging is an essential tool atthe Amen Clinics to help us understand the current state of our patients’ brainfunction and to help us target the most appropriate interventions.From the time I ordered my first brain SPECT scan in 1991, I knew it was apowerful tool, because when people saw the scans it changed their behavior.A sign of intelligent life is changing your behavior after receiving newinformation.The SPECT scans are extraordinarily useful in giving us more information to helpour patients who suffer with dementia, memory problems, brain injuries,depression, obsessiveness, substance abuse, attention deficit hyperactivitydisorder (ADHD), anger issues, and more. When used in combination with detailedclinical histories, the scans help us target treatment to our patients’ ownspecific brain patterns. Additionally, the scans help us use and develop morenatural treatments to optimize the brain, in part because some of the typicalpharmaceutical interventions appeared toxic on scans. One of the most importantuses of the scans is that they help patients develop their own intimaterelationship with their brains and be more willing to take better care of them.Not all of my colleagues have embraced the clinical use of brain SPECT imagingin clinical practice, but more and more are doing so every day. Routinely, weget inquiries from physicians around the world who want to incorporate brainSPECT and these concepts into their practices. Without brain imaging tools toguide us, physicians wander around in the dark wondering what to really do tohelp their patients and themselves live long and stay young. In chapter 10[Amen_9780307888563_epub_c10_r1.htm] there will be more information on how brainSPECT imaging can be useful to you, even if you never get a scan.7. You are not stuck with the brain you have. You can make it better, even ifyou have been bad to it. You can change your brain and change your life. This isone of the most exciting breakthroughs in medicine. This hopeful message hasdriven our work since 1991. At the Amen Clinics we have done thousands ofbefore-and-after scans, like with Carlos, and have demonstrated that withtargeted, “brain smart” interventions you can boost the actual physicalfunctioning of your brain and decrease its functional age, even if you havepreviously been bad to your brain!Intuitively, most people know that bad behaviors make us age more quickly. Wesee it in the skin of smokers or in the gaunt appearance of a methamphetamineaddict or in the decreased cognitive functioning of people suffering fromalcoholism. Unfortunately, in my experience, most people do not have a clueabout how their physical health affects their cognitive and mental health.For example, I did a fascinating project with a group of businesswomen. Whenyour brain works right, your business works right! One of our CEOs, Tina, wasstruggling with depression, obesity, and uncontrolled diabetes. Her brain SPECTscan looked awful.Tina told me that she had been diagnosed with diabetes several years earlier buthad not found the time to really get healthy. She thought she would eventuallyget around to it. I thought to myself, “This is really nuts.” (My prefrontalcortex, or PFC, in the front third of my brain, prevented me from saying it outloud.) Tina, like most people, had no idea that diabetes causes brain damage. Itdamages blood vessels, including those to the brain, and doubles the risk forAlzheimer’s disease. Obesity, all by itself, is also a risk for thirty medicalillnesses, including Alzheimer’s disease; and, as we will see, it damages thebrain. Depression can be caused by uncontrolled diabetes and obesity and is, byitself, another independent risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease.I looked at Tina and said, “Nothing in your life will work right, especially notyour business, if your brain isn’t right. Your physical health problems are a‘brain emergency.’ It is critical to get your weight and diabetes under control,and when you do this, your mood will be better as well.”Normal Brain SPECT Scan[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_013_r1.jpg]Full, even, symmetrical activityTina’s Brain SPECT Scan[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_014_r1.jpg]Overall decreased activityTina’s Follow-up SPECT Scan[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_015_r1.jpg]Overall increased activitySince we started working together, Tina has lost 40 pounds, her diabetes isunder control, her mood is better, and she looks and feels much younger.Moreover, her business has dramatically improved because she has better focus,energy, and judgment.NONE OF THIS IS HARD OR ABOUT DEPRIVATION! IT IS ABOUT SMART CHOICES AND GOODDECISIONSYou will find that none of the strategies in this book are hard to do or requiredeprivation. The program is about making smart choices and good decisions.Mind-set here is critical. If you think something is being taken from you, youwill resist. If you think you are being given the gift of extended, prosperouslife for your mind and body, it will be easy to stay on this program. In fact,with the proper attitude, you will start to vigilantly protect your health fromall those people in your life who are actively trying to steal it.At this stage of my life, I am only interested in habits and food that serve merather than those that enslave and steal from me. For example, I used to loveRocky Road ice cream until I learned that not only is it filled with sugar andcalories, which promote obesity, inflammation, and erratic brain cell firing, italso has a type of fat, palmitic acid, that fools the brain into thinking it hasnot eaten anything at all. No wonder that halfway through the first bowl of icecream, I was thinking about the second bowl. This does not happen with nonfatyogurt and blueberries, which I also love.Success on this program will require you to use the PFC to plan and think ahead.Strengthening this part of the brain will dramatically improve your focus,forethought, judgment, and impulse control. Throughout the book I will give youhundreds of ways to enhance your PFC and improve every decision you make in yourlife to keep you on track toward your goals. Success will also require apowerful emotional or limbic brain to keep you motivated to move in thedirection of health.WHY YOU WANT TO COMPLETELY EMBRACE THIS PROGRAM NOWBy adopting the brain healthy strategies detailed in this book, you can outsmartyour genes, put the brakes on aging, and even reverse the aging process so thatyou look and feel younger in a very short period of time. Researchers indicatethat within just three months of adding a new healthy habit, you can startseeing a measurable difference in your life expectancy. By following the planoutlined in this book, your brain can start looking younger in a matter of justeight weeks.In my lectures I often ask the audience, “How many of you want to live untileighty-five or beyond?” Most of the audience raises their hands. “Did you know,”I continue, “that 50 percent of people eighty-five or older will be diagnosed orhave significant symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia?”That one statistic gets their attention and it should get yours as well.How is Alzheimer’s disease different from dementia? Dementia is the big umbrellacategory. Alzheimer’s is one of the common types of dementia. Other types ofdementia include alcoholic dementia, brain trauma dementia, vascular dementia(often associated with small or large strokes), pseudodementia (depression thatmimics dementia), and frontal temporal lobe dementia, to name a few.With the aging population, Alzheimer’s disease is expected to triple from fivemillion to fifteen million Americans in the coming decades, and there is no curefor it on the horizon. If that is not enough motivation for you to get healthy,then you might want to volunteer at an elderly care center for two weeks andmeet a few people with Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia. It is afrightening illness that robs you of your ability to form new memories. Later inthe illness, you lose old memories too. And it puts a tremendous burden onfamilies.One of the reasons there is not likely to be a cure for Alzheimer’s disease andother forms of dementia is that they start thirty years or more before peoplehave any symptoms. According to one study at UCLA, 95 percent of people withAlzheimer’s disease were diagnosed when they were in the moderate to severestages of the illness, when not much can be done. Early screening andintervention is absolutely essential.The National Institute of Aging recently revised its staging guidelines forAlzheimer’s disease. The old guidelines had three stages:1. Normal, in which people had no symptoms2. Mild cognitive impairment, in which people or relatives started to notice aproblem3. Alzheimer’s disease, in which a significant problem was presentBased on new brain imaging data, the National Institutes of Aging added a newstage:1. Normal2. Preclinical stage, in which there were no obvious outward symptoms but wherenegative changes were already brewing in the brain3. Mild cognitive impairment4. Alzheimer’s diseaseCan you see the problem here? You have no symptoms at all, but your brain isalready starting to dramatically deteriorate, up to thirty to fifty years beforeyou have symptoms! The time to start preventing Alzheimer’s and other diseasesof aging is now, not tomorrow, no matter what your age. The person who isdiagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease at age fifty-nine likely started to shownoxious brain changes by age thirty. The person who is diagnosed withAlzheimer’s disease in his early seventies already had evidence of braindeterioration in his forties.Losing your memory or developing brain fog in your forties, fifties, sixties,seventies, or even eighties is not normal. It is a sign of trouble. Be smart andstop waiting for a problem to hit you in the head before you decide you have toget healthy.Marianne was fifty-nine years old when she almost quit her job. She worked as ahigh-level business executive but felt as though her mind was beginning todeteriorate. Physically, her whole body hurt, and her head felt foggy all daylong. At first she thought that she was “just” getting older, that it happenedto everyone. But as she got worse, she thought it was unfair to her co-workersthat she was not on top of her game, and she considered leaving a job she loved.She thought her best days were behind her. Her daughter gave her a copy of oneof my books and she immediately started the program. To her amazement, withintwo months she started to feel much better, her pain was gone, and the brain foghad lifted. Within a year, she had lost thirty pounds and now her brain feelsyounger, sharper, and more energized than it has in decades. “I have afast-acting brain with the wisdom of experience,” she told me. “I feel like I amat the peak of my life and my best is no longer behind me.”Are the treatments we have now for Alzheimer’s disease more likely to make animpact early or late in the illness? Early. The more brain tissue there isavailable to save, the better. The best tactic to decrease your risk forAlzheimer’s disease or to even prevent it is to decrease the illnesses andproblems that are associated with it, such as brain injuries, drug or alcoholabuse, heart disease, vascular diseases, strokes, cancer, obesity, sleep apnea,diabetes, hypertension, depression, toxic exposure, low testosterone levels, andlow thyroid levels.This book will be your road map for decreasing your risk for Alzheimer’s diseaseand other forms of dementia, and in the process you will look and feel better,have a sharper memory and improved decision-making skills. Since the problems ofaging, including dementia, start much earlier than their symptoms manifest, nowis the time to take your brain health seriously, no matter what your age. Manyof the diseases of aging actually start in childhood or adolescence and includeobesity, brain injuries, depression, and an unhealthy support system. Keepingyour children and grandchildren healthy is one of the best gifts you can givethem. Knowing what we know now, if you are the grandparent who gleefully dolesout the candy and ice cream whenever the grandchildren come over, you areclearly not doing them any favors.This book is organized around ten stories that highlight the major concepts ofusing your brain to change your age. 1. Nana, Lisa, and Ruth’s story will show you the importance of knowing yourimportant health numbers. You cannot change what you do not measure. Allowingthese numbers to get out of control may very well lead to your early death. Itwill also give you a plan to decrease your risk for Alzheimer’s disease andage-related memory problems. 2. Tamara’s story will show you how the food you eat literally poisons yourbody, drains your brain, and causes you to want to check out of life early, orhow it can be your best medicine. If you are smart, you will only want to eatfood that serves you. 3. Andy’s story will show you the importance of getting strong to live long.His before-and-after brain scans will show you how you can look and feeldramatically younger by following the steps of the program, especially addingconsistent physical exercise. 4. Jose’s story directly demonstrates how the physical health of your brainenhances good decision-making skills to help you live longer. 5. Jim’s story highlights the importance of lifelong learning to keep thebrain young. 6. Joni’s story illustrates the connection between brain health, beautifulskin, and a healthy sex life. The health of your skin is an outside reflectionof the health of your brain. Since the brain is 50 percent visual, healthy skinattracts others to you. 7. Chris and Sammie’s heartbreaking story will demonstrate the need to treatgrief, depression, anxiety disorders, and other emotional challenges in order towant to live long and feel younger. 8. Anthony, Patrick, Nancy, and others will demonstrate that brain damage isoften reversible with an intense, smart, focused program. 9. “The Tale of Two Ricks” will show the importance of your “people”connections to get and stay healthy.10. Daniel—that’s me—and Brain SPECT Imaging will tell how the brain images inthis book have changed everything in my life and how they can change yours aswell, even if you never get a scan.In addition, there will be detailed information on ways to actively protect thebrain from aging, as well as on the smart use of natural supplements. I amexcited to be your guide on this journey. Together we can make a difference inyour life and in the lives of those you love, even for three or fourgenerations.STEVE’S AMAZING TRANSFORMATIONEighteen months before I wrote this book Steve was forty years old and weighed630 pounds. He was depressed and struggling with a twenty-five-year addiction toalcohol and nicotine. He suffered with sleep apnea, hypertension, diabetes, andsevere chronic pain in his feet, which tortured him day and night. He was so bigthat whenever he fell he would have to call 911 for a team of people to helphim. At the time, he was contemplating suicide and finally decided that he hadonly two choices: either to live or to die. He chose life.[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_016_r1.jpg]His sister bought him a copy of my book Change Your Brain, Change Your Body,which he followed religiously, and together with the help of many supportivepeople, Steve lost 156 pounds over the next four months and has now lost over380 pounds. In addition, Steve has gone from ten medications to two, and he haslost his pain, diabetes, cigarettes, and depression—all without any surgery. Notonly does Steve look and feel dramatically younger, but his brain is younger aswell. He has better focus, better energy, and a better memory. Ultimately, Steveused his brain to change his age, and in the process he saved his life. If Stevecan use these principles to get healthy, then I know you can too."},{"pageContent":"1NANA, LISA, AND RUTH[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_L01_r1.jpg]KNOW YOUR NUMBERS TO KEEP YOUR MIND HEALTHY AND PREVENT ALZHEIMER’S AND OTHERDISEASES OF AGINGI can never find my keys. Sometimes they show up by the eggs in therefrigerator.I am fifty-two. Isn’t that normal?Think again!When Lisa was a young girl she adored her nana, her mother’s mother. Nana andLisa baked cookies together, played cards for hours, told silly jokes, andpicked plums in Nana’s backyard. Nana taught Lisa how to can the fruit for plumjam, which they loved to share. Nana was very overweight, so she would hold theladder while her granddaughter climbed the ladder for the plums. On nights Lisaslept over, Nana always read to her. Lisa remembers laughing so hard that shewould sometimes snort at the silly voices Nana used when she read the stories.At night in the dark they promised each other to always be best friends. Lisaloved snuggling into Nana’s body, which was ever so soft. She felt unconditionallove in Nana’s presence, which was one of the best feelings she remembered fromher childhood.Then, when Lisa was about twelve years old, something started to change. Atfirst, it was barely noticeable. Nana seemed less interested in their timetogether. There were no more jokes, fewer stories, and Nana said she was tootired to play games or pick plums. Nana was also more irritable with Lisa, evensometimes yelling at her for what seemed like no reason at all. Lisa wasdevastated, but Nana did not pick up on the social cues that should have toldher that her granddaughter needed soothing. Lisa remembers this as one of thesaddest, most confusing times in her life. She wondered if she had donesomething to make Nana mad. “What’s wrong with Nana?” Lisa would ask her mother,but time and again her mother would say, “Don’t worry. Nana is fine.” This onlydeepened Lisa’s pain and confusion. Maybe she really was the problem and Nanahad just stopped loving her.Her grandmother was sixty-five years old when Lisa noticed the changes. Aroundthis time, Nana had been diagnosed with diabetes and high blood pressure. Lisaremembered watching Nana take her pills and her shots to feel better, but no oneseemed overly concerned about her health.When Lisa was fourteen, Nana took a dramatic turn for the worse. With Lisa inthe car, Nana got lost on the way home from the store. Nana panicked and stoppeda man who was walking across the street to ask for help, but she could not tellhim where she lived. She appeared frightened and confused, like a child. Lisaasked the man to call her grandfather, who came to pick them up.Once they got home Lisa cornered her mother. “Look, Mom, I know something isreally wrong with Nana. Her brain isn’t working right. She needs help.” Still,the family continued making excuses, normalizing what was obviously not normalbehavior. Looking back on this time, as an adult, Lisa remembers being furious,feeling she was, even as a young teen, the lone voice of reason shouting into abitter wind. After Nana got lost several more times, the family finally wasconcerned enough to take her to a doctor who diagnosed her with something calledsenile dementia. He recommended Nana live in a nursing home for people withmemory problems.Gone were the happy warm feelings she once enjoyed when she visited hergrandmother. The nursing home where she now lived smelled “medical” and feltcold, and Lisa felt odd and afraid in it. She never knew which Nana she’d findon these visits: Sometimes Nana smiled when she saw Lisa; sometimes she did notrecognize her at all. Sometimes when Lisa read to Nana she seemed engaged andhappy, other times her grandmother just wanted to be left alone. After a fewyears, Nana died in the nursing home. However, Lisa felt that Nana had reallydied years earlier when her personality slowly ebbed away. At Nana’s funeral,all of their special times circled through Lisa’s mind. She couldn’t helpwondering how a person could disappear while her body continued living on, andshe couldn’t help feeling how sad it all was. Lisa wondered if she or her motherwould have the same problem as Nana. She prayed to God they would not.Lisa’s mother, Ruth, was also a lot of fun. They too had many special times,cooking, reading, and playing together. Like Nana, Ruth was a fabulous baker whoalso struggled with her weight, early onset diabetes, and hypertension. Lisa’smother was also a wonderful grandmother to Lisa’s three daughters, whichreminded Lisa of the closeness she’d shared with her own nana. In fact, hergirls called her mother Nana as well. In the back of her mind she kept watchover her own mother’s brain health. She didn’t want her granddaughters to losethis vibrant and wonderful relationship they’d enjoyed with her mom, as she’dlost hers with Nana. It was this concern that prompted Lisa, now in her earlyforties, to pick up my book, Change Your Brain, Change Your Life.When Ruth turned sixty-eight Lisa’s worst fears started to actualize. At first,Ruth struggled with finding the right words. If she meant dog, she mightunintentionally say bark; if she meant milk, she sometimes said cow. One timewhen she asked her granddaughter for a hug, she said, “Give Nana a slap.”Ruth’s memory was also becoming a problem. Lisa watched her reach for the phoneto dial her sister whom she’d just called five minutes earlier. Her sister saidthis sort of thing was happening more frequently. Lisa’s father mentioned thatthere were times when he found her mother standing and staring and not knowingwhy she was in a room. There were also two occasions on which Ruth got lostdriving in a town where she had lived for thirty years, forcing her to call herhusband for directions. Her father had installed a GPS system in Ruth’s car tohelp her. (I sometimes wonder if having GPS systems actually delays thediagnosis of early Alzheimer’s disease, as people do not have to rely as heavilyon their own memories to get from point A to point B, so their deficits are notseen early by those who could encourage them to get help.)Initially, Lisa’s dad just laughed off her mother’s struggles. He explained itaway with, “She is just getting older. She’s under a lot of stress.” Or “Youknow your mom has never had a good memory or sense of direction. It will pass.Everything is all right.”Because early signs of dementia may alternate with periods of lucidity, familiestend to deny what’s happening. This is tragic, because the earlier someone seekshelp, the better the prognosis. Remembering her Nana, Lisa wasn’t about toignore her concerns or let others downplay them. She anxiously and emphaticallytold her father, “Mom needs help and she needs it now.” Together they approachedher mom with their observations and concerns, urging her to go to the AmenClinics. At first Ruth was resistant. “I’ll be okay,” she said, which frightenedLisa even more. Then Lisa reminded her of Nana and told her that earlyintervention might help her avoid Nana’s fate. At this, Ruth agreed to come tothe Amen Clinics for an evaluation and brain SPECT imaging.I greeted Lisa and Ruth when they came into my office, and listened to theirstory. From these descriptions alone, I suspected Ruth had early Alzheimer’sdisease. However, after being a neuropsychiatrist for thirty years, I knew Icouldn’t proffer a diagnosis based on my suspicions alone. I had to look, test,probe, and get as much information as possible.Ruth’s brain SPECT scan showed three findings consistent with Alzheimer’sdisease: 1. Decreased activity in her parietal lobes, at the back, top part of herbrain. The parietal lobes help with direction sense. 2. Decreased activity in her temporal lobes, which help get memories intolong-term storage. The temporal lobes are also involved in word finding. 3. Decreased activity in an area called the posterior cingulate gyrus, deep inthe back part of the brain. The posterior cingulate gyrus is one of the firstareas in the brain that dies in Alzheimer’s disease and is involved with visualmemory.The structured memory testing that we do at the Amen Clinics also showedsignificant problems in both immediate and delayed recall.Normal Brain SPECT Scan[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_001_r1.jpg]Full, even, symmetrical activityRuth’s Brain SPECT Scan[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_018_r1.jpg]Decreases in the temporal and parietal lobe consistent with early Alzheimer’sdiseaseKNOW YOUR NUMBERS: YOU CANNOT CHANGE WHAT YOU DO NOT MEASUREThe next step in the process was to look at her important numbers. These arealso vital numbers for you to know and optimize; they’re a critical step inhelping you live longer and look younger.Here is a list we use at the Amen Clinics. 1. BMI 2. Waist-to-height ratio 3. Calories needed / calories spent 4. Number of fruits and vegetables eaten a day 5. Average of hours slept each night (with sleep apnea ruled out) 6. Blood pressure 7. Complete blood count 8. General metabolic panel with fasting blood sugar 9. HgA1C test for diabetes10. Vitamin D level11. Thyroid levels12. C-reactive protein13. Homocysteine14. Ferritin15. Testosterone16. Lipid panel17. Folic acid and B12 levels18. Syphilis and HIV screenings19. Apolipoprotein E genotype test20. Twelve modifiable health risk factors 1. Know Your BMI Ruth’s BMI, or body mass index, was 32, which was too high. Anormal BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9, overweight is between 25 and 29.9, andobese is greater than 30. You can find a simple BMI calculator on our website atwww.amenclinics.com [http://www.amenclinics.com]. Ruth was obese, which was nothelping her brain remain healthy. As already mentioned, being obese has beenassociated with less brain tissue and lower brain activity. Obesity doubles therisk for Alzheimer’s disease. There are probably several mechanisms thatunderlie this finding, including the fact that fat cells produce inflammatorychemicals and store toxic materials in the body.One of the reasons I want my patients to know their BMI is that it stops themfrom lying to themselves about their weight. I was sitting at dinner recentlywith a friend who seemed totally indifferent about his weight, even though hewas injecting himself with insulin for his diabetes at the table. As we weretalking, I calculated his BMI for him. Trust me, I can be a very irritatingfriend if I think you are not taking care of yourself. His BMI was just over 30,in the obese range. That really got his attention. Since then he has lost 20pounds and is more committed to getting healthy. The truth will set you free.Know your BMI.I put Ruth on a structured weight-loss program. 2. Know Your Waist-to-Height Ratio (WHtR) Another way to measure the health ofyour weight is with your waist-to-height ratio. Some researchers believe thisnumber is even more accurate than your BMI. BMI does not take into account anindividual’s frame, gender, or the amount of muscle mass versus fat mass. Forexample, two people can have the same BMI, even if one is much more muscular andcarrying far less abdominal fat than the other; this is because BMI does notaccount for differences in fat distribution. The WHtR is calculated by dividingwaist size by height. As an example, a male with a 32-inch waist who is 510 (70inches) would divide 32 by 70 to get a WHtR of 45.7 percent. The WHtR is thoughtto give a more accurate assessment of health, since the most dangerous place tocarry weight is in the abdomen. Fat in the abdomen, which is associated with alarger waist, is metabolically active and produces various hormones that cancause harmful effects, such as diabetes, elevated blood pressure, and alteredlipid (blood fat) levels. Many athletes, both male and female, who often have ahigher percentage of muscle and a lower percentage of body fat, have relativelyhigh BMIs, but their WHtRs are within a healthy range. This also holds true forwomen who have a “pear” rather than an “apple” shape.You want your waist size in inches to be less than half your height. So if youare 66 inches tall, your waist should not be more than 33 inches. If you are 72inches tall, your waist should not be more than 36 inches.Note: You have to actually measure your waist size with a tape measure! Going byyour pants size does not count, as many clothing manufacturers actually maketheir sizes larger than they state on the label so as not to offend theircustomers. I remember preferring to purchase pants or shorts that were labeled“relaxed fit” because I could still fit into a size 34-inch waist. There was noway I could get into a slim-fit 34 inches, which, looking back, actually was 34inches. Since doing this work, I have seen that most people do not know theirwaist size and are in total denial. Most of our NFL players and patientssignificantly underestimate their waist size. One of the pastors we work withsaid his waist size was 42 inches, but when we measured (at the belly button) itwas really 48 inches. Ruth was 54 tall. She told me her waist was 33 inches. Itmeasured at 37 inches.This was further confirmation that Ruth needed a structured weight-loss program. 3. Know the Number of Calories You Need and Spend in a Day I think of calorieslike money: If I eat more than I need, my body will become bankrupt. Wisecaloric spending is a critical component to getting healthy. Don’t let anyonetell you that calories don’t count. They absolutely do. The people who saycalories don’t matter are just fooling themselves. You need to know how manycalories you need to eat a day to maintain your current weight. The averagefifty-year-old woman needs about 1,800 calories, and the average fifty-year-oldman needs about 2,200 calories a day. This number can go up or down based onexercise level and height. You can find a free personalized “caloric need”calculator at www.amenclinics.com [http://www.amenclinics.com].Set a realistic goal for your desired weight and match your behavior to reachit. If you wish to lose a pound a week, you typically need to eat 500 calories aday fewer than you burn. I am not a fan of rapid weight loss. It does not teachyou how to live for the long term. One of my patients went on the hCG diet andlost 40 pounds in three twenty-six-day cycles, but it was at a pretty high cost.Within the next six months, she put all the weight back plus another 10 pounds.Slow and steady teaches you new habits. I like it for people to lose a pound aweek, which teaches them a new way of living for the long term.Know the Daily Calories You Consume Stomp out calorie amnesia! For anyone whohas problem with their weight, this is a very effective strategy to get back ontrack. Stop lying to yourself about what you are actually putting into yourbody. As we will discuss in the next chapter, think CROND: calorie restricted,optimally nutritious, and delicious. Besides becoming familiar with caloriecounts, get a small notebook that you can carry with you everywhere. It will beyour new best friend. Jot down the calories you consume as you eat during theday. If you keep this log, together with the other parts of the program, it willbe a major step forward in getting control of your brain and body for the restof your life. If you don’t know the calories of something, don’t eat it. Why areyou going to let someone else sabotage your health? Ignorance is not bliss. Itincreases your chances for an early death.Until you really understand calories, you need to learn to weigh and measurefood and look at the food labels for portion size. What the cereal companiesthink is a portion size may not be anywhere near what your eyes think. When youactually do this, I can promise it will be a rude awakening. I know it was forme. Upon keeping track of his calories, one of our NFL players wrote, “I had noidea of the self-abuse I was doing to my body!”Ruth had no idea of how many calories she needed a day or how many she actuallyate. This had to be part of her brain rehabilitation program. 4. Know the Number of Fruits and Vegetables a Day You Eat Count them! Eat morevegetables than fruits and try to get that number to between five and tenservings to enhance your brain and lower your risk for cancer. Ruth said she waserratic in eating vegetables and had no idea of the actual number of servingsshe was eating each day. Another benefit of eating five to ten servings a day offruit and vegetables is that they are so naturally filling, making it mucheasier to keep within your calorie limits. Ruth’s diet needed a makeover. 5. Know How Many Hours of Sleep You Get Each Night Ruth typically got fivehours of sleep at night. Her husband said she did not snore or stop breathing atnight. Sleep assessment with memory problems and aging is critical. One of thefastest ways to age is by getting less than seven or eight hours of sleep atnight. People who typically get six hours of sleep or less have lower overallblood flow to the brain, which hurts its function. Researchers from the WalterReed Army Institute of Research and the University of Pennsylvania found thatchronically getting less than eight hours of sleep was associated with cognitivedecline.Chronic insomnia triples your risk of death from all causes.This was clearly an area in which Ruth needed help. I recommended sleepstrategies, including a warm bath before bed, no television an hour before bed,a sleep-inducing hypnosis CD, and a melatonin-based sleep supplement.While we are discussing sleep, it is important to know that sleep apnea doublesa person’s risk for Alzheimer’s disease. On our brain SPECT studies sleep apneaoften looks like early Alzheimer’s disease with low activity in the parietal andtemporal lobes. Sleep apnea is characterized by snoring, periods of apnea(temporary cessation of breathing), and chronic tiredness during the day. Thechronic lack of oxygen from the apnea periods is associated with brain damageand early aging. Sleep apnea has also been associated with obesity,hypertension, strokes, and heart disease. If there is any chance you may havesleep apnea, go to your health care professional who can refer you to a sleeplab. 6. Know Your Blood Pressure Ruth’s blood pressure was 145/92 mm/Hg(millimeters of mercury) on her blood pressure medication. This is way too high.High blood pressure is associated with lower overall brain function, which meansmore bad decisions. Check your blood pressure or have your doctor check it on aregular basis. If your blood pressure is high make sure to take it seriously.Some behaviors that can help lower your blood pressure include losing weight,daily exercise, fish oil and, if needed, medication.Optimal: Below 120/80 mm/HgPrehypertension: 120/80 to 130/80–130/89 mm/HgHypertension: 140/90 mm/Hg or aboveI added exercise and high-dose fish oil to Ruth’s regimen.LABORATORY TESTSThe next set of important numbers comes from laboratory tests that are usuallyordered by a health care professional. It is essential that you know theseimportant numbers about yourself. 7. Know Your Complete Blood Count (CBC) You need to check the health of yourblood, including red and white blood cells. People with low blood count can feelanxious, tired, and have significant memory problems. In one of our patients whowas screened as part of a regular physical, we picked up that he had leukemia,even though he had no physical symptoms. Early treatment for most medicalconditions, including leukemia or Alzheimer’s disease, is best. Ruth’s CBC wasnormal. 8. Know YourGeneral Metabolic Panel This is to check the health of your liver,kidneys, fasting blood sugar, and cholesterol. Ruth’s fasting blood sugar washigh at 135. Normal is 70–99 mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter), prediabetes is100–125 mg/dL, and diabetes is 126 mg/dL or higher. Even though Ruth was beingtreated, her blood sugar was too high.Why is high fasting blood sugar a problem? High blood sugar causes vascularproblems throughout your whole body. It causes blood vessels over time to becomebrittle and vulnerable to breakage. It leads not only to diabetes but also heartdisease, strokes, visual impairment, impaired wound healing, wrinkled skin, andcognitive problems.If we were going to reverse Ruth’s cognitive deterioration, it was critical toget her blood sugar under better control with a healthy diet and some simplesupplements, such as alpha-lipoic acid. 9. Know Your HgA1C Level This test shows your average blood sugar levels overthe past two to three months and is used to diagnose diabetes and prediabetes.Normal results for a nondiabetic person are in the 4–6 percent range.Prediabetes is indicated by levels in the 5.7–6.4 percent range. Numbers higherthan that may indicate diabetes.Ruth’s HgA1C was high at 7.4 percent. To optimize it, I recommended that shelose weight, eliminate all sugar and refined carbohydrates, eat several smallmeals a day with some protein at each meal, exercise, and begin taking fish oiland the supplement alpha-lipoic acid.10. Know Your Vitamin D Level Low levels of vitamin D have been associated withobesity, depression, cognitive impairment, heart disease, reduced immunity,cancer, psychosis, and all causes of mortality. Have your physician check your25-hydroxy vitamin D level, and if it is low get more sunshine and/or take avitamin D3 supplement. A healthy vitamin D level is 30–100 ng/dL (nanograms perdeciliter). Optimal is 50–100 ng/dL. Two-thirds of the U.S. population is low invitamin D, the same number of Americans who are overweight or obese. One of thereasons for the dramatic rise in vitamin D deficiency is people wearing moresunscreen and spending more time inside working or in front of the television orcomputer.Ruth’s vitamin D level was 8 ng/dL, which was very low. Optimizing her vitamin Dlevel was another critical component to optimizing her cognitive health.11. Know Your Thyroid Levels Abnormal thyroid hormone levels are a common causeof forgetfulness, confusion, lethargy, and other symptoms of dementia in bothwomen and men. Having low thyroid levels decreases overall brain activity, whichcan impair your thinking, judgment, and self-control, and make it very hard foryou to feel good. Low thyroid functioning can make it nearly impossible tomanage weight effectively. Know your:• TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone)—normal is between 0.350 and 3.0 μIU/mL• Free T3 (300–400 pg/dL [picogram per deciliter])• Free T4 (1.0–1.80 ng/dL)• Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies (0–34 IU/mL)There is no one perfect way, no one symptom or test result, that will properlydiagnose low thyroid function or hypothyroidism. The key is to look at yoursymptoms and your blood tests, and then decide. Symptoms of low thyroid includefatigue, depression, mental fog, dry skin, hair loss, especially outer third ofeyebrows, feeling cold when others feel normal, constipation, hoarse voice, andweight gain.Most doctors do not check TPO antibodies unless the TSH is high. This is a bigmistake. Many people have autoimmunity against their thyroid, which makes itfunction poorly but still register a “normal” TSH. That’s why I think thisshould be part of routine screening.Medication can easily improve symptoms if a thyroid problem is present. Haveyour doctor check your thyroid hormones for hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidismand treat as necessary to normalize.Ruth’s thyroid tests were normal.12. Know Your C-reactive Protein Range This is a measure of inflammation.Elevated inflammation is associated with a number of diseases and conditionsthat are associated with aging and cognitive impairment. Fat cells producechemicals that increase inflammation. A healthy range is between 0.0 and 1.0mg/dL. This is a very good test for inflammation. It measures the general levelof inflammation but does not tell you where it is from. The most common reasonfor an elevated C-reactive protein is metabolic syndrome or insulin resistance.The second most common is some sort of reaction to food—either a sensitivity, atrue allergy, or an autoimmune reaction as occurs with gluten. It can alsoindicate hidden infections.Ruth’s C-reactive protein test was 7.3 mg/dL, which was way too high and neededto be addressed immediately with high-dose fish oil (6 grams a day) and the samehealthy anti-inflammatory diet recommended in this book.13. Know Your Homocysteine Level Elevated levels (>10 μmol/L [micromoles/liter])in the blood have been associated with damage to the lining of arteries andatherosclerosis (hardening and narrowing of the arteries) as well as anincreased risk of heart attacks, strokes, blood clot formation, and possiblyAlzheimer’s disease. This is a sensitive marker for B vitamin deficiency,including folic acid deficiency. Replacing these vitamins often helps return thehomocysteine level to normal. Other possible causes of a high homocysteine levelinclude low levels of thyroid hormone, kidney disease, psoriasis, somemedicines, or when the condition runs in your family. The ideal level is 6–10μmol/L (micromoles/liter). Eating more fruits and vegetables (especially leafygreen vegetables) can help lower your homocysteine level by increasing how muchfolate you get in your diet. Good sources of folate include lentils, asparagus,spinach, and most beans. If adjusting your diet is not enough to lower yourhomocysteine, take folic acid (1 mg), vitamin B6 (10 mg), and B12 (500 μg[micrograms]).Ruth’s homocysteine level was high at 16 μmol/l. I recommended a comprehensivemultivitamin with higher levels of B vitamins and a healthy diet.14. Know Your Ferritin Level This is a measure of iron stores that increaseswith inflammation and insulin resistance. Less than 200 ng/mL is ideal. Womentend to have lower iron stores than men, due to blood loss (blood cells containiron) from years of menstruation. Low ferritin levels are associated withanemia, restless legs, and ADD. Higher iron stores have been associated withstiffer blood vessels and vascular disease. Some research suggests that donatingblood to lower high ferritin levels may enhance blood vessel flexibility andhelp decrease the risk of heart disease. Moreover, whenever you give blood youare being altruistic, which will also help you live longer.Ruth’s ferritin level was normal.15. Know Your Free and Total Serum Testosterone Levels Low levels of the hormonetestosterone, for men or women, have been associated with low energy,cardiovascular disease, obesity, low libido, depression, and Alzheimer’sdisease.Normal levels for adult males are:• Testosterone Total Male (280–800 ng/dL)• Testosterone Free Male (7.2–24 pg/mL)Normal levels for adult females are:• Testosterone Total Female (6–82 ng/dL)• Testosterone Free Female (0.0–2.2 pg/mL)Ruth’s free and total testosterone levels were very low. Sometimes hormonereplacement is necessary, but my first intervention is a healthy diet, whicheliminates sugar. Getting a sugar burst has been associated with lowertestosterone levels.16. Know Your Lipid Panel Sixty percent of the solid weight of the brain is fat.High cholesterol is obviously bad for the brain, but having too little is alsobad, as some cholesterol is essential for making sex hormones and helping thebrain function properly. Getting your lipid panel checked regularly isimportant. This test includes HDL (high-density lipoprotein, or “good”cholesterol), LDL (low-density lipoprotein, or “bad” cholesterol), andtriglycerides (a form of fat). According to the American Heart Association,optimal levels are as follows:• Total Cholesterol (<200 mg/dL)• HDL (≥ 60 mg/dL)• LDL (<100 mg/dL)• Triglycerides (<100 mg/dL)If your lipids are off make sure to get your diet under control as well as takefish oil and exercise. Of course you should see your physician. Also, knowingthe particle size of LDL cholesterol is very important. Large particles are lesstoxic than smaller particle size.Ruth’s total cholesterol and LDL were high while her HDL was low.17. Know Your Folic Acid and B12 Levels It is important in evaluating memoryproblems to rule out deficiencies of these nutrients. Ruth’s levels were normal.I once had a patient who had a severe B12 deficiency, whose brain SPECT scanshowed severe overall decreased blood flow.18. Know Your Syphilis and HIV Screening Results Dementia can be associated withlater-stage syphilis and HIV infections. If the person had syphilis or an HIVinfection many years ago and was never properly treated, the illness may haveprogressed to the point of affecting behavior and intelligence. Even though itwasn’t likely in Ruth’s case, it is always important to check. Her tests werenegative.19. Know Your Apolipoprotein E (APOE) Genotype This test checks genetic risk.The presence of the APOE e4 gene significantly increases a person’s risk forAlzheimer’s disease and is associated with symptoms that appear five to tenyears earlier than in the general population. Many children of an affectedparent wish to know the parent’s APOE genotype so they can determine theirchance of inheriting a higher risk for AD, atherosclerosis, heart disease, andstroke.Everyone has two APOE genes, and if one of them—or worse, two of them—are APOEe4, that person’s chances of having memory issues are higher. APOE genes aloneare not dangerous; we need them to function. They help in the development,maturation, and repair of cell membranes of neurons, and they help regulate theamount of cholesterol and triglycerides in nerve cell membranes. There are threeversions of the APOE gene: e2, e3, and e4, and it is the last one that is theculprit. As with all genes, we inherit one copy from each parent, and any oneperson could have the following combination: e2/e2, e2/e3, e2/e4, e3/e3, e3/e4,or e4/e4.If a person has two e4 genes, it means he received one from each parent. Becausethe APOE e4 gene is known to increase the beta-amyloid deposition and plaqueformation that is found in people with Alzheimer’s disease, it increases thechance of developing the most common form—late-onset Alzheimer’s disease—by 2.5(for one e4) or fivefold (for two e4s). The APOE e4 gene also causes symptoms toappear two to five years earlier than for those who don’t have it but do havesome other cause of Alzheimer’s.For about 15 percent of the general population, at least one of their two APOEgenes is the e4 gene. People who have no APOE e4 gene at all have only a 5–10percent chance of developing AD after age sixty-five, whereas people with oneAPOE e4 gene have about a 25 percent chance. That is quite a jump. But the goodnews that can be inferred here is that not everyone with the gene will developAlzheimer’s; in fact, 75 percent will not. One other thing to consider is thateven if a person has one APOE e4 gene and he develops dementia, Alzheimer’sdisease might not be the source. There is a chance that the cause of thedementia could be something else. If the person has two APOE e4 genes, on theother hand, and he develops dementia, the odds are very good that it is fromAlzheimer’s disease. In fact, the odds are 99 percent.Ruth had the e3/e4 gene.20. Know How Many of the Twelve Most Important Modifiable Health Risk FactorsYou Have, Then Work to Decrease Them Here is a list from researchers at theHarvard School of Public Health. Circle the ones that apply to you.• Smoking• High blood pressure• BMI indicating overweight or obese• Physical inactivity• High fasting blood glucose• High LDL cholesterol• Alcohol abuse (accidents, injuries, violence, cirrhosis, liver disease,cancer, stroke, heart disease, hypertension)• Low omega-3 fatty acids• High dietary saturated fat intake• Low polyunsaturated fat intake• High dietary salt• Low intake of fruits and vegetablesRuth had ten of the twelve preventable risk factors (those in italics) for earlydeath. Working to address these issues was critical to have any hope ofreversing the negative trend.In summary, Ruth’s evaluation demonstrated a clinical picture, scan findings,and memory testing consistent with “early” Alzheimer’s disease. She had one ofthe APOE e4 genes that put her at risk, and she was practicing only two of thetwelve preventable risk factors for early death. The good news in a case such asRuth’s was that there were so many different important numbers that could stillbe changed or optimized that it might make a significant difference in hermental state.Thankfully, Ruth was still cognitively aware enough and still had ampleprefrontal cortex function to understand the severity of her problems werelikely to get worse without a serious attempt at getting well. The plan for Ruthincluded these elements:• Immediately change to a CROND diet, eliminating sugar, simple carbohydrates,and artificial sweeteners and eating more vegetables (at least five servings)together with lean protein and healthy fat. She was to weigh herself every day,and have her husband record it for her.• Begin taking supplements of multivitamins with extra B vitamins, alpha-lipoicacid for blood sugar regulation, vitamin D, and fish oil.• Begin taking supplements to enhance memory, including vinpocetine and ginkgoto enhance blood flow, huperzine A and acetyl-L-carnitine to enhance theneurotransmitter acetylcholine, and N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which is asuper-antioxidant.• Focus on getting seven to eight hours of sleep at night with better sleephabits, self-hypnosis, and melatonin as needed.• Implement strategies for lowering blood pressure, which included exercise,weight loss, and fish oil. Her medication would be adjusted if the lifestylechanges did not work within three months.• Recheck blood tests in three months to make sure that fasting blood sugar,HgA1C, vitamin D, C-reactive protein, homocysteine, testosterone, andcholesterol were improving with the supplements and diet.• If after three months there was no improvement, other treatments would beimplemented, including medication to enhance memory. (My bias, after being apsychiatrist for thirty years, is to start with natural treatments, even inserious cases such as Ruth’s.)In talking to Lisa, she told me that seeing her mother this way was a seriouswake-up call for her. Lisa’s SPECT scan showed mildly low activity in hertemporal lobes and parietal lobes (two of the three areas known to be associatedwith Alzheimer’s disease). Her lab testing revealed that she had one of the APOEe4 genes and that her fasting blood sugar was already high as were her BMI andWHtR ratio. To help her mother, and herself, stay on track, she would do the neweating plan with her and make sure her father was totally on board. Support iscritical to success.Normal Brain SPECT Scan[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_019_r1.jpg]Full, even, symmetrical activityLisa’s Brain SPECT Scan[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_020_r1.jpg]Mild decreases in her parietal and temporal lobeThree months later, Ruth was doing much better. Her memory test scores hadimproved as had her weight (she lost 18 pounds and 3 inches off her waist) andall of her important numbers, without any additional medication. At first,getting on the dietary changes was hard for Ruth because she’d never learned howto cook in a brain healthy way. Everything had been bread and butter, pancakesand muffins, cakes and cookies. She and Lisa got one of my wife’s two cookbooksand used them as a guide. The program kicked in after about two weeks when theyrealized that healthy food was not only good for them, but that it also tastedgreat. The program was not about being deprived, they learned, but ratherlearning to prepare an abundance of healthy food. Even on a calorie-restricteddiet, their cravings went away and their energy went up. They also lovedspending time together, which Lisa realized was more important now than everbefore. Given the severity of the diagnosis and seeing Ruth’s scans and testscores, Lisa’s father also joined the effort and stopped his denial.To live longer, feel your best, and look and think younger, it is important todo it by the numbers. Knowing your important numbers is a critical step ingetting control of your brain and body for the rest of your life. When any orall of these numbers are out of whack, it can prevent you from losing weight,keep you in the dumps, and reduce brain function. Remember the paint-by-numbersets when you were little? How you filled in each section, one by one, until abeautiful picture formed? Getting well can be much the same way. The morenumbers you get balanced, the more you become a living, breathing, beautifulpicture of health. My patients are often surprised to find how fun, rewarding,and motivating it is to see evidence of incremental improvement in black andwhite on their lab reports or, in the case of SPECT scans, in living color.DECREASE YOUR RISK FOR ALZHEIMER’S AND OTHER FORMS OF DEMENTIAI gave Ruth a plan to treat the “early” Alzheimer’s disease that was alreadyravaging her brain, and the treatment had a positive impact for her. I put theword early in quotes because in reality the disease in her brain was definitelynot just starting. Researchers believe that Alzheimer’s disease and other formsof dementia actually start decades before people have their first symptoms. Inone study from UCLA, brain imaging researchers suggest that brain scans actuallystart to change as much as fifty years in advance of the illness. The only waywe will ever be able to seriously make an impact in decreasing your risk forAlzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia is to start early. Lisa’s brain,in her forties, already showed evidence of problems.Alzheimer’s disease is no small problem. It currently affects more than fivemillion people in the United States, and it is estimated to triple by the year2030. Nearly 50 percent of people who live to the age of eighty-five willdevelop Alzheimer’s. One of the sad truths is that everyone in the family isaffected by this disease. The level of emotional, physical, and financial stressin these families is constant and enormous. One of the frightening statistics isthat an estimated 15 percent of caregivers of people with Alzheimer’s have itthemselves.Decreasing your risk for Alzheimer’s disease and other causes of memory lossrequires forethought, a well-researched scientific plan (something that willactually work), and a good prefrontal cortex so that you will follow through onthe plan. My plan to decrease your risk for Alzheimer’s and keep your brainhealthy as you age is the whole program in this book. What follows are someobvious steps you can take to decrease the chances your brain will ageprematurely.STEP 1. KNOW YOUR RISK FOR TROUBLEIt is critical to know your specific risk for Alzheimer’s disease. Here is alist of the most common risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease and early brainaging. The number in parentheses indicates the severity of the risk: the higherthe number, the more severe the risk factor. Work to eliminate as many of theserisk factors as possible:One family member with Alzheimer’s or dementia (3.5)More than one family member with Alzheimer’s or dementia (7.5)Family history of Down syndrome (2.7)A single head injury with loss of consciousness (2.0)Several head injuries without loss of consciousness (2.0)Alcohol dependence or drug dependence in past or present (4.4)Major depression diagnosed by a physician in past or present, whether treated ornot (2.0)Stroke (10)Heart disease or heart attack (2.5)High cholesterol (2.1)High blood pressure (2.3)Diabetes (3.4)History of cancer or cancer treatment (3.0)Seizures in past or present (1.5)Limited exercise, less than twice a week (2.0)Less than a high school education (2.0)Jobs that do not require periodically learning new information (2.0)Within the 65–74 age range (2.0)Within the 75–84 age range (7.0)Over 85 years old (38.0)Smoking cigarettes for ten years or longer (2.3)Has one APOE e4 gene, if known (2.5)Has two APOE e4 genes, if known (5.0)STEP 2. CONSIDER A SPECT SCANHaving a brain SPECT scan can also help you know about the health of your brainand your risk of getting Alzheimer’s disease. When I turned fifty, my doctorwanted me to have a colonoscopy. I asked him why he didn’t want to look at mybrain. “Isn’t the other end of my body just as important?” How do you reallyknow what is going on in your brain unless you look? At some point in the nearfuture I believe these screening tools will be as normal as mammograms orcolonoscopies. They may be especially helpful for people at risk or those having“early” symptoms. Because most physicians are not used to looking at brainfunction, many people suffer needlessly and never know that that they havevulnerable brains until it is too late. They never know that they have apotentially treatable condition.Here is an example.EdEd, seventy-two, was brought to us from Vancouver, British Columbia, by hisdaughter, Candace. Candace was concerned that her father was becoming moreforgetful. His mood seemed lower than usual and his judgment was not as good.When she looked at his finances, he had paid bills twice and had forgottenothers. When she took him to the local neurologist, the doctor diagnosed himwith Alzheimer’s disease, without ever looking at his brain. Candace had read mybook Change Your Brain, Change Your Life and was upset the doctor did not ordera scan. The doctor said he was confident in his diagnosis and didn’t need tolook at his brain. This is always an attitude that amazes me. Unhappy with thelack of thoroughness, Candace brought Ed to see us.In looking at his scan, Ed had very large ventricles (fluid-filled cavities inthe brain). It is a pattern I have labeled the “lobster sign” because what lookslike an upside-down lobster appears on the brain slices. Ed also had a smallcerebellum in the back, bottom part of the brain. He definitely did not have thetypical Alzheimer’s pattern (low temporal and parietal lobe activity).Ed’s Brain SPECT Scan (showing slices from the top of the brain to the bottom)[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_021_r1.jpg]See slices 15 and 16 to see the “lobster sign”Normal Brain SPECT Scan[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_022_r1.jpg]Full, even, symmetrical activityEd’s Brain SPECT Scan[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_023_r1.jpg]Not a typical Alzheimer’s pattern but large ventricles (middle hole) and smallcerebellum (bottom)The reason this finding is so important is that it is often seen with acondition called normal pressure hydrocephalus, or NPH. The drainage of thecerebrospinal fluid is gradually blocked and the excessive fluid builds upslowly over time. It is often associated with urinary incontinence and troublewalking, though not always. Because Ed did not have those other symptoms, hisneurologist never thought of NPH. Subsequently, Ed’s brain continued todeteriorate. Upon seeing his scan, I recommended he have an immediateneurosurgical consultation. The neurosurgeon agreed with me and placed a shuntin Ed’s brain. Within three weeks, Ed’s memory came back. How do you know unlessyou look?STEP 3. FOCUS ON REDUCING YOUR SPECIFIC RISK FACTORSOkay, you have an idea of what risk factors you may have. Now what can you doabout it? Here is a list of ways to reduce those factors.Risk: Family member with Alzheimer’s disease or related disorder, or you havethe APOE e4 geneReduce: Seek early screening and take prevention very seriously and as early aspossible. Do all of the strategies outlined in this book now.Risk: Single head injury or several head injuriesReduce: Prevent further head injuries and start the prevention strategies assoon as possible.Risk: Alcohol dependence, drug dependence, or smoking in past or presentReduce: Get treatment to stop and look for underlying causes; start preventionstrategies early.Risk: Major depression or ADHD diagnosed by a physician in past or presentReduce: Get treatment and start prevention strategies early.Risk: Stroke, heart disease, high cholesterol, hypertension, diabetes, historyof cancer treatment, seizures in past or presentReduce: Get treatment and start prevention strategies early.Risk: Limited exercise (less than twice a week or less than thirty minutes persession)Reduce: Exercise three times a week or more.Risk: Less than a high school education or job that does not requireperiodically learning new informationReduce: Engage in lifelong learning.Risk: Sleep apneaReduce: Seek evaluation and treatment for sleep apnea.Risk: Estrogen or testosterone deficiencyReduce: Consider hormone replacement, if appropriate.You get the idea. Eliminate all the risk factors you can and work to keep yourbrain healthy over time.STEP 4. KEEP YOUR BODY AND BRAIN ACTIVEAs we will see in coming chapters, physical and mental exercise is the best wayto keep your brain young. Mental exercise helps the brain maintain and make newconnections. For more on mental exercise, see chapter 5[Amen_9780307888563_epub_c05_r1.htm]. Physical exercise boosts blood flow to thebrain, improves oxygen supply, helps the brain use glucose more efficiently, andhelps protect the brain from molecules that hurt it, such as free radicals. Formore on physical exercise, see chapter 3 [Amen_9780307888563_epub_c03_r1.htm].STEP 5. SUPPLEMENTS THAT SUPPORT HEALTHY BRAIN FUNCTIONThere is a lot of information and misinformation about supplements. Knowing whatto do is essential, because some vitamins and supplements work. Take amultivitamin and fish oil every day. Get your vitamin D level checked andoptimize it. Here are other supplements that have been shown to be helpful:• Fish oil and curcumin to decrease inflammation,• NAC and alpha-lipoic acid to boost the body’s ability to handle free radicalsand oxidation• Ginkgo biloba and vinpocetine to boost blood flow• Huperzine A and acetyl-L-carnitine to boost acetylcholine, theneurotransmitter involved in learning• Acetyl-L-carnitine and CoQ10 (coenzyme Q10) to boost mitochondrial function(the cells’ energy powerhouse, which diminishes with age and aging)• Brain and Memory Power Boost, a combination of ginkgo, vinpocetine,alpha-lipoic acid, NAC, acetyl-L-carnitine, and huperzine A to boost blood flowand cognitive testing scores when combined with a multiple vitamin, fish oil,and a brain healthy programSTEP 6. EAT TO LIVE LONGYou are what you eat. Many people are not aware of the fact that all of yourcells make themselves anew every five months. Food is a drug; intuitively, weall know this. If you have three doughnuts for breakfast, how do you feel thirtyminutes later? Blah! If you have a large plate of pasta for lunch, how do youfeel at 2 p.m.? Blah! The right diet helps you feel good. The wrong diet makesyou feel bad. Diet is an extremely important strategy to keep your brain healthywith age.The best diet is one that is high in nutrients, low in calories (calorierestriction is associated with longevity), high in omega-3 fatty acids (fish,fish oil, walnuts, and avocados), and antioxidants (vegetables). The bestantioxidant fruits and vegetables, according to the U.S. Department ofAgriculture, include prunes, raisins, blueberries, blackberries, cranberries,strawberries, spinach, raspberries, Brussels sprouts, plums, broccoli, beets,avocados, oranges, red grapes, red bell peppers, cherries, and kiwis. Eat yourfruits and vegetables! Your mother was right. For much more on nutrition, seechapter 2 [Amen_9780307888563_epub_c02_r1.htm].If you follow these guidelines you can decrease your risk for Alzheimer’sdisease by 50 percent or more. In a new study from San Francisco researchersfound that if people exercised and eliminated smoking, hypertension, depression,and obesity, they could dramatically cut their chances of getting Alzheimer’sdisease and other problems of aging. It’s your choice. Do you want a good mindgoing forward or not? If you do, now is the time to get serious, not at somearbitrary time in the future.SIMPLE STEPS TO DRAMATICALLY DECREASE YOUR RISK OF ALZHEIMER’SOf course, with any recommendation, especially one with such a high promise asdecreasing your risk for Alzheimer’s disease, it is important to ask thequestion “How do you know?” The strategy of decreasing your risk factors todecrease your chances of getting Alzheimer’s was studied by Dr. Deborah Barnes,a mental health researcher at the San Francisco VA Medical Center. Her researchfound that more than half of all Alzheimer’s disease cases could potentially beprevented through lifestyle changes and treatment, or prevention of chronicmedical conditions. She looked at research on hundreds of thousands ofAlzheimer’s disease patients from around the world and concluded that many riskfactors for Alzheimer’s disease can be reduced.Worldwide, the risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease include low education,smoking, physical inactivity, depression, midlife hypertension, diabetes, andmidlife obesity. In the United States, Dr. Barnes found that the biggest riskfactors that are modifiable are physical inactivity, depression, smoking,midlife hypertension, midlife obesity, low education, and diabetes. Her researchconcluded that this group of risk factors is believed to account for up to 51percent of all Alzheimer’s patients worldwide (17.2 million cases) and up to 54percent of Alzheimer’s cases in the United States (2.9 million cases). Herresearch suggests that some very simple lifestyle changes can have a dramaticeffect on preventing Alzheimer’s and other dementias in the United States andworldwide. The study results were presented at the 2011 meeting of theAlzheimer’s Association International Conference on Alzheimer’s Disease in Parisand published online in Lancet Neurology.REAL PREVENTION STARTS WITH OUR CHILDRENMany of the risks for Alzheimer’s disease occur in childhood. If we are sincereabout preventing this disease and related problems we must start with ourchildren. The APOE e4 gene increases the risk of Alzheimer’s. Having this geneplus a head injury increases the risk further. Many head injuries occur inchildhood, especially when playing contact sports or doing other high-riskactivities. If children are allowed to engage in these activities they shouldfirst be screened for the APOE e4 gene. If they have it, we should be moreattentive to protecting their heads. Children with ADHD and learning problemsoften drop out of school, leaving them at higher risk for dementia. Making surewe properly diagnose and help these children is essential to helping them becomelifelong learners. The seeds for depression occur in childhood. Depression isoften a result of persistent negative thinking patterns. School programs shouldbe developed to teach children how to correct these patterns, which could helpdecrease depression. Childhood obesity leads to adult obesity. Educatingchildren on nutrition and exercise can have lifelong benefits.Get healthy for yourself, but also do it for your children andgreat-grandchildren who want you around, lucid and vibrant and smiling, to enjoylife with them as long as humanly possible.CHANGE YOUR AGE NOW: TWENTY BRAIN HEALTHY TIPS AND NUMBERS TO KNOW FOR A LONG,HEALTHY LIFE 1. Know your important health numbers. Get tested and write them down, makelifestyle changes to improve them, and retest every three months until you areout of any danger zones. Some of the numbers you’ll want to know are listedbelow. 2. Know your BMI. Lose weight if you are overweight by eating low-calorie buthighly nutritious foods. Think CROND: calorie-restricted, optimally nutritious,and delicious. Being obese has been associated with less brain tissue and lowerbrain activity and doubles the risk for Alzheimer’s disease. Make sure yourwaist size is half your height in inches. Yes, you actually have to measure yourwaist with a tape measure. 3. Get your five to ten fruits and veggies per day. Count them! Eat morevegetables than fruits and try to get that number to between five and tenservings to enhance your brain and lower your risk for cancer. 4. Get eight hours’ sleep every night. Getting fewer than eight hours has beenassociated with cognitive decline. Chronic insomnia triples your risk of deathfrom all causes. Try a warm bath before bed, no television an hour before bed, asleep-inducing hypnosis CD, and a melatonin-based sleep supplement. Sleep apneadoubles a person’s risk for Alzheimer’s disease, so get a sleep study done ifyou suspect this could be an issue. 5. Check your blood pressure often, and make sure it is under control. If itis high, fish oil and exercise, along with losing weight, can help. If thisprotocol doesn’t help, make sure to see your health care professional. Highblood pressure is an emergency and is the second-leading preventable cause ofdeath in the United States, after smoking. 6. If you smoke, quit. It prematurely ages the brain and body. 7. I am not a fan of alcohol intake, because of what I see on brain scans.Don’t overdo it. 8. Get a complete blood count. Low blood count can make you feel anxious andtired and can affect your memory. One of our patients got this as a screeningtest and found out he had leukemia. Early treatment works better than latetreatment. 9. Get a general metabolic panel. This will test the health of your liver,kidneys, fasting blood sugar, and cholesterol. Every organ in your body isrelated to brain health and vice versa.10. Get an HgA1c test. It shows your average blood sugar levels over the pasttwo to three months and is used to diagnose diabetes and prediabetes.Alpha-lipoic acid has been shown to be helpful to stabilize blood sugar.11. Check your 25-hydroxy vitamin D level. This is critical and easy to fix.Also, check your folic acid and B12 levels. A deficiency in these vitamins canadd to cognitive decline.12. Know your thyroid levels. Abnormal thyroid hormone levels are a common causeof forgetfulness, confusion, lethargy, and other symptoms of dementia in bothwomen and men. Having low thyroid levels decreases overall brain activity.13. Find out your C-reactive protein level. This is a measure of inflammation.Elevated inflammation is associated with a number of diseases and conditionsthat are associated with aging and cognitive impairment. The eating lifestyle Iencourage in this book is also an anti-inflammatory diet. Fish oil also helpslower inflammation.14. Find out your homocysteine levels. Elevated levels in the blood have beenassociated with poor arterial health, as well as a possible increased risk ofheart attacks, strokes, blood clot formation, and possibly Alzheimer’s disease.Lentils, asparagus, spinach, and most beans are good for lowering yourhomocysteine levels, along with folic acid (1 mg), B6 (10 mg), and B12 (500 μg).15. Test for excess ferritin. This is a measure of excess iron stores thatincreases with inflammation and insulin resistance. Higher iron stores have beenassociated with stiffer blood vessels and vascular disease.16. Know your free and total serum testosterone level. Low levels of the hormonetestosterone, for men or women, have been associated with low energy,cardiovascular disease, obesity, low libido, depression, and Alzheimer’sdisease.17. Don’t ignore or minimize increased forgetfulness or downplay it with “She’sjust ditzy” or “He’s just getting older.” Forgetfulness and fogginess could havea number of causes (from adult attention deficit disorder, or ADD, to anemia, toearly-onset dementia)—but they are signs, at minimum, that your brain can use atune-up.18. Technology, like GPS systems, may be delaying the diagnosis of dementiabecause it can conceal forgetfulness. Make sure you get regular memoryscreenings after the age of fifty. You can do this at www.theamensolution.com[http://www.theamensolution.com].19. Dramatically decrease your risk of Alzheimer’s disease by decreasing all ofthe risk factors that are associated with it. These include diabetes, heartdisease, obesity, depression, brain trauma, and cancer.20. Real prevention starts with getting our children healthy."},{"pageContent":"2TAMARA[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_L01_r1.jpg]FOCUS ON FOODS THAT SERVE YOU, NOT STEAL FROM YOUThe major cause of inflammation is our processed high-sugar, low-fiber,fast-food, junk-food, calorie-dense, nutrient-poor industrial diet and ourcouch-potato lifestyle. A plant-based, whole-foods, real-food diet without sugarand flour in pharmacologic doses along with anti-inflammatory omega-3 fats and agood dose of exercise can dramatically reduce the risk of and even reverse heartdisease and diabetes. And they cost a lot less.—MARK HYMAN, M.D.Food is medicine or it is poison. You get to choose.Research suggests that your diet will affect generations to come. In a newstudy, animals fed the typical Western diet, over several generations, bredoffspring who were born more obese. The diet actually changed the way theanimal’s genes functioned so that over time each generation ate more food andbecame fatter and fatter. This is very disturbing, because it means that unlessyou get your health under control now, it can affect your children, yourgrandchildren, and even your great-grandchildren.The opposite is also true. As you care for yourself, you are increasing the oddsthat your children and grandchildren will have better health. Scientists,researchers, and psychiatrists are finding that everything we do has rippleeffects on the emotional and physical health of our families and beyond. Youhave the ability to change your life and the lives of generations to come.AN OLD WOMAN AT AGE THIRTY-TWOFor Tamara, my wife’s sister, it was a miserable day that began like others fromthe previous year. At the time, Tamara was a thirty-two-year-old mother of afive-year-old and a baby. She was unable to sleep through the night and wouldwake at intervals with a fierce craving for sugar. On more than onemiddle-of-the night excursion to the kitchen, unable to find something tosatisfy her raging sweet tooth, Tamara ate the kids’ sweet-tasting vitamins.Her numerous trips to the toilet would begin in earnest around 4:00 a.m. everyday. The contents of her bowels were the consistency of water, and at lastcount, the day before this one, she’d visited the bathroom thirteen times. Shewas spending three to five hours a day on the toilet. Every joint in her bodyached like the body of an old arthritic woman, and with every movement, hermuscles burned as if on fire. Her hands were so swollen that as she changed herbaby’s diaper that morning, she saw that her knuckles were beginning to crackand bleed—her skin unable to contain whatever toxic monster within was blowingher body up like a balloon. Her stomach was so painfully bloated most of thetime that she still looked pregnant.The complete lack of energy made working impossible. Taking her young kids tothe park, something she longed to do on pretty days, was unthinkable. It was allshe could do to care for the children’s most basic needs as she lay on the couchmost of the day, with zero energy and terrible pain soaring with every movement.“There wasn’t an energy drink or a strong enough brew of coffee that would evenfaze me anymore,” Tamara said. Her husband, Hector, was a wonderful man,compassionate and hardworking. He was also terribly concerned about what washappening to his wife. Many of the older people Tamara loved and had cared forin her family had recently died, and the toll of these multiple losses, on topof her waning health, hung over her like a heavy cloud. She’d begun taking anantidepressant, hoping it might help dispel some of the darkness that shroudedher days and nights.For whatever reason, this particular day in November of 2010, Tamara hit a wall.She’d finally had enough. She realized if she didn’t do something radical, shecould die; and her husband would lose the love of his life, and her childrenwould grow up without knowing their mother. As she lay on the couch, tearsstreaming, she thought of her big sister, Tana—my wife. Tamara knew that Tanawas a fitness and nutrition coach, the picture of health. But she alsoremembered that Tana had battled serious health issues in her past and had founda way to overcome them. Tana had never pushed her nutritional or exercisephilosophy on her extended family, but Tamara had always known in her heart thatTana would be happy to help if and when she was ready to get serious abouthealth. Tamara knew it was time to ask for help; she reached for her cell phoneand made the call that would soon change her life.TIRED OF PILLS AND LABELSShortly before this life-changing phone call, Tamara saw a doctor for her myriadissues. She’d been suffering with an unexplained autoimmune disorder for years.At one time doctors suspected she had lupus. When that was ruled out, theytested her for rheumatoid arthritis and then several other diseases. Eventually,she fell into the catchall diagnosis of fibromyalgia. But she didn’t know manypeople with fibromyalgia who spent several hours every day in the bathroom. Thisdoctor put her through another battery of tests to rule out rheumatoid arthritis(again), celiac-sprue, Crohn’s disease, and irritable bowel syndrome. Lab testsshowed her triglycerides were 290 mg/dL (normal is less than 150 mg/dL),cholesterol was 250 mg/dL (less than 200 mg/dL is optimal), and her bloodpressure was 139/96 mm/Hg (below 120/80 mm/Hg is optimal)! At 54, her weight hadcrept up to 206 pounds. Her vitamin D level was less than 20 ng/mL (optimal is50–90 ng/mL). Even with these numbers in hand, the doctor said nothing to Tamaraabout a lifestyle change but was quick with the prescription pad, orderingmedications for her array of symptoms.As sick as Tamara was, she left the doctor’s office with foreboding. Somethingin her hesitated to take the prescribed medications. In her experience, most ofthe medical world had given her either labels or pills, and the outcome of bothhad never been good. She remembered all too well the nightmare of getting offpain pills, which had been prescribed for her in the past, and knew she couldnot go there again.I WANT YOU TO EAT LIKE A GORILLATana’s voice was now on the other end of the phone, and she listenedcompassionately as Tamara shared her despair. Tana understood her sister’s painand frustration, as she too had suffered from a variety of health issues beforediscovering she had several food allergies. She suspected that since she andTamara were half sisters and shared genes, Tamara might also have severe andundiagnosed food allergies. At this point Tamara was all ears, ready to tryanything.“It is a choice,” Tana said. “If you are ready to make the decision to radicallyimprove your health, I want you to begin an elimination diet along with a fewsupplements. And Tamara, I want you to start today.” Tana then asked her sisterwhat sort of food she and her family had been eating.“Oh, the basic American diet,” Tamara quipped. “Whatever comes out of a box.”“Do you eat any vegetables?”“Honestly, Tana, I can’t remember the last time I ate a vegetable.”Tana took a deep breath. “Okay, get ready for a big change. I want you to starteating like a gorilla.”Tamara laughed, but Tana was on a roll. One thing about these talkative sisters,they are never at a loss for words and when they have something to say, they sayit with passion, and they talk fast. Tana said, “I want you to eat all the greenvegetables you can manage to eat, lightly cooked or in salads. I want you to eatthree palm-sized portions of protein a day. I also want you to drink ten totwelve glasses of water a day. Two glasses before you eat breakfast. You need itto wash those toxins out of your body. Your body is full of inflammation and itis killing you. This is the fastest way to get rid of it. You can also throw insome nuts, seeds, and eventually berries when you start to add fruit into yourroutine. But for now, avoid all fruit, until we get that raging sugar craving ofyours completely under control. Also, no dairy.”Tamara sighed. “I’m going to have to empty my kitchen cabinets. They are full ofjunk, and I know if there’s any sugar in the house, I’m helpless to avoid itright now.”Tana agreed this was a good idea and encouraged her sister to “make her fridgeinto a rainbow,” so Tamara tossed out the chips and bought some hummus and acolorful array of bell peppers. Because their family was on a tight budget ittook some shopping around to find affordable, healthy food. Tamara hadn’t boughtvegetables in such a long time that she hadn’t realized how expensive they were.But she found organic spinach in bulk at a popular discount warehouse and groundturkey was lean, tasty, and affordable. For the first two days, she foughtthrough the cravings, dining on her “gorilla zoo food” of fresh green salads,accompanied by turkey patties with a creamy slice of avocado on the side. Sheloved cheese, so that was hard to give up, but she’d never liked milk and foundthe taste of almond and coconut milk to be delightful. For everything she gaveup, she discovered a new and more nutritious food that she really liked, a foodthat satisfied her, made her feel better, and didn’t leave her with irrationalpowerful cravings for more.Tana also sent Tamara some nutritional powdered shake mixes and somesupplements, including a high-quality fish oil and vitamin D from the AmenClinic. She also sent our specially formulated supplements designed to help withcravings and sharpen her focus and energy without the unwanted side effects ofcaffeine.THE TWO-DAY MIRACLETwo days later, a miracle happened. It felt like a miracle to Tamara anyway. Shewent to the bathroom and afterward called Tana, in tears. “Tana! I had my firstnormal bowel movement in months! I can’t believe it! Can this be a result ofjust a change in diet? Surely this is a fluke. I know it is crazy to be thishappy about ‘normal poop’—but I’ve been living such a nightmare with thisembarrassing, exhausting, chronic diarrhea for so long, I just can’t tell youhow great this is to me!”Tana laughed and encouraged her sister, telling her, “Don’t worry, we’re notnearly done yet. This is only the beginning.” Within two months, Tamara had alsolost seventeen pounds. The goal had not been to lose weight per se. The goal wasto save Tamara’s health and possibly her life. But the by-product of weight losswas so much fun for Tamara, and her self-esteem soared along with her renewedenergy. “I can suck in my stomach now!” she says. “Before, I was always sobloated, I couldn’t even feel or find the muscles to contract them.”Tamara returned to her doctor, thrilled to tell her about her progress, assumingthe physician would give her high fives and ask what she’d done to turn herhealth around. To Tamara’s shock, it was as if the doctor didn’t hear anythingshe said. In fact the doctor said, “You are young and you need this medication.Diet alone won’t cure your issues. You will probably need to be on medicationfor the rest of your life.” Before leaving the office, Tamara asked for a copyof her latest blood work and left, still stunned about the absence ofencouragement from her physician.She called Tana and shared what had happened, explaining her reluctance to go onmedication when diet changes alone had accomplished so much, so fast. Then Tanaasked about the blood work. Tamara faxed it over, and within minutes Tana was onthe phone, her voice happy and excited. “Tamara, this is unbelievably good news.Your triglycerides have gone from 295 to 129. Your cholesterol has gone from 258to 201. Your blood pressure is now normal, dropped from 136/94. I can’t believeyour doctor didn’t share and rejoice in this improvement with you!”Tana continued, “I’m not telling you not to take the medicine. But let’sexperiment by continuing what you are doing, without meds, for another month.Then let’s revisit this.”THE FUTURE’S SO BRIGHT, SHE’S GONNA NEED SHADESWithin a month, Tamara had improved so much she was like a new person. Themedications still remain unopened, unused. Twenty pounds lighter now, she hasplenty of energy. When her husband was laid off recently from his job due toeconomic downturn, Tamara waited for the stress of that to sink her, but to hersurprise it didn’t. She was coping well. So well, in fact, she was able to get ajob as a waitress at a nice family restaurant—a job requiring lifting heavytrays and staying on her feet—to help with emergency income. In addition, she isalso regularly walking around a lake near her house with some of her girlfriendsfrom work, many of whom struggle with fibromyalgia-like symptoms and weightissues too. “I don’t preach to them,” says Tamara, “because I’m still learningtoo, but I know that watching my life has inspired them to make changes in theirhealth as well. And when they ask me, I’m ready with answers.”Hector is a fabulous cook and his specialties are spicy, flavorful Mexicandishes from his Hispanic heritage. Now he uses many of the same spices andflavors of the Southwest, but adds lots of veggies to his dishes and makes largefresh salads to go with them. The children easily adapted to a healthier way ofeating and especially love fresh fruit. As of this writing, Tamara looks andfeels dramatically younger than she did just seven months earlier. And not onlyTamara: Her new behavior has rubbed off on her children, and if she continues tomodel brain healthy nutrition she will have a positive effect on hergrandchildren as well.FOOD, LONGEVITY, BIZARRE TIMES, AND THE LITTLE LIESIf you want to live longer, look younger, and be healthier, happier, andsmarter, getting your food under control is critical. In fact, it may be themost important factor in increasing your longevity odds. Food is medicine, or aswe saw in Tamara’s case, it can be poison. The changes in her diet were criticalto her success and if she sticks with it for the long haul it will likely saveand extend her life.Getting your food under control in our current society is no small feat, as welive in a very bizarre time. Nearly everywhere we go we are being pounded by thewrong messages about food that will make us fat, depressed, and feebleminded.Look what we’re bombarded with:• Foot-long hot dogs at the ball park• Huge meal portions at restaurants• Food pushers who ask us to supersize everything for less money• Monster foods pushed by billboardsI was recently driving down the 405 freeway in Los Angeles when I saw abillboard for a huge fast-food sandwich.And, then, no lie, as I turned my head to the other side of the freeway I sawanother billboard for losing weight with Lap-Band.[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_024_r1.jpg]Indulge yourself, continually make bad decisions, and then pretty soon you oryour patients will need surgery to get your inner child under control. Soundspretty crazy. We need a better way, which is to start being smart about ournutrition and stop the lies that perpetuate illness.[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_025_r1.jpg]Here are some of the recent lies I have heard people tell themselves about whythey have to eat poor-quality food, and my response in parentheses:• “I can’t eat healthy because I travel.” (I am always amused by this one, as Itravel a lot for my public television shows. It just takes a little forethoughtand judgment when ordering.)• •“I work hard and eat out a lot.” (Probably not harder than me or many otherreally healthy people.)• “My whole family is fat; it is in my genes.” (This is one of the biggest lies.It is our behavior that triggers the expression of our genes. My genes too say Ishould be fat, but I do not give in to the behavior that would make me so.)• “My family won’t cooperate.” (If your family started to do cocaine or steal,would you join them? It is better if you eat healthy together, but ultimatelyyou are responsible for you.)• “It’s my boss’s fault.” (For the ineffective person, it is often someoneelse’s fault. When you take responsibility to be better, you are much morelikely to win.)• “It’s Easter, Memorial Day, the Fourth of July, Labor Day, Thanksgiving,Christmas, New Year’s Day, my birthday, my dog’s birthday. It is Monday,Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday.” (There is always areason to cheat, to celebrate, or to commiserate. You get healthy with food whenyou realize it is medicine or poison.)• “I’ll start tomorrow!” (I used to say this year after year, then realizedtomorrow never comes.)• “My son will only eat Cap’n Crunch for breakfast.” (I recently did an exercisewith my wife in which together we cleaned out the kitchen of a woman at ourchurch. She said she was mostly a vegetarian and ate a healthy diet. Hercabinets were loaded with bad foods. When we got to the Cap’n Crunch she told usthat was the only food her teenage son would eat for breakfast. “Really?” Iasked. “If you did not have Cap’n Crunch, he would starve?” At that point, sheturned her head away and said, “No. He would find something else that washealthy.” The little lies do not only hurt us, they hurt the people we love.)• “Good food is expensive.” (Being sick is really expensive. In fact, thecheapest food is the most expensive in terms of illness and lost productivity.)• “I would rather get Alzheimer’s disease, heart disease, cancer, or diabetesthan give up sugar.” (This one always shocks me. But I understand addiction.Certain combinations of fat, sugar, and salt actually work on the heroin centersof the brain and can be totally addictive.)You literally are what you eat. Throughout your lifetime, your body iscontinually making and renewing its cells, even brain cells. Your skin cellsmake themselves new every thirty days! So eating right can have a dramatic,positive impact on your skin in a short period of time. Food fuels cell growthand regeneration, so what you consume on a daily basis directly affects thehealth of your brain and body.In addition, you likely have already noticed how foods affect your mood andenergy level. Ever feel buzzed for an hour, then ready for a long winter’s napafter a Grande Americano? Have you ever felt shaky, foggy, headachy, or weakafter a breakfast of orange juice with pancakes drowned in syrup? How about thatstuffed feeling after you’ve eaten too much of anything, and just want to liedown and sleep it off? Too much white bread and protein, and an absence of freshfruit and vegetables, is constipation waiting to happen, which is one of thereason people struggle with a sluggish digestion when they travel. (Lack ofexercise is another.) They’re grabbing burgers on white bread or chicken nuggetsand downing them with a soft drink loaded with high-fructose corn syrup (or ayeasty beer) as they pick up their dinner at the drive-through or an airportkiosk. In short, if you want to feel old, weak, bloated, cranky, sleepy, andconstipated, this is the diet for you!CHEAT DAYS NOT REQUIRED OR ENCOURAGEDIf you want to feel and look happier, healthier, and younger in the future, be awarrior for the right nutrition. Cheating and cheat days are not required orencouraged. I am often amazed at the number of health programs that encouragecheat days. Since food can clearly be addictive, would it ever make sense totell any addict that it is okay to have cheat days? Imagine telling a cocaineaddict or smoker or alcoholic to have cheat days. That could trigger a relapse.What about a sex addict? Would it be okay for her to take a day off and grab afew prostitutes? Will that help reset her metabolism? Use your brain, and goodcommon sense, to change your age.SEVEN RULES FOR BRAIN HEALTHY EATING FOR THE LONG RUNOver the years I have been able to distill our message about brain healthynutrition into seven simple rules. If you follow them, food will become yourlongevity medicine.1. Eat high-quality calories and not too many of them.2. Drink plenty of water and avoid liquid calories.3. Eat high-quality lean protein.4. Eat “smart” (low-glycemic, high-fiber) carbohydrates.5. Limit fat consumption to healthy fats, especially those containing omega-3s.6. Eat natural foods of many different colors to boost antioxidants.7. Cook with brain healthy herbs and spices.RULE 1. EAT HIGH-QUALITY CALORIES AND NOT TOO MANY OF THEMMy wife will tell you that I am not cheap, but I always want great value for themoney I spend. I think of calories the same way. I always want high-qualitynutrition that serves my mind and body. You should too. I want you to think ofeating and drinking only high-quality calories and not too many of them. Thereis extensive research on this concept for longevity. Restricting calories notonly helps you control weight, but it decreases the risk for heart disease,cancer, diabetes, and stroke. Even better, restricting calories triggers certainmechanisms in the body to increase the production of nerve growth factors, whichare beneficial to the brain. To get the most out of your food, think CROND(calorie restricted, optimally nutritious, and delicious). This means that onceyou figure out how many calories are optimal for you to maintain your weight (orlose weight if needed), each of those calories needs to be jam-packed withnutrition. The other benefit of eating nutrition-laden foods in moderation isthat they are naturally more filling. So don’t let calorie restriction make youthink “starving” or even “hungry”—because if you eat well, the fiber and proteinand clean fresh water will keep you plenty satiated; and you’ll also feel light,lean, and energetic.Another one of the little lies professionals will tell you is that you do notneed to count your calories. Of course you do if you want to stay healthy. Notcounting your calories is like not knowing how much money you have in the bankwhile you continue to spend, spend, spend until your body becomes bankrupt. Byknowing what you are putting into your body and using the CROND principle, youare much more likely to be healthy and live longer.The average fifty-year-old woman needs about 1,800 calories a day to maintainher weight, and the average fifty-year-old man needs 2,200 calories a day. Ofcourse, it will vary depending on height and activity level. Go towww.amenclinics.com [http://www.amenclinics.com] for a free calorie calculator.Attitude here is critical. If you become a calorie value spender you can eatgreat food and feel more than satisfied and avoid foods that hurt you. Thetypical Western diet of bad fat, salt, and sugar (think cheeseburgers, fries,and sodas) promotes inflammation and has been associated by itself withdepression, ADD, dementia, heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and obesity. But ifyou start making better choices today you will quickly notice that you have moreenergy, better focus, a better memory, better moods, and a slimmer, sexierwaistline. A number of new studies have reported that a healthy diet isassociated with dramatically lower risks of Alzheimer’s disease and depression.What really surprised me when I decided to get healthy, and really learned aboutfood, my food choices got better, not worse.It was the start of a wonderful relationship with food. I was no longer a slaveto foods that were hurting me. I used to be like a yo-yo. Crave bad food…overeat it …feel lousy …then hate myself in the process. It was way too muchdrama. Since I have been on my program, I have never eaten better and it affectseverything in my life in a positive way. My wife, Tana, has written severalamazing cookbooks to help people get thinner, smarter, and happier, and ofcourse I get to try everything first. I love her lentil soup and stuffed bellpeppers, think of berry nutty quinoa as dessert, and feel smarter with freshwild salmon. I don’t want fast food anymore because it makes me tired andstupid. Now I want the right food that makes me smarter. And, contrary to whatmost people think, eating in a brain healthy way is not more expensive—it isless expensive. My medical bills are lower and my productivity has gone way up.And what price can you put on feeling amazing? Be smart. Use food as medicinethat heals you.RULE 2. DRINK PLENTY OF WATER AND AVOID LIQUID CALORIESYour brain is 80 percent water. Anything that dehydrates it, such as too muchcaffeine or alcohol, decreases your thinking and impairs your judgment. Makesure you get plenty of filtered water every day. On a trip to New York Cityrecently I saw a poster that read “Are You Pouring on the Pounds …Don’t DrinkYourself Fat.” I thought it was brilliant. A recent study found that, onaverage, Americans drink 450 calories a day, twice as many as we did thirtyyears ago. Just adding the extra 225 calories a day will put 23 pounds of fat ayear to your body, and most people tend not to count the calories they drink.Did you know that some coffee drinks or some cocktails, such as margaritas, cancost you more than 700 calories? One very simple strategy to get your caloriesunder control to live longer is to eliminate most of the calories you drink. Myfavorite drink is water mixed with a little lemon juice and a little bit of thenatural sweetener stevia. It tastes like lemonade, so I feel like I’m spoilingmyself, and it has virtually no calories.Proper hydration is a very important rule of good nutrition. Even slightdehydration increases the body’s stress hormones. When this happens, you getirritable, and you don’t think as well. Over time, increased levels of stresshormones are associated with memory problems and obesity. Dehydration also makesyour skin look older and more wrinkled. Water also helps to cleanse the body ofimpurities and toxins.Make sure your water is clean. Having a water filter on your drinking waterfaucets at home and only drinking from phthalate and BPA-free water bottles isbest.Be aware that not all liquids are created equal. It is best to drink liquidsthat are low in calories or have none at all and that are free of artificialsweeteners, sugar, caffeine, and alcohol. I also encourage my patients to drinkgreen tea (unsweetened or lightly sweetened with stevia) two or three times aday. Caffeinated green tea has half the calories of coffee, so it is notterrible. Decaffeinated green tea is an alternative if you are eliminatingcaffeine from your diet (which is a good choice for many people). Researchersfrom China found that when people drank two to three cups of green tea a day,their DNA actually looked younger than that of those who did not.RULE 3. EAT HIGH-QUALITY LEAN PROTEINProtein helps balance your blood sugar and provides the necessary buildingblocks for brain health. Protein contains L-tyrosine, an amino acid that isimportant in the synthesis of brain neurotransmitters. Found in foods like meat,poultry, fish, and tofu, it is the precursor to dopamine, epinephrine, andnorepinephrine, which are critical for balancing mood and energy. It is alsohelpful in the process of producing thyroid hormones, which are important inmetabolism and energy production. Tyrosine supplementation has been shown toimprove cognitive performance under periods of stress and fatigue. Stress tendsto deplete the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, and tyrosine is the amino acidbuilding block to replenish it.Also found in protein is L-tryptophan, an amino acid building block forserotonin. L-tryptophan is found in meat, eggs, and milk. Increasing intake ofL-tryptophan is very helpful for some people in stabilizing mood, improvingmental clarity and sleep, and decreasing aggressiveness.Eating protein-rich foods like fish, chicken, and beef also provides the aminoacid glutamine, which serves as the precursor to the neurotransmitter GABA(gamma-aminobutyric acid). GABA is reported in the herbal literature to work inmuch the same way as antianxiety drugs and anticonvulsants. It helps stabilizenerve cells by decreasing their tendency to fire erratically or excessively.This means it has a calming effect for people who struggle with temper,irritability, and anxiety.Great sources of lean protein include fish, skinless turkey, chicken, and leanbeef (hormone free, antibiotic free, free range), beans, raw nuts, high-proteingrains, and high-protein vegetables, such as broccoli and spinach. Did you knowthat spinach is nearly 50 percent protein? I use it instead of lettuce on mysandwiches for a huge nutrition boost.It is especially important to eat protein at breakfast because it increasesattention and focus, which we need for work or school. Eating carbohydratesboosts serotonin in the brain, which induces relaxation, and that makes you wantto sleep through your morning meetings. In the United States, we have itbackward. We tend to eat high-carbohydrate cereal, pancakes, or bagels forbreakfast and a big steak for dinner. Doing the opposite may be a smarter movefor your brain. I love the idea of using food to fuel your ability to focus orrelax. If I need to work at night I will increase my protein. If it has been astressful day, I am more likely to eat a higher concentration of carbohydratesto calm my brain.RULE 4. EAT “SMART” (LOW-GLYCEMIC, HIGH-FIBER) CARBOHYDRATESEat carbohydrates that do not spike your blood sugar and are high in fiber, suchas whole grains, vegetables, and fruits like blueberries and apples.Carbohydrates are not the enemy. They are essential to your life. Badcarbohydrates are the enemy. These are carbohydrates that have been robbed ofany nutritional value, such as simple sugars and refined carbohydrates.Get to know the glycemic index (GI). The glycemic index rates carbohydratesaccording to their effects on blood sugar. It is ranked on a scale from 1 to100-plus with the low-glycemic foods having a low number (which means they donot spike your blood sugar, so they are generally healthier for you) and thehigh-glycemic foods having a high number (which means they quickly elevate yourblood sugar, so they are generally not as healthy for you).Eating a diet that is filled with low-glycemic foods will lower your bloodglucose levels and decrease cravings. The important concept to remember is thathigh blood sugar is bad for your brain, and ultimately your longevity.Be careful when going by GI to choose your foods. Some low-glycemic foods aren’tgood for you. For example, in the following list, you might notice that peanutM&Ms have a GI of 33 while steel-cut oatmeal has a GI of about 52. Does thismean that it’s better for you to eat peanut M&Ms? No! Peanut M&Ms are loadedwith sugar, saturated fat, artificial food coloring, and other things that arenot brain healthy. Steel-cut oatmeal is a high-fiber food that helps regulateyour blood sugar for hours. Use your brain when choosing your food.In general, vegetables, fruits, legumes, and nuts are the best low-GI options. Adiet rich in low-GI foods not only helps you lose weight, it has also been foundto help control diabetes, according to a 2010 review of the scientificliterature in the British Journal of Nutrition. Be aware, however, that somefoods that sound healthy actually have a high GI. For example, some fruits likewatermelon and pineapple have a high ranking. It is wise to consume more fruitson the low end of the spectrum. Similarly, some starches like potatoes and rice,and some high-fiber products like whole wheat bread, are on the high end of thelist. Eating smaller portions of these foods and combining them with leanproteins and healthy fats can reduce their impact on blood sugar levels.The following list of foods and their GI is culled from numerous sources,including a 2008 review of nearly twenty-five hundred individual food items byresearchers at the Institute of Obesity, Nutrition and Exercise in Sydney,Australia. Make a copy of this list and keep it with you when you go groceryshopping.GLYCEMIC INDEX (GI)Low GI 55 and under Medium GI 56–69 High GI 70 and aboveGLYCEMIC INDEX RATINGSGrainsGlycemic Index White bread75 ± 2 Whole wheat bread74 ± 2 White rice72 ± 8Bagel, white69 Brown rice66 ± 5 Couscous65 ± 4 Basmati rice57 ± 4 Quinoa53Pumpernickel bread41 Barley, pearled25 ± 2Breakfast FoodsGlycemic Index Scones92 ± 8 Instant oatmeal79 ± 3 Cornflakes77Waffles76 Froot Loops69 ± 9 Pancakes66 ± 9 Kashi Seven Whole65 ± 10 GrainPuffs Bran muffin60 Blueberry muffin59 Steel-cut oatmeal52 ± 4 Kellogg’sAll-Bran38FruitGlycemic Index (raw unless otherwise noted)  Dates, dried103 ± 21 Watermelon80 ± 3 Pineapple66 ± 7 Cantaloupe65 Raisins64 ±11 Kiwi58 ± 7 Mango51 ± 5 Banana, overripe48 Grapes43 Nectarines43 ± 6 Banana,underripe42 Oranges45 ± 4 Blueberries40 Strawberries40 ± 7 Plums39 Pears38 ± 2Apples36 ± 5 Apricots34 ± 3 Peach28 Grapefruit25 Cherries22VegetablesGlycemic Index Baked potato86 ± 6 Sweet potato70 ± 6 Sweet corn52 ± 5Peas51 ± 6 Carrots, boiled39 ± 4 Artichoke15 Asparagus15 Broccoli15Cauliflower15 Celery15 Cucumber15 Eggplant15 Green beans15 Lettuce15 Peppers15Snow peas15 Spinach15 Squash15 Tomatoes15 Zucchini15Legumes and NutsGlycemic Index Baked beans, canned40 ± 3 Chickpeas36 ± 5 Pintobeans33 Butter beans32 ± 3 Lentils29 ± 3 Cashews25 ± 1 Mixed nuts24 ± 10 Kidneybeans22 ± 3BeveragesGlycemic Index Gatorade89 ± 12 orange flavor Rice milk79 ± 8Coca-Cola63 Cranberry juice59 Orange juice50 ± 2 Soy milk44 ± 5 Apple juice,41 unsweetened Milk, full fat41 ± 2 Skim milk32 Tomato juice31Snack productsGlycemic Index Tofu-based frozen115 ± 14 dessert Pretzels83 ±9 Puffed rice cakes82 ± 10 Jelly beans80 ± 8 Licorice78 ± 11 Pirate’s Booty70 ±5 Angel food cake67 Popcorn65 ± 5 Water crackers63 ± 9 Ice cream62 ± 9 Potatochips56 ± 3 Snickers bar51 Milk chocolate, Dove45 ± 8 Corn chips42 ± 4 Low-fatyogurt33 ± 3 M&Ms, peanut33 ± 3 Dark chocolate, Dove23 ± 3 Greek-style yogurt12± 4 Hummus6 ± 4Choose high-fiber carbohydrates. High-fiber foods are one of your best longevityweapons. Years of research have found that the more fiber you eat, the betterfor your health and weight. How does dietary fiber fight fat? First, it helpsregulate the appetite hormone ghrelin, which tells you that you are hungry.Ghrelin levels are often out of whack in people with a high BMI so you alwaysfeel hungry no matter how much you eat. New research shows that high ghrelinlevels not only make you feel hungrier, they also increase the desire forhigh-calorie foods compared to low-calorie fare, so it’s a double whammy. Butfiber can help. A 2009 study showed that eating a diet high in fiber helpedbalance ghrelin levels, which can turn off the constant hunger and reduce theappeal of high-calorie foods that kill you early. Second, no matter how much youweigh, eating fiber helps you feel full longer so you don’t get the munchies anhour after you eat. Third, fiber slows the absorption of food into thebloodstream, which helps balance your blood sugar and lowers the risk fordiabetes. In fact, fiber takes so long to be digested by your body, a personeating 20–35 g fiber a day will burn an extra 150 calories a day or lose 16extra pounds a year.These three things alone can go a long way in helping you live longer.Fiber-friendly foods boast a number of other health benefits as well, including:• Reducing cholesterol• Keeping your digestive tract moving• Reducing high blood pressure• Reducing the risk of cancerExperts recommend eating 25–35 g fiber a day, but research shows that mostadults fall far short of that. So how can you boost your fiber intake? Eat morehigh-fiber brain healthy foods like fruits, vegetables, legumes, and wholegrains. Here are the fiber contents of some brain healthy foods. Try to includesome of the foods on this list at every meal or snack.FoodGrams of Fiber Kidney beans (1 cup canned)16.4 Split peas (1 cup cooked)16.4Lentils (1 cup cooked)15.6 Black beans (1 cup canned)15.0 Garbanzo beans (1 cupcanned)10.6 Peas (1 cup frozen cooked)8.8 Raspberries (1 cup)8.0 Blackberries (1cup)7.6 Spinach (1 cup cooked)7.0 (1 cup raw)0.7 Brussels sprouts (1 cupcooked)6.4 Broccoli (1 cup cooked)5.6 Pear (1 medium w/skin)5.1 Sweet potato (1medium baked)4.8 Carrots (1 cup cooked)4.6 (1 medium raw)2.0 Blueberries (1cup)3.5 Strawberries (1 cup)3.3 Apple (1 medium w/skin)3.3 Banana (1 medium)3.1Orange (1 medium)3.1 Asparagus (1 cup cooked)3.0 Grapefruit (½ medium)2.0Avocado (1 ounce)1.9 Whole wheat bread (1 slice)1.9 Walnuts (7 whole)1.9 Plums(2 medium)1.8 Peach (1 medium with skin)1.5 Tomato (½ cup fresh)1.5 Cherries (10large)1.4 Oatmeal (¾ cup cooked)0.8 Almonds (6 whole)0.8Source: Adapted from U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural ResearchService, 2004. USDA Nutritional Nutrient Database for Standard Reference,Release 17.Steer clear of bad carbohydrates. These are carbohydrates that have been robbedof any nutritional value, such as simple sugars and refined carbohydrates likemuffins, scones, cakes, cookies, and other baked goods. If you want to livewithout cravings, eliminate these completely from your diet. I like the oldsaying “The whiter the bread, the faster you are dead.”Sugar is not your friend. We have often heard of sugar being called “emptycalories.” In fact, it is so damaging to your brain and body that I call itanti-nutrition or toxic calories. Sugar increases inflammation in your body,increases erratic brain cell firing, and sends your blood sugar levels on aroller-coaster ride. Moreover, new research shows that sugar is addictive andcan even be more addictive than cocaine.That helps explain why we eat so much of it. Americans consume an average of22.2 teaspoons of sugar a day, which adds up to 355 calories a day. That’s anincrease of 19 percent since 1970.Table sugar isn’t the only culprit making you fat. Research shows thathigh-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), which is found in many sodas and accounts foras much as 40 percent of the caloric sweeteners used in the United States, iseven more fattening than table sugar.HFCS and sugar went head to head in a 2010 study from researchers at PrincetonUniversity. Compared with rats that drank water sweetened with table sugar, ratsthat drank water sweetened with HFCS gained significantly more body weight,including more fat around the belly, even though they consumed the same numberof calories. Every single one of the rats drinking the HFCS became obese. Aftersix months, the rats guzzling the HFCS showed signs of a dangerous conditionknown in humans as the metabolic syndrome, including weight gain, abdominal fat,and high triglycerides.Put down the sodas and HFCS, now!A lot of people ask me, “Isn’t it okay to have sweets in moderation?”Personally, I don’t agree with the people who say “Everything in moderation.”Cocaine or arsenic in moderation is not a good idea. Sugar in moderationtriggers cravings. The less sugar in your life the better your life will be.Reach for a banana or an apple instead.Cutting down on the sweet stuff is a good start, but sugar lurks in a lot ofother processed foods as well like ketchup, barbecue sauce, and salad dressing.Start reading food labels. At first, you might feel like you’re reading aforeign language—sorbitol, maltose, maltodextrin, galactose: these are just someof the many names for sugar used on food labels.RULE 5. LIMIT FAT CONSUMPTION TO HEALTHY FATS, ESPECIALLY THOSE CONTAININGOMEGA-3SHealthy fats are important to a good diet because the solid weight of the brainis 60 percent fat! The one hundred billion nerve cells in your brain needessential fatty acids to function. Focus your diet on healthy fats, especiallythose that contain omega-3 fatty acids, found in foods like salmon, tuna,mackerel, avocados, walnuts, and green leafy vegetables.How omega-3 fatty acids help you get thinner, smarter, and happier. The two moststudied omega-3 fatty acids are eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoicacid (DHA). DHA makes up a large portion of the gray matter of the brain. Thefat in your brain forms cell membranes and plays a vital role in how our cellsfunction. Neurons are also rich in omega-3 fatty acids. EPA improves blood flow,which boosts overall brain function.Low levels of omega-3 fatty acids have been associated with depression, anxiety,obesity, ADD, suicide, and an increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease anddementia. There is also scientific evidence that low levels of omega-3 fattyacids play a role in substance abuse, and I would argue that overeating is aform of substance abuse.Boosting omega-3 fatty acids in your diet is one of the best things you can dofor your weight, mood, brainpower, and longevity. In a fascinating 2009 study inthe British Journal of Nutrition, Australian researchers analyzed blood samplesfrom 124 adults (21 healthy weight, 40 overweight, and 63 obese), calculatedtheir BMI, and measured their waist and hip circumference. They found that obeseindividuals had significantly lower levels of EPA and DHA compared withhealthy-weight people. Subjects with higher levels were more likely to have ahealthy BMI and waist and hip measurements.Research in the last few years has revealed that diets rich in omega-3 fattyacids may help promote a healthy emotional balance and positive mood in lateryears, possibly because DHA is a main component of the brain’s synapses. Agrowing body of scientific evidence indicates that fish oil helps ease symptomsof depression. One twenty-year study involving 3,317 men and women found thatpeople with the highest consumption of EPA and DHA were less likely to havesymptoms of depression. People in Japan have the lowest levels of depression,and they eat the most fish. North Americans have high levels of depression, andwe eat low amounts of fish.There is a tremendous amount of scientific evidence pointing to a connectionbetween the consumption of fish that is rich in omega-3 fatty acids andcognitive function. A Danish team of researchers compared the diets of 5,386healthy older individuals and found that the more fish in a person’s diet, thelonger the person was able to maintain their memory and reduce the risk ofdementia. Dr. J. A. Conquer and colleagues from the University of Guelph inOntario, Canada, studied the blood fatty acid content in the early and laterstages of dementia and noted low levels when compared with healthy people.Eating fish also benefits cognitive performance. A study from Swedishresearchers that surveyed nearly five thousand fifteen-year-old boys found thatthose who ate fish more than once a week scored higher on standard intelligencetests than teens who ate no fish. A follow-up study found that teens eating fishmore than once a week also had better grades at school than students with lowerfish consumption. Other benefits of omega-3 fatty acids include improvingattention in people with ADD and reducing the risk for psychosis.FOODS HIGH IN OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS• Anchovies• Broccoli• Brussels sprouts• Cabbage• Cauliflower• Cod• Flaxseeds• Halibut• Mackerel• Salmon, wild• Sardines• Scallops• Shrimp• Snapper• Soybeans• Spinach• Tofu• Trout• Tuna• WalnutsEliminate bad fats. While healthy fats enhance brainpower and help you loseweight, bad fats drain your brain. Eating too many saturated fats or trans fats,also known as “Frankenfats,” contributes to obesity and cognitive decline. Transfats are used to help foods have a longer shelf life and are found in margarine,cakes, crackers, cookies, and potato chips. They decrease your shelf life!RULE 6. EAT NATURAL FOODS OF MANY DIFFERENT COLORS TO BOOST ANTIOXIDANTSThis means you should eat all the colors of the rainbow. Eat blue foods(blueberries), red foods (pomegranates, strawberries, raspberries, cherries, redbell peppers, and tomatoes), yellow foods (squash, yellow bell peppers, smallportions of bananas, and peaches), orange foods (oranges, tangerines, and yams),green foods (spinach, broccoli, and peas), purple foods (plums), and so on.This will boost the antioxidant levels in your body and help keep your brainyoung. Several studies have found that eating foods rich in antioxidants, whichinclude many fruits and vegetables, significantly reduces the risk of developingcognitive impairment.Blueberries are very high in antioxidants, which has earned them the nickname“brain berries” among neuroscientists. In laboratory studies, rats that ateblueberries showed a better ability to learn new motor skills and gainedprotection against strokes. That is not all. In one study, rats that ate a dietrich in blueberries lost abdominal fat, lowered cholesterol, and improvedglucose levels. Similar studies showed that rats that consumed strawberries andspinach also gained significant protection.Eating fruits and vegetables from the rainbow, along with fish, legumes, andnuts is part of what is known as the Mediterranean diet. Research has found thateating a Mediterranean diet can make you not only happier but smarter too. Aseries of studies from Spanish researchers revealed that adherence to this typeof eating plan helps prevent depression. A team of scientists in Bordeaux,France, concluded that a Mediterranean diet slows cognitive decline and reducesthe risk for dementia.Of course, eating from the rainbow does not mean indulging in Skittles or jellybeans.FRUITS AND VEGETABLES WITH HIGH ANTIOXIDANT LEVELS• Acai berries• Avocados• Beets• Blackberries• Blueberries• Broccoli• Brussels sprouts• Cherries• Cranberries• Kiwis• Oranges• Plums• Pomegranates• Raspberries• Red bell peppers• Red grapes• Spinach• StrawberriesRULE 7. COOK WITH BRAIN HEALTHY HERBS AND SPICESCutting calories while keeping taste and pleasure high is made much easier bythe creative use of spices. Spices not only increase the flavor of foods withoutadding salt, but most of them have wonderful de-aging and health-boostingproperties. It only takes a teaspoon of spices to add a powerful, concentratedantioxidant punch to your health profile. Try these ten brain healthy spices tohelp keep you young:Turmeric Found in curry, turmeric contains a chemical that has been shown todecrease the plaques in the brain thought to be responsible for Alzheimer’sdisease.Saffron In three studies, a saffron extract was found to be as effective asantidepressant medication in treating people with major depression.Sage Sage has very good scientific evidence that it helps boost memory.Cinnamon Cinnamon has been shown to help attention and it helps regulate bloodsugar, which decreases cravings. Also, cinnamon is a natural aphrodisiac formen—not that most men need much help.Basil This potent antioxidant improves blood flow to the heart and brain and hasanti-inflammatory properties that offer protection from Alzheimer’s disease.Thyme Supplementing the diet with thyme has been shown to increase the amount ofDHA—an essential fatty acid—in the brain.Oregano Dried oregano has thirty times the brain-healing antioxidant power ofraw blueberries, forty-six times more than apples, and fifty-six times as muchas strawberries, making it one of the most powerful brain cell protectors on theplanet.Garlic Garlic promotes better blood flow to the brain and killed brain cancercells in a 2007 study.Ginger Can ginger make you smarter? A study that combined ginger with ginkgobiloba suggests that it does. Ginger root extract may also be helpful in thetreatment of Parkinson’s disease and migraine headaches.Rosemary A 2006 study reported that rosemary diminishes cognitive decline inpeople with dementia.MORE WAYS TO HELP YOU AND YOUR BRAIN LIVE LONGERLIMIT CAFFEINEMost of us associate caffeine with coffee, but it can also be found in tea, darksodas, chocolate, energy drinks, and pep pills. If your caffeine intake islimited to one or two normal-size cups of coffee or two or three cups of tea aday, it probably is not a problem. But any more than that can cause problems.Why?Caffeine restricts blood flow to the brain. Anything that compromises blood flowleads to premature aging.Caffeine dehydrates the brain and body. This makes it harder to think quickly.Remember, your brain is 80 percent water and needs adequate hydration.Caffeine interferes with sleep. Sleep is essential for good brain health,appetite control, and skin rejuvenation. Caffeine disrupts sleep patternsbecause it blocks adenosine, a chemical that tells us when it is time to hit thehay. When this chemical is blocked, we tend to sleep less, which leads to sleepdeprivation. And when we aren’t getting enough sleep, we feel like we absolutelymust have that cup of joe in the morning in order to jump-start our day.Caffeine can be addictive in high amounts. When you try to kick the habit, youare likely to experience withdrawal symptoms, including severe headaches,fatigue, and irritability.Caffeine can accelerate heart rate and raise blood pressure. In some people,drinking too much caffeine leads to a temporary spike in blood pressure and aracing heart.Caffeine can give you the jitters. Ingesting more caffeine than you normally docan leave you feeling jittery and nervous.Caffeine increases muscle tension. Tight muscles have been linked to caffeineintake.Caffeine can cause an upset stomach. Gastrointestinal troubles are common withexcessive caffeine use.Caffeine can elevate inflammatory markers. Two studies showed that 200 mgcaffeine (equivalent to two cups of coffee) raised homocysteine levels, a markerfor inflammation and heart disease.Caffeine can interfere with fertility. Pregnant women should be careful withcaffeine because it has been associated with premature births, birth defects,inability to conceive, low birth weight, and miscarriage.To be fair, there are also a number of studies suggesting that coffee can behelpful for you. It has been shown to decrease the plaques that causeAlzheimer’s disease, lower the risk for Parkinson’s disease, and lower the riskof colon cancer and diabetes. It may be other substances in the coffee, not justthe caffeine, that are actually helpful, and decaffeinated varieties may giveyou the benefits without the troubles noted above. A Harvard University studyfound that those drinking decaffeinated coffee also showed a reduced diabetesrisk, though it was half as much as those drinking caffeinated coffee. Anotherstudy, however, found that caffeine reduced insulin sensitivity and raised bloodsugar—both bad news for you. Watch how your body responds to caffeine and keepit to a minimum.EAT SUPER BRAIN FOODSUnless you’ve been living in isolation for the past ten years, you’ve probablyheard about antioxidants, which neutralize the production of free radicals inthe body; free radicals, if left to themselves, can do any number of dirtytricks to your body. Cancer, aging too fast, and lowered immunity to alldiseases are just a few things that can happen unless we load up on oursuperhero foods that are full of antioxidants. Foods rich in antioxidantsinclude a variety of fruits and vegetables.Scientists have recently reported the first evidence that eating blueberries,strawberries, and acai berries may help the aging brain stay healthy in acrucial but previously unrecognized way. Their study concluded that berries, andpossibly walnuts, activate the brain’s natural “housekeeper” mechanism, whichcleans up and recycles toxic proteins linked to age-related memory loss andother mental decline. We’ve known from past studies that old lab rats fed fortwo months on diets containing 2 percent high-antioxidant strawberry, blueberry,or blackberry extract showed a reversal of age-related deficits in nervefunction, memory, and learning behaviors. But in this new study, researchersfound out that berries help the aging microglia (think brooms that have gonesoft and don’t work well anymore) perk up and clean up the bad brain debris thatleads to aging.An apple a day may indeed keep the doctor away. Scientists are reporting thatconsuming a healthful antioxidant substance in apples extends the average lifespan of test animals—by 10 percent. The researchers found that apple polyphenolsnot only prolonged the average life span of fruit flies but also helped preservetheir ability to walk, climb, and move about. In addition, apple polyphenolsreversed the biological markers for age-related deterioration and approachingdeath. In another study, women who often ate apples had a 13–22 percent decreasein the risk of heart disease.I’ve mentioned studies on just two kinds of fruit here: berries and apples.There are hundreds of studies on the antioxidant, antiaging values of hundredsof fruits and vegetables. Mom was right to urge us to eat them.When it comes to antioxidants, consider Tana’s advice to Tamara: “Turn yourfridge into a rainbow.” Eating fruits and vegetables of many different colorswill ensure that you are getting a wide variety of antioxidants to nourish andprotect your brain. (Tana’s cookbook Eat Healthy with the Brain Doctor’s Wifehas fabulous recipes that make use of the best in brain foods.)REDUCE SALT AND INCREASE POTASSIUMReducing salt, especially the sort of salt found in processed foods, is anotherimportant health measure. Using sea salt, because it is rich in minerals andmore flavorful than regular table salt, to season your own fresh food is a goodidea. Canned vegetables, like corn, tend to have much more salt than you’d useif you cooked up fresh or frozen corn and lightly sprinkled it with sea salt.Most people end up using less of it than regular salt because it packs such aflavor punch. Simply buying more fresh or frozen vegetables instead of cannedones can help cut your sodium intake significantly. The same is true forpreflavored or marinated meats. Avoid these and make your own. It won’t take buta few seconds to whip up a marinade that tastes a hundred times better and hassignificantly less salt than prepackaged, preseasoned meats.Also consider adding potassium to your diet. A recent study found that eatingtwice as much potassium as sodium can cut the risk of dying from heart diseasein half. A 1997 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association thatreviewed the results of thirty-three clinical trials found that individuals whotook potassium supplements lowered their blood pressure. Foods high in potassiuminclude bananas, spinach, honeydew melon, kiwi, lima beans, oranges, tomatoes,and all meats.ALLOW SNACKINGIf anybody has ever told you to avoid snacking throughout the day, don’t listen!Going too long without eating can wreak havoc on your brain function and makeyour blood sugar levels drop too low. Low blood sugar levels are associated withpoor impulse control and irritability. It can also cause emotional stress insome people.Eating approximately every 2.5–3 hours throughout the day can help balance yourblood sugar. This isn’t a license to gorge all day long. When snacking, opt forlow-calorie foods and include a balance of protein, complex carbs, and goodfats, if possible. Personally, I love to snack. Since I travel frequently, I’velearned to pack brain healthy snacks for the road. Otherwise, I am tempted tograb candy bars from the airport gift shop. One of my favorite low-caloriesnacks is dried fruits, without any added sugar or preservatives, and fresh rawvegetables. I add a few nuts or some low-fat string cheese to balance out thecarbohydrates in the fruits and vegetables with a little protein and fat. Bewary when buying dried fruits and vegetables—many brands add sugar,preservatives, or other ingredients, which renders them less than healthy. Readthe food labels. Look for brands that don’t add anything.Here are a few more of my favorite midmorning or midafternoon snacks:• Chopped veggies and hummus• Fresh guacamole and red bell peppers• Celery with almond butter• Apple slices or a banana with almond butter• Unsweetened yogurt and blueberries with a little stevia• Deviled eggs with hummus (discard the yolk)• Turkey and apple slices with a few almonds• Steamed edamame• Fresh guacamole on sprouted grain toast• Homemade turkey jerkyRECOGNIZE FOOD ALLERGIESMany people know that food allergies can cause hives, itching, eczema, nausea,diarrhea, and, in severe cases, shock or constriction of the airways, which canmake it difficult to breathe and can be fatal. But can certain foods and foodadditives also cause emotional, behavioral, or learning problems? You bet. Thesetypes of reactions are called “hidden” food allergies, and they could behampering your efforts for a better body. Tana and her sister, Tamara, are bothclassic examples of this. Both react severely to gluten and to dairy. I had onepatient who found he got extremely angry after eating MSG (monosodiumglutamate). It is always a good idea to ask yourself what you ate beforeexperiencing negative emotions or off-kilter physical symptoms.As far as food allergies go, the most common culprits are peanuts, milk, eggs,soy, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, and wheat. These eight foods account for 90percent of all food-allergic reactions. Other foods commonly associated withallergies include corn, chocolate, tea, coffee, sugar, yeast, citrus fruits,pork, rye, beef, tomato, and barley.Physical symptoms that might tip you off to a food allergy or sensitivityinclude dark circles under the eyes, puffy eyes, headaches or migraines, redears, fatigue, joint pain, chronic sinus problems (congestion or runny nose), orgastrointestinal issues. Behavioral problems that can be caused by foods includeaggression, sleep problems, lack of concentration, and changes in speechpatterns (turning into a motormouth or slurring words).When a food allergy or food sensitivity is suspected, a medical professional mayrecommend an elimination diet such as the “gorilla diet” that Tana recommendedfor Tamara. An elimination diet removes all common problem foods for a period ofone or more weeks. These diets aren’t easy to follow because they’re veryrestrictive. However, if you’ve been miserable from potential food reactions fora long time, the fact that you may begin to feel better soon (as in Tamara’scase) helps with the motivation needed to stay on the restrictive diet for awhile. After the initial diet period, potential allergens are reintroduced oneby one. Foods that cause abnormal behaviors or physical symptoms should bepermanently eliminated from the diet. Working with a nutritionist may make a bigdifference. For a long while, if Tamara ate so much as a piece of bread, hermiseries would return. But now that she’s doing so much better and healing well,she can get away with a small amount of her husband’s incredible Spanish ricenow and then. But it is a treat—she eats a small portion and she doesn’t eat itoften.HORMONES, ORGANICS, AND SAFE LISTS …OH MY!There is rising concern about pesticides, used on plants for food, causingendocrine disruption, meaning that the residual pesticides appear to be changinghormone levels in our populations. This concern is compounded by the use ofhormones in the dairy and beef industry in order to increase milk production and“beef up” the cattle. The most common problem is that foods now have too many“estrogenic” properties, causing some feminization in males, such as less spermproduction, less sex drive, and prostate problems. In women, we are seeing arise in early puberty and menopause. For these reasons, it is a good idea tochoose hormone-free and organic foods whenever possible. Also, eatingomega-3-rich foods, exercise, and consuming lots of fruits and vegetables willhelp flush excess estrogen out of your system.The following lists from the Environmental Working Group contain the mostcontaminated “dirty dozen” foods (you should buy their organic counterpartsinstead) and those that are least contaminated. Keeping these lists handy whileshopping can help stretch your budget, so you can use your dollars wisely.TWELVE MOST CONTAMINATED FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 1. Celery 2. Peaches 3. Strawberries 4.

On the one hand, nutritionists are encouraging us to eat fish,but they are also cautioning us about the mercury levels in some of the fish,which if eaten too often or in great quantities, could be cause for concern. Fora downloadable pocket guide to the safest fish in your area of the country go tohttp://www.montereybayaquarium.org [http://www.montereybayaquarium.org] andclick on “Seafood Watch.” Here are a couple of general rules of thumb that arehelpful: (1) the larger the fish, the more mercury it may contain, so go for thesmaller varieties; and (2) from the safe fish choices, eat a fairly wide varietyof fish, preferably those high in omega-3s.

How can one eat healthy and stay onbudget too? Here are some tips from our online community participants:• “I’ve become very freezer-happy lately as we’ve cut back on our food costs. IfI see something about to go bad, I figure out a way to freeze it so we haveminimal waste. During those times when I’m stretching the groceries, I may runout of fresh produce, but I usually can hit up my freezer for a meal or two thathas plenty of veggies in it, rather than living off canned food and pantrystaples to get us through to the next paycheck.”• “When choosing organic, I spend $$ on the dirty dozen and buy non-organic fromleast contaminated list.”• “I buy frozen organic blueberries in bulk.”• “I try to buy in season from farmers’ markets; then I’ll freeze fresh produceif it is less expensive than frozen at that time.”• “I shop the Manager’s Special section for great deals on fruits & veggies forjuicing or using in smoothies or to put in the evening’s dinner.”• “Though we don’t eat much meat, I have friends who buy whole or half a cow orpig from a nearby farmer that doesn’t use antibiotics or hormones. There’s aninitial investment for the deep freezer plus the bulk meat, but pays off in theend.”• “More and more people are raising their own chickens for eggs. I like to buyfree-range eggs at the farmers’ market or from a local farmer.”• “Take the time to learn how to store fruits & veggies properly so you get theoptimal freshness out of them.”• “Freeze fruit for smoothies before it goes bad. Bananas often get ripe all atonce, so I peel them, store them in plastic bag, and enjoy them either insmoothies or as treats.”• “Freezing nuts is also a good hint because they are cheaper in bulk but stayfreshest in the freezer.”• “You can get the best prices on a lot of health products shopping online,especially if you buy in bulk. Chia seeds, nuts, and coconut oil are good forthis. Health food stores will often discount bulk orders, too.”• “Make a Crock-Pot full of seasoned beans (pinto or black are wonderful) andseason with spices, garlic and onions, then serve with salsa or pico de galloover brown rice. You can top it with jalapeños, Greek yogurt (tastes just likesour cream but with more protein, less calories), and avocado. You can mashleftover beans for use in healthy burritos on whole wheat tortillas for lunches.For a Southwest treat, serve a side of beans with huevos rancheros.”• “Join a local co-op.”• “Join a gardening co-op.”• “Ground turkey and larger bags of hormone-free chicken thighs and legs arecheap, healthy eats!”• “Organic tilapia, bought in bulk, frozen is a fabulous fish that cooks in notime and is usually very affordable. Just sprinkle with a little of yourfavorite seasoning on one side, saute in a small amount of olive or coconut oil.Squeeze a slice of citrus on top and dinner is served. Great for fish tacos.”NUTRITIONAL GUIDES AND FOOD LABELSWhen eating out always ask for the nutritional guide, which will help you makebetter decisions. Most restaurants now have these guides, and they will horrifyyou worse than Piranha 3D. Some appetizers like onion rings or potato skins cancost you more than 1,200 calories, more than half of your daily calorieallowance. When I was in a coffee house recently with a friend who was havingtrouble with her weight, I helped her discover that the latte she was about toorder was 600 calories, a third of her daily calorie allowance for one drink.Shocked, she ordered green tea instead, which was virtually calorie free. I lovesaving money …and I love getting great value from my food.Likewise, always read the food labels. I was on vacation recently with my son,Antony, and we were shopping together when he put a “healthy” protein bar in ourcart. We then looked at the food label together and it had fourteen differenttypes of sugar in it, along with artificial dyes and sweeteners! I told my sonthat the bar must have been mislabeled, because really it was an early-deathbar. Read the labels. If you don’t know what’s in something, don’t eat it. Wouldyou ever buy something without knowing the cost? Be smart with your food and youwill be smarter and younger for a longer period of time.RIZ’S STORYWe started this chapter with the story of how simple changes in food madedramatic changes in my sister-in-law’s life. This is also true for one of thephysicians, Dr. Riz Malik, who works in our Reston, Virginia, clinic. Riz is anoutstanding child psychiatrist who works very hard and has many gratefulpatients. One day he sent me an e‑mail with a subject line that read “ADifferent Person.” In the e-mail, Riz sent me the two photos you see below witha note saying, “Hey guys, I lost twenty-eight pounds in the last three months.The pictures show the difference. I just wanted to share.”I was so excited to see the change in Riz that I had to find out how he did it.He said it happened around the time my book Change Your Brain, Change Your Bodywas released. When a friend of his got diagnosed with high cholesterol and highblood pressure, it made him start to examine his own health and well-being.After Riz came to the United States fifteen years ago at age twenty-five, hepicked up the Western habits of eating lots of rich food loaded with saturatedfat and drinking sugary beverages. He averaged four sodas (about 400 calories)and two fast-food meals (about 700 calories each) during the workday, bringinghim to about 1,800 calories before he ate dinner. For lunch, he was addicted toeating a burger with mushrooms and Swiss cheese. He craved them every day. Healso craved Indian foods with heavy curry sauces and lots of bread to go withthem. (The bread was not whole wheat but rather made from white flour.) Inaddition, he also started to crave potato bread and was eating three to fourslices a day with butter.[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_026_r1.jpg]Before[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_027_r1.jpg]After four months, down six pants sizesand 36 pounds and looks ten yearsyoungerRiz said, “It seemed that eating all of this food was a way of rewarding myselffor the hard work, the night calls, and the fact that I sometimes gotoverwhelmed with challenging psychiatric patients as I had to ‘absorb’ all thenegativity, sadness, and mental turmoil my patients go through. So eating was agood way out. But now I feel that I was, in fact, penalizing myself by eatingall those carb- and fat-loaded meals.”This is a key reminder, because people often believe they are “treatingthemselves” when they eat high-fat or -sugar foods, when in reality they arepunishing themselves, treating their bodies poorly. Those high-fat meals weren’tdoing him any favors. In addition to pushing his weight to 183 and his BMI to27, they gave him gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), also known as acidreflux. At forty years of age now, he thought that if he kept going in thisdirection, he would weigh about 250 pounds by the time he turned fifty-five.Riz continued his story. “When I started looking at what I had done to myself, Ithought, ‘My God, this is not good.’ I’m a physician and child psychiatrist, andhere I am telling my patients and kids to eliminate sugar and eat healthy, butwhat am I doing?”Riz realized he wasn’t eating any vegetables or getting much fiber in his diet.Using the tips in our books, as well as other reputable nutrition sources, hestarted making changes to his eating habits. He ditched the sodas and switchedto water with a little lemon. He started eating organic apples and blueberries,yogurt with fiber, skinless chicken and turkey breast, low-calorie whole grainbread, high-fiber lentils, and lots of veggies. He also started taking fish oiland a supplement called Attention Support, which supports attention and focus,and doing about ten to fifteen minutes of light exercise every day.At first, the thought of giving up his burgers and comfort foods seemed almostimpossible. “But after a while, you get used to the healthy food and start tolike it.” Now he looks forward to his blueberries, yogurt, and other brainhealthy fare.After four months, Riz lost 40 pounds, dropped his BMI to 22.7, and whittled hiswaistline from 36 to 30 inches. He weighs 148 pounds now, but weight loss isn’tthe only benefit from the changes he has made. “One of the most amazing thingsis my sleep has improved,” he said. “I had GERD, and now that’s gone. Plus, mylevel of alertness is better, and I’m more efficient at work.”Recently Riz sent this follow-up e-mail, which brought a big smile to my face,and I hope will inspire you to make the food choices today that will yield ayounger, healthier “different person” in your mirror tomorrow.Daniel,I cannot thank you enough for guiding me in the right direction for a healthierlifestyle and a fit body with a “fit” mind.For the last 4 months, I have maintained myself at 148 lbs, which is the idealweight for me (down from 184 lbs in March 2009). I have learned how to manage mycravings, how to reward myself with “yummy foods” once in a while, and how toregulate my own metabolism. Of course you know that my waist went down from 36to 30 at this point, and I love it.My sleep is much better, my energy levels are good throughout the day and I feelmore confident when talking to my patients about having optimal weight, a niceshape to my body, and most important, having the high self-esteem and confidencethat results when you are in good shape and can take charge of your negativethoughts, unhealthy lifestyle, and negative temptations for unhealthy foods.I knew that I had lost weight and I looked good and could enjoy better-fittingclothes and jeans, but I’ve had a question in my mind for the last 2 months: “Myexternal appearance is good and I look fit and slim, what about the differentparameters in terms of labs and other studies? Am I really healthy inside?”So I went to my doctor last week, at Washington Hospital Center, and said, “Dr.R! Could you please run some blood tests on me? I have lost weight, felt goodabout it, but I want to make sure that I see the real proof that I have donethings right rather than just being obsessed about my weight issues.” So we dida bunch of tests and the results came back three days ago.I will share them with you and won’t mind sharing with others too.In December of 2009, I got a regular physical and bloodwork and I compared thatto the ones done last week.Serum Cholesterol: Previous 209 (getting to a borderline risk) Now 156(fantastic)Serum LDL: Previous 109 (High) Now 82Serum HDL: Previous 24 (Low) Now 49Serum Triglycerides: Previous 302 Now 137 (Fantastic. A result of sayinggood-bye to Big Macs and Whoppers)Random Serum Glucose: Previous 109 Now 70 Serum HBA1cEven though I do not have diabetes, there is a family history in distantrelatives, so I just wanted to get the test. It is 5.0 (Great)Hemoglobin levels, vitamin D levels, complete blood count, electrolytes, wasabsolutely fine. And because I am over 40, I did a PSA [prostate-specificantigen test], and it was super normal and fine too.The other area of my concern was my abnormally high diastolic blood pressure. Itwas always between 88 and 92 (which does qualify for borderline hypertension).Ever since I can remember in the last 10–12 years, my blood pressure was alwayshigh in diastolic range. Having a strong family history of hypertension andheart attacks, I was always “nervous” about this. Guess what? In the last 3encounters (two with my primary care physician and one with an ER nurse) in thelast 8 weeks, my blood pressure has been consistently 115/75, 118/80, and110/79, which is ideal.Weight loss and reverting to a healthier lifestyle has been a blessing for meand it has helped me connect to my patients more and to offer them somethingbeyond a pill to help them feel better.I have been eating healthy, doing 15–20 minutes of exercise 4–5 days a week,getting to sleep on time, and taking fish oil and a multivitamin on a regularbasis. It has helped a lot.Please feel free to share my story with anyone it might encourage!Regards,RizAs I was writing this book I was in our Reston clinic and, just looking at Riz,he clearly looked 10 years younger than before he lost the weight.I WANT TO BE A TOUGH RED BELL PEPPERI want to close this chapter with one of my favorite stories. I was recently ona walk with my wife and daughter near our home. At the time Chloe was seven. Shehas red hair like her mother and usually speaks her mind. Even though it was astrenuous walk, Chloe did great. As we were nearing the end, her mother put herarm around her and said, “You are a tough cookie.”Immediately, Chloe looked up at her mother with an attitude and said, “I do notwant to be a tough cookie. I want to be a tough red bell pepper.”Living in our house, Chloe knew about nutrition. One of her favorite snacks wassliced red bell peppers with fresh mashed avocados. She also knew that cookiesand sugar made her feel bad, and having them increased the likelihood she wouldget herself into trouble. My hope for you is that you can be like Chloe and onlywant foods that serve you, not those that get you into trouble.CHANGE YOUR AGE NOW: TWENTY BRAIN TIPS FOR MAKING FOOD YOUR FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH 1. Eat only food that serves you. 2. When eating out, ask the waiter to tailor your order to your health needs.Most are happy to help. 3. If you have multiple symptoms and digestive issues, you may have foodallergies. Try the “gorilla diet” for a couple of weeks, eating only greenfoods, protein, and water, adding in new foods slowly to find the culpritscausing your issues. The most common food allergy culprits are peanuts, milk,eggs, soy, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, and wheat, accounting for 90 percent ofall food-allergic reactions. 4. Make your fridge into a rainbow. Stock it with all the most colorful fruitsand vegetables in the deepest hues. Imagine gorgeous dark spinach, red ripetomatoes, crisp yellow bell peppers, sweet blueberries, and fresh cantaloupelined up like a rainbow in your crisper. Getting your phytonutrients andantioxidants can be both beautiful and tasty! 5. Eating approximately every three to four hours throughout the day can helpbalance your blood sugar. Going too long without eating can wreak havoc on yourbrain function and make your blood sugar levels drop too low. Low blood sugarlevels are associated with poor impulse control and irritability. 6. When eating out always ask for the nutritional guide, which will help youmake better decisions. Also check labels, even on “health food” or “healthbars,” as packaging can be deceiving. 7. Eat with CROND in mind: calorie restricted, optimally nutritious, anddelicious food. Begin making a list of foods that are packed with nutrition,that are delicious to you, and are low in calories. These foods will be your newbest friends. 8. Junk food increases cravings. Be careful with the white powders: sugar,white flour, and salt. 9. Don’t drink your calories. But do drink plenty of water, and white or greentea. (You can “spruce up” your water with a slice of citrus and a dash ofstevia.)10. Feed your brain good fats! Omega-3 fats found in foods like oily fish andflax or chia seeds are great for the brain. Olive oil is good for salads andlight cooking; coconut, grape seed, and avocado oils are good for cooking athigher heat.11. Rethink the idea of “rich food” as a reward for a hard day of work oraccomplishing a task. If the rich or sugary food makes you fat and cranky orgives you heartburn, is it really such a great “reward”? Search for a win-win.Something nutritious and delicious that will leave you feeling better in an hourrather than worse.12. Learn how to be creative with your food budget. The best fruits and veggiesare the ones that are in season, and they are usually the ones on sale. Trimwaste (and your waist) by freezing fruit and veggies before they go bad, and usethem in smoothies or soups. Check out co-ops and other community resources forhealthy food on a shoestring. Check the “dirty dozen” list of the mostcontaminated foods and budget money to buy these organically.13. There is rising concern about hormones and toxins in foods that can changethe healthy balance in your brain and body. When possible, buy hormone-free,antibiotic-free, free-range, grass-fed meats and dairy products.14. Start your day with a good breakfast. One of the best ways to begin your dayis with a fully loaded smoothie: Try a good-quality protein powder, some “greenfood” powder, and fresh veggies with a little fruit. You’ll get hooked on thegood mood and energy that comes from this powerful start to your day.15. Watch for too much salt! Use it sparingly, and use sea salt at home. Avoidpremarinated and canned foods that have much more sodium than is needed, raisingblood pressure, which is bad for the brain, heart, and longevity.16. Limit your caffeine intake. Some coffee may be beneficial for health, butmany people are sensitive to its side effects. Moderation is key. Green teaprovides an energy boost without the caffeine-related jitters.17. Spice it up. More and more studies show that spices are indeed the “spice oflife”—in that many of them contain antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.Enjoy the good-for-you flavor of a variety of spices.18. Eat three palm-sized servings of high-quality lean protein a day. Beans,fish, turkey, and chicken are especially good choices. Protein is a precursor todopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine, which are critical for balancing moodand energy, metabolism and energy production, and improving cognitiveperformance.19. Eating a diet that is filled with low-glycemic foods will stabilize yourblood glucose levels and decrease cravings. Most low-GI foods are low in sugarand/or high in fiber or protein. The important concept to remember is that highblood sugar is bad for your brain and, ultimately, your longevity.20. Supplements like fish oil, vitamin D, and specialized supplements that helpcontrol cravings or help with mood and focus may be helpful."},{"pageContent":"3ANDY[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_L01_r1.jpg]GET STRONG TO LIVE LONGAccording to one study, the number-one predictor of longevity is the amount oflean muscle mass on your body.Tall, lean, smiling, and healthy at age sixty-four, exuding an unstoppablevibrancy that would make the Energizer Bunny envious, it is hard to believe thatDr. Andrew McGill began his life prematurely back in 1947. The expectations thathe might actually live were so low that he wasn’t named until he was four orfive days old. But such is the strong will of one Andy McGill.However, in 1999, when Andy was turning fifty-two, he had a wake-up call thatwould challenge his will to survive in a whole new way. It began when professorAndy McGill attended a seminar I gave at the University of Michigan about ADHDand our work with brain SPECT imaging. At the time, Andy’s high school daughter,Katy, was struggling with ADHD. Curious about SPECT and wanting to make sureKaty had the best current diagnosis and follow-up treatment, Andy flew the wholefamily to California for a fun day of “having their heads examined” at one ofour clinics. Andy heard me say in one of my presentations, “If your child hasADHD, look at the parents. More than likely he or she got it from one of you.”At that moment, Andy had looked at his wife, Kathe, suspiciously, thinking,“Well, it’s obvious. Katy gets it from her mom.” At the very same moment, Andy’swife was eyeing him, thinking, “Aha! My husband is the culprit!”Originally, Andy and his wife’s motivation for getting their brains scanned,alongside Katy, was to help their daughter feel less alone and more comfortablewith the process. As it turned out, Katy, who had taken the summer offmedication to prepare for the scan, had made such marked improvement that shewas able to get off medication completely a few years later. However, Dr.McGill’s scan told a different tale, and an alarming one.BRAIN SPECT SCANS CAN TELL AN ALARMING STORYWhen I first saw Andy’s scan I wondered what I would tell him. It is not easy totell a kind, educated man who had traveled more than halfway across the countryto see you that his brain was damaged and looked much older than he was. Hisscan looked terrible. There was overall decreased activity in a Swiss cheesetoxic-looking pattern. I had seen this pattern hundreds of times. It could beattributed to any number of causes: alcohol; drugs; environmental toxins, suchas mold or organic solvents; infections; a lack of oxygen; or a significantmedical problem like severe anemia or low thyroid.When I asked Andy if he drank alcohol, he described what he felt was a prettynormal social drinking routine: a couple of drinks to wind down from a busy dayof teaching business classes to college students, then a glass of wine withdinner, and finally, a nightcap before retiring for the evening. Since most“social drinkers” tend to fudge on the number of drinks they actually have, orthe size of those drinks, I suspected that four drinks per day was probably theminimum daily drinking quota.“How long have you been drinking?” I asked.“Well, as a young man I was newspaper business editor for the Miami Herald andthe Detroit News, so I was in a culture where smoking and drinking went hand inhand with the job. I quit smoking back in the seventies. But I’ve put in aboutforty years of good drinking, all together.”Normal Brain SPECT Scan[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_028_r1.jpg]Full, even, symmetrical activityAndy’s Brain SPECT Scan 1999[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_029_r1.jpg]Overall decreased activityI cut to the chase and told him, firmly and clearly, the realities of his futureif he continued to drink, such as early dementia, disease, death, and basicallylosing his good mind. He was also quite overweight and needed to revamp his dietand start exercising. But the first order of business was that he had to stoppoisoning his brain on a daily basis with alcohol. Also, much to his chagrin, Ihad to tell him the news that Katy’s ADHD most likely came from her father’sside of the brain tree.Andy thanked me and flew back to Ann Arbor with his family. I had no ideawhether or not he’d take my advice to heart (or should I say “to brain”?).Then, about a year and a half later, our office received a call from Dr. McGill,who wanted to fly out to the clinic again, this time alone (he didn’t evenmention this trip to his wife), to recheck his brain. When I saw his scan, Ishook my head sadly. His scan was even worse than the previous year.This time, for whatever reason, Andy somberly assimilated the truth on a deepand profound level.NEW YEAR, NEW LIFEAndy will never forget New Year’s Eve of the new millennium, ushering in 2001.He was drinking a glass of wine with some buddies at a party. Glasses in hand,they all began talking about how they wanted to stop drinking. Andy said, “I’mgoing to do it. When I finish this glass of wine, I’ll never drink again. Thisis my last one.” Amazingly, the McGill “will” kicked in. He never took anotherdrink. (His friends all began drinking again within a few months.) Emotionallyready and intellectually armed after seeing his SPECT scan and hearing myconcern, Andy made that solemn commitment, and he knew he would keep thispromise to himself. He wanted a new brain for the new decade.In addition to giving up alcohol, Andy also gave up caffeine, knowing from ourtalks that too much caffeine constricts blood flow to the brain. Once he hadthese two issues under control, he started feeling better and decided to tacklethe extra 100 pounds.When he first went to see his local doctor, his weight was at 279 pounds. Heexercised sporadically. He got his weight down to 208 pounds in 2002, but itjumped up to 289.5 pounds in 2006. At this time, Andy was attending medicalschool—at age fifty-nine! He was taking classes and seeing patients as part ofhis clinical program. One day, he found himself lecturing a diabetic patientabout the importance of nutrition, losing weight, and exercise. On the way homehe thought to himself, “Andy, what a hypocrite you are! When are you going tostop playing around with your own health?”Andy hit a wall on November 1, 2006, and not unlike what happened to him the dayhe stopped drinking, he made a deep, committed vow to himself never to miss aday of exercising. He’s kept that promise for over five years now withoutmissing a single day. Ever. Through sickness, through hard days (“through rain,through hail, through black of night”) the ol’ McGill will keeps on ticking.Once Andy fell on the ice and he was in pain, but having been through medicaltraining, he knew he’d not broken or sprained anything. He was just bruised andsore. So to the treadmill he went.“I actually find that when I’m not feeling well, which is rare, if I’ll just geton the treadmill for a while, I will almost always feel better afterward.”DON’T BREAK THE STREAK!“What I’ve learned about myself, based on my history, is that once I break astreak, it’s easier to break it again and I might not stick with the program soseriously or get back with a program again,” Andy explained. “What happens whenyou allow yourself to take breaks or start giving yourself excuses for days offis that you set up a cognitive precedent.” A man of his word, even to himself,Andrew’s secret of quitting a bad habit and starting (and sticking with) a newone is simple: Just do it. And don’t stop doing it. Don’t break the streak.“The secret to exercise is to make it happen first thing in the morning, noexcuses,” Andy says. “The day will get away from you and you’ll rationalize notexercising all day long if you don’t do it as soon as you get up.”Andy has also incorporated one of the most positive outlooks on exercise I’veever observed. “I’ll tell you what I love about exercising in the mornings,” hesays with a wide grin. “I know that no matter what else happens in my day, I canguarantee a part of my day will be great. When I exercise, I feel good. Even ifthere are troubles or frustrations as the day wears on, I’ve ensured I have hadat least one fabulous hour by keeping exercise as a regular, top priority.” Intruth, because we know that exercise elevates mood and keeps the energy upthroughout the day, Andy is also ensuring that his mood level stays as high aspossible all day long, come what may.A YOUNGER BRAIN, A SHARPER MIND, AND A HAPPIER LIFENow curious to see if all the changes he’d made over the years had affected hisbrain, Andy called the clinic for another appointment in late 2010. To tell youthe truth, and as I would tell Andy later, I was dreading this, worried that hisscan might be bad or have even gotten worse. I didn’t know at this point aboutthe scope of the lifestyle changes he’d been implementing, and of course, he wasnow almost a decade older since that first awful scan was taken.Andy’s Brain SPECT Scan 1999[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_030_r1.jpg]Overall decreased activityAndy’s Brain SPECT Scan 2010[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_031_r1.jpg]Dramatic overall improvementWhat I saw on Andy’s new scan simply made my entire week. As we age, typicallyour brain looks older, less active. This guy’s brain had aged backward! He wasnow the proud owner of a much younger, healthier brain than he had ten yearsbefore. I was elated to show Andy the scans and share the good news, the happyresult of many years of omitting bad habits and steadily applying new ones.When I asked Andy about his inspiration, he talked about his wife, Kathe, whohad been doing her own swimming exercise routine—three times a week—for morethan twenty years after being diagnosed with fibromyalgia, and had gotten backto a point of operating at 95 percent of her former mobility. She swims threedays a week, in a short wetsuit after pouring hot water inside to warm hermuscles, then doing a physical therapy routine of two dozen water exercises.Kathe has found that it is important to keep the muscles of fibromyalgiapatients warmed up, and this way she enjoys the benefits of water exercise whilekeeping her muscles warm.Today, Andy’s energy level is great and stays steady all day. He doesn’t feelrun down or tired like so many his age. He also looks great and feels asintellectually engaged as when he was young, but now he has a wiser, more maturemind. He loves jazz and cooking, along with writing, some adjunct professorialduties, and some pro bono community service activities. He actually feels muchmore comfortable with students and people younger than himself than he does atthe university retiree events. He feels decades younger than his biological age.His daughter, Katy, who once struggled in school, grew up to be a kindergartenteacher in San Diego and has a six-year-old, who happily runs his grandfatheraround Disneyland and Sea World when he visits. Andy McGill never takes thesemoments for granted, knowing full well that if he had not made vows to changehis health habits ten years ago, he might not be here to see his grandson.I recently received this encouraging and heartwarming e-mail from Andy, saying,“Along with the 2000 brain scan, it was your matter-of-fact warning, Dr. Amen,telling me that I would be in really sad shape by the time I reached sixty,unless I got serious about repairing the damage and got my brain healthy again.It scared me into action. That is when I became intellectually convinced. Whileit took me a few more months to become totally emotionally ready and quitdrinking, you really saved my life and are responsible for me being as healthyas I am today. Never underestimate that. I may do the exercise. But you were thestimulant.”Needless to say, letters like this and lives changed for the better, like AndyMcGill’s, are why I love what I do.ANDY’S IMPRESSIVE HEALTH STATSNot only did Andy get a new, younger brain, he also got a new, younger body.When Andy began exercising, he was so out of shape and weighed so much that evenwalking at a very slow pace was tough. Today Andy is at an extreme level offitness. For his morning routine now he runs on the treadmill for an hour,beginning at 3 mph at a 6 percent grade for the first 7.5 minutes, increasinggradually to 4.5 mph and 9 percent level. This routine gets his heart rate up to125 beats per minute (bpm) from a resting rate of about 50 bpm. On Mondays,Wednesdays, and Fridays he does forty-five minutes of treadmill and then usesfree weights for ten to fifteen minutes.Andy reports, “I have now achieved a very, very high cardiac fitness level: the99th percentile for men in my age group, comparatively—also at the 99thpercentile for the age-fifty men’s group, the 99th percentile for the age fortymen’s group. My regular doctor had to go down to the age thirty men’s group tofind a comparative level for me: There I am only in the 75th percentile!”In addition, on Andy’s last major fitness test, his VO2 (volume of oxygen takenin during exercise) was 63 ml/kg/min (milligrams per kilogram per minute).“Normally, your VO2 is expected to go down when you age,” wrote Andy. “Mine wentfrom 49, when I began my exercise streak in 2006, to 63. I’m told that isconsidered an extraordinary fitness achievement for my age. Achievements likethis also help keep me motivated.”There are four major lessons in Andy’s story.1. Being able to see your own brain often creates brain envy and motivatespeople to start taking better care of it.2. Alcohol is not your friend, especially lots of alcohol. The sooner you loseit or significantly decrease your intake, the better your brain and body willbe.3. Regular exercise can make a dramatic difference in how you look and feel.4. Dedicate yourself to brain healthy habits and keep them going for a long,healthy life.Andy[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_032_r1.jpg]Before[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_033_r1.jpg]After eleven years, down 100 pounds, with a better brain and cardiovascularsystem!I used to exercise for my butt. Now I exercise for my brain.—DAVID SMITH, M.D., FOUNDER OF THE HAIGHT-ASHBURY FREE CLINICS AND MY COAUTHOROF UNCHAIN YOUR BRAINThis is one of my favorite quotes. David is a pioneer in the addiction treatmentfield, and together we wrote a terrific book, Unchain Your Brain: 10 Steps toBreaking the Addictions That Steal Your Life, on using the latest brain scienceto help people with addiction issues. As David learned more and more aboutcreating a brain healthy life, his daily exercise routine became more about hisbrain than his body. Physical exercise is another fountain of youth for thehealth of your brain. Regular exercise will help you look younger, be trimmer,feel smarter, and boost your mood all at the same time.Certainly, it is no secret that our society has shifted to a sedentary lifestylewhere most of us spend our days sitting—working on computers, watching TV, anddriving. The problem is that a lack of physical activity robs the brain ofoptimal function and is linked to obesity, higher rates of depression, a greaterrisk for cognitive impairment …and worse.Physical inactivity is the fourth most common preventable cause of death, behindsmoking, hypertension, and obesity.EXERCISE AND LONGEVITYNew research seems to be popping up every day proving that exercise will notonly increase how long you live but also the quality of life in those years.Here’s a sample of some of the findings.1. THOSE WITH PEP IN THEIR STEP STAY YOUNGERA recent study shows that after age sixty-five, one strong predictor oflongevity is walking speed. Those who can still hoof it after age seventy-fivehave an even better chance of living even longer. An eighty-year-old man whoclocks 1 mph has a 10 percent probability of reaching age ninety, while a womanof the same age walking at that pace has a 23 percent chance. Now let’s assumethis pair is hoofing it a little faster at a speed of 3.5 mph. Now theeighty-year-old man has an 84 percent probability of reaching age ninety, whilea woman would have an 86 percent chance.2. DO YOUR AEROBICS AND KEEP MORE BRAIN TISSUE!If you are like me, you’d like to keep every iota of brain tissue you possiblycan as you get older. Researchers found that exercise, particularly aerobicexercise, reduces brain tissue loss in aging adults.3. BALANCE EXERCISES HELP YOU AGE GRACEFULLYGentle exercise, like yoga or tai chi, increases balance, which decreases falls,which decreases injury and complications leading to death.4. ACTIVE SENIORS LOOK YEARS YOUNGER THAN THEIR COUCH POTATO FRIENDSExercising thirty minutes a day, five times a week, can make you look many yearsyounger than your biological age. Researchers from the University of St. Andrewsin Scotland found that aging in the form of loose skin on the neck and jowls arethe most pronounced effect of not exercising. The forehead and eye area alsotend to fatten more in inactive people.5. RESISTANCE EXERCISE KEEPS YOU STRONGER TO LIVE LONGERUniversity of Michigan researchers published a study showing that after anaverage of eighteen to twenty weeks of progressive resistance training, an adultcan add 2.42 pounds of lean muscle to their body mass and increase their overallstrength 25–30 percent. This is significant because without proactive training,aging adults tend to lose muscle mass and strength. The study recommended thatpeople over age fifty begin by using their own body weight to do squats,modified push-ups, lying hip bridges, or standing up out of a chair. (Also, taichi, Pilates, and yoga employ many resistance exercises using your own bodyweight as well.) Then you can add weights in a progressive training programdesigned specifically for your age and fitness, preferably starting with apersonal trainer who can teach you good exercise form with weights, how manyreps to do, and when it is time to up your weights.6. THE GREATER YOUR MUSCLE STRENGTH, THE LESS RISK OF ALZHEIMER’SAccording to research done at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago,individuals with weaker muscles appear to have a higher risk for Alzheimer’sdisease and declines in cognitive function over time. Those at the 90thpercentile of muscle strength had about a 61 percent reduced risk of developingAlzheimer’s disease compared with those in the 10th percentile. Overall, thedata showed that greater muscle strength is associated with a decreased risk ofdeveloping Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment. It also suggeststhat a common but yet-to-be-determined factor may underlie loss of musclestrength and cognition in aging.7. THOSE WHO EXERCISE SLOW DOWN THEIR BIOLOGICAL CLOCKExercise improves telomere maintenance by increasing the activity of the enzymetelomerase that builds and repairs telomeres. Telomeres are the part of yourchromosomes that control aging. They represent your biological clock. When youare young your telomeres are longer, and they progressively shorten with age.But the rate at which that shortening occurs is directly influenced by lifestylechoices. So at any age, healthier individuals have longer telomeres than theirunhealthy counterparts.There are so many other benefits to regular exercise. Here are a few more ofthem.Handle stress better. Working out helps you manage stress by immediatelylowering stress hormones, and it makes you more resistant to stress over time.Raising your heart rate through exercise also makes you a better stress handlerbecause it raises beta-endorphins, the brain’s own natural morphine. Increasingyour ability to manage stress can keep you from polishing off a whole bag ofchips when you are under a lot of pressure.Eat healthier foods. A 2008 study found that being physically active makes youmore inclined to choose foods that are good for you, seek out more socialsupport, and manage stress more effectively. Obviously, choosing brain healthyfoods over junk food provides the foundation for lasting health. Creating asolid support network to encourage your new brain healthy habits can help youstay on track.Get more restful sleep. Engaging in exercise on a routine basis normalizesmelatonin production in the brain and improves sleeping habits. Getting bettersleep improves brain function, helps you make better decisions about the foodsyou eat, and enhances your mood. Chronic lack of sleep nearly doubles your riskfor obesity and is linked to depression and a sluggish brain.Increase circulation. Physical activity improves your heart’s ability to pumpblood throughout your body, which increases blood flow to your brain. Betterblood flow equals better overall brain function.Grow more new brain cells. Exercise increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor(BDNF). BDNF is like an antiaging wonder drug that is involved with the growthof new brain cells. Think of BDNF as a sort of Miracle-Gro for your brain.BDNF promotes learning and memory and makes your brain stronger. Specifically,exercise generates new brain cells in the temporal lobes (involved in memory)and the prefrontal cortex, or PFC (involved in planning and judgment). Having astrong PFC and temporal lobes is critical for successful weight loss.A better memory helps you remember to do the important things that will help youstay healthy—for example, making an appointment with your physician to checkyour important health numbers, shopping for the foods that are the best for yourbrain, and taking the daily supplements that will benefit your brain type.Planning and judgment are vital because you need to plan meals and snacks inadvance, and you need to make the best decisions throughout the day to stay ontrack.The increased production of BDNF you get from exercise is only temporary. Thenew brain cells survive for about four weeks, then die off, unless they arestimulated with mental exercise or social interaction. This means you have toexercise on a regular basis in order to benefit from a continual supply of newbrain cells. It also explains why people who work out at the gym and then go tothe library are smarter than people who only work out at the gym.Enhance brainpower. No matter how old you are, exercise increases your memory,your ability to think clearly, and your ability to plan. Decades of researchhave found that physical activity leads to better grades and higher test scoresamong students at all levels. It also boosts memory in young adults and improvesfrontal lobe function in older adults.Getting your body moving also protects the short-term memory structures in thetemporal lobes (hippocampus) from high-stress conditions. Stress causes theadrenal glands to produce excessive amounts of the hormone cortisol, which hasbeen found to kill cells in the hippocampus and impair memory. In fact, peoplewith Alzheimer’s disease have higher cortisol levels than normal aging people.Ward off memory loss and dementia. Exercise helps prevent, delay, and reduce thecognitive impairment that comes with aging, dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease.In 2010 alone, more than a dozen studies reported that physical exercise resultsin a reduction in cognitive dysfunction in older people. One of them came from agroup of Canadian researchers who looked at physical activity over the course ofthe lifetime of 9,344 women. Specifically, they looked at the women’s activitylevels as teenagers, at age thirty, at age fifty, and in late life. Physicalactivity as a teenager was associated with the lowest incidence of cognitiveimpairment later in life, but physical activity at any age correlated to reducedrisk. This study tells me that it is never too late to start an exerciseprogram.Protect against brain injuries. Exercise strengthens the brain and enhances itsability to fight back against the damaging effects of brain injuries. This is socritical because brain injuries—even mild ones—can take the PFC offline, whichreduces self-control, weakens your ability to say no to cravings, and increasesthe need for immediate gratification, as in “I must have that bacon cheeseburgerright this minute!”You don’t have to lose consciousness to suffer from brain trauma. Even mild headinjuries that do not typically show up on the structural brain imaging tests,such as MRIs or CT scans, can seriously impact your life and increase your riskfor unhealthy behaviors. That is because trauma can affect not only the brain’shardware, or physical health, but also its software, or how it functions. Headinjuries can disrupt and alter neurochemical functioning, resulting in emotionaland behavioral problems, including an increased risk for eating problems andsubstance abuse.Each year, two million new brain injuries are reported, and millions more gounreported. Brain trauma is especially common among people with addictions ofall kinds, including food addiction. At Sierra Tucson, a world-renownedtreatment center for addictions and behavioral disorders, our brain imagingtechnology has been used since 2009. One of the most surprising things the brainscans have shown, according to Robert Johnson, M.D., the facility’s medicaldirector, is a much higher than expected incidence of traumatic brain injuryamong their patients.Get moving to get happier. Have you ever heard the term runner’s high? Is itreally possible to feel that good, just from exercise? You bet it is. Exercisecan activate the same pathways in the brain as morphine and increases therelease of endorphins, natural feel-good neurotransmitters. That makes exercisethe closest thing to a happiness pill you will ever find.Boost your mood. Physical exercise stimulates neurotransmitter activity,specifically norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin, which elevates mood.Fight depression. In some people, exercise can be as effective as prescriptionmedicine in treating depression. One of the reasons why exercise can be souseful is because BDNF not only grows new brain cells, but it is alsoinstrumental in putting the brakes on depression.The antidepressant benefits of exercise have been documented in medicalliterature. One study compared the benefits of exercise with those of theprescription antidepressant drug Zoloft. After twelve weeks, exercise provedequally effective as Zoloft in curbing depression. After ten months, exercisesurpassed the effects of the drug. Minimizing symptoms of depression isn’t theonly way physical exercise outshined Zoloft.Like all prescription medications for depression, Zoloft is associated withnegative side effects, such as sexual dysfunction and lack of libido.Furthermore, taking Zoloft may ruin your ability to qualify for healthinsurance. Finally, popping a prescription pill doesn’t help you learn any newskills. On the contrary, exercise improves your fitness, your shape, and yourhealth, which also boosts self-esteem. It doesn’t affect your insurability, andit allows you to gain new skills. If anyone in your family has feelings ofdepression, exercise can help.I teach a course for people who suffer from depression, and one of the mainthings we cover is the importance of exercise in warding off this condition. Iencourage all of these patients to start exercising and especially to engage inaerobic activity that gets the heart pumping. The results are truly amazing.Over time, many of these patients who have been taking antidepressant medicationfor years feel so much better that they are able to wean off the medicine.Ease anxiety. Although the research on the effects of exercise on anxiety isn’tquite as voluminous as the evidence on exercise and depression, it shows thatphysical activity of just about any kind and at any intensity level can sootheanxiety. In particular, high-intensity activity has been shown to reduce theincidence of panic attacks.Boost your sexuality. Exercise helps to boost testosterone levels and makes youfeel sexier. In addition, you look better, which also makes you feel and actmore attractive. Even a few pounds or inches lost can make a big difference inhow sexy we feel.CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE BEGINNING ANY EXERCISE PROGRAM.BEST EXERCISES FOR YOUR BRAINAerobic exercise, coordination activities, and resistance training have all beenfound to benefit the brain.Get the most out of your aerobic exercise with burst training. If you want ahigher-calorie burn, a faster-fat burn, a greater mood enhancer, and a betterbrain booster, try burst training. Also known as interval training, bursttraining involves sixty-second bursts at go-for-broke intensity followed by afew minutes of lower-intensity exertion. This is the type of workout I do, andit works. Scientific evidence says so. A 2006 study from researchers at theUniversity of Guelph in Canada found that doing high-intensity burst trainingburns fat faster than continuous moderately intensive activities.If you want to burn calories with bursts, do intense exercise, such as fastwalking (walking as if you were late for an appointment), for thirty minutes atleast four to five times a week. In addition, in each of these sessions, you areto do four one-minute bursts of intense exercise. These short bursts areessential to get the most out of your training. Short-burst training helps raiseendorphins, lift your mood, and make you feel more energized. It also burns morecalories and fat than continuous moderate exercise. Here is a sample of aheart-pumping thirty-minute workout with bursts:SAMPLE BURST TRAINING WORKOUT3 minutesWarm-up 4 minutesFast walking (walk like you are late) 1 minuteBurst(run or walk as fast as you can) 4 minutesFast walking 1 minuteBurst 4minutesFast walking 1 minuteBurst 4 minutesFast walking 1 minuteBurst 4minutesFast walking 3 minutesCool downIf you can’t devote an entire thirty minutes to an aerobic burst routine, don’tthrow in the towel. Research from Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston showsthat just ten minutes of vigorous exercise can spark metabolic changes thatpromote fat burning, calorie burning, and better blood sugar control for atleast an hour. For the 2010 trial, researchers looked at exercise-inducedmetabolic changes in people of varying fitness levels: people who became shortof breath during exercise, healthy middle-aged individuals, and marathonrunners.All three groups benefited from ten minutes on a treadmill, but the fittestindividuals got the biggest metabolic boost. This indicates that as you increaseyour fitness, your body will become more effective at burning fat and calorieswith exercise.Boost your brain with coordination activities. Doing coordinationactivities—like dancing, tennis, or table tennis (the world’s best brainsport)—that incorporate aerobic activity and coordination moves are the bestbrain boosters for all types of overeaters. The aerobic activity spawns newbrain cells while the coordination moves strengthen the connections betweenthose new cells so your brain can recruit them for other purposes, such asthinking, learning, and remembering.What I really like about aerobic coordination activities is that many of themalso work as burst-training sessions. For example, in tennis and table tennis,you give it your all during the point, then you have a brief rest period beforethe next point begins. It is the same with dancing, where you dance to the songand then take a short break.In general, I recommend that all of us do some form of aerobic coordinationactivity at least four to five times a week for at least thirty minutes.Have you typically avoided coordination activities because you have two leftfeet? This could be part of the reason why you have a hard time controllingyourself around food. That is because the cerebellum, which is the coordinationcenter of the brain, is linked to the PFC, where judgment and decision-makingoccur. If you aren’t very coordinated, it may indicate that you are not verygood at making good decisions either. Increasing coordination exercises canactivate the cerebellum, thereby improving your judgment so you can make betterdecisions.Strengthen your brain with strength training. I also recommend adding resistancetraining to your workouts. Canadian researchers have found that resistancetraining plays a role in preventing cognitive decline. Plus, it builds muscle,which can rev your metabolism to help you burn more calories throughout the day.Extensive research shows that adding resistance training to a controlled-calorienutrition program results in greater loss of body fat and more inches lost thandiet alone.Calm and focus your mind with mindful activities. Yoga, tai chi, and othermindful exercises have been found to reduce anxiety and depression and toincrease focus. Although they don’t offer the same BDNF-generating benefits asaerobic activity, these types of exercise can still boost your brain so you canimprove your self-control and reduce emotional or anxious overeating.“COME ON AND DANCE WITH ME!”Eddie Deems has taught ballroom dance for seventy of his ninety-two years, whichmakes him one of the oldest—and most accomplished—hoofers in the Dallas–FortWorth Metroplex. Lithe and graceful in his nineties, Eddie dresses in a handsomedark suit complete with ascot, looking every bit the professional danceinstructor that he still is. Eddie is a living testimony to one of the world’sbest exercises for longevity: dancing!Imagine going to the doctor, complaining of depression, and instead of givingyou a prescription for Zoloft or Prozac, he hands you an Rx slip that says,“Take ten tango lessons and call me in two months.” As far-fetched as that mightsound, it could very well be a better answer than medication for many peoplewith low-mood issues.“We’ve become a nation of armchair dancers, mesmerized by Dancing with the Starsand So You Think You Can Dance,” says Lane Anderson, author of an article inPsychology Today. “But research shows that getting your own groove on is morebeneficial in improving social skills, lifting your spirits, even reversingdepression.“In a recent study at the University of Derby,” Anderson wrote, “depressedpatients given salsa-dancing lessons improved their moods significantly by theend of the nine-week, hip-swiveling therapy.” Researchers found that thecombination of the endorphin boost from exercise, along with the socialinteraction and forced concentration, lifted moods. I think it is safe to assumethat the emotional boost of music, which calms and energizes the brain, alsohelped, along with the pride learning a new skill.In a study from Germany, twenty-two tango dancers had lower levels of stresshormones and higher levels of testosterone. They also reported feeling sexierand more relaxed. Another study from the University of New England showed thatafter six weeks of tango lessons, the participants showed significantly lowerlevels of depression than a control group who took no classes, and had similarresults to a third group who took meditation lessons. Dance requires extremefocus or “mindfulness” and when the brain is deeply engaged at this level,negative thought patterns that lead to anxiety and depression are interrupted.Using the body in physical, rhythmic movement also plays a part in openingpeople up on several levels. “Depressed patients tend to have a curved back,which brings the head down so it’s facing the ground,” said DonnaNewman-Bluestein, a dance therapist with the American Dance Therapy Association.“Dancing lifts the body to an open, optimistic posture.”So grab your partner and do a little waltz around the kitchen, or go ahead andturn on “Dancing Queen” full volume (nobody’s looking, right?) and get yourgroove on. What have you got to lose but a bad mood and a few pounds?DR. JOE DISPENZA: HOW TO ENGAGE YOUR BRAIN IN A ONCE-AND-FOR-ALL DECISIONIn addition to keeping a streak, another aspect that is unique to Andy’s storywas his “all in” approach to two life-altering decisions, from which there wasno turning back. Not even a slip-up. It reminds me of that famous scene from TheEmpire Strikes Back in which Yoda tells Luke, “Do or do not. There is no try.”What enables people to make these strong vows to themselves that they simplydon’t break? Where there is no more “try,” there is only “do.”Dr. Joe Dispenza, author of the book Evolve the Brain: The Science of ChangingYour Mind, wrote: “I hope you’ve had this experience in your life where yourintention, your focus and your will have all come into alignment.” Dr. Dispenzahas become a friend and refers many people to our clinics. I think he is on tosomething here. Ponder for a moment about vows you’ve made to yourself in thepast, and think about what occurred in the times that you kept a vow and neverbroke from it. For some of you, perhaps, there was a moment where you said toyourself, “I will not be abused anymore” and broke free from an abuser, never toreturn. Or maybe it was the moment you chose your career path, knowing all theyears of schooling and training ahead of you, knowing too that this was thecourse for you, so you signed up, went all in, and finished your degree. Thesewere moments when your “intention, focus and will” collided to facilitate majorchange. I believe that intention, focus, and will stem from your PFC (thebrain’s supervisor) and your limbic system (emotional brain), working in tandem.Together they help you make the kind of deep, intrinsic, lasting vow to yourselfto make radically better choices for your new, improved brain.In a recent conversation with Dr. Joe Dispenza he shared more about the why andhow of getting to an “all in” decision for your well-being, which couldpositively change the course of your life.1. OBSERVE YOUR THOUGHTSTo begin the change process, Dr. Dispenza teaches others to become“metacognitive.” This means that we step back from our thought patterns andobserve them. We “think about our thinking patterns.”“ ‘What if?’  questions, when we start to speculate about new ways of thinkingand being, open up a world of possibilities,” he says. The PFC loves these kindsof questions, finds them stimulating. “Why not wake up every morning and beginthe day by reminding yourself how you want to be and feel?” he asks. “And alsoremind yourself of who you don’t want to be each day.”Dr. Dispenza points out that how you think creates how you feel (emotions). Howyou feel (your emotional state) creates a mood that, if left unchecked,eventually creates a temperament and, ultimately, your personality. Yourpersonality, no doubt, ultimately affects your sense of reality. So much startswith a single thought. As the ancient proverb goes, “As a man thinks in hisheart, so is he.” But how do we really make up our minds to change? Dr. Dispenzasays it has to do with creating a firm intention (with our PFC) that is strongenough to break old habits.2. VISUALIZE YOUR NEW WANTED HABITS IN DETAILOne way of creating new habits is to mentally practice. In one experiment, Dr.Dispenza points out that non-piano-playing people were taught to practice aseries of finger movements on the piano for two hours a day, for five days.Another group of non–piano players was asked to mentally “practice” playing thepiano (without moving their fingers) for the same amount of time. Brain scansshowed that both groups showed the same pattern of new learning had taken placein the brain. Mental rehearsal, alone, changed the brain in the same way thatactual practicing with the body did. Spending some time visualizing exactly howyou’ll spend your day in order to be healthier and live longer is a valuablemental tool in prepping you for that “all in” decision to change once and forall.3. FEED YOUR BRAIN NEW EXPERIENCES TO CREATE NEW NEURAL NETSDr. Dispenza’s work emphasizes the brain science truth that “neurons that firetogether, wire together.” The more that you feed your brain new experiences andnew learning, the more those neurons fire; and the more you repeat similarexperiences and layer similar knowledge, the more your neurons fire and wiretogether. Under heavy-duty microscopes, the neurons look very much like threadscoming together to create a fishing net. In fact, this is what is called aneural net. Another way, then, to make a “once-and-for-all decision” is to feedyour brain new experiences and new learning until your neurons “fire and wiretogether” to become new neuron nets, or new automatic thoughts and actions. Forexample, the more you read and study books like this one on brain health, themore you create connections of information that link together and begin tochange your brain. The more you risk new experiences over time—like eating morefruits and vegetables every day or walking for thirty minutes a day—the morethis becomes a good habit.4. STUDY ROLE MODELSAnother way to help your brain change is to read and study those whose livesyou’d like to emulate. Dr. Dispenza enjoyed Nelson Mandela’s biography becauseit taught him how a noble man can suffer unjustly, for years, in a prison andthen forgive and go on to great things with his life. The biography of theWright Brothers is of great encouragement for someone risking a dream that seemsunrealistic to many. Abraham Lincoln is a role model of honor, integrity, faith,and humor in a time of great crisis. I am sharing stories of real people in thisbook who have changed their brain, changed their life and their biological age,to help inspire you to believe that you too can change.5. FIRM INTENTION“The problem with the way most people make decisions to change is that they’lltell themselves, while lying on the couch with the remote, eating junk food anddrinking beer, ‘I’m going to get my act together and change tomorrow,’ ”explains Dr. Dispenza. “But the body is saying to the mind, ‘Oh, relax. Hedoesn’t really mean it. He always says this over and over but he never changes.Go ahead and have another potato chip and a swig of beer.’But when you really truly make up your mind and are in a state of firmintention—that is, you absolutely know that you are going to follow through on anew way of thinking or acting, you can almost feel the hair on the back of yourneck stand up. You are saying to yourself, with deep conviction, ‘I don’t carewhat anyone else says or does. I don’t care what happens or what challenges Iface. I don’t care how hard it is. I am going to do this. I am going to change.’When you are at this point of serious, firm attention, your body sits up andpays attention. It knows the brain means business. And the body will now followthe direction of a firmly convinced prefrontal cortex.”PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE: SHRINKAGE HAPPENSDr. Cyrus Raji, M.D., Ph.D., is a bright, articulate, kindhearted doctor andresearcher at the University of Pittsburgh’s Department of Radiology, whooversaw and released some fascinating studies on the correlation betweenAlzheimer’s disease, dementia, and physical activity. He has also become a goodfriend, as we both share a keen interest in the brain and longevity.Dr. Raji comes to an interest in helping the brain stay healthier longer frompersonal experience. Cyrus’s grandmother was a teacher, a brilliant woman whospoke five languages. But she was a smoker, suffered from a couple of strokes,and eventually succumbed to dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. In her waningyears of life her brain was reduced to that of a lost and confused child.Watching this bright light in his life grow dim, Cyrus has dedicated much of hiscareer to doing what he can to stem the ugly tide of dementia and Alzheimer’s inthe world. As I mentioned in chapter 1 [Amen_9780307888563_epub_c01_r1.htm],over five million Americans currently suffer from this disease, and because itdoesn’t just affect those who have Alzheimer’s, but those who love them, theripple effect of pain is tremendous.Dr. Raji has been involved in brain imaging and Alzheimer’s research for sevenyears, but for the last five years he’s concentrated his research on howlifestyle factors can affect our brains positively or negatively. Using aspecial type of brain scan, researchers can measure the overall amount of volumein the brain as well as the volume in individual parts of the brain. The largerthe volume in a brain, the healthier it is. When a brain is unhealthy or getsold, it will shrink, and the neurons will get smaller as well. But when a personhas Alzheimer’s disease, the neurons don’t just shrink—they actually begin todie in the parts of the brain that are responsible for memory, organization, andpersonality.Dr. Raji has been involved with a study that began in the 1980s, following 450individuals over a period of twenty years, specifically to observe how lifestylefactors affected their brains as they aged. Some amount of brain shrinkage isnormal in aging. Scientists call this process atrophy; the brain shrinks muchthe way a muscle will shrink when you don’t use it. As the brain atrophies,senior moments happen with increased frequency.However, in Alzheimer’s disease, because the neurons are dying, there areactually fewer of them in the parts of the brain that help a person organizetheir day, remember things and people and places, and make up a large part oftheir personality.One of the first studies that Dr. Raji worked on looked at how obesity affectedbrain volume in a group of normal people (individuals with no indication ofbrain deterioration issues). I mentioned this study in chapter 1[Amen_9780307888563_epub_c01_r1.htm], but it is worth repeating. He measuredobesity using the body mass index (BMI), which is your weight divided by yourheight squared. A normal BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9; overweight is 25 to 29.5(one hundred million Americans are in this category), and over 30 is consideredobese (seventy-two million people in our country fall into this category). WhatDr. Raji and his research team found was that the higher the obesity, the lowerthe brain volume and the higher the risk for Alzheimer’s. Those who wereoverweight had some shrinkage. Those who were not overweight had nopreshrinkage. This is the study upon which I base what I call the dinosaursyndrome in my PBS specials: the bigger the body, the smaller the brain. Notgood. Dr. Raji’s group repeated the study using seven hundred individuals withearly stage Alzheimer’s and found that obesity makes things worse. (They didn’tuse people in late stage Alzheimer’s because people at this stage are thin sincethey are forgetting to feed themselves, and at this point, losing weight is notgoing to help their brain. It’s too late.)When Dr. Raji published this study, it received a lot of media attention. It wasa “downer of a finding,” Dr. Raji said in a recent conversation. This was thestimulus to find something positive that might help alter a bad brain trend. Sohe began to look at how lifestyle factors, particularly physical activity, mighthelp the brain. He and his team looked at the most basic kind of simply physicalactivity anyone at any age can do: walking. He knew if they could prove thatwalking helped the brain, then it would follow that more exercise would do thesame or perhaps even more good for brain volume.“We looked at the effect of walking on 299 cognitively normal subjects,” Cyrusshared. “We found that people who walked a mile a day or about twelve cityblocks, six times a week, had increased brain volume over time in areas formemory and learning.” Taking it further, he discovered that there would be a 50percent reduction in the possibility of getting Alzheimer’s over a thirteen-yeartest period. (Another way to say this is that Alzheimer’s was cut down by afactor of two.)In November of 2010, Dr. Raji looked at 127 people who had what we call mildcognitive impairment (lots of “senior moments”) and were at a high risk forgetting Alzheimer’s or early stage Alzheimer’s. “We looked at the effect walkinghad on their susceptible brains. In this study, we only had people walk aboutfive miles a week, or three-quarters of a mile per day. The good news was thatwalking preserved their brain volume. It didn’t increase their brain volume butit helped them to preserve what they had, without further brain shrinkage.” Thisbenefit even extended to those in the obese category. For anyone of any weight,walking stemmed the tide of brain atrophy.Dr. Raji is often asked about other types of exercise for people who don’t likewalking. His reply is always, “Do what you like to do because you’re more likelyto participate in it more often. Being physically active improves blood flow tothe brain. It delivers oxygen and other nutrients to your neurons.”JUST DO IT: KEEP AN EXERCISE STREAKWhen software developer Brad Isaac asked Jerry Seinfeld, who in those days wasstill a touring comic, what his secret was, Seinfeld asked Isaac to pick up oneof those wall calendars that had the entire year on a single page. To Seinfeld,becoming a better comedian meant writing every day, so for each day Jerry workedon his writing he would put a big red X in the box for that day. Pretty soon,there’d be a chain of red Xs and not breaking the chain became its ownmotivation. Some people might think Andy McGill’s dedication extreme, but it isoften the hallmark of a successful person. Keep a good streak going.There are moments when, caught up in the mental resistance that keeps us fromgetting started, we forget just how enjoyable the act of doing really is. Whenyou’ve finally started and you’re engaged in the work, you think, “Hey, I kindof like this.” What I love about the Seinfeld calendar idea is that it lets youdivert your stubbornness away from the “I don’t wannas” and redirect to notwanting to mess up a good winning streak.When I was in Sacramento recently for public television, the station managerused the same technique for exercise. He got on his treadmill for thirty minutesa day and marked an X on the calendar. So satisfying was that series of Xs thathe felt he had to keep his streak going. Then it became a habit. I urge you totry the “wall calendar and X system” as you begin your habit of daily exercise.This simple visual engages the brain in a way that motivates your body to getwith the program. The chart appeals to your logical PFC; but the series of Xs,signifying accomplishment, gives your limbic system a little rush of goodfeelings. Ka-ching! Your brain is buying in!Bottom line? Find an exercise you like, whether it is walking around the blockor hitting the gym or dancing with the stars (in your living room) and make upyour mind, in firm intention to just do it. Your body and brain will thank youfor decades and decades to come!CHANGE YOUR AGE NOW: TWENTY BRAIN HABITS TO GET YOU MOVING FOR A LONG ANDHEALTHY LIFE! 1. It is never too late to be the person you always wanted to be. Stopping abad habit, like drinking too much, and adopting a new one, like exercising everyday, is something anyone can do when they have truly made up their mind tochange. Consider “doing an Andy McGill”—stop a bad habit today, and replace itwith a new one right away. 2. Most “social drinkers” underestimate the amount they drink and the damageit is doing to their brains. Take a look at Andy’s “before SPECT” scan again. Ifyou know you are drinking too much, remember that excess alcohol is toxic toyour brain. The “potholes” in an alcohol-soaked brain scan represent areas whereyour brain is not getting enough blood to function well. Determine to make yourbrain a “toxin-free zone” and get the blood pumping through it again! 3. Adopt Andy’s attitude that daily exercise will ensure that one part of yourday will be great! No matter what else happens, you can enjoy and feel energizedin the special time you set aside to love yourself by investing in your health.Good mood endorphins are your immediate reward! Good health is the long-termpayoff. 4. Start a streak and don’t stop it! Try getting a calendar that you use onlyto keep track of your exercise. Make an X on it every day you exercise and set agoal to have five to seven Xs on your calendar every week for the month. Rewardyourself when you meet that goal! Then do it again, and again and again . . . 5. Your brain knows whether or not you mean business when you make aresolution. Set aside some time to let your brain and body know that yourcommitment to change is no joke by saying to yourself, with deep conviction, “Idon’t care what anyone else says or does. I don’t care what happens or whatchallenges I face. I don’t care how hard it is. I am going to do this. I amgoing to change.” Write it down and reread your promise to yourself often. 6. Begin every morning by reminding yourself how you want to be and feel. Helpcreate your own great day by doing this. Also remind yourself of how you don’twant to feel and what steps you’ll need to take to ensure you have a fabulousday—beginning with taking time out of your day for exercise. 7. Expect for it to take some time to push pass the discomfort of adding a newroutine, like daily physical activity, into your life. The brain likes thestatus quo, but it can be trained to change and upgrade itself. Take custody ofyour brain and body! Push through the unease, until exercise becomes a familiarand routine habit, like brushing your teeth. 8. Instead of reaching for sweets, fatty snacks, or alcohol when you arestressed, do something that will really work to lower anxiety and upset: Work upa sweat! Working out helps you manage stress by immediately lowering stresshormones, and it makes you more resistant to stress over time. 9. If you are suffering from mild to moderate depression or even a temporarylow mood, remember that exercise can be as effective as an antidepressantwithout the negative side effects. In fact, the side effects are positive:You’ll look better, have a better body, and increase your libido. Even if youtake antidepressants for severe depression, exercise can boost the effects.10. Besides longevity, looking good, and enjoying more energy, remind yourselfthat exercise is one of the best and proven preventions for dementia, cognitivedecline, and Alzheimer’s. If scientists could patent a pill with these kinds ofresults, they’d be very rich.11. Everyone is motivated to get healthy for different reasons, but I have foundthat sharing the research finding that “as your weight goes up, your brain sizegoes down” is a powerful motivator for many people to get moving and get theirweight under control.12. Most people who do not exercise first thing in the morning, won’t get itdone. The day and its to-do lists invade us and provide excuses to miss ourworkout. Do your physical activity routine in the morning as part of yourregular morning routine, and the habit will be easier to maintain.13. Walking a mile six days a week is generally an easy and doable activity formost people and proven to help protect the brain. However, the best exercise foryou is the one you will do! If swimming is your thing, by all means do that andenjoy it! If you like tennis, incorporate that into your weekly routine. Dowhatever exercise floats your boat. The main thing is to simply do it, and do italmost every day, for consistency.14. Consider dancing if you enjoy the music and the beat. It can keep you youngat heart, can lift depression, keep you socially connected, and enhance yourbrain and your body.15. Ever notice that you sleep better on days when you get physically active?And that you may have trouble getting to sleep and staying asleep when you’ve“couch potatoed” the day away? Engaging in exercise on a routine basisnormalizes melatonin production in the brain and helps give you a good night’sworth of z’s. Good sleep enhances your mood and decision making and also lowersyour risk for obesity and depression.16. Want to look younger? Those who do not exercise look older because they havemore loose skin on their face and neck. Those who exercise tend to look yearsyounger than those who do not.17. Lifting weights or using your own weight as resistance can increase yourmuscle strength and stamina, and tighten up the muscles beneath your skin,giving you a whole body “lift.” While watching TV, do some sit-ups and push-upsor leg lifts or squats. Keep a pair of handheld weights near the couch and pumpsome iron while you are watching the tube.18. Get the lead out! Walking speed is a predictor of longevity, so try to put alittle pep in your step. I tell people to walk as if they are late for ameeting.19. Stretching and bending exercises such as yoga, Pilates, and tai chi helpstrengthen your core, support flexibility, reduce stress, and aid in balance,which can reduce your risk of falls.20. To really burn calories, try burst training, which involves going all outfor a few minutes followed by more moderate exercise. Run as fast as you can fora minute, and then walk fast for four minutes and repeat until thirty minutes ormore is up."},{"pageContent":"4JOSE[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_L01_r1.jpg]THEN WHAT? OPTIMIZE YOUR PREFRONTAL CORTEX TO FUEL CONSCIENTIOUSNESS AND MAKEBETTER, HEALTHIER DECISIONSI don’t tell lies, because I can look into the future and see that it is moretrouble than it’s worth.—CHLOE, AGE 7In large part, your behavior is driven by the actual, physical functioning ofyour brain. When your brain works right, you are more likely to act inthoughtful, conscientious ways that help you live longer. When your brain istroubled, you are much more likely to act in impulsive, careless, thoughtlessways that put you at risk for illness and early death. One of the smartestthings you can do to increase the length and quality of your life is to optimizethe physical functioning of your brain. Jose’s story is a perfect example.JOSEIn early 2010 a producer from the Dr. Phil show called and asked if I would helpwith a program on infidelity. They wanted me to evaluate and do SPECT scans onJose, a compulsive cheater. When I first met Jose, he and his wife, Angela, werestruggling with his infidelity, lies, and addiction to porn. As far as she knew,in their four-year relationship Jose had cheated on her eight times. On theshow, Dr. Phil replied to the eight incidences of infidelity by saying, “Myfather used to say for every rat you see there are fifty you don’t.”They had been married three months when Angela found out Jose was cheating onher. She discovered that he had been with another girl when he asked her tomarry him, when they were planning the wedding, and two days after they hadBella, their now three-year-old little girl.“I was devastated and very angry,” Angela said. “I gave my gun to my mom becauseI thought I was going to shoot him. After I took him back I found out he cheatedon me with numerous girls. He is a chronic liar and he is very good at it. Oneof my friends told me that she saw Jose on a sex tape punching a girl in theface. She was passed out and pretty messed up. He likes rough sex and had triedto have rough sex with me. He tries to push to see how far he can go. He is athrill seeker and needs constant stimulation. I got involved with SexaholicsAnonymous because I thought he had a problem, but instead he starting using itas an excuse. He would say, ‘It’s an addiction, I can’t help it.’ That’s a bunchof crap. He doesn’t think. He just does things and then afterward says he willfind a way to deal with it.”Jose said, “I have always been the kind of guy who would just hook up whensomeone comes along. I was out of the home for five weeks before we decided topatch things up. Before we got married I never felt guilt. My father was acheater. I am worried I have a sexual addiction because I have a need forsomething stimulating, such as affairs, fast cars, living on the edge. I lost mydriver’s license for getting four speeding tickets. In the last year, I havebeen faithful but had a problem with pornography.”On the show, Dr. Phil asked Jose, “If this is your proclivity, why not get adivorce and go do what you wanted to do?” Jose replied that it was not what hewanted. He wanted to be married, to have a family, and to raise his daughter.His father was a cheater, which had a negative effect on his family. He wantedto be a positive influence for his daughter.When I saw Jose he had a number of issues besides the chronic infidelity. He wasan adrenaline junkie who had a high need for speed along with excitement-seekingbehavior. His brain SPECT scan showed three highly significant abnormalities:1. Increased activity in a part of the front part of the brain called theanterior cingulate gyrus, which is the brain’s gear shifter. Increased activityin this part of the brain is often associated with compulsive behavior, wherethe gear shifter becomes stuck on negative thoughts or negative behaviors. Inaddition to the cheating, Jose compulsively got tattoos. He was tattooed fromhead to toe. Even though Jose was a smart man, the tattoos had prevented himfrom getting work.2. Decreased activity in another part of the front part of the brain, theprefrontal cortex (PFC). The PFC acts like the cop in your head and helps youstay on track toward your goals without going down the wrong path. The PFC isalso thought of as the brain’s brake and helps prevent us from saying or actingon the first thing that comes to mind. From Jose’s scan and behavior, his PFCwas in trouble.3. A head-injury pattern. Jose’s scan clearly showed evidence of brain trauma,with areas damaged in the front and back part of his brain.Initially, I asked Jose if he ever had a brain injury.He said no.But as someone who has scanned the brains of tens of thousands of patients, Iknew the pattern in Jose’s brain was in part from a head injury, so I persisted.Again he said no. I have heard this same story so often that it is a runningjoke at the Amen Clinics. People initially tell us they have not had significanthead injuries. Then we see the obvious pattern of a brain injury on their scansand persist in probing further. Eventually they will tell us things like, “Ifell out of a second-story window” or “I fell down the stairs” or “I broke mycar windshield with my head” in forgotten accidents. Or, as was the case withone of our NFL players, his car crashed through a mountain guard rail and fell150 feet to a riverbed below, knocking him unconscious.Normal Surface Brain SPECT Scan[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_034_r1.jpg]Full, even, symmetrical activityJose’s Surface Brain SPECT Scan[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_035_r1.jpg]Decreased activity in the front (prefrontal cortex) and the back of the brain,consistent with a prior brain injury or injuriesNormal Active Brain SPECT Scan[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_036_r1.jpg]Highest activity at back of brainJose’s Active Brain SPECT Scan[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_037_r1.jpg]Increased anterior cingulate activity in front part of the brain consistent withtrouble shifting attention (arrow)“Yes,” Jose finally admitted. “I played football in high school.” He then toldme about a number of times he had concussions. Next, he volunteered that he wasa bull rider and a mixed martial artist and had been hit hard in the head manytimes. And then, almost underneath his breath, he said, “And I am a headbanger.”“Excuse me?” I responded.With an embarrassed smile, Jose said, “I used to break things with my head. Itwas like a party trick. I could break cans and beer bottles with my forehead.”All of us have a running dialogue in our minds whenever we are talking toothers. Psychiatrists are no different. When I heard Jose say that he used tobreak bottles with his head, I thought to myself, “This is not a sign ofintelligent life.” But I did not say it out loud, because I have a good PFC anda fairly strong internal brake.But then Jose added, “When I got drunk I’d often put dents in doors and wallswith my head. I can usually find the studs in the walls with my head.”At this, my own internal brake betrayed me, and I said out loud, “That is not asign of intelligent life.”Jose agreed.The day of the Dr. Phil show taping was emotional. Angela was angry and wantedJose to change. She thought he could just will it to be so. Angela said, “UnlessI see a complete change I am done.”I knew better. Even the best intentions are thwarted by an unhealthy brain.On the show Jose said he was excited to see the results of the scans.In his no-nonsense Texas drawl, Dr. Phil said, “It is odd to hear someone saythey are excited to have brain damage. You think this gives you a pass. It islike, ‘Hey, it’s not my fault, my brain’s not right.’ ”Jose then said something very profound. “I am not thinking of this as an excuse,but I am hoping this might be a key to help change my behavior.”The show then took an interesting twist. Dr. Phil asked the audience whetherthey thought sexual addiction was a real biological phenomenon or just an excusefor bad behavior. The audience was of the opinion that it was just an excuse.I understand why people feel this way, but from the brain scans I have seen andmy years of experience in helping people unravel from addictions, I know thereare strong brain issues at play. I have seen sexual addictions ruin people’slives and bring many addicts to the point of financial ruin and even suicide. Ialso believe that addictions, including sexual addictions, are going to getworse in our society as we are wearing out the brain’s pleasure centers by theconstant exposure to highly stimulating activities, such as video games, textmessaging, sexting, Internet pornography, scary movies, and highly addictivefoods like cinnamon rolls and double cheeseburgers.There is an area deep in the brain called the nucleus accumbens that isresponsive to the pleasure and motivation chemical dopamine. Think of thenucleus accumbens as one of the main pleasure levers in the brain. Whenever wefeel pleasure, a little bit of dopamine has pressed on the lever. If the leveris pushed too hard, such as with drugs like cocaine, we can feel a rush ofpleasure that causes us to lose control over our behavior, or if it is pushedtoo often, it becomes sensitized or numb and we need more and more pleasure inorder to feel anything at all. Moreover, if you have low activity in the brakingactivity of the PFC, the nucleus accumbens can literally take control of yourlife, as in Jose’s case. To live long, it is important to protect your pleasurecenters and prefrontal cortex.Even though it sounds odd, be careful with experiencing too much pleasure. Ithink one of the reasons actors and high-performance athletes have problems withdepression and addiction is because their success can give them free access toanything they want at any given moment, and this often wears out their pleasurecenters.After the show, Jose and Angela agreed to see me for help. He was in enough painthat he was willing to follow my recommendations. Here was his prescription:Stop drinking alcohol. Alcohol lowers Jose’s PFC function and decreases hisbrain’s braking power, which makes him less able to say no to his urges.Get enough sleep to maintain healthy brain function. Getting less than six hoursof sleep at night has been associated with lower overall blood flow to thebrain, which leads to more bad decision making.Clean up his diet. Only eat healthy food that serves his optimal brain function.Eat multiple times a day to keep his blood sugar stable. Low blood sugar resultsin more bad decision making.Eliminate the caffeine and energy drinks that were a staple of his diet.Caffeine constricts blood flow to the brain. Anything that lowers or constrictsblood flow to the brain increases bad decision making.Add the following supplements to enhance his brain:• Serotonin Mood Support to support healthy serotonin levels and calm hisanterior cingulate gyrus and compulsive behaviors.• Focus and Energy Optimizer to support healthy dopamine levels and boost hisprefrontal cortex, focus, and impulse control.• Brain and Memory Power Boost to help restore healthy brain function. This isthe same supplement we used in our NFL brain rehabilitation study.• High-quality fish oil.Over the next seven months I regularly saw Jose, Angela, and their adorabledaughter, Bella, to monitor their progress. In our sessions we discussed hisnutrition, supplements, and strategies to control his urges, which were becomingless and less powerful.I had Jose plant the question “Then what?” in his head to help boost his PFC bythinking about the future consequences of his behavior. It finally clicked whenhe heard the chorus of the Clay Walker song “Then What?” Jose realized that ifhe didn’t ask “Then what?” and make new, better choices he was going to besomebody who “ain’t anybody anyone’s gonna trust.”Things were going so well for Jose and Angela that they started to discusshaving another child. They went to Hawaii on vacation to talk more about theirfuture together. While there Jose saw people jumping off a sixty-foot cliff intothe water below. His immediate reaction was that he wanted to do it too. Being athrill seeker had been part of his life for a very long time. Some would say itwas part of his DNA. As Jose hiked up the hillside, Angela rolled her eyes,thinking yet again to herself, “He is such a showoff.” She had seen him do somany stupid things throughout their time together. Would it ever end?But this time things were different. Very different.When Jose got to the top of the cliff and looked down, something happened in hismind. He started to feel uncomfortable, even anxious. Even though he saw otherpeople jumping off the cliff, he realized that because he could not clearly seethe rocks jutting up in the water, it would be hard to avoid them. He thought tohimself, “Then what? What if I land wrong? What if I get hurt? What if I amparalyzed? I have a wife and child and we want another child. Being paralyzedwill not help any of us. Do I really need to do this?”He stepped out of line to think about his next move. This level of thought,pausing to contemplate the consequences of a risky action, was new for Jose.After a minute or so, he decided not to jump. With a sense of freedom, he beganwalking down the hillside. Angela was stunned. She had never seen Jose doanything like that before. Maybe there was hope.Shortly after his trip to Hawaii, we did a follow-up SPECT scan on Jose, whichshowed dramatic improvement from seven months earlier.Jose’s First SPECT Scan[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_038_r1.jpg]Decreased activity in the front (prefrontal cortex) and the back of the brainconsistent with a prior brain injury(s)Jose’s Follow-up SPECT Scan Seven Months Later[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_039_r1.jpg]Overall dramatic improvementBy working the treatment plan, Jose literally changed his brain and dramaticallyimproved and likely extended his life. As I write this story it has been over ayear and a half since I first met Jose, Angela, and Bella. They remain happy,together, and hopeful about their future as an intact family. Angela no longerfeels she needs to give her gun to her mother, and Jose has been faithful and ismaking decisions that will likely extend his life through better forethought.CONSCIENTIOUSNESS AND LONGEVITYI know many researchers are looking for the fountain of youth and hoping to findit in a new medication or natural supplement. I am rooting for these researchersto help us. But nothing will ever be as important to your longevity as thequality of the decisions you make throughout your life in regard to your healthand your relationships. The quality of these decisions is a direct reflection ofthe physical health of your brain.According to a remarkable longitudinal study, one of the main predictors oflongevity is conscientiousness. The study was started in 1921 by Dr. LewisTerman of Stanford University. He and his team evaluated 1,548 bright childrenwho were born around 1910. Over the course of ninety years, researchers havediscovered many fascinating findings that clearly point to healthy brainfunction and longevity. Here are some of their major findings:• Hard work and accomplishment (usually associated with good brain function) arestrong predictors of longevity.• Those who were most disappointed with their achievements died the youngest.• Being undependable and unsuccessful in careers (usually the sign of poor brainfunction) was associated with a whopping increase in mortality.• Reaction to a loss with drinking, depression, anxiety, or catastrophizing wasassociated with early death (further causing poor brain function). On the otherhand, those who, following a period of grief and adjustment (using brain healthyrecovery skills), thrived after loss, got a “resiliency bonus” and lived anaverage of five years longer than average.• An optimistic, carefree attitude encouraged people to underestimate risks andapproach their health in a lackadaisical fashion, which decreased longevity.They died more often from accidents and avoidable deaths (behaviors associatedwith poor PFC function and subsequent poor planning). Some in the media haveerroneously interpreted this study to mean that “pessimists live longer thanoptimists.” This is not true; optimists of the hardworking, careful variety livelonger lives than the average person. It is the “carefree” optimists who neverworry, plan, or think about future consequences who do not live as long.• Thoughtful planning and perseverance (usually associated with good brainfunction) were associated with longevity.• Prudent, persistent achievers with stable families and social support livedlonger (all signs of healthy brain function).• People with habits, routines, and social networks that encouraged exercise didthe best.• Social relationships dramatically impact health. The group you associate withoften determines the type of person you become. For people who want to improvetheir health, association with other healthy people is usually the strongest andmost direct path to change.• Moderate worry, meaning you care and think about the future, is an importantpart of staying healthy.Clearly, this research and my own clinical experience have shown that someanxiety is good. People like Jose, who are risk takers and have low levels ofanxiety, take unreasonable risks, which can lead to an early grave. Obviously,too much anxiety is bad. But not enough anxiety has been associated with morefaulty decisions about health and safety.People who are conscientious and “finish what they start” seem to have a reducedrisk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, according to a twelve-year studyinvolving Catholic nuns and priests. The most self-disciplined individuals werefound to be 89 percent less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease than theirpeers. Robert Wilson and colleagues from Rush University Medical Center inChicago followed 997 healthy Catholic nuns, priests, and Christian brothersbetween 1994 and 2006. At the beginning of the study, the clergy completed apersonality test to determine their level of conscientiousness. Based on answersto twelve questions such as “I am a productive person who always gets the jobdone,” they received a score ranging from 0 to 48. On average, volunteers scored34. Over the duration of the study, 176 of the 997 participants developedAlzheimer’s disease. However, those with the highest score on the personalitytest—40 points or above—had an 89 percent lower chance of developing Alzheimer’sthan participants who received 28 points or lower. Dr. Wilson hypothesized thatmore conscientious individuals likely have more activity in their PFCs, andother researchers have confirmed this finding.LOVE AND CARE FOR YOUR PFCThe PFC is larger in humans than in any other animal by far. It comprises:• 30 percent of the human brain• 11 percent of the chimpanzee brain• 7 percent of your dog’s brain (unless your dog is my dog, Tinkerbell, whowon’t stop barking at strangers; hers is likely 4 percent)• 3 percent of your cat’s brain (which is why they need nine lives)• 1 percent of a mouse’s brainNeuroscientists call the PFC the executive part of the brain because itfunctions like the boss at work. It is the CEO inside your head. Comedian DudleyMoore once said, “The best car-safety device is a rearview mirror with a cop init.” Your PFC acts like the cop in your head that helps to prevent you frommaking bad decisions.[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_040_r1.jpg]Prefrontal CortexIt is like our own personal Jiminy Cricket. If it’s not in good working order,ill-considered decisions can put you at risk for a miserable life, and even anearly death.The PFC is involved with:• Forethought• Judgment• Impulse control• Attention• Organization• Planning• Empathy• Insight• Learning from mistakesA healthy PFC helps you think about and plan your goals (e.g., “I want to live along, healthy life”), and it keeps you on track for the long run.Low activity in the PFC has been associated with:• Lack of forethought• Short attention span• Impulsivity• Procrastination• Disorganization• Poor judgment• Lack of empathy• Lack of insight• Not learning from mistakesThe PFC is not fully developed until people are in their midtwenties. Eventhough we think of eighteen-year-olds as adults, their brains are far fromfinished. Scientists are now learning what insurance companies have known for along time. When do car insurance rates change? At age twenty-five. Why? Becausethat is when people display better driving judgment and are less likely to getinto accidents and cost the insurance companies more money.Below is a graph of activity in the prefrontal cortex across the lifespan. It isbased on over six thousand scans we have done in our clinics. You can see that achild’s PFC is very active, but over time the activity begins to settle downbecause unused connections are being pruned and brain cells are being wrappedwith a white fatty substance called myelin.[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_041_r1.jpg]Myelin acts like insulation on copper wires and helps our brain cells work moreefficiently. In fact, cells wrapped with myelin work ten to a hundred timesfaster than those without it. The prefrontal cortex is not fully myelinated, orefficient, until we are about twenty-five years old. Anything that disruptsmyelin formation can actually delay or damage brain development. All of thefollowing disrupt myelin formation:• Smoking• Drinking alcohol• Drug use• Brain trauma• Poor diet• Too much stress• Not enough sleepIf we want our children to make better decisions for their lifetime, we need todo a much better job of taking care of their brains, since the PFC provides thehorsepower for their decision-making skills for the rest of their lives.Our research also shows a new burst of increased activity in the PFC after theage of fifty.As I looked at this part of the curve, I began to think of the wisdom of age.Have you ever noticed that many “silly” things become less important as we age?We know the difference between “big stuff” and “small stuff”—and most of itreally is “small stuff.” We become more thoughtful and more able to focus onwhat really matters in life, which is why some people make better grandparentsthan they do parents.Bill Cosby has a great routine in which he says that his children think theirgrandmother is the most wonderful person on the face of the earth. “I keeptelling my children,” he says, “that this is not the same woman that I grew upwith. You are looking at an old person who is trying to get into heaven.” Thatmay be true, but more likely it has to do with the wisdom of age. If you takecare of your brain, over time you are more likely to be wiser, because wisdom isa brain function based on intelligence born of many life experiences. Wisdomalso helps us keep the Grim Reaper at a distance from our door.Another way to think of the development of the PFC is to think about maturity. Ithink of maturity as not making the same mistakes over and over. Mature peoplehave a more thoughtful approach to their lives. As the PFC becomes myelinated,people act with more forethought and are likely to make fewer mistakes.THE DINOSAUR SYNDROME REVISITED: BIG BODY, LITTLE BRAIN, BECOME EXTINCTI, along with my colleagues Kristen Willeumier, Ph.D. (a director of research)and Derek Taylor (a data analyst), published an important study in theprestigious Nature Publishing Group Journal, “Obesity,” which demonstrated thatas weight went up in a healthy group of people, the function of their PFC wentdown in highly significant ways.Over the last decade there is growing evidence that shows the harmful effects oftoo much fat on your body. In a study of 1,428 Japanese men, researchers foundsignificant decreases in brain size in the PFC and temporal lobes (learning andmemory). Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, andcolleagues found that in healthy adults a high BMI (body mass index) wasinversely correlated with activity in the PFC. Elevated BMI has also beenassociated with myelin abnormalities in the PFC of healthy normal and elderlyadults.The goal of our study was to test the hypothesis that an elevated BMI isassociated with lower blood flow to the PFC in a healthy group of people onbrain SPECT imaging. To that end, we compared our group of “healthy” subjectswho had a high BMI with people in our “healthy” group of normal weight. Theresults of our study were very clear. The high BMI group had statisticallysignificant lower activity in the PFC compared with the normal group.Obesity is becoming a worldwide epidemic and is a risk factor for many chronicconditions, including cardiovascular disease, depression, and neurodegenerativediseases like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. It has been recently found to beworse for your liver than alcoholism.We were not able to determine if problems in the PFC led to increasedimpulsivity and subsequent obesity or if being overweight or obese directlycaused brain changes. Both scenarios may be true. The fact that we used ahealthy-brain group and specifically excluded ADHD or other behavioral disordersargues against the premorbid hypothesis, but other studies have shown anassociation between ADHD and obesity. Still other authors report that fat tissuedirectly increases inflammatory chemicals, which likely have a negative effecton brain structure and function.One of the major problems with being overweight or obese is that there isevidence that it damages your PFC, which as we have seen is the majordecision-making part of the brain. So if you do not get your weight undercontrol, it will become harder and harder to use your own good judgment overtime to get and stay healthy. Now is the time to start enhancing your health andlongevity, not at some arbitrary point in the future, which most likely willnever come.ADHD, PFC PROBLEMS, AND EARLY DEATHADHD is associated with low activity in the PFC. Initially, ADHD was thought ofas a childhood disorder that most kids outgrew by the time they turned twelve orthirteen. The hallmark symptoms of ADHD are short attention span, being easilydistracted, disorganization, hyperactivity (trouble sitting still), and poorimpulse control. People with ADHD, like Jose, often exhibit excitement-seekingor conflict-seeking behavior; they also tend to have trouble with time (they areoften late and turn in assignments at the last minute). Over the last threedecades it has become clear that many ADHD children continue to havedebilitating symptoms for the rest of their lives. They tend to outgrow thephysical hyperactivity but not the problems with disorganization, inattention,distractibility, and impulse control. Untreated ADHD has been associated with ahigher incidence of:• Drug and alcohol abuse (impulsivity and to calm feelings of hyperactivity)• Relationship problems (impulsivity and conflict seeking)• School failure (attentional problems and impulsivity)• Job-related problems (problems with time, attention, and impulse control)• Medical problems (associated with chronic stress, plus more head trauma withthe excitement-seeking behavior)• Obesity (lack of impulse control)• Depression (chronic failure)• Lack of conscientiousness (all of the above)In the book I wrote with noted neurologist Rod Shankle, Preventing Alzheimer’s,we argued that ADHD is likely associated with Alzheimer’s disease because of itsconnection with many of the illnesses that put people at risk for it, such asalcohol abuse, obesity, depression, and head trauma. This is very important,because when ADHD goes untreated, a person will not be able to control his orher impulses, setting him up for significant health problems, poor decisions,and earlier death. If you or someone you love has symptoms of ADHD, it isimportant to be treated. Natural ways to treat ADHD, in my experience, includeintense aerobic exercise, a very healthy diet, a multivitamin, fish oil, andsupplements (such as green tea, rhodiola, L-tyrosine) or medication (such asRitalin or Adderall) to enhance PFC function.Once you realize the absolutely critical role of the PFC to longevity, you thenneed to do everything possible to protect it and rehabilitate it if necessary.BOOST YOUR PFC TO REIN IN YOUR INNER CHILD AND BOOST CONSCIENTIOUSNESSAll of the information in this book is designed to help you win the war in yourhead between the adult, thoughtful part of your brain (the PFC), which knowswhat you should do, and your pleasure centers, which are run by a spoiled,demanding inner child who always wants what he wants whenever he wants it.Your brain’s pleasure centers are always looking for a good time.• They want to jump off a cliff.• They love going fast on a motorcycle in the rain.• They crave the ice cream.• They want the double cheeseburgers.• They will stand in line for the fresh cinnamon rolls.• They focus on having the second piece of cake.Left unchecked, your inner child is often whispering to you like a naughtylittle friend:“Do it now …”“It’s okay …”“We deserve it …”“Come on, let’s have some fun …”“You’re so uptight …”“Live a little …”“We already had one bowl of ice cream. Just one more won’t hurt …”“We’ll behave better tomorrow. I promise …”Without adult supervision, your inner child lives only in the moment and he canruin your life. I have a friend who shared that her daughter-in-law got sickwith the flu and had to remain in bed upstairs. Her four-year-old son decided to“take over” the house while his mother was otherwise occupied with a poundingheadache, fever, and vomiting. When his father came home, there was ice creammelting in puddles on the kitchen countertop; the pots and pans were arranged ina pyramid formation in the middle of the floor; cartoons were blaring on TV atfull volume; and clothes, toys, and blankets (made into tents and forts) werestrewn everywhere. Absolute anarchy and chaos. This is a great visual of whathappens to your life when your PFC is not functioning: Your inner child takesover while your inner adult is napping. The resulting mess is something tobehold.To balance your pleasure centers, and tame your inner child, the PFC helps youthink about what you do before you do it. It thinks about your future, not justabout what you want in the moment. Instead of thinking about the chocolate cake,it is the rational voice in your head that helps you:• Avoid having a big belly.• Remember that “food is medicine” and that you’ll be in a sugar-induced,cranky, sleepy mood an hour after eating that cake.• Remind your inner child of delicious but healthier alternatives that will bothtaste good and nourish your body.• Be concerned about your bulging medical bills.• Say no and mean it.When your PFC is strong, it reins in your inner child, so that you can have afun, passionate, meaningful life but in a thoughtful, measured, conscientiousway. To live a long healthy life, it is critical to strengthen your PFC and putyour inner child into time-out whenever he acts up.It is also critical to watch your internal dialogue and be a good parent toyourself. I have taught parenting classes for many years and the two words thatembody good parenting, even for your inner child, are firm and kind. When youmake a mistake with food or with your health, look for ways to learn from yourmistakes but in a loving way.CAN YOU CHANGE YOUR LEVEL OF CONSCIENTIOUSNESS?Changing one’s personality traits is never easy. They are thought to be enduringpatterns that ultimately come from stable patterns of brain function. But in theTerman study, researchers found that people can indeed increase or decreasetheir conscientiousness over time. Jose was able to do this, and I havewitnessed it in myself. As I have learned more and more about brain function anddeveloped brain envy, I have personally developed better habits and my behaviorhas been more consistent. I feel much more in control of my own behavior than Idid even four or five years ago. I have seen others’ conscientiousnessdeteriorate after a head injury, binge drinking or drug use, being exposed to anenvironmental toxin, or at the onset of developing dementia.Before discussing how to boost your level of conscientiousness, let’s firstdefine what it is. Conscientiousness concerns the way we manage our impulses.Impulses are not inherently good or bad. It is what we do with them that makesthem that way. Sometimes we need to make a snap decision and cannot think aboutit over and over. Other times we want to be spontaneous and fun, especially whenwe are relaxing. But when it becomes a way of life, it can take a seriouslynegative toll on your health. Giving in to immediate desires, like thedoughnuts, often produces immediate rewards but undesirable long-termconsequences. Impulsive behavior can lead to being fired from your job, divorce,drug or alcohol abuse, jail, or obesity, all of which have a negative impact onyour health. Acting impulsively often brings regret because you failed toentertain all of your options. The accomplishments of an impulsive person areoften smaller, more diffuse, and less consistent.A hallmark of intelligence and what separates us from other animals is ourability to think about the consequences of our behavior before acting on animpulse. It is the internal dialogue that accompanies “Then what?” Effectivedecisions usually involve forethought in relation to your goals, organizing, andplanning, which helps you not only live in the moment but to continue ten oreven fifty years from now. “Being prudent” is another label forconscientiousness. It means being wise and cautious. If you are conscientious,you are more likely to avoid troubled situations and be perceived as intelligentand reliable by others. If you go overboard, of course, others will think youare a compulsive perfectionist or a workaholic.SIX FACETS OF CONSCIENTIOUSNESS1. True confidence. You have a true feeling of being self-efficacious. You knowyou can get things done.2. Organized, but not compulsive. Keep an orderly home or office and keep listsand make plans.3. A high sense of duty. You have a strong sense of moral obligation.4. Achievement oriented. Drive to be successful at whatever you do and have astrong sense of direction.5. Persistence. You have the ability to stay on track despite the obstacles thatmight come your way.6. Thoughtfulness. You are disposed to think through possibilities and theconsequences of your behavior before acting.Here are steps to optimize both your PFC and level of conscientiousness to boostthe control you have over your life.1. “Then What?” Always carry this question with you. Think about theconsequences of your behavior before you act.2. Protect Your Brain from Injury or Toxins This should be obvious by now.3. Get Eight Hours of Sleep Less sleep equals lower overall blood flow to thePFC and more bad decisions.4. Keep Your Blood Sugar Balanced Throughout the Day Research studies say thatlow blood sugar levels are associated with lower overall blood flow to thebrain, poor impulse control, irritability, and more unfortunate decisions. Havefrequent smaller meals throughout the day that each have at least some protein.5. Optimize Your Omega-3 Fatty Acid Levels by Eating More Fish or Taking FishOil Low levels of omega-3 fatty acids have also been associated with ADHD,depression, Alzheimer’s disease, and obesity.6. Keep a “One-Page Miracle” On one piece of paper write down the specific goalsyou have for your life, including for your relationships, your work, your money,and your health. Then ask yourself every day, “Is my behavior today getting mewhat I want?” I call this exercise the One-Page Miracle, because it makes such adramatic difference in the lives of those who practice it. Your mind is powerfuland it makes happen what it sees. Focus and meditate on what you want.7. Practice Using Your PFC Self-control is like a muscle. The more you use it,the stronger it gets. This is why good parenting is essential to helpingchildren develop self-control. If we gave in to our eight-year-old every timeshe wanted something or threw a temper tantrum, we would raise a spoiled,demanding child. By saying no and not giving in to tantrums, we teach her to beable to say no to herself. To develop your PFC you need to do the same thing foryourself, practice saying no to the things that are not good for you, and overtime you will find it easier to do.8. Balance Your Brain Chemistry Illnesses such as ADD, anxiety, and depressiondecrease self-control. Getting help for these problems is essential to being incontrol of your life.Trying to use willpower to control your behavior when your sleep or brainchemistry is off, or when your omega-3 fatty acids or blood sugar levels arelow, is nearly impossible.BE THE BOSS OF YOUR LIFE AND YOUR LONGEVITYWhen I walk down the street and see people who are not healthy, I often say tomyself, “That person has made many, many bad decisions.” It frustrates mebecause I know with the right education and right environment they would behealthier and happier. When I see someone who is healthy I think, “That personhas made many, many good decisions.” It is the quality of the decisions you makethat helps you live a long time as a healthy human being or kills you early. Byapplying the principles in this book you can boost your PFC and have much bettercontrol of your health and your destiny. You can be the boss of your life,instead of allowing your cravings or the food companies to take your life early.A little forethought and an appropriate level of anxiety are all that isrequired. When confronted with choices between a spinach salad or a doublecheeseburger, between going to a late-night party or getting a good night’ssleep, between going for a hike or jumping off cliffs into the water below, canyou step back and ask yourself which choice is really in your best interest?Does the choice you favor make you better, stronger, healthier, more passionatefor your life? Or does it steal from your life? Choose to be in charge. Chooseto be the CEO of a long, healthy, vibrant, meaningful life.CHANGE YOUR AGE NOW: TWENTY TIPS TO HELP YOU MAKE BRAIN HEALTHY DECISIONS TODAY 1. When your brain is troubled, you are much more likely to act in impulsive,careless ways that put you at risk for illness and early death. When your brainworks right, you are more likely to act in thoughtful, conscientious ways thathelp you live longer. Prioritize your brain health and better behavior willfollow. 2. Nothing is more important to your longevity than the quality of thedecisions you make in your life. And the quality of your decisions is a directreflection of the physical health of your brain. Taking time to look at andupsize your brain health may be the most important decision you make to livestrong and long. 3. Decreased activity in the PFC has been associated with lack of forethoughtand poor judgment. When it does not get enough blood flow, you don’t have a goodworking brake on your impulses. Increasing blood flow to this area with brainhealthy habits, along with supplements, such as green tea and rhodiola, willhelp a person make better decisions, leading to a longer and happier life. 4. Head injuries, even minor concussions from the past, show up on SPECT scansand may affect your behavior and feelings years later. We often have to askpeople many times, “Have you ever had any sort of injury to your head?” beforethey recall the incident that hurt their brain. Recognizing and rehabilitatingthese injuries will dramatically increase the quality of all of your decisions. 5. Addictions, including sexual addictions, are made worse when we literally“wear out” the brain’s pleasure centers by the constant exposure to highlystimulating activities, such as video games, text messaging, sexting, Internetpornography, and scary movies. Take inventory of the adrenaline-producingactivities in your life: Eliminate the unhealthy ones, and take breaks fromthose activities (even good ones) that are becoming compulsive. 6. An overly optimistic, worry-free attitude (without forethought andplanning, which are PFC activities) leads people to underestimate risks andapproach them in lackadaisical fashion, decreasing longevity. Be optimistic, asthis is good for longevity; but balance this trait with a healthy level ofanxiety and careful thinking. 7. People who were persistent achievers with stable families, habits, androutines did the best in longevity studies. Consider your daily and weeklyroutines: Can you make them more brain friendly? For example, can you walksomewhere that you always drive to? Can you exchange an hour of TV for playingbrain games? 8. To make better decisions, make sure to optimize the blood flow to yourbrain by stabilizing your blood sugar (make sure you eat healthy and often),getting good sleep, limiting alcohol and caffeine, and eliminating nicotine. 9. If we want our children to make better decisions for their lifetime, weneed to do a much better job of taking care of their brains. The brain is notfully efficient until we are twenty-five years old. To avoid disrupting earlybrain development, help young people avoid smoking, substance abuse, braintrauma, a lousy diet, stress, and poor sleep.10. Our research shows a new burst of increased activity in the PFC after theage of fifty. We become more thoughtful and more able to focus on what reallymatters in life. Have a few wise friends over age fifty who can give youvaluable insight when making decisions.11. When fighting addictions or everyday temptations of any kind, always keepthis question in mind: “Then what?” Whenever you think about doing or sayingsomething, ask yourself about the consequences of your behavior. This questioncan serve as a caution or stop sign to a brain that is about to take you down abad path.12. A hallmark of intelligence and what separates us from other animals is ourability to think about the consequences of our behavior before acting on animpulse. It is the internal dialogue that accompanies “Then what?”13. A high percentage of people who struggle with addictions also have ADD orADHD. When left untreated, a person has less ability to control his or herimpulses, setting him up for significant health problems, poor decisions, andearly death. Natural ways to treat ADHD include intense aerobic exercise, a veryhealthy diet, a multiple vitamin, fish oil, and supplements (such as green tea,rhodiola, L-tyrosine) or medication (such as Ritalin or Adderall) to enhance PFCfunction.14. Being overweight is damaging to your PFC and can have a negative impact onthe decision-making part of the brain. Getting your weight under control,starting now, will help you enhance your health and longevity.15. Practicing self-control is a good exercise to strengthen your PFC. The moreyou use it the stronger it gets. To develop your PFC you need to practice sayingno to the things that are not good for you, and over time you will find iteasier to do.16. Low levels of omega-3 fatty acids have also been associated with ADHD,depression, Alzheimer’s disease, and obesity—all brain issues that lead to poordecision making. You can optimize your omega-3 fatty acid levels by eating morefish or taking fish oil.17. Keep a One-Page Miracle. On one piece of paper write down the specific goalsyou have for all the main areas of your life. Then ask yourself every day, “Ismy behavior getting me what I want?” This simple but profound activity can be oftremendous help in encouraging better daily choices that add up to a betterlife.18. On occasion, we all need to rein in our inner child who wants to eat junk,avoid sleep, or “play with fire.” But it is important to be a good parent toyourself, which means being firm and kind. When you make a mistake with food orwith your health, look for ways to learn from your mistakes but in a loving way.Emotionally healthy people deal with mistakes by acknowledging them, learningfrom them, and moving on from them as soon as possible.19. Hard work and accomplishment (usually associated with good brain function)are strong predictors of longevity.20. The quality and length of your life are direct reflections of the quality ofthe decisions you have made."},{"pageContent":"5JIM[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_L01_r1.jpg]BOOST YOUR BRAIN’S LIFE SPAN, SPEED, AND MEMORYYou know you’ve got to exercise your brain just like your muscles.—WILL ROGERSOnce you optimize the physical functioning of the brain, it is then critical tokeep it strong. Mental workouts and lifelong learning strategies are essentialtools to keep your brain young, agile, and adaptable. One of my friends spendshis life teaching people just how to do this. Jim’s real last name is Kwik.Which is uncanny, because today he helps others “speed up” their brain’sprocessing abilities. His list of clients is impressive, and he flies all overthe globe teaching corporations, executives, doctors, lawyers, and students thesecrets of how to improve brain function that he once stumbled upon in hislowest moments.“MY INSPIRATION WAS MY DESPERATION”“My inspiration was my desperation,” Jim told me. “I was a young guy, a freshmanattending college in New York. And I was struggling. The jump from high schoolto college was especially tough for me.” Jim was not prepared for the amount ofmaterial he was expected to read, assimilate, and regurgitate for his courses.“I worked harder than most of my friends, and this was tough on my self-esteem,as it is for anyone who struggles in school.” At school, like many first-yearcollege students I’ve treated, Jim was in a state of overwhelming stress, thelikes of which he’d never known before. He was juggling midterm exams, labs, andwriting papers, on top of trying to keep up. He went without sleep and food,studying and reading day and night. One day he simply passed out. “Two dayslater I woke up dazed and confused, and in a hospital. I had been trying so hardto learn and read everything, until I literally put my brain and body into astate of exhaustion. I was trying to drink water out of a fire hose and wasbarely surviving.”Jim thought to himself, “There has to be a better way.” His answer walked in thedoor, right at that moment, carried by a nurse. She held a hot mug of tea andhanded it to Jim. On the cup was a quote by Einstein: “Problems cannot be solvedby the same level of thinking that created them.” Looking at that quote, Jim gotchills down his spine.Jim was looking at the problem—his need to absorb information—and trying tosolve it the same way it was created, by pushing himself harder to absorb moreand more. He had been working harder. Now it was time to work smarter. It was inthat life-altering moment, when he was vulnerable and open to another way, thathe realized, School is great for teaching us what to learn. Where it fails isteaching us how to learn.Jim began asking himself questions: “How can people learn how to remember thingsmore easily? How do they use their brain to improve their focus? How can I trainmy brain to better handle the hordes of information coming at me? Is there aneasier way than rote learning?”INFORMATION OVERLOAD AND THE SECRETS TO BECOMING A LIFELONG LEARNEROur modern minds have to handle more information than ever before in history.For example, information is so fast-paced that it doubles now every two years.We have a half million words in the English language, five times as many wordsas in the time of Shakespeare. Someone who goes to college for a four-yeardegree may discover that by their third year of study, much of what they’velearned is already outdated. There’s more information in one issue of a New YorkTimes than a person in the eighteenth century would have been required to digestin his whole lifetime. If you look at the top in-demand jobs for 2011, most ofthem didn’t even exist in 2004. That’s a lot of change, a lot of information.Jim’s pain created questions, which in turn led to life-changing answers. Hebegan studying every book he could find on how to quicken the brain’s ability tolearn. What Jim learned radically changed his performance in school. He wasn’tworking as hard as before, but he got better grades with less effort. He beganto realize that if he could do this, anybody could. “There’s no such thing aspeople who have better memories than others,” he now tells his students. “Thereis a trained memory and an untrained memory.”Science verifies what Jim teaches. With a simple plan you can dramaticallyimprove your brain’s ability to think and remember. But to do this you have touse your brain on a regular basis. Here are some immediate tips to implement inyour life.Dedicate yourself to reading something that interests you for thirty minutes aday. The brain is like a muscle: you need to use it or you will lose yourability to use it. The biggest mental declines happen after we complete ourformal schooling and after retirement. Why? Because we are not pushing ourselvesto continue to learn, grow, and stretch our neurons. Reading helps the learningcontinue. People who are in a job that does not require continual learning areat greater risk for Alzheimer’s disease.Turn your car into a “university on wheels.” Listening to audiobooks is anotherway to keep your mind active and sharp. When I walk, I love listening to thelatest audiobook I’ve downloaded to my smartphone, which actually makes mesmarter.Journal every day. You’d be amazed at how many of the great men and women ofhistory kept a journal. Journaling can take many forms, from the conventionalpen-and-notebook-style journals to blogging or simply posting meaningful quotes,thoughts, and experiences on social media sites.Stay childlike when it comes to learning. Jim says, “My ninety-five-year-oldgrandmother is one of the youngest people I know.” It is because she has kepther childlike curiosity intact. Did you know that preschoolers ask between threehundred and four hundred questions a day? Not only should we never stop askingquestions, but we should be actively curious. Ask yourself, “What if?” and thenseek out the answers.Keep your emotional state primed for learning. All learning is dependent uponyour emotional state. A brain that is emotionally balanced is ready and primedfor learning. When we are bored, cranky, and tired, it doesn’t matter howinteresting the teacher might be, we are not going to learn anything new. If weare depressed or stressed or obsessed, all our brain energy is being used to tryto prop up our emotions for survival; very little is left for new learning. Useyour body to train your mind. The research is conclusive: Exercise helps thebrain learn better. We are all pretty familiar with the mind–body connectionnow. But fewer realize the body–mind connection, or how the body helps stimulatedifferent parts of the brain. For example, Jim teaches people to use theirfinger or a pen to follow the words on a page. This one simple act of using thebody to help the mind read will give you 25 percent increase in speed and focus.Create a positive learning environment. All learning is “state dependent.” “Welearn best,” Jim points out, “when we can get in that state known as flow, whenwe are alert and relaxed at the same time.” Other scientists call this a concertstate: a calm but focused mind, such as when you attend a symphony. Stress isthe enemy of learning. We tend to freeze up when stressed and we cannot take innew information or process it well in that mood state. Studies have shown thatstudents score higher on tests of recall and memory after they have been shown afunny movie clip. The laughter relaxes their brain so that it is optimized andopen to absorb new information.It pays to proactively create a positive environment for learning. Rooms thatare either too boring or too busy can distract from learning. Good lighting iskey. Some people learn better when there is beautiful art or music around.Baroque music that plays at sixty beats per minute has been shown to helplearning. Smells actually can anchor learning. Jim has his students learnsomething new while wearing a particular scent or smelling an essential oil.Later when they take the test or need to recall the information, he asks them towear the same scent or take a whiff of the essential oil and they’ll recall theinformation better. The olfactory senses are very tied to memory. We’ve all hadexperiences of catching a certain scent, like bread baking, and being drawn backto a warm memory.MEMORY TIPSMental practice is to the mind what physical exercise is to the body. One way toenhance your brain is to boost your memory skills. Brain cells in an area of thetemporal lobes, called the hippocampus, are responsive to training. These aresome of the first cells to die in Alzheimer’s disease, so working to keep themyoung is critical to lifelong brain health.Jim teaches his clients how to boost their memory abilities. We are allemotionally connected to our names, so when someone remembers our name andaddresses us by it, it makes us feel special. Here are some tips that Jimshared, which you can use to help remember people’s names. Note that you canalso use these strategies to help you remember other items. The acronym SUAVEspells out the key steps.S: Say the person’s name. When someone tells you his name, repeat it in anatural way. For example, someone tells you, “I’m Joshua.” Repeat his name in asentence: “Joshua, nice to meet you.”U: Use the person’s name. In a natural way, use this person’s name again as theconversation goes on. “Hey, Joshua, can I get you a cup of coffee?” (Remember touse it, but don’t abuse it. If you use his name in every other sentence you’llstart to sound like a salesman about to make a pitch.)A: Ask questions. This is especially good with unusual names. Ask the person,“How do you spell that?” Or comment, “That’s a beautiful and unusual name. Doyou know its origin?” Or “What does it mean?”V: Visualize the person’s name. Create a funny or unique or crazy image in yourmind. For example, if a person’s name is Mark, imagine you putting a checkmarkon his forehead. If his name is Michael, think of him grabbing a “microphone”and jumping up on a table to sing karaoke. For Alexis, picture a woman driving aLexus. The wilder the image, the better it will stick in your brain. Peoplesometimes ask Jim how he remembers so well and he responds, “How can I forgetit? You should see the crazy picture I created in my mind!”E: End every conversation with using their name before you say good-bye. “It wasgreat visiting with you, Bob,” you might say as you mentally visualize him“bobbing” for apples just one more time.Decide to focus on remembering people’s names for twenty-one days to embed thehabit. “I’d even make up names for people when I walked into a store,” says Jim,“just to see if I could remember their ‘made up’ names when I left the store.”SPEED READINGSince reading can help work out your brain, let’s enhance it with speed reading.Jim is an expert on teaching people this skill, so I asked him to share somesecrets with you. He says, “Reading faster is a skill that anyone can learn. Butto become a speed reader, it means to let go of or ‘unlearn’ what has been acomfortable, familiar, albeit slow habit. And the hard part is that sometimesyou have to slow down during relearning before you can speed up.” Jim told methat as a boy he mastered the art of typing with two fingers when he’d stay athis grandparents’ home. “They were wonderful loving people, but they had notoys,” he explained. So he kept himself entertained on their old typewriter, byteaching himself to type like crazy with two fingers.And then he took a required typing class at school.The teacher asked him to let go of his two-finger method and use all ten of hisfingers instead. What do you think happened to his typing speed at first? Yes,it slowed way down. But eventually, when he mastered the art of ten-finger, ortouch, typing, he was able to type faster than ever. “Reading is much the sameway,” Jim explains. “Most people are reading with two fingers, so to speak.”Here are some insights and tips to help quicken your reading speed.• Though you may think that people who read faster comprehend less, the oppositeis true. Here’s why. People who read slowly read One. Word. At. A. Time. Theyare reading so slowly that they are boring themselves. Their mind begins dashingaround the environment looking for something more interesting to hold itsattention. They can’t focus on the content of what they are reading. Fasterreaders actually have better comprehension because they can focus more easily:Basically, the information is hitting their brain at a more interesting speed.• Another common issue that slows down reading is “subvocalization,” which meansthat some people say aloud every word they are reading in their head. Using thismethod, you can only read as fast as you can talk, which is 200–500 words perminute. We think much faster than we talk, so by getting rid of thesubvocalization habit, with specialized training, you can begin to read closerto the speed of thought than the speed of talking.• Regression or rereading slows down reading. This habit is like someone havingcontrol of a DVD and rewinding it a little bit about every thirty seconds.Breaking this two-finger habit helps people to read faster.• Using a finger, a pen, or a computer mouse to follow the words, as if you areinvisibly underlining the sentences, will increase your reading speed 25–50percent across the board. The reason? Your eyes are attracted to motion, andthis increases focus. Also, in the way that the senses of taste and smell arelinked, so are touch and sight. There is a touch–sight connection in the brainthat when activated increases speed and comprehension.• If you are right-handed, try using your left hand to follow the words as youread. This activates more of your whole brain. Most people are “left brainreaders,” and they find when they use this method that it engages their rightbrain. One of Jim’s clients said that he reread Ernest Hemingway’s classic TheOld Man and the Sea using this method, “only this time around, it was like Icould actually feel the sand on my feet and hear the ocean waves. The only thingI didn’t like was the smell of the fish.”• Take notes as you read. By taking notes as you read, your comprehension willshoot up. If you share or relate what you read, even pretend to “teach it” tosomeone else, your retention will be even higher.MIND WORKOUTS FOR EVERYONE: 24/7 BRAIN GYM TRAINING FOR BOOSTING YOUR BRAINTHE ELEPHANT AND THE RIDER: SYNCING TWO FORCESIn The Happiness Hypothesis, author and philosopher Jonathan Haidt uses themetaphor of an elephant and a rider to help us visualize two strong forces inthe brain. The prefrontal cortex, or PFC, is much like the rider and involvesthe thinking, logic center that we assume (or like to assume) is in control ofour lives. The elephant is what I would call the limbic system and representsour emotions, which are automatic responses to outward triggers based on storedmemories. As long as the elephant wants to go where the rider directs him,things work fine. But when the elephant “truly, deeply, madly” wants to gosomewhere that the rider prefers him not go, who is going to win that tug ofwar? Most bets are on the elephant.How do we integrate, then, our own rider and elephant so that our PFC and limbicbrains, our goals and our desires, our thoughts and behaviors, get more in sync?One way to do that is through continual, goal-directed, brain-trainingtechniques. This is one of the reasons we developed the brain-training moduleson our website at www.theamensolution.com [http://www.theamensolution.com]. Ilike to call it our 24/7 Brain Gym, because you can log on and work out yourbrain at any time.The process starts with a long assessment to help individualize your program.Based on how you score, you’re given a personalized set of exercises to boostyour weak areas and strengthen the ones that are already working well. Thedevelopment of this part of our site flowed out of years of gatheringinformation from thousands of people, using the latest research on how tooptimize brain function. This allowed us to create a program that helps thebrain operate better as a whole system, ultimately helping your behaviors andyour beliefs work together. In other words, it helps the rider and the elephantstop the tug-of-war and work together in cooperation.Savannah DeVarney, one of our site developers, says, “What we have found is thatone brain function precedes the other. Our internal state drives our externalstate, or how we behave in the world. Every fifth of a second you have anemotion that becomes a feeling, which may turn into a conscious thought and thendrive a behavior.” So looking at this process, it may seem as though we arehelplessly chained to the elephant of our emotions. A part of this is true, butthe rider can influence the elephant’s automatic emotional responses insignificant ways over time. Change the way you perceive the world around you,along with changing the automatic feelings and thoughts coming up within you,and you’ll find that what you choose to attend repeatedly and over time willharness and refine the internal elephant.The default mode of the human brain is more sensitive to negativity. This ispart of the built-in survival system of the human race. Being hyperalert tonegativity in the environment—say, a noise that sounds like a bear in theforest—was one way to assure survival in earlier, more dangerous times. Now thathumans live in a world that is for the most part safer, the brain still has aresidual focus on negativity, but it no longer serves us well.Here’s an example. You have a headache. Let the brain take its natural negativecourse, and it begins to spiral into worst-case scenarios faster than you cansay, “Gee, I must have a tumor.” Within a few seconds your inner elephant cantake you down a path that imagines your headache is a baseball-sized cancerousmass, skips straight to visualizing yourself on your deathbed, fast-forwards toimagining your own funeral in living color (complete with songs, hymns,flowers), and gets angry at your spouse when you contemplate him or her marryingsomeone else you don’t like. At this point your mate may innocently walk in theroom, and you find yourself feeling and acting inexplicably ticked off. Thisdownward spiral can take place within seconds. This is how quickly a response toa trigger (a headache) can deteriorate into a negative spiral, instigating badbehavioral outcomes (you are unfairly angry and short with your spouse for animaginary future scenario).The good news is that we can also, and just as easily, spiral into positivity.TAKING THE EMOTIONAL REINSEverything that comes into our brain, be it from external sound or visual cuesor memories that pop into our mind, causes an automatic emotional response. Ourbrains begin processing things like body language or the tone of someone’svoice, and this leads to emotions that are subconscious reactions. But as theseemotions become more conscious they turn into feelings. Butterflies in yourstomach would be one example. At this point we can consciously switch what weare attending to and choose to focus on better and more positive thoughts.An example might be that you are about to speak to a group in public. Yourealize that your mouth is getting dry and your stomach is flip-flopping. Theautomatic fear response is in full swing. However, this is when you can chooseto “attend to” more positive thoughts and actions. You can begin to breatheslowly and deeply. The brain takes a cue from this and begins to relax. You canthink about how much your audience needs and wants the information you have toshare, taking the focus off your fear and onto their receptivity instead.Continue like this and before long you will be relaxed and positive, lookingforward to stepping up to the podium with energy, focus, and joy.The rider has tamed the elephant.Another scenario: Your inner elephant really wants a sugary cookie and wouldlike to go down the path leading to an extreme sugar high. But you’ve alsotrained your brain to pause and recall the emotions that come after the sugarcookie. The fatigue, the shakes, the excess weight. You remember that after thehigh comes the crash. You’ve begun to train your brain to want more positiveoutcomes, so you choose instead to eat half of a frozen banana that has beenrolled in chopped nuts, stored ahead in your freezer for such a time as this,going down the path to a truly satisfying and healthy snack. This healthy treatsatisfies your urge for something sweet while also giving you fiber and proteinand potassium and more. You know you will feel better and won’t have a headacheor be hungry again in thirty minutes. You give your body what it really wantsand needs, satisfying both elephant and rider.Now imagine that you practice positivity in every circumstance where you noticeyour thoughts about to spiral down. You stop them and restart a more positivespiral and change your mood state, and then automatically better behaviors willfollow as well. You do this so often that it becomes habitual. Over time you caneven change your personality. You can go from a fearful, worst-case-scenarioauto-responder to a positive, happier, more relaxed, productive, and enjoyableperson. You make better decisions, both in the short term and long term. Nomatter your age, you can do this.Besides being aware of what to pay attention to and focus on, there is anotherway to speed up and help your brain integrate and respond to life in betterways. It only takes ten to fifteen minutes, three times a week, sitting in frontof your computer and playing a few fun and relaxing “games” in our 24/7 BrainGym on the Amen Solution website (www.theamensolution.com[http://www.theamensolution.com]).MENTAL WORKOUTSThink of training the brain to respond in more focused, positive, and calm waysas we think of exercising for our bodies. I like to call it mental workouts. Andjust as we exercise, eat right, and brush our teeth as a form of preventivehealth, by training the brain on a regular basis we are practicing preventivemental health. Should a crisis come along, you’ll have trained your brain todeal with stressors and problems more effectively. Better responses to all oflife’s challenges will have become habitual, so you are not as easily throwninto an unproductive negative loop.We are all constantly on a thin edge, which can lead us down one side tonegative spiraling or another side that can lead us to more positive and helpfulreactions and behaviors. The brain is also extremely suggestible and open tocues and clues. For example, if you are feeling insecure, try standing up tallwith shoulders straight and head up, and smile with confidence. Adopting aconfident body posture sends a message to your brain that says, “I’m feelingconfident that I can tackle this challenge.” Latching onto role models ofconfidence, listening to audiotapes, being around confident people, and readingquotes that support a more confident state of mind can all affect which side ofthe “edge” your brain decides to ski down, which in turn affects your behaviorsin the real world.The 24/7 Brain Gym provides exercises that keep your brain tuned up and yourautomatic habitual responses to life’s many triggers more positive, hopeful, andcalm. It covers these four areas:• Boosting your memory and attention• Enhancing your emotional IQ• Increasing your happiness• Reducing your stressIn addition, the site offers:• Emotional training games to help you to better pick up on nonverbal clues• Thinking training games to help boost your attention, memory, and planningskills• Feeling training games to help minimize stress and enhance your heath andwell-being• Self-regulation training games to help you manage your emotions, thinking, andfeelingTogether these four areas help keep your brain in top shape, so both theelephant and rider parts work in tandem and allow you to handle life better.This is especially important when it comes to longevity. Those who visualizethemselves as getting better as they grow older, who look forward to theirgolden years, and who respond to life’s adversities with resiliency andpositivity indeed live longer and happier lives. One of the testimonials from aclient who used the Brain Gym training was that when her father passed away, shefelt she was better able to cope with the grief and changes than she would havebeen before she’d toned up her brain. She felt it helped her to be moreeffective with difficult decisions and comforting others who were also grieving,and she was more resilient post-loss.The games in the Amen Solution Brain Gym are amazing—and fun. Even in the firstweek I could see my abilities improving. What an innovative way to increaseintelligence, emotional IQ, and internal self regulation!—BILL HARRIS, CREATOR OF HOLOSYNCConsider adding mental workouts to the rest of your longevity habits, and itwill pay you back many times with increased feelings of calm, happiness, andfocus. You’ll also be proud of the life legacy you leave others as your outwardbehaviors more and more line up with your inner convictions.DO-IT-YOURSELF BRAIN IMPROVEMENTNo matter your age, income, IQ, or education, there are dozens of ways to helpyour neurons grow, stretch, and branch into a younger, more beautiful brainevery single day. Here are a few examples: 1. Learn a new language. Learning a new language requires that you analyze newsounds, which improves not only auditory-processing skills but also memory. 2. Play Sudoku. Sudoku is a numbers (not math) game that is both popular andaddictively fun to many who play it. It can help increase your logic andreasoning skills as well as your memory. Crossword puzzles do the same. 3. Lose the list. Using mnemonics (triggers to aid memory using visual imageryor sounds, such as rhyming) is a great way to boost your brain while developinga system to remember things. There are several great memory courses available onaudio or video recordings, often at local libraries or online. 4. Get in the game. Play board games like chess or Scrabble. Trivia games canboost memory, jigsaw puzzles can help visual and spatial skills, and mah-jonggcan help executive function (the capacity to control and apply your mentalskills). 5. Online brain-training games such as our Brain Gym atwww.theamensolution.com [http://www.theamensolution.com] can be quite helpful inkeeping your brain fit. Spend about ten minutes a day doing these fun games, andsee if you don’t find your brain beginning to process better and faster. 6. Be a Curious George. Stay curious about life and learning. Read and studyor take courses in subjects or the arts or activities that capture your fancy.Be a lifelong learner and you’re more likely to stay young at heart and in yourbrain. 7. It is never too late to go back to college! “People with fewer academicqualifications may grow old faster,” according to a DNA study that comparedgroups of people who spent different lengths of time in education and found theones who spent the least time had shorter telomeres, or “caps,” on the ends oftheir DNA, a sign of premature aging in cells. Think you’re “too old” to earn adegree? Ask yourself, “How old will I be in four years if I don’t earn adegree?” The oldest person to graduate college in the United States was in hermidnineties! Already have a degree? How about getting another one? Or go for avariety of continuing education courses, designing your own degree in “What I’veAlways Wanted to Learn.” 8. Learn to play a musical instrument or a different instrument than younormally play. 9. Try a brain healthy sport you’ve never tried.10. Try a new brain healthy recipe, perhaps from one of my wife’s cookbooks.11. Break your routine. This is especially important for anyone who is tetheredto bad, brain-harming habits. You can increase your chances of staying healthierlonger if you change your daily habits and routines. Introducing new habits canhelp rewire your brain so you don’t fall back into the same patterns ofactivity. For example, if you always take the same route home to work so you canstop at your favorite doughnut shop along the way, take a different route towork and bring a homemade brain healthy smoothie made from protein powder andfruit, which you can sip along the way.SPECIFIC WORKOUTS FOR DIFFERENT BRAIN AREASHere are some workouts I recommend to help balance six different areas of yourbrain.• PFC (forethought)• Strategy games, such as chess and checkers• Meditation to boost PFC function• Hypnosis, which can help focus and boost PFC function• Temporal lobes (language and memory)• Crossword puzzles and word games• Memory games• Basal ganglia (modulate anxiety and motivation)• Deep relaxation and/or meditation• Hand-warming techniques. As you warm your hands it sends an automatic signalto the rest of your body to relax.• Diaphragmatic breathing• Deep limbic (emotions)• Killing the automatic negative thoughts. There is more information in chapter7 [Amen_9780307888563_epub_c07_r1.htm].• Gratitude practice• Building libraries of positive experiences to enhance mood states• Parietal lobes (direction sense and spatial orientation)• Juggling• Interior design• Cerebellum (coordination)• Dancing• Table tennis (also works prefrontal cortex)• Martial arts, without risk for brain injury (also works PFC and temporallobes)• Handwriting• CalligraphyHow old would you be if you didn’t know how old you are? By keeping your brainyoung, curious, and ever learning new things in this fascinating world of ours,you may find yourself growing younger, rather than older, as the years go by.CHANGE YOUR AGE NOW: TWENTY BRAIN TIPS TO HELP YOU BECOME A LIFELONG LEARNER 1. To find your motivation to learn something new, begin by asking yourself,“What gifts do I have to bring to the world that could be lying dormant betweenmy ears?” Then ask, “What do I dream of doing with my life?” Go ahead, startwriting your bucket list now. Your brain loves activities that hold promise andexcitement like this one. 2. Think of books as a college course between two covers. Books are theworld’s greatest educational bargains. You can learn from the world’s greatestminds, past and present (and for little cost), if you become a reader. You canbecome an expert at almost anything, at any age! 3. Turn your car into a “university on wheels.” Purchase, download, or borrowaudiobooks on a variety of subjects that pique your interest. Download podcastsfrom great teachers whom you admire. You’ll turn boring drive times intoclassrooms of fascinating knowledge. 4. Stop telling yourself you have a poor memory or that you are not a goodreader. Instead say, “Memory is an art I can practice. I can read as well asanyone by applying new habits.” 5. “Don’t let your schooling get in the way of your education.” Formallearning is important for many, but only those who go above and beyond theeducational system discover the true joy of lifelong learning. 6. When memorizing a list, associate it with the craziest picture you canthink of to help your brain recall it later. No one sees the image you areholding in the privacy of your mind, so be creative and have fun with it. 7. To remember someone’s name, repeat the name, use it once or twice innatural conversation, visualize the name as a picture (perhaps on the person’sforehead), and use their name when saying good-bye. 8. Try increasing your reading speed by using the simple method of followingsentences with your finger, a pencil, or your mouse cursor. 9. Set aside three or four ten-minute sessions a week to play a variety ofbrain games on your computer. It’s like circuit training for your mind. We offermany great exercises for your brain in the form of fun games in our 24/7 BrainGym at www.theamensolution.com [http://www.theamensolution.com].10. Sharpen your brain by enjoying leisure activities that also keep youthinking. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found thatreading, playing board games, playing musical instruments, and dancing wereamong the best leisure activities for keeping your brain young.11. Try breaking your routine by doing something different and outside the box.Try a new sport. Whip up a new recipe. Take a new route home. Mix up your life.Variety is not only the spice of life, but it will help grow new neurons in yourbrain too!12. When you really want to learn something well, make sure to teach it tosomeone else. This will dramatically increase your skill and knowledge in asubject within a short period of time.13. Note-taking increases comprehension and retention. When you read, take notesin the margin of a book. If you’re reading a book that you cannot mark up, keepa notepad handy as you read. Jot notes on the strips of paper, then tuck them inthe pages where you found the quote or point you liked.14. Lifelong learning involves becoming more curious about all of life. Forexample, to keep your mind from wandering in conversations, be a curiouslistener. Notice not just what another person is saying but also her bodylanguage and tone. Ask follow-up questions. Pretend you are a journalist or atherapist, deeply intrigued with the story you’re being told and the storiesbehind the story.15. Don’t ask yourself, “How smart am I?” Instead, ask yourself, “How am Ismart?” There are many kinds of intelligences: social, mathematics, logic, art,creativity, intuitive sensing. What do you excel at?16. Everyone has preferred learning styles. Find your style. Do you learn bestby reading, hearing, talking, writing, doing, or some combination of these? Tryto learn something new via your best learning style. If you are an auditorylearner, listen to a book on tape. If you are a kinesthetic learner, take aclass where you’ll have hands-on experiences.17. Cognitive skills tend to dip after we graduate from college or retire fromwork. Don’t stop challenging your brain on a daily basis! Be a perpetual studentof life. Take continuing education classes or get a college degree. Learn to bea gourmet cook, discover fly fishing, write your memoir, study the brain! Theworld is endlessly fascinating for those who never stop learning, and it helpsyour brain thrive.18. Meditation has been shown to boost activity in the PFC and sharpen yourmind. Just a few meditative minutes a day can make a dramatic difference in yourmental abilities.19. Boost your prefrontal cortex by making clear goals and looking at them everyday.20. Boost your brain’s flexibility and creativity centers by asking yourself tolook at everyday activities, such as family time or how you do an activity atwork, in new and different ways."},{"pageContent":"6JONI AND THE MINI FACE-LIFT[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_L01_r1.jpg]BOOST YOUR BLOOD FLOW FOR BETTER SKIN AND SEXGood morning, Daniel…Just a quick note to tell you that my husband & I, along with our granddaughter,were walking around Laguna Lake where I stopped to read a sign that read “PleaseDon’t Feed the Ducks.” It went on to warn people not to give them a handoutbecause they need to feed off of their natural food plants and insects. If theducks feed off of the food we hand out it could be deadly, as it changes theirbehavior. They become sedentary and will stay at the lake instead of migrating.It was a huge wow moment for me. When I don’t eat the foods created for me and Ieat food handed out (the drive-thru window!)—“fast food”—it changes my behavior.I will not “migrate” to new horizons!I just had to share this with you because it really is a parable about all thatyou and your wife are so passionate about. Oh, by the way, the sign said when wefeed the ducks, other ducks come to the lake and it causes unsightly droppings.So the moral of the story is when junk food is served you sit around, with nomotivation, in your own &%@!Have a grand day!JoniJONI NOW: BEAUTIFUL INSIDE AND OUTJoni is a woman whom I admire for her enthusiasm, unique way of seeing life,ready sense of humor, and ability to encourage others. Over the years she hassent me a number of e-mails like the one on the previous page. Recently Jonistarted attending classes at the clinic in Newport Beach about how to have abetter brain and a better body.“I started applying what I learned. Eating better, taking supplements, andexercising more consistently. I think consistency is a challenge for women whenwe’re raising kids because we tell ourselves, ‘I don’t have time to exercise!There are too many needs I have to tend to!’ But what we don’t realize is thattaking time to exercise is not only an investment in ourselves but also in ourfamily members, who want us to live longer and feel good about ourselves.”Indeed, a happy, healthy wife and mom is one of the best gifts a woman can giveher husband and kids. Recently Joni, who is a grandmother of three, shared thefollowing story. “One day after I’d lost about ten pounds and started to feelmuch better in every way, I went out to breakfast with my twin sister. She eyedme suspiciously across the table and said,“ ‘Okay, tell me the truth, Joni. Did you have a mini face-lift?’“I was so surprised, and flattered. ‘No!’ I said, ‘I promise I haven’t!’“ ‘Seriously?’ my twin countered. ‘Even my sons thought you’d had some workdone!’ ”Joni told her sister that all she had done was to change her diet, addsupplements, and exercise consistently. “It was only a ten-pound weight loss,but it was more that the pounds lost gave my skin a lift and a happy glow.”In truth, the process began fifteen years ago when Joni was, as she simply putit, “a mess.” She explained, “Transformation for me personally came from theinside out. Outside in has never worked for me.“I am sure that in addition to the dietary and exercise changes, the reason myskin and face appear younger is that I am happier and more peaceful and balancedwithin.”JONI THEN: A HOT MESSIn 1996, when I first met Joni, she thought, as many people do, that her issuesstemmed from a lack of willpower. “I’d pray and pray and ask God to help me, butI wasn’t getting much better. Until, that is, I also started therapy and thatwise therapist sent me to Dr. Amen.”Joni had a SPECT scan at our clinic and it was a huge epiphany for her, as it isto so many thousands of patients who come face-to-face with the first picture oftheir brain. At the time she was terribly anxious and depressed. She had beendiagnosed with PMS, but she knew it had to be more than that. She was living insuch pain, misery, and shame. She had been emotionally wounded as a child, as somany women are. She believed she was dumb and had such a hard time feeling thatshe belonged anywhere in the world. As she was sitting in our waiting room, shewas engulfed with a feeling of shame for being such a mess that it had come tothe point of literally having to get her head examined.DISCOVERING HER INNER BEAUTYWhen she saw a picture of what was happening in her brain it was as if she justopened up inside.Joni said, “As I looked carefully at the images I really understood thatsomething biological was at play here. This wasn’t just a spiritual problem orlack of willpower. The doctor, pointing to various parts of my brain, describedwhy I was feeling so anxious. My basal ganglia were overactive. When I saw lowactivity in my prefrontal cortex, tears of compassion welled up in my eyes.Compassion for my lost self. I could see that without enough blood flow to thispart of my brain, it was no wonder I struggled in school, with my marriage, andeven feeling loved by and connected to God.”GETTING BEAUTIFUL ALL OVERThe only plastic surgery I have had is cutting up my credit cards!—JONIIn addition to the therapy, having her brain balanced with supplements and avery little bit of medication—a small amount of Adderall for the ADD issues—gaveher a brain she could finally work with. Therapy continued but much moreeffectively. Once she was better on the inside, she was fully ready to get herbody healthy as well. About this time my book Change Your Brain, Change YourBody came out. The clinic offered classes and a support group and she signed upand brought my daughter’s friend, who lost thirty pounds.The classes helped her understand the connection between what she put in hermouth and her mood. Healthy food could bring a full life, instead of anoverstuffed belly. In addition to upsizing her nutritional input, Joni foundthat targeted supplements were very helpful.“I’m going through menopause and that is no picnic, but I’m so grateful to havethe supplements, the nutrition, and the exercise to help me,” she said. Newresearch suggests that fish oil lowers the frequency of hot flashes. Joni worksout with a trainer three times a week. She shared that before she started on hersupplements she used to come in to the gym to work out and forget what hertrainer had told her to do. Her trainer would tease her, saying, “What are youdoing, Joni? Waiting for a bus?”To stay on task was that difficult for her. But with the supplements andnutrition she has the focus and energy to pay attention and finish her workouts.She also goes on hikes and bike rides.When she goes to the grocery store, Joni is now an avid label reader. Sherealizes that food is truly medicine. She’s also getting comfortable withaccurate portion sizes. Because Joni has ADD, she sees quite an improvement inher attention when she has protein for breakfast. She usually goes for abreakfast shake with protein or egg whites with avocado and pico de gallo. Forlunch she usually has a soup and salad or a healthy sandwich. Dinner istypically fish, a vegetable, and a salad.Her time of greatest temptation is at night, when she stays up late. Her brainprofile showed Joni struggles with impulsive and anxious overeating. “Every dayI have a choice,” she says. “Interestingly it wasn’t just food I was impulsiveabout. I used to be an impulsive shopper as well and got in trouble with goingto the mall and ended up with out-of-control credit card bills. Now I’m debt free! As I got my ADD balanced, I hadbetter control over eating, and many other areas of my life.”Joni added, “In response to the mini face-lift and debt reduction, I tellpeople, ‘Honestly, the only plastic surgery I have had is cutting up my creditcards!’ ”Joni says that her supportive community made all the difference in being able tostick with her brain healthy decisions. “I have people in my life who support myhealing and also people I can call when I’m triggered or stressed. My brain scanalso showed a pattern consistent with past emotional trauma. Now I understandwhat happens when something triggers old pain, and my brain wants to dosomething to self-medicate, like shopping too much, eating a bunch of sweets, orother addictive behaviors. I know how to soothe my brain now, with supplementsand diet and exercise and changes in thought patterns.“The other day someone came into our workplace and just exploded with anger.This was a trigger to major anxiety for me, and I really wanted to ‘medicate’ itwith a bunch of doughnuts. Food, to me, was like a loving mama, like Paula Deenfrom the Food Network!”What Joni has realized now is that she can get that comforting and support andnurturing from Paula Deen– like people in her life—without all the sugar andbutter to go with it!“I’m thrilled with the reflection I now see in the mirror,” says Joni. “What iswithin me now shines on the outside! With a balanced brain I no longer seemyself as I used to see me, like the wicked queen in a fairy tale gone wrong.What I see reflected in the mirror now is a healthy, vibrant young woman!”CARING ABOUT YOUR SKIN IS IMPORTANT“Beauty is in the eye of the beholder” is an old saying that may be more truethan we realize. The “beholder”—the human eye—automatically sizes up someone’shealth by the appearance of their skin and face. Surprisingly, this automaticresponse is amazingly accurate. Early visible signs of aging, such as wrinkling,often indicate some sort of systemic failure within. A growing body of researchdemonstrates that facial wrinkles are a reliable indicator of internal health.For example, in one study using pictures of older twins, the researchers hadtwenty nurses browse the photographs to guess the age of each individual twin.In the following years, the twin who was seen as “older looking” was more likelyto die from health-related issues in 73 percent of the cases.One of the most important concepts that I have learned over the years is thatthe health of your skin is an outside reflection of the health of your brain.The brain–skin connection is so strong that some people have begun calling theskin the brain on the outside. The same habits that we have been discussing inthis book that improve the brain’s look, feel, and function, also apply to yourskin. Your skin covers about twenty square feet and is one-sixth of your bodyweight, making it the largest organ in the body. Nourish it well, starting fromthe inside out, and it will pay huge dividends in both the quantity and qualityof your life.Did you know that 50 percent of the brain is dedicated to vision? Healthy skinis attractive, not only to the opposite sex, but to everyone. Many people thinkit is shallow to care about how you look, but it is important to take care ofyour appearance if you want to stay connected to others and if you want toattract people to you.“BUT WAIT! DON’T GET THAT FACE-LIFT YET!”Extreme makeovers are fun to watch on TV, but this kind of beauty is only skindeep at best, doing nothing to help a person’s health and longevity. Thelong-term results are fleeting.What you don’t see with some of these extreme makeovers is the extreme pain someof the procedures involve. In addition, few nip ’n’ tucks are without sideeffects. Many times the results are less than people had hoped for, or worse,they are left with a face stuck in the “surprise” or “Joker-face smile”position. Google “bad celebrity face-lifts” and you’ll get a brief tour into thebizarre. Surgery of any sort, including implanting or injecting foreignsubstances into the body, always carries both short-term and long-term risks.Sure, there are cases when plastic surgery is a legitimate option. However, ifyou’ve been toying with the idea of going under the knife for some “work,” I’dlike to challenge you to consider an alternative. Postpone the decision for sixmonths to a year, and in that time make a concerted effort to make positivechanges that will uplift your health, your happiness, and your face at the sametime. As another added bonus, doing this will not only tighten and smooth theskin on your face but on the rest of your body as well.At the Amen Clinics we often see people morphing into younger versions ofthemselves as they get their brains balanced by going on a brain-smart diet andexercise program. Even a ten-pound weight loss—if you are losing weight onhighly nutritious foods—can often de-age a person’s face profoundly. When peoplelose weight on a healthy regimen, others often comment on how much younger theylook as well (as opposed to those who lose weight by cutting calories but eatinglow-nutrient, artificial foods—these people tend to look drawn, wrinkled, andweak). I remember when I once tried an extreme low-carbohydrate diet: my skintook on a grayish tinge, and I looked older and sicker in a matter of weeks. Itwas the wrong weight loss for me.There’s a good chance that if you choose brain healthy living, and dive into itwholeheartedly, you will look in the mirror a few months from now and seesignificant progress. But be sure to take a before picture when you start.Sometimes gradual changes are more noticeable to others.In the rest of this chapter we’ll explore natural ways to lift, tighten, andsmooth your skin. We will also discuss how to boost the blood flow to your brainand skin and improve your sex life.As it turns out—surprise, surprise!—what keeps your brain young also keeps yourskin young. So you get a two-fer when you opt for a brain healthy life.Actually, you get a four-fer, because what is good for your brain is good foryour skin is also good for your heart and your genitals. There is no downside,no side effects, no risks, and no frozen clown faces when you choose to go for anatural, brain healthy face-lift!There are no beauty contests for a beautiful brain, but the truth is thatwithout a gorgeous brain, you will not be as good-looking as you could be.Anger, depression, and anxiety all show up on our faces. Getting the braincalmed and focused will relax and beautify your face as well.HEALTHY SKIN FROM THE INSIDE OUTEven the best facelift does little if you are not addressing the aging that isgoing on inside the body. To truly look and feel young, you have to start fromwithin and, most important, with the brain.—DR. ERIC BRAVERMANOne of the things I love so much about Joni’s story is that she emphasizes thather changes on the outside began with changes within. This applies to many areasof life, but it is perhaps even more obviously true when it comes to our skin.Caring for our skin is a little like caring for a plant. A well-nourished plantgrows tall and beautiful, with supple leaves and bright color. We know thisabout plants. But we forget this about ourselves.Imagine this scenario.Let’s say a woman named Sophia has a beautiful flowering plant that sheabsolutely loves. But one day she thinks to herself, “Gee, I’m tired of wateringand fertilizing that thing. And I prefer to move it to a dark corner in thebasement. Also, I think I’ll try growing it in clay dirt instead of pottingsoil. And forget the Miracle-Gro. This year I’m going to save myself time andmoney by letting this plant take care of itself.”So Sophia quits watering the plant, lets the soil go without nutrients, andkeeps it away from sunlight and fresh air. Her plant is basically relegated tosolitary confinement, void of nourishment and light, without even bread—orrather, fertilizer—and water.Eventually the inevitable happens. The leaves begin to shrivel, wrinkle, andturn brown. Sophia doesn’t like this look, so she trims the dead leaves andspray paints the plant a nice shade of “grass green.”The stems begin to bend, so she props them up with sticks and tape and wire.Even so, the root and stems of the plant’s vascular system have bends and kinksaplenty that keep nourishment from flowing freely to the flowers and leaves.The plant no longer blooms, so she buys artificial flowers and “implants” themamong the leaves.“Wait! Wait!” you would say to anyone trying to do this sort of extreme makeoverto a once naturally beautiful plant. “You’re killing that poor plant! It has tobe nourished with rich soil, daily watering, and just the right amount of freshair and sunlight. Then its stems will straighten up, the leaves will be suppleand vibrant, and real, colorful flowers will bloom.”The parallel is obvious. You can’t grow a healthy, beautiful flower by suchextreme and artificial means; and neither can you grow a healthy, supple,unwrinkled, vibrant skin with color blossoming in your cheeks unless you “growit” from the inside out.The most expensive cosmetics in the world cannot make you as beautiful as goodbrain-smart living can. Let’s take a look at how you can begin to nourish yourskin, starting now.WATERING YOUR SKIN: HYDRATIONJust as plants need water, the skin and brain also need water. Drinking plentyof filtered water is most helpful for the skin because of its ability to flushtoxins from the body, including those that end up in your skin. Green or whitetea might be even more helpful, as it is shown to protect collagen.HEALTHY OILSOmega-3s A study in Journal of Dermatological Research (2008) showed animprovement in skin elasticity in women taking over 1 g EPA (eicosapentaenoicacid) fish oil for three months. Omega-3s also help the skin recover morequickly after exposure to UV radiation and protect DNA within skin cells alongwith supporting collagen. It also can improve the elasticity of blood vessels,thus improving blood flow, giving your skin a healthy glow.Gamma-linolenic Acid (GLA) GLA acid is a “good” omega-6. It is typically derivedfrom borage, evening primrose, or black-currant seed oils. (Borage contains thehighest amount.) Improvements in skin smoothness and hydration have been shownafter one to three months of consuming 500 mg GLA from borage oil; it also helpsrelieve dry, itchy skin. By combining with fish oil, you’ll reduce the amount ofwater lost from the epidermis. Give this combination a try for at least a month,as it takes this long before effects begin showing up on your skin.Acetylcholine This is a very important nutrient that acts as a neurotransmitterin the brain, for learning and memory, but also in the skin. Acetylcholineprovides the moisture to the body, so when it goes, we dry up from the inside(starting with the brain). Dry, wrinkled skin may be a clue that your memory isfading as well. A loss of acetylcholine is a marker of dementia.Here are some foods that help increase acetylcholine:• Whole egg• Turkey liver• Cod, salmon, or tilapia• Shrimp• Soy protein• Peanut butter• Oat bran• Pine nuts (Be sure these are grown in America, as pine mouth syndrome, atemporary condition affecting your taste buds, has been found in many importedbatches of pine nuts in recent years.)• Almonds• Hazelnuts• Macadamia nuts• Broccoli• Brussels sprouts• Cucumber, zucchini, lettuce• Skim milk• Low-fat cheese• Low-fat yogurtSupplements are also a great way to increase your acetylcholine. These includephosphatidylcholine, acetyl-L-carnitine, alpha-lipoic acid, manganese, andhuperzine A.Tea Time For healthy skin that glows from the inside out, drink tea: white,green, or black. Studies show the polyphenols found in tea haveanti-inflammatory properties that may be beneficial to skin. One study publishedin the Archives of Dermatology found drinking 3 cups of oolong tea a day cuteczema symptoms for 54 percent of those who tried it. Research found thatdrinking two to six cups of green tea a day not only helps prevent skin cancerbut might also reverse the effects of sun damage by neutralizing the changesthat appear in sun-exposed skin.There is also some compelling new research that shows white tea to be a strongskin de-ager, in addition to helping reduce the risk of cancer and rheumatoidarthritis. In a study where scientists tested the health properties oftwenty-one plant and herb extracts, they were intrigued to find that white teaconsiderably outperformed all of them. White tea had antiaging potential andhigh levels of antioxidants, and protected the structural proteins of the skin,specifically elastin and collagen, which help the skin’s strength andelasticity, diminishing wrinkles and sagging. As little as one cup of white teaa day has a powerful effect.FEEDING YOUR FACEYou may have noticed that Japanese women have some of the most beautiful skin inthe world. Often they seem almost ageless. Many of the world’s longest-livedpeople are from Japan, and their skin shows the least signs of visible aging.Researchers believe it may have much to do with their diet, which is high inseafood and vegetables while low in sugars and bad oils. Just as a plant looksbest when it is “fed” rich soil and nutrients, so a face that is “fed” healthyfood will look its best too.In one study, researchers found that the older adults with the highest intake ofitems like olive oil, fish and seafood, nuts, legumes, yogurt, tea, wholegrains, deep green veggies, and dark fruits and berries had the fewest visiblesigns of aging. On the other hand, a greater risk of skin wrinkling wasassociated with the consumption of fatty processed meats, saturated fats, whitepotatoes, and sugary beverages and desserts. Your skin is what you eat, so feedit beautiful ingredients.Dr. Lawrence E. Gibson, dermatologist for the Mayo Clinic, lists the followingfoods as best bets for healthy skin.• Carrots, apricots, and other yellow and orange fruits and vegetables• Blueberries• Spinach and other green leafy vegetables• Tomatoes• Beans, peas, and lentils• Fish, especially salmon• NutsMaking sure you get plenty of fiber-rich foods also slows down sugar spikes,which reduces glycation, a process that ages the body, including the skin.SUPPLEMENTSMore and more multivitamin products are being formulated with skin-nourishingingredients and advertised as such. Look for the following ingredients in yourskin-friendly multivitamin:Vitamin C and Lysine These antioxidants are known to inhibit enzymes produced bycells that are known to attack collagen.Vitamin D This important vitamin supports skin health by decreasing inflammationand boosting immunity. As skin ages it is less effective at synthesizing vitaminD coming from the sun. If your skin is not healing as quickly as it used to fromsmall cuts, extra oral vitamin D may help.Zinc This mineral promotes wound healing and is beneficial to hair and skinhealth, especially if you suffer from dermatitis and dandruff.Vitamins A and E Both of these vitamins have been beneficial in decreasinginflammation.Omega-3s Omega-3s improve skin elasticity, help protect and restore body afterUV radiation exposure, and protect DNA and collagen. As previously mentioned,GLA can help as well and, taken in combination with an omega-3 supplement, can,over time, greatly improve the moisture and appearance of the skin.Dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE) Also known as deanol, DMAE is an analog of the Bvitamin choline. DMAE is a precursor of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, andit has strong effects on the central nervous system. DMAE is commonly used toincrease the capacity of neurons in the brain and is also thought to haveantiaging properties that diminish wrinkles and improve the appearance of theskin.Phenylalanine This amino acid has been found to be helpful for depression andpain. There is also good scientific evidence that it may be helpful forvitiligo, a chronic, relatively common skin disorder that causes depigmentationin patches of skin. It occurs when the cells responsible for skin pigmentationdie or become unable to function.Alpha-lipoic Acid This compound is made naturally in the body and may protectagainst cell damage in a variety of conditions. In a number of studies it hasalso been found to be helpful for skin issues as well.Grape Seed Extract This substance comes from grape seeds, which are wasteproducts of the wine and grape juice industries. Extensive research suggeststhat grape seed extract is beneficial in many areas of health because of itsantioxidant effect to bond with collagen, promoting youthful skin, elasticity,and flexibility.Probiotics The gut is often an indicator of health, and this is especially truewhen it comes to stress. Did you know that the emotions of fear and anger canreduce the number of healthy bacteria in your gut tenfold? In times of sicknessor emotional stress, or after overindulging in alcohol, you help your body getbetter more quickly by ingesting fermented milk products like Kefir or yogurt ortaking a good-quality probiotic formula. Probiotics can help in returning tonormal immune functioning after exposure to UV rays. Animal studies (yet to beconducted on humans) show promise for skin rejuvenation following exposure tosun by use of probiotics.Splenda (sucralose) was found to reduce friendly bacteria and also to changehealthy pH balance in the body, so avoiding it as a sugar substitute is a goodidea. I recommend stevia instead.HORMONE BALANCINGHaving your hormones checked and balanced is critical for both brain and skinhealth. Trouble with testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, thyroid, and cortisollevels can cause major problems. But before you start taking synthetic hormonereplacement, clean up your diet and environment first. For example, did you knowthat getting a sugar burst can lower your testosterone levels by 25 percent?Testosterone is thought of as the libido hormone. This means if you share thecheesecake at the restaurant, no one will get dessert when you get home.Estrogen replacement for women, when appropriate, can slow the aging process inthe skin by slowing collagen loss that affects the skin’s ability to retainmoisture.SUNLIGHT: JUST ENOUGH, NOT TOO MUCHMost people need about twenty minutes of sun a day to get a healthy level ofvitamin D. You can also get the necessary amount with a vitamin D3 supplement ifyou live in a part of the country, like Washington or Oregon, where there aremonths where the sun hides its face. Avoid the harshest hours of sunlight,however, between 11:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. A variety of plants need differingamounts of sun and shade; this is also true of people. Those with light blondand red hair and fair complexions need to be especially careful of sun exposure,as their rates of skin cancer are much higher than the rest of the populationwith olive or darker skin tones.To Sunscreen or Not to Sunscreen? Years ago, after researchers discovered whatoverexposure to sun could do to our skin, the general advice was to slatheryourself up with a strong SPF sunscreen. What they didn’t take into account wasthat some of the ingredients in some sunscreens may actually be more harmful tothe body than reasonable sun exposure. You can find a list of the safestsunscreens to use at the website of the not-for-profit Environmental WorkingGroup (www.ewg.org [http://www.ewg.org]). They also did not take into accountthat as a nation our vitamin D levels would drop to dangerously low levels. Theanswer here, I believe, is to be cautious with the sun. Get enough to keep yourvitamin D levels healthy but not too much to put your skin health at risk. Thinktwenty minutes a day without sunscreen. Never get sunburned, and get yourvitamin D levels checked with a test called 25-hydroxy vitamin D level.Get a Healthy Tan from Your Five a Day Scientists have shown that you can giveyour skin a golden glow by eating more fruits and vegetables with carotenoids,which will subtly alter your skin color. Carotenoid, an antioxidant responsiblefor the red coloring found in, for instance, tomatoes, peppers, plums, andcarrots, eventually imbues the human skin (of Caucasians) with a healthy-lookinggolden glow. Carotenoids are stored in fat under the skin and secreted throughthe skin in serum. Then they are reabsorbed into the top layer of the skin,bestowing that golden color. These substances also contain powerful antioxidantsthat are good for your brain’s health. Studies show that people find a healthygolden glow more attractive than lighter pigment. Researchers believe that rosyskin tones slightly flushed with blood and full of oxygen make people lookhealthier, because they suggest a strong heart and lungs.GOOD VASCULAR HEALTH EQUALS HEALTHY SKINIt’s all about blood flow. The skin contains an abundance of blood vessels,making it vascular in nature. These blood vessels promote circulation, bloodflow, and clean the skin. When our cardiovascular system clogs up and blood flowis poor, skin loses its pink, youthful appearance. Besides wrinkling, olderpeople often have sallow, pale skin because of a lack of blood flow.Take deep breaths of fresh air. Put a plant under a glass dome and it won’t lastlong. Living things need oxygen and lots of it! Deep-breathing exercises helpcalm the body and increase oxygen to the blood. Breathing outside, in nature,particularly where there are lots of trees (what the Japanese term “forest airbreathing”) lowers cortisol, decreases glycation (a part of aging), and improveswell-being.Avoid anemia. Anemia can cause your healthy red blood cell count to drop too lowand cause people to look ghostlike. Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, whichcarries oxygen to your tissues, and a lack of oxygen can cause stress on organs.Signs of anemia can be mild skin paleness and dizziness or lightheadedness.Increase blood flow to your skin. The best way to get the blood moving isthrough exercise.1. Exercise Makes You Sweat “The body only has so many mechanisms to rid itselfof toxins—the kidneys, the liver, and the skin,” says Sandra M. Johnson, M.D., adermatologist with Johnson Dermatology in Fort Smith, Arkansas. “Exerciseincreases blood flow to the skin, increases neuronal stimulation, and allows thesweat glands to increase their functions and rid the toxins.” Once you sweat outthose toxins, be sure to wash them off. Showering after a workout keeps themfrom sitting on your skin, preventing bacterial or fungal infections that mayoccur from dirt clogging up your pores.2. Exercise Tones Your Muscles The more toned you are beneath your skin, thehealthier your skin will look and feel. Toning your muscles may also help tominimize the appearance of cellulite. You can’t exercise cellulite away, but youcan help it look better.3. Exercise Boosts Oxygen and Blood Flow to the Skin Studies have shown thatregular exercise boosts blood flow enough in type 2 diabetics to help reduce therisk of skin problems that lead to amputation. Exercise increases blood flow,which means that more oxygen and nutrients are being carried to the skin’ssurface.4. Exercise Eases Stress Exercise has long been known as a great way to relievestress. Those mind–body benefits may extend to your complexion as you frownless, smile more. Also, some skin outbreaks may be stress-related.5. Exercise Gives Your Complexion a Beautiful, Natural Glow When you exercise,your skin begins to produce more of its natural oils that help skin look suppleand healthy.Exercise is a vital secret skin care ingredient for a young, healthier, andsmoother complexion.Treat sleep apnea. There is new research indicating a higher rate of skincancers in those with sleep apnea. Also there seems to be a link betweenpsoriasis and sleep apnea. Both issues are related to decreased oxygen and bloodflow to all the organs, including the skin. Alcohol and obesity can worsen thepossibility of sleep apnea. If you find that you are sleepy during the day evenafter a full night’s rest, or if your partner says that you snore, then seem tostop breathing, then snort and breathe again, you may want to get a sleep studydone. Having sleep apnea diagnosed and treated has made all the difference formany people in terms of their energy and health, including bringing more blood,oxygen, and nutrients to their skin.DECREASE STRESS TO DECREASE WRINKLESA plant can go into shock and shut down from being jerked out of its pot andreplanted in another one carelessly or from exposure to extreme temperatures. Inthe same way, stress is not conducive to your health or your beauty. Many peopleturn gray or lose hair during high-stress times. If you doubt this take a lookat past presidents in their years of office. Scientists estimate, from classicmeasurements of aging, that the president of the United States ages about twoyears for every one year in office.Get a massage. Massage helps stimulate blood flow in the skin, and studies showthat it relaxes the entire body, lowering stress hormones after a session. Thekneading action may also help break down scar tissue.Try hypnosis and self-relaxation. Self-hypnosis is a powerful self-soothingskill that can help you relax when you are stressed and also lead you into apeaceful night’s sleep.Get your beauty sleep. If you’ve ever had a sleepless night, it is pretty easyto so see it on your face, particularly around the eyes. Women who are deprivedof sleep have disturbed skin-barrier function, greater water loss from the skin,and highly inflammatory chemicals in circulation. Good sleep also keeps thehealthy bacteria in your gut. (Loss of sleep cuts back the amount of healthybacteria in your intestines. Taking a probiotic when you are not sleeping wellis a good preventive measure.) Interestingly, good skin health relies on twobrain chemicals that also have antiaging properties: GABA and melatonin. GABAenhances the survival of cells that make collagen. Lack of melatonin may causethinning of the epidermis. Both of these chemicals are low in people withchronic sleep issues.Try aromatherapy. In one sleep study where very small amounts of scents fromjasmine and lavender were “piped” into a room of sleeping subjects, jasmineoutperformed lavender by a long shot in terms of helping people enjoy morerestful sleep. People moved less and slept more deeply. The amount used was sosmall that the subjects could not detect the smell consciously. So a very littledab of this natural scent may prove helpful.AVOID TOXIC EXPOSUREJust as a plant can wither from exposure to toxic chemicals in the soil or inthe air, so your brain and your skin may wither from both internal and externalexposure to toxic substances. On a brain scan, toxic exposure gives the brain abumpy, scalloped, uneven appearance. This is true of ingested toxins, likealcohol and drugs, as well as environmental toxins, like asbestos and leadpaint. Toxic exposure can also leave the skin with bumps, uneven color, rashes,and wrinkling. Here are some things to avoid if you want to protect your skin.Stop smoking. Nicotine reduces blood flow to the skin, robbing it of thathealthy, rosy glow. It also destroys elasticity, which promotes wrinkles. Theact of puffing on cigarettes also adds fine lines to the area above your upperlip. Smoking for ten or more years can give you “smoker’s face.” That’s a termDr. Douglas Model introduced in 1985 when he published a study in the BritishMedical Journal showing that he could identify long-term smokers by doingnothing more than looking at their facial features. The “smoker’s face” made thepeople look older than their true age and included the followingcharacteristics: lines above and below the lips, at the corners of the eyes, onthe cheeks, or on the jaw; a gaunt appearance; a grayish tone; and a reddishcomplexion. More bad news: smokers are three times as likely to develop acertain type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma than nonsmokers,according to a study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.Avoid glycation end products (AGEs). Eating too many sweets and high-glycemicfoods can cause wrinkles. A study in the British Journal of Dermatology foundthat consuming sugar promotes a natural process called glycation, in whichsugars attach themselves to proteins to form harmful molecules called advancedAGEs. AGEs damage your brain and also damage collagen and elastin, the proteinfibers that help keep skin firm and supple. The more sugar you consume, the moredamage to these proteins and the more wrinkles on your face. In addition,cooking with liquids rather than over dry heat reduces the AGEs in your body.Steaming and poaching are better skin-healthy choices than grilling or broilingwith dry heat.Limit caffeine. Too much caffeine from coffee, tea, chocolate, or some herbalpreparations dehydrates your skin, which makes it look dry and wrinkled.Watch the alcohol. Alcohol has a dehydrating effect on the body, sappingmoisture from your skin and increasing wrinkles. It also dilates the bloodvessels and capillaries in your skin. With excessive drinking, the blood vesselslose their tone and become permanently dilated, giving your face a flush thatwill not go away. Alcohol also depletes vitamin A, an important antioxidantinvolved in skin cell regeneration. Alcohol abuse damages the liver and reducesits ability to remove toxins from the body, resulting in increased toxins in thebody and skin that make you look older than you really are.SMILING AND SEX: SKIN-HAPPY HABITSSMILE! IT DE-AGES YOUR FACE!A sincere and happy, natural smile may be one of the top age erasers of all.People who have brains that are both calm and focused and who have lives thatare healthy in myriad ways tend to be happier and smile more often. Socialpsychology research has also demonstrated that a person’s viewing benefits he orshe receives as a gift from God or another person has been correlated withsuccessful aging as well as longevity. So while you are eating your fruits andveggies, drinking water and tea, taking brain and skin healthy supplements, andgetting plenty of exercise, another way to give yourself a mini face-lift is topractice the art of daily gratitude, giving yourself something to smile about.STAYIN’ FRISKY OVER FORTYFrank Sinatra’s hit song “You Make Me Feel So Young” could also be translated tosay, “You make me look so young!” People in loving, flirtatious relationshipswith regular and happy sex lives look younger. It is true, we all look betterwhen we are in love and enjoying great sex with our partners.Why? In a way, the brain lives in our skin. Our skin is filled with neuronalconnections stemming from the brain, which is why the skin responds to touch soquickly. The skin is a sensual and sexual organ, which is why we can be arousedby caresses. Aging can cause the nerve endings in the skin to lose sensitivity,another reason to invest in your brain-heart-skin-genital health. A healthybrain can help you enjoy a healthy sex life—but did you know that a great sexlife can also help your brain, your heart, and your skin? It is one of life’sgreatest win-wins.Research from Scotland revealed that making love three times a week can make youlook an average of ten years younger! The scientists interviewed thirty-fivehundred European and American men and women over a ten-year period on a varietyof lifestyle topics. Participants ranged in age from 20 to 104, but most were 45to 55 years old. The one thing this group had in common was that they lookedyoung for their age, according to a six-judge panel who watched the intervieweesthrough a one-way mirror. The volunteer judges guessed the participants’ ages tobe from seven to twelve years younger than their actual ages.A vigorous sex life, according to this study, was the second-most-importantdeterminant of how young a person looked. Only physical activity proved moreimportant than sex in keeping aging at bay. The young-looking participants hadsex an average of three times a week. Having sex more frequently than threetimes a week didn’t seem to produce any added benefits. Three was the magicnumber for keeping that youthful glow.The study also found out that sex without a good relationship that is verysupportive and empathetic doesn’t slow the aging process. In fact, cheating andcasual sex with different partners may cause premature aging from worry andstress.A DOZEN LIFE-ENHANCING REASONS TO MAKE LOVE!Consider the following advantages of a good sex life and you’ll wonder why moredoctors don’t prescribe “Go home and make love to your mate three times a week”to increase happiness, health, and longevity.• Sex can burn fat, about 200 calories per lovemaking session on average—theequivalent of running vigorously for thirty minutes.• Sex causes the brain to release endorphins, naturally occurring chemicals thatact as painkillers and reduce anxiety as well or better than someantidepressants or antianxiety prescription drugs.• In men, sex seems to stimulate the release of growth hormones andtestosterone, which strengthens bones and muscles and skin tone.• In both men and women, research has shown that sex also seems to prompt therelease of substances that bolster the immune system. Researchers at WilkesUniversity in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, found that having sex once or twice aweek boosts the immune system by 30 percent.• A man’s orgasm can even be beneficial to women, according to research thatindicates that semen can reduce depression in women. One study found that womenwhose male partners did not use condoms were less subject to depression thanthose whose partners did. One theory put forth was that prostaglandin, a hormonefound in semen, might be absorbed in the female genital tract, thus modulatingfemale hormones.• Research shows that there are anticancer-producing properties to making love,probably due to positive hormones produced during and after sex.• People who have lots of sex tend to eat better and exercise more, though whichcomes first, the sex or the health habits, is unclear. It may be another win-winof life, where one activity naturally boosts the other.• Having great sex—and a lot of it—can boost the levels of hormones, such asestrogen and DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone), both of which promote smoother,tighter skin.• Sex makes you happier than lots of money. According to a study by the NationalBureau of Economic Research, a marriage that included regular sex was figured tobring the same level of happiness as earning an extra hundred thousand dollars ayear.• A study at Queen’s University in Belfast, Northern Ireland, found that men whohave sex three or more times a week can cut their risk of heart attack in half.Regular sex also cuts the risk of men having a stroke in half.• Endocrinologists at Columbia University found that women who have sex at leastonce a week have more regular menstrual cycles than those who don’t.• In a study done at Duke University, researchers followed 252 people overtwenty-five years to determine the lifestyle factors important in influencinglife span. Sexual frequency and past and present enjoyment of intercourse werethree of the factors studied. For men, frequency of intercourse was asignificant predictor of longevity. While frequency of intercourse was notpredictive of longevity for women, those who reported past enjoyment ofintercourse had greater longevity. This study suggested a positive associationbetween sexual intercourse, pleasure, and longevity.• Muscular contractions during intercourse work the pelvis, thighs, buttocks,arms, neck, and thorax. Men’s Health magazine has gone so far as to call the bedthe single greatest piece of exercise equipment ever invented.SEX KEEPS YOU YOUNGIn August 1982, during my internship year on the surgical floor at the WalterReed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C., Jesse was discharged from thehospital. He had been admitted for an emergency hernia operation two weeksearlier and there had been some minor complications. I remember Jesse so vividlynow because he was one hundred years old but talked and acted like a man thirtyyears younger. Mentally, he seemed every bit as sharp as any patient I hadtalked to that year (or since). He and I developed a special bond, becauseunlike the surgery interns who spent a maximum of five minutes in his room eachday, I spent hours over the course of his hospitalization talking to him abouthis life. The other interns were excited to learn about the latest operatingtechniques. I was interested in Jesse’s story and I wanted to know about Jesse’ssecrets for longevity and happiness.Jesse had his hundredth birthday in the hospital and it was quite an event. Hiswife, actually his second one, who was three decades younger, planned the eventwith the nursing staff. There was great love, playfulness, and physicalaffection between Jesse and his wife. Clearly, they still had the “hots” foreach other.Just before his discharge from the hospital he saw me at the nurses’ stationwriting notes. He enthusiastically waved me over to his room. His bags werepacked and he was dressed in a brown suit, white shirt, and a blue beret. Helooked deeply into my eyes as he quietly asked me, “How long, Doc?”“How long what?” I answered.“How long before I can make love to my wife?”I paused and he continued in a hushed voice, “You want to know the secret tolive to one hundred, Doc? Never miss an opportunity to make love to your wife.How long should I wait?”A slow smile came over my face. “I think a week or so and you should be fine. Begentle at first.” Then I gave him a hug and said, “Thank you. You have given mehope for many years to come.”Science finally caught up to Jesse thirty years later. Now there is a wealth ofresearch connecting healthy sexual activity to longevity. The lesson from Jessestill rings true today. While there are many ingredients to a long life as wehave been exploring, frequent sexual activity with your beloved is one of themtoo.BEAUTY AND THE BRAINIf you apply the ideas in this chapter for six months to a year, you, like Joni,may not need that face-lift after all. And better yet, you’ll increase yourchances for longevity and decrease your chances of depression, dementia, heartdisease, cancer, and obesity. The two biggest organs in your body, your brainand your skin, will be better and you will be healthier, happier, and sexier allat the same time.CHANGE YOUR BRAIN NOW: TWENTY BRAIN TIPS FOR BETTER BLOOD FLOW, SKIN HEALTH, ANDSEX LIFE 1. The brain-skin connection is so strong that some people call skin “thebrain on the outside.” The health of your skin is a visual indicator of thehealth of your brain. When you take care of your brain, you will also seeimprovement in your skin. Don’t get that face-lift before you see whatbrain-smart living can do for your appearance! 2. Even a ten-pound weight loss—if you are losing weight on highly nutritiousfoods—can decrease the age of your face. When people lose weight on a healthyregimen, others often comment on how much younger they look as well. Those wholose weight by eating low-calorie, low-nutrient foods are more likely to lookdrawn, wrinkled, and weak. 3. Beauty begins in your brain. An emotionally balanced brain relaxes thefacial muscles and produces a more serene appearance and smile. Nourishing yourbrain also nourishes your skin and makes it more attractive. 4. Exercise beautifies the skin. It increases blood flow and releases toxins,tones your muscles, gives your skin healthy color, and eases wrinkle-producingstress. Make daily exercise a part of your skin-healthy regimen. 5. Drinking water is helpful because it flushes toxins from the body, but tokeep your skin moist and help protect it from sun damage make sure you also haveat least 1 g fish oil a day. Borage, evening primrose, or black-currant seedoils improve dry skin as well. 6. For healthy skin that glows from the inside out, drink tea: white, green,or black. Tea has anti-inflammatory properties, which may help prevent skincancer and reverse aging. White tea has been shown to protect elastin andcollagen, which help the skin’s strength and elasticity, diminishing wrinklesand sagging. 7. People in cultures where high amounts of dark-colored vegetables, seafood,tea, dark fruits, and berries are consumed have younger-looking skin. Those whoeat lots of processed meats, saturated fats, white sugar, and starch age faster.Your skin is what you eat, so feed it beautiful ingredients. 8. Ditch the skin-harming suntan and give your skin a naturally golden glow byeating more yellow and orange fruits and vegetables, loaded with healthycarotenoids. 9. Massage helps stimulate blood flow in the skin, and studies show that itrelaxes the entire body, lowering stress hormones after a session. The kneadingaction may also help break down scar tissue. So go ahead and enjoy a spa day nowand then, and pamper yourself with a therapeutic massage.10. You really do need your beauty sleep. Women who are deprived of sleep havedisturbed skin-barrier function, greater water loss from the skin, and highlyinflammatory chemicals in circulation. Interestingly, good skin health relies ontwo brain chemicals that also have antiaging properties: GABA and melatonin. Trytaking these supplements before bed, to help both your sleep and your skin.11. Toxins age skin. Avoid smoking, sugar, environmental toxins, grilling foodsover high dry heat, and drinking too much alcohol and caffeine to keep your skintoxin-free.12. Though what you put in your body probably affects your skin’s health themost, what you put on your skin also matters. Wash, exfoliate, tone, andmoisturize your skin with high-quality skin care products that are free oftoxins and contain ingredients that are also good for your brain, such aspomegranate and white tea.13. Be a grateful person and you’ll not only be happier, but you will also smilemore, which will help you be beautiful from the inside out.14. Have you ever felt hungry to be touched? We give and receive feelings oflove and security through our skin through hugs and loving touches. Those whoare physically affectionate with their friends, spouses, and kids will reap thebenefits of regular touch for both their bodies and their brains.15. One study showed that a loving, vigorous sex life can make people appearseven to twelve years younger. Only physical activity proved more important thansex in keeping aging at bay. If you are in a loving relationship, making lovethree times a week will make you both look younger than your years.16. People who have lots of sex tend to eat better and exercise more, thoughwhich comes first, the sex or the health habits, we are not sure. It may beanother win-win of life, in which one activity naturally boosts the other.17. Having great sex—and a lot of it—can boost the levels of hormones, such asestrogen and DHEA, both of which promote smoother, tighter skin.18. Your bed may be the best piece of workout equipment in your house. Sex canburn fat, about 200 calories per lovemaking session on average—the equivalent ofrunning vigorously for thirty minutes. Your reward for participating in thispleasurable activity is a better-toned body and lots of feel-good andskin-friendly hormones.19. Anxiety and depression can quickly age a person’s body and face. However,exercise causes the brain to release endorphins, naturally occurring chemicalsthat act as painkillers and reduce anxiety as well or better than someantidepressants or antianxiety prescription drugs.20. In men, sex stimulates the release of growth hormones and testosterone,which strengthen bones and muscles and skin tone. Regular sex helps keep awoman’s antiaging hormones circulating, thus beautifying her brain, body, andskin. If you are tempted to say, “I’m too tired” or “I have a headache,” thinkof sex with your partner as not only fun and connecting but also as one ofnature’s most pleasurable beauty treatments."},{"pageContent":"7CHRIS AND SAMMIE[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_L01_r1.jpg]TREAT DEPRESSION, GRIEF, AND STRESS TO ADD YEARS TO YOUR LIFEThere is a fountain of youth: it is your mind, your talents, the creativity youbring to your life and the lives of people you love. When you learn to tap thissource, you will truly have defeated age.—SOPHIA LORENANXIETY ATTACKSSammie was a sunny little girl with a wide, happy smile. She was just enteringfourth grade when her mother, Chris, took a job outside the home for the firsttime in years. Sammie was often overcome with anxiety. She became anxious whenher mom had to work a little late, even though friends and family cared for herfor the hour or two before Chris could get home. Then, seemingly out of nowhere,Sammie became obsessed with fear about getting sick. “Her anxiety was getting sointense,” Chris said, “that we scheduled an appointment with a therapist. It wasodd because there was really nothing in our lives that had happened to thispoint that would cause her to worry like this. No sickness or death in thefamily or among friends.” Chris and her husband, Steve, reassured Sammie that itwould be more likely that an “airplane would crash into their house” than thatshe would get seriously or fatally ill. Still, the inexplicable fears continued.[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_042_r1.jpg]One Monday, Sammie came home from school describing a “big magnet machine” herclass saw on a film in class, which scared her. “I told her it was an MRImachine,” said Chris, and calmly explained what it did. “Then we wrote down herfears together on a piece of paper and I asked her, ‘What do we do with ourfears?’ Sammie wadded up the paper and threw it in the fireplace, a visual wayto ‘toss fears away.’ ”The next day, a Tuesday, Sammie took a spill on her Rollerblades. The followingnight her knee was very swollen, and she was frightened. Chris took her daughterto a clinic the next day. And that is when, to their shock and surprise, an“airplane crashed into their house,” so to speak.THE DREADED DIAGNOSIS[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_043_r1.jpg]The doctor asked Chris to call her husband for support when he realized thebulge in Sammie’s knee was a tumor. Sammie would be diagnosed with osteosarcoma,an insidious type of bone cancer. “Looking back,” Chris said, “though we didn’tsee it as anything more than a phase of childish anxiety at the time, a fewscenes flashed through my mind. There was a family outing when Sammie had someshortness of breath. On the Fourth of July, she’d not wanted to run with therest of the kids.” Sadly, by the time the cancer had showed up on her knee, ithad also gone to her lungs. This was followed by chemotherapy, every three weeksfor five to seven days, for one very tough year. Along with the chemo came awfulnausea, weakness, and hair loss. The doctors were able to save Sammie’scancer-riddled leg, but 70 percent of her leg and knee was now titanium. Shealso had to have a thoracotomy, which is a painful major surgery that involvedan incision in the chest and spreading of the ribs, so the surgeons could get toand remove the tumors in her lungs.Sammie finished treatment in November of 2008 and was pronounced cancer free,but in January of 2009, she took a fall at the fairgrounds. The cancer hadmetastasized to her spine. More treatment, spine surgery, more thoracotomies,more agonizing pain, more of every parent’s worst nightmares, multiplied. Thethree-month scan showed the cancer had spread everywhere. In fact, the surgeonsaid that there were too many tumors to count. Even so, knowing that Sammie’swill to live was so strong, Chris and Steve agreed to try more chemo to slow thegrowth. However, one night, because she was so low in potassium from her manyordeals, Sammie went into cardiac arrest.“We literally lost her,” Chris said, “as her life ebbed away in my arms.” Steve,however, knew CPR and managed to get her heart beating again. When she came to,Sammie reported seeing a bright light and thought the family was at Disneylandbecause it was such a happy place. Her glimpse of heaven? After this experience,there would be no more chemo, no more medical interventions.THE HARDEST GOOD-BYE“We had to shift from helping Sammie to live, to preparing our precious child todie,” said Chris. Talk about a task that no mother or father can fathom havingto do.Sammie lived seven more months, but these days were filled with horrendous pain,sickness, and depression. Eventually hospice came, and though Sammie had aglimpse of the happiness beyond death during her heart attack, she still foughthard to live to the very end. The last three days of her life were worse thanChris or Steve could have imagined. There were many seizures, and the long hoursof watching their little girl fighting in vain for her life were devastatinglydifficult. “Sammie wanted to die at home,” Chris explained, a catch in hervoice, wiping at tears. “We did all we could for her up to the end, when shedied as her father held her tight in his arms.”Those last three days, along with the multiple ordeals over the last three and ahalf years, would be a trauma that would fill Chris’s mind with painfulrecurring memories that invaded her thoughts night and day.DESCENT INTO DARKNESSThere was a beautiful funeral, a celebration of Sammie’s courageous short life,but after Chris said her final good-bye to her daughter, in many ways she saidgood-bye to herself. “Sammie was our middle child,” Chris shared. “She has anolder sister, Taylor, and younger brother, Ryan, and of course I did my best asa parent in crisis, but they were often put on the back burner of our lives,which revolved around saving their sister’s life and then helping their sisterlet go of her life. There was little or no thought of myself during those yearsas I poured every ounce of my strength into Sammie’s care.”To try to numb the great loss, Chris began to eat and to drink alcohol. She hada hard time getting out of bed. “I sank into a depression so low that I toldmyself I would just make it to the anniversary of Sammie’s death and then find away to end my life. I just didn’t feel I could go on. I was seeing a goodtherapist who worked with me every week, and promised me there would be a shifteventually that would help lessen this debilitating grief. He did not encouragemedication, telling me, ‘There is no medication that can touch this kind ofpain.’ But there were things I kept from the therapist, even, like my increaseduse of alcohol.”THE TURNING POINTThen one day Chris was visiting with a friend of her sister’s. “This lady wasvery fit and had a positive attitude.” Chris was short, just 51, weighing alittle over 200 pounds and walking in a gloom so heavy she thought she’d neversmile—and mean it—again. “This friend had a copy of the Change Your Brain,Change Your Body Food Journal,” Chris explained. “Flipping through it, Ithought, ‘Okay, I like this. It makes sense to me. I have to start looking forthe brighter side of life.’ After all, my choices at that point were to take mylife, drink myself to death, or end up in rehab. And I was way too proud to goto rehab.”Chris went home, found the book Change Your Brain, Change Your Body on theInternet, and downloaded it to read that evening. She read the whole book (not ashort book!) in one night. “There was one part of the book, and I can stillremember how I felt when I read the list of things that alcohol stops you fromfeeling, like empathy and compassion for others. I knew I needed to get myfeelings of empathy and compassion back for my other children and husband. Ineeded to find a way to be happy and whole again for their sakes, and my own.”Chris was a thirsty sponge and she absorbed everything written in the book. Shesaid, “I went hard core into the plan. In fact, I did a twenty-eight-daycleanse. I tossed out all the alcohol, ate no processed food, and began takingfish oil and vitamin D.”The change for Chris was fast and remarkable. “Within eight days I didn’t careif I never dropped a pound again. I was free! Because I was eating food thatactually nourished my cells, the food and alcohol cravings stopped. I got rid ofall the diet drinks and colas. I slept through the night for the first time infour years. And for the first time in years, I didn’t wake up in a panic.”Chris continued, “I never looked past the trauma with Sammie for the reasonsbehind my depression and addiction. I blamed everything I felt on the loss andgrief. But as I read Change Your Brain, Change Your Body, I took a broaderinventory of my life and realized I’d struggled with anxiety for a long while.After the first eight days of getting rid of junk and dealing with ANTs(automatic negative thoughts) according to the methods in the book, my anxietylevel dropped from a 10 to a 3. I can actually talk myself out of an anxietyattack now by asking myself questions such as, ‘Is it really true?” and ‘If evena part of it is true, is there anything I can do to change it?’ I also use otherantianxiety techniques from the book, but honestly, it is usually so calm insidemy brain now that I don’t need them often. And remember, I only began thisprogram five months ago.”Chris went from never having run before to running four days a week. Sheadvises, “I really recommend running outside if at all possible. I also gotmyself some support by getting involved in a group called Running for Womenwhere they taught me how to run and walk in intervals. I run 4.5 miles a day,four days a week. Sometimes I run with a bunch of women but sometimes alone. Idon’t let anything deter me. I go no matter what because I need those endorphinsto help me stay balanced! I may not ‘love’ the feeling of running while I do it,but I see it as an emotional investment that pays huge dividends. It only takesan hour, four times a week, and the payoff is a calmer brain and healthierbody.”In five months, Chris is down 35 pounds and four pant sizes, which she sees as aside benefit to getting her emotional life back thanks to nutritional changesand physical activity. “It’s not just that I am losing weight. I am changing theway I lose weight. I have lost 8 inches off my waist, my neck has slimmed, andmy skin is brighter. Though I’d like to lose some more weight, if you saw metoday, you’d never think, ‘Oh, there’s a woman who needs to lose some pounds!’My weight, with the new muscle, has distributed itself well. I used to be aWeight Watchers gal, but I ate a lot of diet food on that plan, and it onlyincreased my cravings. I’d always gain the weight back. On this plan I don’thave cravings because I am eating real food that satisfies. I finally look likeI’m in the body I’ve always belonged in, and I am!”Chris now admits that the depths of her depression had roots and patterns beyondthe loss and trauma. She says, “I’m grieving now, but I’m grieving well.” Shespoke of taking care of herself the way a mom would take care of a child.“Friends tease me about always having healthy snacks in my purse when we are outand about at kids’ events. Lord knows there’s nothing redeeming in most snackbars. Trust me, I’ve looked! I just ask them, ‘When your kids were little, didyou ever leave the house without a diaper bag packed with everything your childmight need, including healthy snacks and a sippy cup? You were prepared becauseyou didn’t want to end up stuck somewhere with a cranky, crying baby, right?Well, I’m just treating myself as a good mom would treat her child because Idon’t want to get stuck somewhere without nutritious food or drink and end upcranky and crying.’ ”Chris’s daughter, Taylor, is now seventeen years old, and much of her teen yearswere spent without her parents’ full focus because of her sister’s majorillness. Recently Taylor told her mom, “You are a joy to be around again!” Ryanis eleven now and so supportive of his mom as well. He told Chris, “You don’thave two necks anymore!” (Boys at eleven are honest, if anything.) He also toldher one day that he wasn’t going to have dessert for a whole week as a way tosupport his mom’s efforts. Her husband, Steve, has stood by Chris through everymoment of this long ordeal and he verbalizes how proud of her he is, that heknows that every morning she wakes up she has to make a choice to live happy andhonor her daughter’s memory or slack up and go back to that dark place.“I’m still grieving but I am grieving better, if that makes sense. When we spendtime together as a family, going out somewhere fun, I really have to fight theANTs. My automatic reaction is sadness and thinking about the hole in our familywhere Sammie used to be. But I take control of my thoughts and remind myselfthat Sammie is happy and wants us to be happy too. I focus on what we stillhave, including one another, and the good memories of Sammie, instead of what wedon’t have.”LIFE IS GOOD AGAINChris has become a crusader for my new program, The Amen Solution—Thinner,Smarter, Happier with Dr. Daniel Amen! Her father, mom, and sister are on theplan. Taylor has lost 17 pounds as well. Friends sometimes approach her and saythings like, “I can’t believe I’m telling you this because what you went throughis worse than what I’m going through, but I’m feeling depressed and I can’t helpbut notice the change in you.” She then shares my books with them. “I keep acopy of The Amen Solution on my kitchen counter now because I refer to it sooften for myself or for someone who asks me about what’s happened to me the lastfew months.”When I was speaking at our northern California Clinic, Chris’s friend Mo, who isalso the director of outcome research at the Amen Clinics, called Chris andencouraged her to come meet me and hear my talk. Chris’s ANTs said to her brain,“Oh, I have too much to do, I really can’t.” But immediately Chris recognizedthis as the “old Chris” talking and replied, instead, “I’d love to go.” I, forone, am so glad she did, as her story deeply and profoundly touched me.When I first met Chris she started to cry, which almost made me cry. Thishappens to me a lot. People come up to me, start to cry, and then tell me howour work has changed their life or the life of one of their loved ones. This hasalways been the reason behind why I do what I do, despite some of the obstaclesthat have come our way.Chris shared, “I’m honoring Sammie’s memory in a better way by taking care ofmyself, and everything else seems to be just falling into place. I don’t want tolive in the realm of ‘childhood cancer.’ I want to help people enjoy their livesand overcome whatever issues are troubling them. Sammie didn’t want to be ‘thecancer kid’ or poster child for cancer either. She just wanted to be Sammie,herself.”The family sold their home and moved to a new house shortly after Sammie died.In Chris’s case, the house was too full of sad memories and a new homerepresented a new chapter of life. As Chris began to ponder the other changesshe wanted to make in her life, she looked for a job that would support hergoals. She applied to work at a specialty shoe store where people get into theright running shoes for the shape of their foot. “I have a strong retailbackground and really wanted to work for this company, but were they going tohire a middle-aged woman in her forties who weighed 202 pounds? In years past, Iwould have let that thought intimidate me, but my focus was so strong on gettinghealthy and I’d been through the death of a child, so really, I felt I didn’thave anything to lose in applying, and I took a leap.”Chris eventually secured the position and today absolutely loves her job. “Thestaff is gentle and kind, and we have a great time on the job together. I amstretching and growing my brain cells by learning so much new information.”She continued, “I am creating a life that I desire instead of what was presentedto me. I saw quite poignantly that there is much in life over which we have nocontrol. So I’d better take control of what I can. So I am feeding myself well,taking myself for runs, being nice to myself. And this allows me to be thehealthy, happy person who can now give joy to others again.”Chris’s sister started a “bunny drive,” which happens every spring, whenchildren’s hospitals are in most need of gifts for sick kids. The charitableproject gathers all sorts of new stuffed animals (five thousand in 2011) andgives them to six local hospitals that care for children, making deliveries onGood Friday. When a child gets a hospital bed during this time, a stuffed animallies on the pillow with a name tag that says, “From Angel Sammie.” For moreinformation on how to help with the bunny drive and to read more of Sammie’sstory, you can visit www.caringbridge.org/visit/sammiehartsfield[http://www.caringbridge.org/visit/sammiehartsfield].HOW DEPRESSION, GRIEF, AND STRESS STEAL YOUR LIFEDepression, grief, and chronic stress all take years off your life and make youlook, feel, and think older than your age. Depression is one of the greatestproblems and killers of our time, affecting fifty million Americans at somepoint in their lives. Nearly all of us have either suffered from depression orhave known someone who has. Two of my best friends had fathers who killedthemselves. Depression, all by itself, is a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease,heart disease, cancer, and obesity. When depression accompanies heart disease,people are much more likely to die earlier than those without it. Grief causesyour heart to go into abnormal rhythms, which is one of the reasons why peopleoften experience physical chest pain with the loss of a loved one.Chronic stress is associated with an increased production of certain hormonesthat cause metabolic changes that put more fat on your belly and diminish thepart of the brain that helps get memories into long-term storage. Whenever youexperience depression, grief, or chronic stress, think of it as a healthemergency. These negative emotional states have a damaging effect on yourphysical body and have been associated with obesity, cancer, diabetes, heartdisease, and dementia. Unless treated aggressively, depression, grief, andchronic stress will rob your ability to live a long, healthy life.Chris’s story illustrates how these negative emotional states can overwhelm andsteal your life, and how to work to heal them. When hit with a severe emotionaltrauma many people self-medicate the pain with toxic food, alcohol, drugs, orsex. The problem, of course, is that short-term solutions only eradicate thepain for a little while and make the situation worse in the long run.THE BEST TIME TO START HEALING FROM STRESS IS WHEN IT STARTSPastor Gerald Sharon lost his wife in December 2010 after a nine-month battlewith colon cancer. It was hell for him. Yet his initial reaction to the crisishad been the opposite of Chris’s. Gerald had been a senior pastor for many yearsand had seen many people fall apart during the stress of crises. He knew that ifhe was going to survive and be able to take care of his wife and be there forhis children he had to get healthy. So in the midst of the family emergency, hewent to his physician, saw a nutritionist, got on a healthy-eating regimen,exercised, and lost 50 pounds. “I am a stress eater,” he told me. “I knew if Iwas not careful, I would gain 50 more pounds and die in the process as well.”It is common to suffer physical and emotional exhaustion when mourning. Adaptingto the loss of someone you love is one of life’s most difficult challenges. Yourbrain is being asked to adapt, sometimes suddenly, to new routines without thepresence of your loved one. Grief can leave you thinking you may be going crazyat times. In her bestselling memoir The Year of Magical Thinking, the authorJoan Didion writes candidly about the sorts of “tricks” her brain would play onher as she adjusted to the sudden loss of her husband after many decades of ahappy marriage. “We might expect that we will be prostrate, inconsolable, crazywith loss,” she writes. “We do not expect to be literally crazy, cool customerswho believe that their husband is about to return and need his shoes.” It willcomfort you to know that you are not going crazy; but your deep limbic system,where your emotions of connection and bonding are stored, is going throughwithdrawal from the person you love as bad as that of any drug withdrawal.Immediately following a major loss, your prefrontal cortex (PFC) may beoverwhelmed by the limbic system (feeling and mood center) and temporarily ceaseto function well. Even creating a to-do list may feel taxing in the days, weeks,and months following loss or during times of high stress. Accept that you mayneed to radically shorten your to-do list, and give your brain and body vitaltime to adjust.You do not have to react to a crisis with self-destructive behavior. You canrespond with love—the type of self-love that opts for caring for your brain andbody, so that you can deal with the stresses that will inevitably come your way.NATURAL WAYS TO TREAT DEPRESSION, GRIEF, AND STRESS TO LOOK AND FEEL YOUNGERBoth Gerald and Chris give us guidance on how to naturally treat depression,grief, and stress. In addition to being kind and patient with yourself, it willhelp immensely if you can put “Take Exceptional Care of My Brain” at the top ofyour newly shortened and reprioritized to-do list. This one decision will helpyou cope better with all the other choices and adjustments you must make duringa difficult time. Here are some ways to practice good self-care and brain careduring stressful or sorrowful seasons:• Eating proper food to nourish your body is critical during times of stress.Fruits and veggies will reduce inflammation that leads to more pain and illness.Protein will assist a strong transmission of nerve impulses in the brain and isa key fuel for healing and optimizing brain function. One of the amino acids inprotein, tyrosine, will increase the levels of two important neurotransmitters,norepinephrine and dopamine. This habit will help your energy levels and youwill feel better physically. If you don’t feel like eating solid food, ahigh-quality protein shake can come to your rescue. Sip on it as you can, eventhough you may not feel hungry at first. Though your appetite might not presentduring the worst days, your body needs nutrients now more than ever.• Get physical exercise, which will help you withstand and heal emotional pain.Force yourself to put on those sneakers and walk, preferably outside so you canalso get the benefit of sunlight. You may find, like Chris, that pushing pastinitial reluctance to get out of the house and move will pay big dividends.Listening to music or an audio book may help make the walk more enjoyable. Evenif you don’t “love” walking while you are doing it, you will notice an improvedmood during the day, which will make this investment in your brain health worththe effort. Yoga may also be soothing if you are feeling anxious as well as sad.• Take healthy supplements. Smart supplementation is important, such as usingomega-3s, optimizing your vitamin D level, and using targeted supplementsdepending on your own type of brain (more on this in a bit).• Eradicating the ANTs that infest your mind is critical to keeping your mindfertile for long-term growth. (More on this later in the chapter as well.)• Cry. Did you know that tears of sorrow have been shown to have toxins in them,where tears of happiness do not? This is one reason that you tend to feel betterafter a good cry when you are sad. So don’t postpone or push back the tears. Letthe grief waves flow, and wash some of the pain out of your brain and body witha good cleansing cry.• Set goals. Having a specific goal is critical for positive brain function.After that good cry, you’ll probably feel some lifting of sorrow and this is agood time to treat yourself to something you like to do, that is good for you.You need breaks from sadness! Meet an understanding friend for lunch, browse toyour heart’s content at a bookstore, play or run with your dog. Watch a sitcomor read a light, funny book if you can. Do whatever soothes and offers even asmall bit of joy.• As soon as possible, learn something new. Perhaps take an art class, a gourmetcooking class, learn how to fly fish, or dance the samba. Learning anything new,especially something outside your comfort zone, will stimulate the growth of newcells and neural connections. When Chris pushed herself to apply for and learn anew job, her brain’s neurons responded with growth and healing feelings. If thenew subject or skill really catches your attention, you may experience periodsof “flow” where you feel almost transported away from worry, regret, and sorrowfor a time. A fascinating new hobby or interest can give you mini-vacations fromgrief. One widow who was struggling to find a reason to live woke up one morningand thought, “I’d like to work at a horse rescue ranch.” She followed that smalldesire volunteering at just such a ranch and found the work to be meaningful andhealing. As she comforted the animals, they in turn comforted her. It also puther in contact with compassionate people who shared her love of animals andnature.• Hydrate. Water is crucial in brain function and will also keep your lymphsystem working to remove toxins from the immune cells and reduce thepossibilities of infections when under stress.• Make every effort to focus on what you can do to strive to be more loving andgrateful. “In my thirty years of helping the bereaved,” says Dr. Louis LaGrand,a grief counselor and author of Love Lives On: Learning from the ExtraordinaryExperiences of the Bereaved, writes, “I am convinced that love is the singlemost effective coping strategy that will get you through any loss. For thebrain, it will minimize, often eliminate, the power of negative thoughts togenerate excessive and unnecessary emotional and physical pain.” In addition tothe great advice of “loving more,” I would add, “purpose to be more grateful.”The emotions of love and gratitude literally block many negative emotions in thebrain. It is hard to really feel grateful and negative or stressed at the sametime.COMPLICATED GRIEFMost of us will experience the pain grief brings at some point in our lives,either through the death of a loved one, unwanted divorce, or other rejection orloss. In time, most people move on. Though we never forget someone we loveddeeply, as months and years pass, the memories of them are less attached to painand more attached to warm and positive memories. This time varies for all of us,as human beings don’t grieve on a set schedule, but there is a syndrome that mayperpetuate the grief process longer in some people than others.In a UCLA study on bereavement, scientists proposed that in addition to normalgrief, there is a syndrome called complicated grief. This is a sort ofunrelenting grief that never allows for healing and moving on. It activatesneurons in the reward centers of the brain (as well as the pain centers),possibly giving past memories addiction-like properties. After the loved onedies, those who adapt to the loss eventually stop getting this neural reward,but those who don’t adapt continue to crave it. This is not something peopleconsciously do; it simply happens to some people (10–15 percent of the grievingpopulation) and not to others.Complicated grief can be debilitating, involving recurrent pangs of painfulemotions, including intense yearning, longing, and searching for the deceasedand a preoccupation with thoughts of the loved one. Some of these experiencesare common to the newly grieving as well, as the brain strives to adjust to newrealities. But if the brain doesn’t adjust, if grief is just as intense yearslater, additional help may be needed to process through grief and find ameaningful life again. Besides the “natural helps for grief and stress” listedabove, someone whose grief has become complicated or has turned into a clinicaldepression may need therapy, supplements, and medication to move forward again.Below is a chart that might help you determine if you or someone you care aboutis simply going through the normal grief process or may have complicated griefor clinical depression.CHARACTERISTICS OF GRIEF OR DEPRESSION:A SIDE-BY-SIDE COMPARISONGriefComplicated Grief or Depression A normal response to loss that causesdistressGeneralized distress—loss of interest, pleasure May experience somephysical symptoms of distressPhysical distress, hopelessness, guilt Still ableto look toward the futureNo sense of a positive future Passive wish fordeathSuicidal ideation not uncommon Retains capacity for pleasureChange incapacity to enjoy life or things that were formerly pleasurablePersistent flat affect, negative self-image Still able to express feelings andhumorBored, lack of interest and expression Comes in wavesConstant, unremittingCan cope with distress on own or with supportive listeningMedication for grief is an exception, not the ruleMay require combined therapy,supplements or medicationKNOW YOUR BRAIN TYPEKnowing the type of brain you have is critical to getting the right help. When Ifirst started our brain imaging work at the Amen Clinics in 1991 I was lookingfor the one pattern that was associated with depression, ADHD, or bipolardisorder. But our brain imaging work clearly taught us that there was not onebrain pattern associated with any of these illnesses. They all had multipletypes. Of course, I then realized that there will never be just one pattern fordepression, because not all depressed people are the same. Some are withdrawn,others are angry, and still others are anxious or obsessive. The scans helped meunderstand the type of depression, ADHD, bipolar disorder, overeating, oraddiction a person had, so that I could better target their treatment.This one idea led to a dramatic breakthrough in my own personal effectivenesswith patients and it opened up a new world of understanding and hope for thetens of thousands of people who have come to the Amen Clinics and the millionsof people who have read my books.Basically, we see these eight brain types:1. Impulsive2. Compulsive3. Impulsive-compulsive4. Sad or moody5. Anxious6. Temporal lobe7. Toxic8. Post-traumatic stressWe see these in all sorts of combinations as well. This is exactly the reasonwhy most psychological and psychiatric treatment programs do not work on aconsistent basis. They take a one-size-fits-all approach to illnesses, such asdepression, which judging from our brain imaging work makes absolutely no senseat all.There is much more information, including a detailed self-test, on our website(www.theamensolution.com [http://www.theamensolution.com]) and in my otherbooks, such as Change Your Brain, Change Your Life, Healing ADD, Healing Anxietyand Depression, The Amen Solution, and Unchain Your Brain.BRAIN TYPE 1: THE IMPULSIVE BRAINPeople with this brain type have low activity in the PFC. Think of the PFC asthe brain’s brake. It stops us from saying stupid things or making baddecisions. Subsequently, people with this type of brain struggle with impulsecontrol, attention, and disorganization. They have trouble thinking about theconsequences of their behavior before they act, which can get them into allsorts of hot water with their health, relationships, work, and money.One of my best friends is a perfect example of this type. He is on a diet everysingle day of his life. He wakes up every morning committed to the idea ofeating right. He maintains the thought as he passes the first doughnut shop. Hestarts to sweat as he passes the second doughnut shop. By the third one, he hasno willpower left. After completely giving up on his plans by noon, he uttersthe famous words of all impulsive overeaters: “I’ll start my diet tomorrow.”This type is common among people who have ADHD, which has been associated withlow dopamine levels in the brain. Research suggests that having untreated ADHDnearly doubles the risk for being overweight and having other medical problems.Without proper treatment, it is nearly impossible for these people to beconsistent with any health plan.My research team and I have published several studies showing that when peoplewith ADHD try to concentrate, they actually get less activity in the PFC, whichwill cause them to have even less control over their own behavior. For thesepeople, literally, the harder they try to lose weight, the worse it gets.Normal Brain SPECT Scan[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_044_r1.jpg]Full, even, symmetrical activityImpulsive Brain Type[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_045_r1.jpg]Low PFC at front of brainThis type is helped by boosting dopamine levels in the brain to strengthen thePFC. Higher-protein, lower-carbohydrate diets tend to help, as do exercise andcertain stimulating medications or supplements, such as green tea or L-tyrosine.Any supplement or medicine that calms the brain, such as 5-HTP(5-hydroxytryptophan), typically makes this type worse, because it can lowerboth your worries and your impulse control.BRAIN TYPE 2: THE COMPULSIVE BRAINPeople with this type tend to get stuck on negative thoughts or negativebehaviors. They often say that they have no control over their behavior and tendto worry, hold grudges, be rigid and inflexible, argumentative or oppositional.The main problem is that they have trouble shifting their attention, so they getstuck on bad thoughts and behavior.I am often asked, what is the difference between people who are impulsive versusthose who are compulsive? Impulsivity is when you get a thought in your head andyou just act on it without thinking. Compulsivity is when you get a thought inyour head and you feel as though you have to act on it.The compulsive brain on SPECT scans usually shows too much activity in a deeppart of the frontal lobes called the anterior cingulate gyrus. I think of thispart as the brain’s gear shifter that helps us go from thought to thought oridea to idea. When it functions optimally, people tend to be flexible,adaptable, and go with the flow. When this part of the brain works too hard,usually owing to a deficit in the neurotransmitter serotonin, people tend to berigid, inflexible, and get stuck on bad thoughts or bad behaviors.Normal “Active” Brain SPECT Scan[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_046_r1.jpg]Most active areas in cerebellum at back of the brainCompulsive Brain Type[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_047_r1.jpg]High anterior cingulate at front of brainCaffeine and diet pills usually make this brain type worse, because these brainsdo not need more stimulation. People with this type often feel as though theyneed a glass of wine at night, or two or three, to calm their worries.Compulsive brain types do best when we find natural ways to increase serotonin.Serotonin is calming to the brain. Physical exercise boosts serotonin as doesusing certain supplements, such as 5-HTP or St. John’s Wort. 5-HTP actually hasgood scientific evidence that it can be helpful for depression, anxiety, andweight loss.BRAIN TYPE 3: THE IMPULSIVE-COMPULSIVE BRAINOn the surface it seems almost contradictory. How can you be both impulsive andcompulsive at the same time? Think of compulsive gamblers. These are people whoare compulsively driven to gamble and yet have very little control over theirimpulses. It is the same with this brain type. Our scans tend to show too muchactivity in the brain’s gear shifter (anterior cingulate) region of the brain,so people overthink and get stuck on negative thoughts, but they also have toolittle activity in the PFC so they have trouble supervising their own behavior.Barb struggled with oppositional and impulsive behavior as a teenager and stillat age forty-eight got stuck on negative thoughts and had trouble controllingher impulses, especially in raising her own teenagers. Many people in her familystruggled with alcohol and other addictions, which is very common with thisbrain type. Barb had tried a number of treatment programs before coming to theAmen Clinics without any success. She had tried stimulants for ADHD, which madeher angry, and antidepressants that boosted serotonin, such as Prozac, Zoloft,and Lexapro, which seemed to make her more impulsive. After listening to herstory and seeing her scans it was clear she had an impulsive-compulsive brain.People with this type benefit from treatments that increase both serotonin anddopamine, such as exercise with a combination of supplements like 5-HTP (toboost serotonin) and green tea (to boost dopamine) or medications to do the samething, such as a stimulant plus a serotonin-enhancing antidepressant at the sametime. For Barb, this combination of supplements helped to balance her brain soshe could feel emotionally stable. Giving her 5-HTP or green tea alone wouldhave made her worse!BRAIN TYPE 4: THE SAD OR MOODY BRAINPeople with this type often struggle with depression, negativity, low energy,low self-esteem, and pain symptoms. On brain SPECT scans we often see too muchactivity, deep within the limbic or emotional part of the brain. With this type,when there are the external factors of stress or grief, the vulnerability isoften depression. We often hear of depression running in families or beingbrought on by stressful early life events.Gary struggled with chronic sadness and negativity. He remembers feeling sad asa child, which only worsened after he lost his grandfather at age thirteen. Atage fifty-seven he felt older than his peers and suffered with arthritis. He hadtried psychotherapy and several antidepressants with little effect before hecame to see us. His SPECT scan showed too much activity in the limbic oremotional part of his brain, which is commonly seen in mood disorders. For thistype, we have had good success by encouraging our patients to exercise, takehigh-dose fish oil (6 g), and certain supplements, such as SAMe(S-adenosylmethionine), to help improve mood, energy, and pain.Normal “Active” Brain SPECT Scan[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_048_r1.jpg]Most active areas in cerebellumSad Brain Type[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_049_r1.jpg]High deep limbic activitySAMe is a nutritional supplement that has good research demonstrating itseffectiveness for both depression and pain. Of note, there is a clear connectionwith physical pain and depression, which SAMe appears to help, as does theantidepressant Cymbalta (duloxetine). When the limbic brain is combined with thecompulsive brain, serotonin interventions seem to be the most effective.BRAIN TYPE 5: THE ANXIOUS BRAINPeople with this type struggle with feelings of anxiety or nervousness. Theyoften feel tense, panicky, and stressed and tend to predict the worst. They areusually conflict avoidant and live with a feeling of angst and that somethingbad will happen. We often see too much activity in an area deep in the braincalled the basal ganglia.Doreen felt anxious most of the time. She was always waiting for something badto happen, and she frequently suffered from headaches and stomach problems.Marijuana helped relax her, but it also gave her memory problems. She had triedantianxiety medications but quickly had the feeling that she was becomingdependent on them, a feeling she hated. Doreen’s SPECT study showed too muchactivity in the basal ganglia. This part of the brain is involved in setting aperson’s anxiety level. When there is too much activity here, often owing to lowlevels of a chemical called GABA, people often have anxiety and a lot ofphysical tension.Normal “Active” Brain SPECT Scan[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_050_r1.jpg]Most active areas in cerebellumAnxious Brain Type[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_051_r1.jpg]High basal ganglia activityBy soothing Doreen’s brain with meditation and hypnosis, plus using acombination of B6, magnesium, and GABA, she felt calmer and more relaxed andnoticed a big boost in her energy.BRAIN TYPE 6: THE TEMPORAL LOBE BRAINThe temporal lobes, underneath your temples and behind your eyes, are involvedwith memory, learning, processing emotions, language (hearing and reading),reading social cues, mood stability, and temper control. Trouble in the temporallobes, often owing to a prior brain injury, can lead to memory problems,learning difficulties, trouble finding the right words in conversation, troublereading social cues, mood instability, and temper problems. Temporal lobeproblems are very common in resistant depression.Beth, twenty-five, came to see us after her fourth suicide attempt. She hadproblems with depression and her temper since she was a child. Her moods wouldfluctuate wildly and she could never predict how she would feel. When she wasthree years old, she fell down a flight of stairs and was unconscious, but onlyfor a brief period of time. Beth had been on many different antidepressantswithout success. Beth’s brain SPECT scan showed clear problems in her lefttemporal lobe. For many years now, we have seen trouble in this part of thebrain be associated with dark, evil, awful, destructive thoughts, including bothsuicidal and homicidal thoughts. None of the medications she had been put onwere specifically to help stabilize her temporal lobes.Normal Brain SPECT Scan[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_052_r1.jpg]Full, even, symmetrical activityTemporal Lobe Brain Type[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_053_r1.jpg]Low left temporal lobeI have found antiseizure medications to be particularly helpful for this braintype. In addition, balancing blood sugar, by eating small meals four to fivetimes a day, making sure to get good sleep, and eliminating sugar are also veryhelpful. With this combination of treatment, Beth’s moods stabilized and she wasable to stay out of the hospital and restart college.BRAIN TYPE 7: THE TOXIC BRAINIn this brain type we see overall low activity in the brain. There are manypotential causes of this brain type, including:• Drug or alcohol abuse• Environmental toxins, such as mold, paint, or solvents• Past chemotherapy or radiation• Brain infections, such as meningitis or encephalitis• Lack of oxygen, such as with a strangulation, near drowning, or sleep apnea• Heavy metal poisoning, such as with lead, iron, or mercury• Anemia• HypothyroidismPatients with this pattern often feel depressed or sad, have low energy, and arementally foggy and cognitively impaired.Will came to see us for resistant depression and brain fog. He had seen sixother psychiatrists and had tried numerous medications. He was feeling hopeless,helpless, and worthless. He had frequent suicidal ideas and his family wasextremely worried about him. He looked much older than his sixty-three years.His brain SPECT scan showed overall low activity.This is the classic pattern we see in a toxic brain. I met with him and hiswife. He said, and she confirmed, that he did not drink or use drugs. Our firstefforts needed to be directed at finding why he had such a toxic-looking brain.After extensive lab and environmental testing, we discovered that he had beenworking in an office that had extensive mold growth. The office had experienceda flood the year before he first became depressed. Other co-workers alsosuffered with cognitive impairment.Normal Surface Brain SPECT Scan[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_054_r1.jpg]Full, even, symmetrical activityWill’s Toxic Surface Brain SPECT Scan[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_055_r1.jpg]Overall decreased activityThe first step in treating this type of brain is to eliminate the toxin. If aperson is drinking or doing drugs, that must stop in order to heal. If there ismold in the environment, that must be fully treated before the person can returnto work. If there is severe anemia or hypothyroidism, it is essential to treatit. If there was a loss of oxygen from chemotherapy or radiation, then we knowthe culprit and can go straight into brain rehabilitation.BRAIN TYPE 8: THE POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS BRAINPeople who have experienced emotional trauma sometimes develop lifelong stresspatterns in the brain, especially if they had vulnerable brains when thetraumatic events appeared. On SPECT scans we see that the brain takes on aspecific pattern. We call it the diamond-plus pattern, because on scans thepattern appears in the shape of a diamond:• Increased activity in the anterior cingulate gyrus at the top of the diamond(negative thoughts)• Increased activity in the deep limbic system at the bottom of the diamond(feelings of sadness)• Increased activity on the outside of the right temporal lobe (this is the“plus” part of the diamond-plus pattern), where we think some traumatic memoriesare storedNormal “Active” Brain SPECT Scan[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_056_r1.jpg]Most active areas in cerebellum at back of the brainPTSD Type[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_057_r1.jpg]Diamond-plus patternThe scans show a pattern where it looks as though the trauma or traumas getstuck in the brain.Frank, sixty-six, was the CEO of a large company. He came to see us because hismemory was poor and he struggled with anxiety, depression, and excessive alcoholuse. His wife had given him an ultimatum to get help or she was going to divorcehim. Frank denied having any emotional trauma in his history. His scan displayedthe diamond-plus pattern. All of the overactivity in his brain helped usunderstand why he drank so much. He was trying to put out the fire in his brainthat made him feel terrible. But the alcohol made him irritable, and his wifewas nearly finished with the chronic stress he gave her. Seeing the diamondpattern led me to ask more pointed questions about past trauma. Again, he deniedit. Being the persistent soul that I am, I asked him repeatedly. He kept sayingno. When I brought his wife into my office, I asked her. She looked at herhusband and said, “Frank has a bad relationship with his father.”“Why is that?” I asked Frank.“When I initially made a lot of money, I bought a home for my mother but not myfather, and he has held a grudge against me ever since.”“Why did you just do it for your mom?” I asked.“When I was growing up in the poor part of Chicago, my parents were separatedand I was raised by my mom. My dad was not around. But my mom was a drug addictand often not home. When I was a young adult, she got clean and I wanted to helpsupport her getting well.”“And you have no emotional trauma in your past?” I said, wondering how he couldforget the years of being raised without a father by a drug-abusing mother. My,how the brain can block out pain; it is indeed a sneaky organ.It was at that moment that Frank’s face changed and he started to sob. He hadforgotten all of the times when his mother did not come home, when he was leftalone, when he thought she was dead, or when she brought over men who were veryscary to him. Frank was loaded with trauma he had never processed, andsubsequently the trauma still lived, wreaking havoc, blocked in his emotionalbrain. His overactive brain caused him emotional pain and he used alcohol to tryto put the brain fires out. Of course, the alcohol brought him all sorts ofother problems and made him more distant from those he loved.To calm the diamond-plus pattern and eradicate the past emotional traumas seenon scans, we often refer people to a special psychological treatment calledEMDR, or eye movement desensitization and reprocessing. I published a study anumber of years ago on using EMDR with six police officers who developedpost-traumatic reactions after being involved with shootings. At the beginningof the study all of the officers were out of work on stress leaves. After eightto ten sessions their brains were calmer and they all went back to work. You canlearn more about EMDR at www.emdria.org [http://www.emdria.org]. We also havepeople engage in all the longevity and brain healthy strategies listed in thisbook.It is common to have more than one of the eight brain types listed above. Ifthat is true for you, work on the most painful type first and then the others.You can also join our online community at www.theamensolution.com[http://www.theamensolution.com] to learn more about your own brain and what todo with combination patterns. Also, when people struggle with resistantproblems, a brain SPECT scan can provide additional valuable information.ERADICATE THE ANTSOne of the techniques that significantly helped Chris heal from her grief wasANT therapy, or learning how to not believe every stupid thought that wentthrough her brain. She learned how to challenge and question the negativethoughts running around her brain. At the Amen Clinics we call it learning howto kill the ANTs. When the ANTs, those negative thoughts that pop up in yourbrain automatically and seemingly out of nowhere, are left unchecked they stealyour happiness, torment you, and can literally make you old, fat, depressed, andfeebleminded.The following exercise to kill ANTs is so simple that you may have troublebelieving how powerful it is, but it can change your whole life. Your sufferingdiminishes and your health and happiness improve. A number of research studieshave found this technique to be as effective and as powerful as antidepressantmedication for depression.ANT THERAPY DIRECTIONS1. Whenever you feel sad, mad, nervous, or out of control, draw two linesvertically down a piece of paper, dividing it into three columns.2. In the first column write down the ANTs going through your brain.3. In the second column identify the type of ANT. Therapists typically describenine different types of ANTs (see table below).4. In the third column, talk back, correct, and eradicate the ANTs. Were yougood at talking back to your parents when you were teenagers? I was excellent.In the same way, you need to learn to be good at talking back to the lies youtell yourself.ANTType of ANTEradicate the ANT I will never be happy again.Fortune-TellingI amsad now, but I will feel better soon. I am a failure.LabelingI have succeeded atmany things. It is your fault!BlameI need to look at my part in the problem. Ishould have done better.Guilt BeatingI will learn from my mistakes and do betternext time. I am old.LabelingI am getting younger every day.Summary of the Nine Different Types of ANTs1. Always Thinking: Thoughts that overgeneralize a situation and usually startwith words like always, never, everyone, every time2. Focusing on the Negative: This occurs when you only focus on what’s goingwrong in a situation and ignore everything that could be construed as positive3. Fortune-Telling: Predicting the future in a negative way4. Mind Reading: Arbitrarily believing you know what another person thinks, eventhough she has not told you5. Thinking with Your Feelings: Believing your negative feelings without everquestioning them6. Guilt Beatings: Thinking in words like should, must, ought, orhave to7. Labeling: Attaching a negative label to yourself or others8. Personalization: Taking innocuous events personally9. Blame: Blaming other people for the problems in your lifeTHE WORK: ANOTHER TECHNIQUEAnother ANT-killing technique that I teach all of my patients is called theWork. It was developed by my friend Byron Katie and explained so well in herbook Loving What Is. Katie, as her friends call her, described her ownexperience suffering from suicidal depression. She was a young mother,businesswoman, and wife in the high desert of Southern California. She becameseverely depressed at the age of thirty-three. For ten years, she sank deeperand deeper into self-loathing, rage, and despair, harboring constant thoughts ofsuicide and paranoia. For the last two years, she was often unable to leave herbedroom and care for herself or her family. Then one morning in 1986, out ofnowhere, Katie woke up in a state of amazement, transformed by the realizationthat when she believed her thoughts, she suffered, but when she questioned herthoughts, she didn’t suffer. Katie’s great insight is that it is not life orother people that makes us feel depressed, angry, stressed, abandoned, anddespairing: It is our own thoughts that make us feel that way. In other words,we live in a hell of our own making, or we live in a heaven of our own making.Katie developed a simple method of inquiry to question our thoughts. It consistsof writing down any of the thoughts that are bothering us or any of the thoughtswhere we are judging other people, asking ourselves four questions, and thendoing a turnaround. The goal is not positive thinking but rather accuratethinking. The four questions are: 1. Is what I’m thinking true? 2. Can I absolutely know that it’s true? 3. How do I react when I believe that thought? 4. Who would I be without the thought? Or, put differently, How would I feelif I didn’t have the thought?After you answer the four questions, you then take the original thought andcompletely turn it around to its opposite and ask yourself whether the oppositeof the original thought that is causing your suffering is not true or even truerthan the original thought. Then turn the thought around and apply it to yourselfand to the other person (if another person is involved in the thought).Here’s an example: Rosemary’s husband of thirty-four years died of cancer.Rosemary was the alumni director at my college and we have been friends for manyyears. After John’s death she was very sad and lonely. I helped her work throughsome of her grief. Two years after John died, Rosemary wanted to start datingagain. She loved being in a close relationship. But she told me, “No one wouldever want a seventy-five-year-old woman.” So we did the Work on that thought.First I asked her this series of questions: 1. Is it true that no one would ever want a seventy-five-year-old woman?“Yes,” she said. “I am too old to date.” 2. Can you absolutely know that it is true that no one would ever want aseventy-five-year-old woman? “No,” she said. “Of course I can’t know that forsure.” 3. How do you feel when you have the thought “No one would ever want aseventy-five-year-old woman”? “I feel sad, hopeless, angry at God, andoverwhelmed by my loneliness,” she answered. 4. Who would you be or how would you feel if you didn’t have the thought “Noone would ever want a seventy-five-year-old woman”? “Well, I would feel muchhappier, more optimistic. I would feel like my usual self,” she said.Then I coaxed her to turn the original thought around. “No one would ever want aseventy-five-year-old woman.” What is the opposite? “Someone will want aseventy-five-year-old woman.” Okay, so which is truer? “I don’t know,” she said,“but if I act like no one will want me, then no one will want me.” After ourexercise, Rosemary started dating again.A year later she met Jack. When I sat with Rosemary and Jack for the first timeit felt like I was with two fifteen-year-olds who had just fallen in love. Theywere married the next year and will soon celebrate their five-year anniversary.All of us need a way to correct our thoughts. Just think about what would havehappened to Rosemary if she hadn’t killed the ANTs that were stealing herhappiness and robbing her joy. She would have died a lonely old woman. I haveseen these four questions dramatically change people’s lives. They can do thesame for you.[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_058_r1.jpg]Rosemary and JackADOPT A POSITIVE ATTITUDE TOWARD AGINGLeroy “Satchel” Paige overcame racial discrimination to break into major-leaguebaseball as a pitcher at the age of forty-two. After a career spanning fortyyears, he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1971. When asked about hisprowess at an age when most players are long retired, Paige responded by asking:“How old would you be if you didn’t know how old you was?” Excellent question.Research shows that people with positive, optimistic attitudes about agingoutlive those who have a negative, pessimistic view of getting older, by anaverage of more than seven years.How powerful is attitude? In the book Counter Clockwise, author Ellen Langerwrites: “Simply having a positive attitude made far more difference than any tobe gained from lowering blood pressure or reducing cholesterol which typicallyimprove life span by about four years. It also beats the benefits of exercise,maintaining proper weight, and not smoking, which are found to add one to threeyears.”Drowning out ANTs is vital in recovering from loss and the stresses of life, butit can also be a life-lengthening skill when it comes to how you think,specifically, about aging. Visualizing yourself happy, engaged, and healthy asyou get older is a wonderful exercise that may add years to your life.CHANGE YOUR AGE NOW: TWENTY BRAIN TIPS TO HELP YOU THROUGH STRESS, GRIEF, ANDDEPRESSION 1. When going through stress, grief, or depression many people are tempted toself-medicate with alcohol, not realizing that alcohol is a depressant! It numbsyou from the good, healing feelings of connection and empathy with others thathelp you traverse grief and pain. Excessive alcohol really only delays andmultiplies pain. Say no to alcohol and yes to a healthy healing path. 2. Because loss takes such a hit on our brain and body, it may help you, likeit helped Chris and Gerald, to focus on going “hard core” into getting healthy.Getting radically healthy gives your brain and body something positive to throwyourself into and yields positive rewards, emotionally and physically. 3. Long-term caretaking takes a huge toll on the caretaker. Remember to“nurture the nurturer,” and learn the art of radical self-care. If you do notreplenish yourself while caring for others, you may not be there for them forlong. Let others pitch in and take a break to go for a walk, read somethinginspiring, see a funny movie, or take a guilt-free nap. 4. Take Chris’s tip and make sure you don’t get stuck somewhere withoutnutritious food or drink. Almonds or walnuts are a great portable snack to keepin your car, briefcase, or purse. “Treat yourself like a good parent would treata child so you don’t end up somewhere hungry, thirsty and cranky,” especiallyduring stress or loss. 5. Don’t let a loss or tragedy leave you a one-dimensional person completelydefined by your loss. You are a person who experienced and survived a greatsorrow, yes. And you are a person with gifts, talents, and a boatload ofcompassion to share. Honor the memory of your loved one by taking care of yourhealth and living a full, rich life of benevolence. 6. When you begin to feel anxious or upset you may be dealing with ANTs. Learnto develop an internal anteater to recognize and eliminate these peskycreatures. 7. Question your thoughts. One of the best ways to eliminate the ANTs is toconstantly question your negative thoughts. Whenever you feel sad, mad, nervous,or out of control, write down your negative thoughts, ask yourself if they arereally true, and start talking back to them. You do not have to believe everythought you have. This exercise can help shift your perspective from negative topositive in seconds and will begin to become automatic with practice. 8. Situational depression is a normal part of grief. Time, tears, reaching outto others, and taking care of yourself will normally ease the pain. Butcomplicated grief or chronic depression that leaves you with suicidal thoughtsor unable to cope after many months needs to be treated like a medicalemergency. Seek help for this kind of grief immediately. We help many people whoare “stuck in grief” through the wonderful resources at our clinics. 9. As Chris pointed out, there is much in life over which we have no control.All the more reason to take charge over what you can control: namely your healthand happiness, especially after a setback or sorrow. Love yourself and tend toyour brain by feeding yourself well, taking yourself out for nice walks or runs,and speaking kind words to yourself.10. Because grief is draining, you may be tempted to say no to invitations fromfriends. Try saying yes more often, pushing past the automatic desire toseclude. Being with loving, patient people is healing to a brain overwhelmed bygrief. Getting out also gives your brain much-needed “breaks” from overthinkingand sadness.11. The brain can become overfocused on the person you lost, to the exclusion ofothers who need you. When grief is new, try setting aside a specific time eachday to focus on and think about the person you lost: Journal, cry, pray, orwhatever you need to do. Then let it go, and turn your mind to others who needyou to be fully present for them. Practice the art of “being here now.”12. Don’t underestimate the power of changing your diet for the better, addingexercise and a few brain-smart supplements (like vitamin D and fish oil) toquickly turn a low mood around. Feeling better provides its own motivation. Onceyou experience a lift in mood after tending to your brain and body, you’ll behooked on the feeling.13. If you have an impulsive brain type, you will be helped by more dopamine.Higher-protein, lower-carbohydrate diets tend to help, as do exercise andcertain stimulating medications or supplements, such as green tea or L-tyrosine.Calming supplements or medications can actually make this brain type worse.14. If you have a compulsive brain type, you may have a very hard time lettinggo of painful negative thoughts. Serotonin is calming to this brain type.Physical exercise boosts serotonin, as does using certain supplements, such as5-HTP or St. John’s Wort.15. If you have an impulsive-compulsive brain type, you may impulsively reachfor something unhealthy, then compulsively get “stuck” on doing it over andover. You need to increase both serotonin and dopamine. A combination ofexercise with a calming supplement like 5-HTP (to boost serotonin) and green tea(to boost dopamine) can help balance the brain naturally.16. If you have a sad or moody brain type, you tend to feel depressed, which canalso make you feel achy all over and lethargic. For this type, we recommendexercise, a high-dose fish oil (6 g), and certain supplements, such as SAMe, tohelp improve mood, energy, and pain.17. If you have an anxious brain type, you may feel tense, nervous, andunsettled inside. Exercise, meditation, hypnosis, and a combination of vitaminB6, magnesium, and GABA may be helpful.18. If you have a temporal lobe brain type, you may struggle with memory andlearning difficulties, mood instability, dark thoughts, and/or temper problems.Anti-seizure medications, along with balancing blood sugar and getting goodsleep, are usu-ally helpful.19. If you have a toxic brain type, you may suffer with mental fogginess, lowenergy, and cognitive impairment. Drug or alcohol abuse and environmental toxinsare two common causes. Eliminate the toxins and get on a brain healthy program.20. Boost omega-3s (fish or fish oil) and vitamin D levels to help counteract alow mood."},{"pageContent":"8ANTHONY, PATRICK, NANCY, AND MORE ON REVERSING BRAIN DAMAGE[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_L01_r1.jpg]MAKE YOUR BRAIN BETTER, EVEN IF YOU HAVE BEEN BAD TO ITI have replaced a part of me that had slowly slipped away.—FRED DRYERAD: THE NOTRE DAME KILLERIn July 2007, Anthony Davis came to see me as a patient at the Amen Clinics. Hewas concerned about the cognitive problems he saw in other former retiredprofessional football players.AD, as he is called by most who know him, is a College Football Hall of Famerunning back from the University of Southern California. AD is called the NotreDame Killer, because in 1972 he scored six touchdowns against the University ofNotre Dame. The students at Notre Dame hated AD so much that they put hispicture on the walkways of the campus so they could walk all over him. In 1974,he scored four more touchdowns against Notre Dame.AD had heard about us and thought perhaps we could be helpful to him. At agefifty-four, AD’s brain looked like he was eighty-five. It showed clear evidenceof brain trauma to the prefrontal cortex and left temporal lobe. For the lasttwenty years the work at the Amen Clinics has been about brain rehabilitation.We have demonstrated over and over that the brain has the ability to improveafter trauma and when we change or improve people’s brains, we change theirlives. AD’s case was no exception. I put AD on a group of brain enhancementsupplements that included high-quality fish oil, a comprehensive multiplevitamin and mineral supplement, and supplements targeted to support blood flowand neurotransmitter levels in the brain. Within several months AD told me thathe felt better and had more focus, better energy, and stronger memory. I decidedto rescan AD in January 2008. His follow-up scan showed significant improvementin blood flow and activity.Underside Surface View of AD’s Brain SPECT Study[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_059_r1.jpg]Severe decreases in left prefrontal and left temporal lobe[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_060_r1.jpg]Overall marked improvementThrough my relationship with Anthony I met many other active and retired NFLplayers, and he was the impetus for our large-scale study of brain injury andbrain rehabilitation in professional football players. At the time, the NFL wasstill saying it did not know if playing football caused long-term brain damagebut had never done the studies to prove it one way or the other. My colleaguesand I decided to tackle it. To date, we have scanned and treated 115 active andretired players. Clear evidence of brain damage was seen in almost all players.Typical NFL SPECT Scan[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_061_r1.jpg]Damage to prefrontal pole, temporal poles, occipital lobes, and cerebellumThe most exciting part of our study we have seen is that recovery andimprovement in function is possible, even if the brain damage occurred decadesearlier, which was true for most of our players. Seventy percent of our playersshowed significant improvement on their SPECT scans and their neuropsychologicaltesting. We found after our first five follow-up scans that our initial group ofsupplements was not powerful enough for the brain damage we saw. That led us todevelop a second group of supplements that have made a much more substantialdifference, especially our fish oil and Brain and Memory Power Boost formula.COMPONENTS OF NFL BRAIN REHAB PROGRAM TO REVERSE BRAIN DAMAGETo help reverse brain damage and facilitate recovery and improved function forNFL players, we’ve integrated the following components into theirrehabilitation:Education on brain health• Stop doing things that hurt your brain.• Start doing things that help your brain.Optimal nutrition educationWeight-loss group for those who needed itCoordination exercisesNatural supplements, including fish oil and Brain and Memory Power BoostFor those players who were depressed or demented, we did more. I acted as thepsychiatrist for a number of our players or as a consultant to their ownphysicians. For many, I prescribed natural antidepressants, such as SAMe,because it also helps with pain. If the supplements were not strong enough, Iprescribed medications. A number of our players also opted to do hyperbaricoxygen therapy (HBOT), which we have seen improve blood flow to the brain andimprove neurofeedback as well. Over the years I have been impressed with theability of HBOT to increase blood flow to damaged brains. Dr. Paul Harch, one ofthe world’s foremost experts in HBOT, and I did a study of forty soldiers whohad experienced brain injuries from IEDs (improvised explosive devises) in Iraqand Afghanistan. We used before-and-after SPECT scans and neuropsychologicaltest data. The results were impressively similar to what we have seen in our NFLplayers. Neurofeedback uses electrodes first to measure brain electricalactivity and then therapists teach patients how to change it. Five examplesfollow.ROYRoy Williams came to see us at age seventy-three. He is part of athree-generation NFL family. He played for the San Francisco 49ers. His son Ericplayed for the Dallas Cowboys and his grandson Kyle played for the SeattleSeahawks. Roy’s cognitive testing scores for attention, reasoning, and memorywere in the normal range, but he was significantly overweight at 334 pounds,which was too much for his 67 frame. His SPECT scan showed overall decreasedbrain activity.When I told Roy about the research studies that report that as your weight goesup the size of your brain goes down, I got his attention. When I added thatbrain shrinkage is associated with aging, he got the picture and said he wantedto do whatever it took to get a younger brain. Roy runs a highly successfulbusiness that helps families transition their wealth to the next generation, sohe was not too keen on having a smaller, older brain.Normal Brain SPECT[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_062_r1.jpg]Full, even, symmetrical activityRoy’s Brain SPECT[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_063_r1.jpg]Lower overall activityRoy eliminated his bad brain habits and adopted a host of new ones. When he cameback for retesting a few months later, he had lost 30 pounds, but moreastounding was the fact that his attention, memory, and reasoning scores hadimproved. His brain was getting younger! Moreover, his wife says he now has theenergy of someone who is forty years old, which initially really irritated her,but now that’s changed. Over time our program ideas rubbed off on her and shehas lost weight too.[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_064_r1.jpg][images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_065_r1.jpg]MARVINMarvin Fleming is another example of how a severely damaged brain can recover.Marvin is the first player in NFL history to play in five Super Bowls. He playedtight end for twelve years for the Green Bay Packers and then the MiamiDolphins, including the Dolphins’ perfect season in 1972. He was sixty-sevenwhen he first came to see us and his brain was in trouble. Marvin is one of thenicest people we have had the privilege of helping. He is funny, caring, andalways looking for ways to improve himself.When I asked him if he ever had a brain injury he said no. Brain injuries are acommon cause of premature aging and cognitive dysfunction. The brain is verysoft, about the consistency of soft butter, and the skull is very hard, withmany sharp bony ridges. I thought to myself, “You played tight end for twelveseasons in the NFL, how could you not have had a brain injury!” So I pressedhim. Marvin seemed so proud of himself because he did not remember ever gettinghis bell rung, being unconscious, seeing stars, or being confused on thefootball field, like almost all of our 115 players. But I persisted. I had seenhis brain and it showed clear evidence of brain injury. I asked about otherpotential causes of injuries from childhood, adolescence, and outside offootball, such as from motor vehicle accidents, falls, or fights. He persistedin saying no. I have been doing this a long time and had seen thousands of scanslike Marvin’s, and knew better.“Okay, Marvin, last time, then I will leave you alone: You are telling me you donot ever remember a car accident, fight, or fall or a time when you playedfootball where you hit your head so hard it caused changes in your awareness orthought process?”What happened next in my office is so common it is a running joke at the AmenClinics. Ask patients ten times whether or not they had a brain injury and thosewho initially say no may actually end up remembering multiple occasions on whichthey lost consciousness or were in severe car accidents. Our research director,Kristen Willeumier, Ph.D., was in the interview with Marvin and gave me aknowing look.Marvin’s face changed. The right hemisphere of his brain had an “aha” memoryexperience and it was all over his face. “I am so sorry I lied to you, Dr. Amen.When I was in college at the University of Utah, we were driving from Utah toCalifornia in the snow and our car skidded off a mountain road and we fell 150feet to a riverbed below. I was knocked unconscious and my friends had to dragme out of the car so I wouldn’t drown.”I wondered how you forget such an emotionally powerful event. But I have seen ithappen so many times in my work. Take all the head hits he had given andreceived in football, plus the car accident, plus whatever else he did notremember, no wonder his brain looked like it was in deep trouble.Normal Brain SPECT[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_066_r1.jpg]Full, even, symmetrical activityMarvin’s Brain SPECT[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_067_r1.jpg]Lower overall activity in a brain trauma patternAll of our players also undergo extensive cognitive testing. Marvin’s generalcognitive testing was not good. What Marvin had going for him was a greatpersonality and a willingness to do the things Dr. Willeumier and I asked.We asked Marvin to lose weight (he was a “sugaroholic” who would eat frostingout of the can without cake). We also gave him a multivitamin, high-dose fishoil, Brain and Memory Power Boost (our specially designed supplement geared toenhance brain function), HBOT to boost oxygen to his brain, and we had himincrease his exercise.Marvin’s Before Brain SPECT[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_068_r1.jpg]Low overall activityMarvin’s After-Treatment Brain SPECT[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_069_r1.jpg]Dramatic overall improvementTwo years later, his brain looks dramatically younger, as does he; he has lost20 pounds, and his cognitive scores have improved by as much as 300 percent.Typically, the brain becomes less active and less efficient with age. Marvin’sbrain, like many of the retired NFL players in our study, became more active andmore efficient.FREDWe have dozens of great testimonials and e-mails from our players. One of myfavorite ones came from Fred Dryer, the famous Los Angeles Ram defensive tightend who later became an actor and television star of the popular show Hunter.“With the supplements and certainly with the neurofeedback sessions themselves,I have replaced a part of me that had slowly slipped away,” he said. “It is veryodd to describe the feeling but it is while going through the program, I noticedmental energy and ‘speed’ of thought and cognition that I ‘recognized’ I hadlost!“Playing a contact sport for so many years did so much cumulative damage itactually mesmerized me into not noticing the slow progression of brain functionloss. It was only when I began to ‘feed’ my brain with the supplements and atthe same time go through the neurofeedback sessions that I began to notice justhow far my brain function had slipped. I wish I had knowledge of thisscience-technology while I was playing professional football. It would havehelped prevent all of what had been lost over the years.”CAMAt thirty-four, Cam Cleeland was one of our younger retired NFL players. Heplayed for the New Orleans Saints, New England Patriots, and St. Louis Rams. Hevolunteered for our study because he was struggling with depression,irritability, frustration, high stress, obsessive thinking, memory problems, andmarital problems.Cam had been diagnosed with a total of eight concussions—three in college andfive in the pros. Cam’s SPECT scan showed clear brain damage and his Microcog (atest of neuropsychological function) showed significant decreases in generalcognitive functioning, information processing speed, attention, memory, andspatial processing.After eight months on our brain rehabilitation program, Cam reported feelingmuch better and noticed significant improvements in his attention, mentalclarity, memory, mood, motivation, and anxiety level. He felt his anger wasunder greater control and he was getting along better with his small children.His SPECT scan showed dramatic improvement in the areas of his temporal lobes(memory and mood stability), prefrontal cortex (attention and judgment), andcerebellum (processing speed). His Microcog showed dramatic improvement as well.CAPTAIN PATRICK CAFFREYWhile deployed in Afghanistan in 2008 Captain Patrick Caffrey, a combat engineerofficer, was in the middle of phasing in new, specially armored vehicles. Theseare the vehicles all of our troops ride today. “We knew one thing about them,”he said. “They could take an enormous blast and you’d be able to walk away,unscathed—or so we thought.”One of the many tasks of the Second Battalion, Seventh Marines Combat EngineerPlatoon was to conduct route clearance—the intense mission of taking minedetectors and other special detection equipment on roads laden with mines andIEDs. His mission was to find and clear them from the road so that logistics,convoys, and the infantry could move freely.At the time Captain Caffrey did not know a thing about traumatic brain injuries,despite having had five or six concussions in his life from sports and otherinjuries. In his ignorance, he said to one of his sergeants: “So, am I screwedup because I kinda want to get blown up? I mean, not get hurt, just blown up,then walk away?” The sergeant said he had the same thought on his own—must be aMarine thing. Little did they know that they’d be together in the same vehiclefor more than one blast. For Patrick that memory redefines the saying “Becareful what you wish for.”Before he left Afghanistan Captain Caffrey sustained three blasts, where heexperienced concussions. But he thought he felt okay. After all, he reasoned,many others were much worse off than he was. However, his personality wasbeginning to change. He became prone to angry outbursts, a new thing for him.Arriving home, the changes became more pronounced. In Patrick’s words, “I wasmore irritable than ever, I had intense headaches, trouble focusing andconcentrating (particularly listening to what people were saying), trouble withmemory, and an inability to sleep. I was rude and nasty to people and the worstpart was that I didn’t really know just how much I had changed.”Normal Brain SPECT[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_070_r1.jpg]Full, even, symmetrical activityPatrick’s Brain SPECT[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_071_r1.jpg]Lower activity in right temporal lobe and left occipital lobePatrick decided to have SPECT imaging at the Amen Clinics in Newport Beach,California. “Boy, did I underestimate the value of actually looking at the brainwhen you have a brain problem!” Patrick said. We saw the damage to his righttemporal lobe, which explained his behavioral and cognitive changes, headaches,decrease in ability to focus and concentrate, and memory issues.Patrick was then put on a simple natural supplement regimen targeted to hisspecific brain issues. He said, “I felt a dramatic difference right away. I feltmore mentally sharp and focused than ever!” Having served in the U.S. Army forten years, first as an enlisted soldier, then as a military physician, I have aheart for soldiers; with Patrick’s help, I hope to enable more servicemen and-women to get the help they need.WHAT ALL THIS MEANS FOR YOUSo why should you care about the brains of these retired gladiators? If we canimprove the brains of retired NFL players who have had tens of thousands of hitsto their heads, imagine the benefit you can get with a brain healthy program,even if you have been bad to your brain. Getting on a brain-smart program canliterally slow and in some cases reverse the aging process.We have seen people improve from brain damage, brain infections, strokes, a lossof oxygen, substance abuse, and toxic exposure. The SPECT scans give us a senseof how much reserve the brain has and how much improvement is possible.Here is a personal brain-smart program to slow aging and reverse brain damage.1. Stop doing anything that hurts your brain. Playing tackle football at any ageis not brain smart. I loved the game, but it does not love us back.2. Focus your energies on brain-smart activities, such as those listed in thisbook. A healthy diet, great exercise, new learning, developing a community ofhealthy people, and so on.3. Lose weight if needed.4. Take simple supplements daily to make sure you get the nutrients you need. Irecommend that all of my patients take a multivitamin and fish oil, and know andoptimize their vitamin D level.5. If damage has occurred consider these brain-enhancing supplements:• Ginkgo and vinpocetine to enhance blood flow• Acetyl-L-carnitine and huperzine A to boost the neurotransmitter acetylcholine• Phosphatidylserine to help nerve cell membranes• N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and alpha-lipoic acid as antioxidantsI put this group of nutrients together in our nutritional supplement productBrain and Memory Power Boost, which we used with our retired NFL players. But tobe clear, we used this supplement together with the whole program, which is thesmartest way to use any supplementation.6. Consider HBOT to enhance blood flow to the brain if there has been trauma.You can learn more about HBOT at www.hbot.com [http://www.hbot.com].7. Consider neurofeedback to help stabilize nerve cell firing patterns in thebrain. Biofeedback, in general, is a treatment technique that utilizesinstruments to measure physiological responses in a person’s body (such as handtemperature, sweat gland activity, breathing rates, heart rates, blood pressure,and brainwave patterns). The instruments then feed the information on these bodysystems back to the patient, who can then learn how to change them. Inneurofeedback, using electrodes placed on the scalp, the amounts of specificbrain wave patterns are measured throughout the brain.There are five types of brain wave patterns:• Delta waves (1–4 cycles per second), which are very slow brain waves, seenmostly during sleep• Theta waves (5–7 cycles per second), which are slow brain waves, seen duringdaydreaming and twilight states• Alpha waves (8–12 cycles per second), which are brain waves seen duringrelaxed states• SMR (sensorimotor rhythm) waves (12–15 cycles per second), which are brainwaves seen during states of focused relaxation• Beta waves (13–24 cycles per second), which are fast brain waves seen duringconcentration or mental work statesResearchers have found that people can learn to change their own brain wavestates through training. Before neurofeedback is done in our office, peopleusually have a SPECT scan or QEEG to help guide the treatment. In our retiredNFL players, we often saw excessively high slow wave (delta and theta) activityand too little fast wave (beta) activity in the front part of the brain. Many ofour athletes thought of neurofeedback like going to the gym for their minds andfound it very helpful.RAY AND NANCY: A STORY OF CONTINUED HOPERay White came to see us as part of our NFL study. He played linebacker for theSan Diego Chargers in the early 1970s. Part of Ray’s motivation forparticipating in our study was that his wife, Nancy, had been recently diagnosedwith frontal temporal lobe dementia, and he wanted us to evaluate her as well.He was upset at the physician who diagnosed Nancy, because he told Ray thatwithin a year she would not know who he was.When we evaluated Ray, he showed evidence of brain trauma, as did almost all ofour retired players, plus he was overweight. Nancy’s scans were a disaster. Shehad severe decreased activity in the front part of her brain, consistent withthe diagnosis of frontal temporal lobe dementia.The feedback session, during which I showed them their scans, was very emotionalfor Ray and Nancy, and it was for me too. We had experience already that showedwe could help Ray. But there is no known effective treatment for frontaltemporal lobe dementia. My bias with cases like Nancy’s is to do everything wecan to try to slow or reverse the dementia process. And, certainly, it does notalways work. In this case, I told Ray and Nancy that it was critical toimmediately get on a brain healthy program, eat right, stop drinking alcohol,take their supplements, and get exercise, and I recommended HBOT andneurofeedback for Nancy. I also told Ray he needed to start losing weight.Ten weeks later I saw them back for their first follow-up visit.I was an emotional wreck the day they came back. The hour before I saw Ray andNancy I had just found out that my work with SPECT had been attacked in apsychiatric medical journal by two doctors from the University of TexasSouthwestern. I was not upset that other doctors attacked my work. By now I wasused to it. I was upset that the journal’s editor would allow people to writelies about me, without showing the articles to me first. I felt that wasunethical. I had just gotten off the phone after having a heated exchange withthe editor when Dr. Willeumier handed me Nancy’s follow-up chart. I was so upsetthat I was shaking, which has happened maybe two other times in my adult life.At the time I was hosting five physicians from Canada who were applying our workwith SPECT to their patients. I had to compose myself.I took ten deep breaths and told myself to focus. As I calmed down, I openedNancy’s chart and didn’t believe what I saw. Nancy’s follow-up scan showeddramatic improvement. I showed the visiting physicians, who were amazed. Ipulled up the scan on the big computer monitor in my office. It was clear thatin ten weeks Nancy’s brain was getting better.Nancy had followed through on all of my recommendations for eating right, takingher supplements, and eliminating alcohol, and she had forty hyperbaric oxygensessions and sixteen neurofeedback sessions. She had significantly improved. Hermemory and cognitive function were better, her personal grooming had improved,and she was doing better taking care of their home. Ray joked that we had toslow down, because soon enough she would be smarter than he was. In addition,Ray had lost 30 pounds! He said his motivation was to help his wife. If he dideverything we suggested, then she would too. They would do it as a couple.Sometimes motivation is about love. Ray loved Nancy.Nancy: Frontal Temporal Lobe Dementia (looking down from the top)[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_072_r1.jpg]Before[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_073_r1.jpg]After ten weeksI have noticed that whenever my work is attacked there is always a case orseries of cases that keeps me centered on the importance of this work. Funny howthat happens.These scans took place in early February and May of 2010. As I write this I haveseen Nancy every couple of months since then; now, eighteen months later, Nancymaintains the gains she has made. She has had nearly two hundred hyperbaricoxygen therapy treatments and continues with her supplements and neurofeedback.She eats healthy, stays away from alcohol, surfs three or four times a week,goes to the gym, and recently took up singing lessons. I am in awe of thiscouple. I also know this program will not work for everyone diagnosed withdementia. Not everyone has a brain that will respond and not everyone can affordall of the treatments Nancy had. But I sincerely believe that we should beapplying these techniques to a lot more people to recover them as much aspossible. I know if it were my wife or my mother I would recommend the exactsame program.CHANGE YOUR AGE NOW: TWENTY BRAIN TIPS TO REVERSING BRAIN DAMAGE 1. Whenever brain damage is present, have a sense of urgency to repair oroptimize the brain. 2. Brain aging, all by itself, lowers blood flow to the brain. As we age, ourbrains become more vulnerable and thus in more need of protection. 3. Use brain imaging and neuropsychological testing to understand the specificvulnerabilities and deficits in the brain. You cannot change what you do notmeasure. 4. Immediately stop doing anything that hurts your brain. 5. Immediately get on a brain healthy program. 6. Head injuries from your past, from taking a fall on the playground at agefive to a concussion in sports to auto accidents, can alter your brain. Thinkback on your brain history since childhood: Was there any change in your mood orbehavior following any brain trauma, even a mild one? Write them down. If so,you may want to consider some of the brain rehabilitation actions discussed. 7. When behavior, emotions, or memory is troubled, make sure to ask yourselften times whether or not a brain injury in the past may be part of the problem. 8. Anxiety, depression, attention problems, obsessiveness, memory problems,temper problems, and low energy are just a few symptoms that could be related toa past concussion or brain injury. 9. One surprise finding during our NFL study and the brain scans from it wasthat lower activity in the cerebellum was common. This is an area in the lowerback of the brain and is the brain’s coordination center. The best activitiesfor enhancing the cerebellum are dancing, table tennis, juggling, cursivehandwriting, and calligraphy.10. If your son or daughter is going to play contact sports, in spite of thedangers, research the program and advocate for brain-protective measures.Seventy-five percent of brain injuries happen during practice. School footballprograms could greatly eliminate brain injuries and concussions by limiting theamount of head to body contact during weekly practice. Thanks to research likeours and publicity about concussions, more schools are looking at brain safetyin sports.11. Many people who used to work out or played sports at a high level when theywere younger have their muscles turn to fat when they give up the hard workouts.Excess weight, in and of itself, can cause lower cognitive functioning.Remember: “As your weight goes up, the size of your brain goes down.” Getting ona healthy weight-loss program can improve your brain’s functioning.12. Sleep apnea often accompanies obesity. Because sleep apnea can increase thepossibility of dementia, it needs to be treated. Losing weight will help, butyou may also want to get a sleep study done and consult with a sleep specialist.13. The good news is that you can reverse the brain’s aging process, and evenimprove brain injuries, with a brain-smart program, even if the brain damageoccurred decades earlier.14. The basics of brain rehab include optimal nutrition, exercise, specialcoordination exercises, weight-loss classes (if needed), and supplements likefish oil and our specially formulated Brain and Memory Power Boost.15. Many of my patients have opted to undergo HBOT, which we have seen improveblood flow to the brain. Over the years I have been impressed with HBOT’sability to increase blood flow to damaged brains. If you’ve had past braindamage, you may want to consider some sessions in an HBOT chamber, available inmany cities now.16. We also used neurofeedback to help reverse brain damage with great success;this involves using electrodes to measure brain electrical activity. Withpractice and coaching we can teach our clients how to change their brain’sactivity and alter brain waves for the better.17. Brain Gym exercises can help in rehabilitating the brain.18. Brain-enhancing supplements may be helpful for those working on repairingand improving their cognitive skills. Some of these are ginkgo and vinpocetineto enhance blood flow; acetyl-L-carnitine and huperzine A to boost theneurotransmitter acetylcholine; phosphatidylserine to help nerve cell membranes;and NAC and alpha-lipoic acid as antioxidants. (I put this group of supplementstogether in our Brain and Memory Power Boost.)19. Even if you have been bad to your brain, we have seen that many, many peoplecan recover brain function with a smart program.20. The best time to start reversing brain damage is now!"},{"pageContent":"9THE TALE OF TWO RICKS[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_L01_r1.jpg]CREATE YOUR OWN GENIUS NETWORK TO GET BETTER TOGETHERWhen health-conscious friends improve their health, their friends’ healthimproves as well.Rick Cortez is the graphic artist who makes my public television shows look sobeautiful. He and I have known each other for years. Rick is thirty-one yearsold, a very talented, hardworking, sweet man. Since I have known him over thelast seven or eight years, his weight just went up and up until he ballooned to350 pounds. I encouraged him to get healthy, but not much happened. Then, a fewweeks after we shot my last public television special, he wrote me the letterbelow.Dr. Amen,I wanted to let you know of an exciting change in my life since the taping ofyour new public television special. In the 5 or 6 weeks since the liverecording, I’ve lost 30 pounds and counting.At the time of the taping I had over 350 pounds weighing down my frame. Fastfood was a staple of my diet, and portions were always big. Despite the largeamount of food I’d take in daily, I had regular cravings for more of the same. Iloved the “high” that came with double cheeseburgers for dinner and ice creamfor dessert.After your program I honestly didn’t expect a life change. I knew myself toowell—impulsive, no willpower, and no endurance…But in the days following your program’s taping, Marco, a co-worker of mine,decided to follow one of the Solutions you offered: “Influence others to bethinner, smarter, and happier …” He asked me if he could join with me to helpcreate a healthy lifestyle, in line with the principles you laid out.Marco then showed me before-and-after photos of a friend of his who had lostmore weight than I was hoping to lose (150 pounds). The key to his sustainedweight loss was a lifestyle change, not a fad diet.That was all I needed. Suddenly it was no longer impossible, it was inevitable—Iknew I was going to lose this weight.About a year from now I’ll be at my ideal size. But I’m in no rush—I’m having agreat time getting there!Thanks for inspiring my co-worker. In my case, it made all the difference.RickThe last time I saw Rick he had lost 97 pounds!According to Rick, Marco was the kind of guy who enjoys seeing others succeed,so about a week after the final taping of my special, he told Rick, in passing,“Hey, both you and I could stand to lose some weight. What do you think abouttrying this Amen Solution together? You want to give it a shot?” Rick hadnothing to lose, except 150-plus pounds, so he agreed. “It was having a friendwho I would check in with every day on my progress, just two or three minutessometimes, that made all the difference in keeping me motivated.”He’s more than halfway to his goal weight and not only does he look ten yearsyounger, there’s a bounce in his step and an obvious feeling of self-confidencethat radiates from him. What is so inspiring to me is the domino effect ofinfluence that has happened simply because of one friend encouraging another.One person lost 150 pounds and inspired Rick’s friend, Marco. Marco reached outto Rick, and now they are both reaping benefits of mutual support. Now Rick isinspiring his family, co-workers, and all who are reading his story here. Wedon’t change in a vacuum. We need each other.In a recent visit, Rick shared a little more about his journey. “I remember theweight began to creep on after I left home (and Mom’s healthy cooking) forcollege and discovered fast food, late nights, and a sedentary lifestyle. Inhigh school, I was active in sports, but my chosen degree and career pathrequired many hours in front of a computer screen. I’m a huge film fanatic too,so instead of walking or working out after a day of work, I’d grab a doublecheeseburger for dinner, then sit down to watch a movie with a pint of Ben &Jerry’s. Did you know there’s a thousand calories in one of those babies? Igained all this weight in 10-to-20-pound increments, one year at a time.”Rick went on to share the loss of energy and the desire and ability to move; hebegan to take walks and dance with his lovely wife of four years (who loves todance!). He hired a personal trainer during one serious attempt to lose weightbut found himself even more hungry, and the effort expended to the amount ofpounds lost hardly seemed worth it. He settled into a state of stable misery interms of his health. “I’m generally a happy guy, but in this area I’d simplyaccepted defeat,” Rick admitted.WHY WE NEED EACH OTHERWhy would you want to recruit others in joining your efforts to look and feelyounger? Because they will help sustain you in the inevitable vulnerable times.There is victory in numbers and regular support. You can find friends, familymembers, co-workers to gather with, or join our online community atwww.theamensolution.com [http://www.theamensolution.com].I can’t emphasize this enough: Social support is one of the main key elements ofsuccess! Many studies have shown that positive relationships strengthen healthand longevity, while a lack of social connectivity is associated withdepression, cognitive decline, and earlier death. In one study of more thanthree hundred thousand people, researchers found that lack of strongrelationships increased the risk of premature death from all causes by 50percent! The health risk of being socially disconnected compares with smokingfifteen cigarettes a day and is a greater threat to your longevity than beingobese or not exercising.What makes positive social connections so effective? Researchers have foundbeing part of a connected community helps relieve chronic stress, whichcontributes to obesity, memory problems, heart disease, gut problems, insulindysregulation, and a weakness in the immune system. When you are in a group ofpeople with mutual care and trust, stress-reducing hormones are elevated. Women,who so naturally get together with one another to talk, chat, and bond oftenfeel a euphoric kind of peace after a time together. Studies have shown thatoxytocin, the trust hormone, is released when women share and bond. Healthy lovebetween people is medicine that helps you live longer. Another benefit ofhealthy social relationships is that when your thoughts get negative or becomeunreasonable, healthy friends and family will give you realistic, positivefeedback. Without proper feedback from others, we’re all more susceptible tobelieving negative thoughts, which contributes to depression and diminishedhealth.THE KIND OF COMPANY YOU KEEPWho you spend time with also matters. You’ve got to be selective because peopleaffect your brain, mood, and physical health. A number of studies report that ifyou spend time with people who are unhealthy, their habits tend to becontagious. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found thatone of the strongest associations in the spread of illness is who you spend timewith. The study was conducted using information gathered from over twelvethousand people who had participated in a multigenerational heart studycollected from 1971 to 2003. The study showed that if a person had a friend whobecame obese, that person had a 57 percent higher chance of becoming obesethemselves. This number went up to 171 percent if both friends identified theother as strong friends. Friendship was apparently the strongest correlation: Itdidn’t matter how far away the friends lived, as geographic distance proved anegligible factor. Sibling influence was also ranked high, with an increased 40percent chance of becoming obese if another sibling was obese.The study highlights the social network effect on health issues and makes animportant point: Our health is heavily influenced by many factors, not the leastof which is the role models around us. The powerful influence of friendshipworks both ways. Researchers also found that when health-conscious peopleimprove their health, their friends’ health improves as well. By taking theinformation in this book seriously, you can influence your whole network offriends and family. If you lead the way to better health in your circle offriends, your friends may also benefit. The author of the study said, “Peopleare connected, and so their health is connected.” People can connect to improvetheir lives through walking groups, healthy-cooking groups, meditation groups,new learning groups, and so on. When you spend time with people who are focusedon their health you are much more likely to do the same.Engaging others to be healthy is a win–win. It’s helping you, and it is helpingthem. Just as when we get emotionally healthy as individuals, our relationshipsimprove; so it is with physical health. If we get physically healthy, it tendsto be contagious and our relationships improve in terms of more activity, eatingbetter, feeling well, looking younger. What a gift to receive, give, and share!A large Swedish study of people ages seventy-five and over concluded thatdementia risk was lowest in those with a variety of satisfying contacts withfriends and relatives.IS YOUR CHURCH, BUSINESS, SCHOOL, HOSPITAL, OR FAMILY A FRIEND OR AN ACCOMPLICE?Did you know that the Cleveland Clinic, a hospital known for its innovativetechnology in the field of medicine, has one of the world’s busiest McDonald’sper square foot on its premises? Does this strike you as an obvious conflict ofinterest? As I started writing this book I went to an appointment with my wifeto see her endocrinologist. He had bowls of candy and cookies in the waitingroom. So let me get this right. Sick people go to the doctor, or a well-knownmedical clinic, and they’re invited to snack freely on food that makes themsicker. Unbelievable! Over the last decade as my work has focused more on theconnection between physical and emotional health, I have realized that manyschools, businesses, hospitals, and churches could do a much better job ofhelping people they serve.In August of 2010 I went to a church near my home with my family and told mywife I would save us seats while she took our daughter to children’s church. AsI walked toward the sanctuary, here’s what I passed:Doughnuts for sale for charityBacon and sausage cooking on the grillHot dogs being prepared for after churchAs I found a seat, the minister was talking about the ice-cream festival thechurch had the night before.I was so frustrated that when my wife found me in church I was typing on myphone, which she absolutely hates, and she gave me that look that only your wifecan give you: Why are you on that thing in church? Then I showed her what I waswriting:Go to church …get doughnuts …bacon …sausage …hot dogs …ice cream. They have no idea they are sending people to heaven early!Nearly everywhere we turn there is evidence that multiple institutions of oursociety, including our public schools, churches, and doctors’ waiting rooms,however well meaning, are hurting us with the food they offer. There has to be abetter way. Churches, businesses, schools, hospitals, and all of our othersocial institutions have the potential to be powerful positive influences on ourhealth and connect us with the kind of support network that leads to success. Wehave to do more to make that happen.For me, church was the obvious place to start. During that service I prayed thatGod would use me to help change places of worship. The house of God, no matterwhat religion, should not be a place that fosters illness.Two weeks later Pastor Steve Komanapalli from Saddleback Church called me.Saddleback is one of the largest churches in America with about thirty thousandmembers and ten campuses across Southern California. Pastor Steve is RickWarren’s personal assistant. Pastor Warren is the senior pastor at Saddlebackand author of The Purpose Driven Life, which has now sold over thirty-fivemillion copies worldwide. During the 2008 presidential election, Pastor Warrenand Saddleback Church hosted a civil forum with Senators John McCain and BarackObama. Pastor Warren also gave the invocation at the 2009 inaugural address andhe was on the cover of Time magazine with the caption “America’s most powerfulreligious leader takes on the world.” His positive influence has crosseddenominational and political boundaries.Steve asked if I would talk to Pastor Warren about a new initiative atSaddleback Church called Decade of Destiny. The staff was putting together aten-year plan to get the church healthy physically, emotionally, cognitively,financially, vocationally, and relationally. Would I be willing to help with theinitiative to help the people at Saddleback have a better brain and a betterbody?I was a little stunned with how quickly my prayer of two weeks earlier was beinganswered. Steve set up a time for me to talk with Rick.I found Pastor Warren to be warm and friendly. He laughed easily. But he had aserious goal: to help his parishioners (including himself) get healthier onevery level. If it worked at Saddleback, he hoped he could export the plan tochurches around the world (Saddleback is connected to four hundred thousandchurches around the globe), as he had done with previous initiatives. Toincrease the health of his congregation, Pastor Warren put together a team ofexperts. He had already recruited noted physicians and bestselling authorsMehmet Oz (heart surgeon) and Mark Hyman (functional medicine specialist). Hehoped I would provide guidance on brain health. I told him, “Count me in! Yourcall is an answer to my prayers about the need to change churches.” I have beena Christian since a small child. I grew up Roman Catholic, was an altar boy,served at Mass when I was in the U.S. Army as a young soldier, and went to aChristian college and a Christian medical school. The project felt like home forme.During our conversation, Pastor Warren asked, “Is there anything I can do foryou to thank you for helping us?” I was just getting ready to shoot my publictelevision special The Amen Solution—Thinner, Smarter, Happier with Dr. DanielAmen and asked if he might be able to gather me an audience for a practice run.“No problem,” he said, and we set a date for the following week. Pastor Warrenasked if he could interview me after I completed the rehearsal and play it atthe kickoff of the health portion of the Decade of Destiny program. I readilyagreed.On the day of the taping, I got to meet Pastor Steve in person outside the mediacenter. Of East Indian heritage, his skin was the warm color of a strong latte.His dark eyes were kind and his laugh easy. I liked him immediately. He was 58and about 300 pounds, however, and I hoped my work would help him get healthy.The food in the green room was awful. There were candy bars, sodas, muffins, andpastries. I asked Steve if they were trying to kill the pastors with the foodthey were serving. He laughed and said, “If you think this is bad, I run aSaturday morning men’s Bible study group and give the guys barbecued ribs as areward for learning Bible verses.” I was beginning to understand why Godanswered my prayer. With the current mentality of enticing or rewarding itsparishioners with junk food, it was like one giant coronary just waiting tohappen. I could also see that changing this mentality was not going to be easy.The auditorium was a great place to practice my new show, and the audience lovedthe program. Afterward I met Pastor Warren, a very large man, both in statureand weight. I was in the middle of our NFL study so I was used to standing nextto people who were 64 and 300 pounds, but Rick did not look healthy or vibrant.He looked tired and sick.When we sat down for the interview, Rick started by asking me three questions inquick succession. One of the questions was about my work with ADHD (hisrapid-fire questions now made sense). We talked about stress and about howincreased exposure to the stress hormone cortisol puts fat on your belly andkills cells in the major memory centers of the brain.He then asked me about the dinosaur syndrome, which I had talked about in thenew show. I’d shown a slide that said:Dinosaur SyndromeBig Body. Little Brain. Become Extinct.“That really got my attention,” Rick said. “Can you explain that some more?”“Sure,” I replied. “ ‘Dinosaur syndrome’ is a term I coined after reading Dr.Cyrus Raji’s research from the University of Pittsburgh, which reported as yourweight goes up, the actual physical size of the brain goes down. The researchersfound that when subjects had a BMI between 25 and 30, considered overweight,they had 4 percent less brain volume and their brains looked eight years olderthan healthy people’s. When subjects were obese with a BMI over 30, they had 8percent less brain volume and their brains looked sixteen years older thanhealthy people’s. In a follow-up study from my research group at the AmenClinics published in the journal Nature Obesity we found that as a person’sweight went up, the function in the prefrontal cortex [PFC], the most human,thoughtful part of the brain, went down.”“Is that why my sermons are getting longer?” Rick joked. The audience chuckled,and then we moved on to the topic of motivation.“What moves you?” I asked Rick. “Why are you doing this new initiative?”His answer was precise. “I want the next ten years to be the best ten years bothfor myself and for the church to get healthy.”We then talked about his diet. He volunteered, “I am not hungry until two in theafternoon. I could fast until noon every day of the week, but then my appetitekicks in and I eat large quantities of food until late in the night.”“You have to stop that eating pattern,” I said. “Study after study has shownthat people who eat breakfast are more likely to lose weight and keep it off. Byeating regularly you keep your blood sugar more stable throughout the day.Stable blood sugar wards off cravings. Keeping blood sugar stable doesn’t justhelp weight loss; it also helps your focus, memory, and decision-making skills.”The interview was fun and pleasant to that point. But then it seemed to take astrange turn. Rick asked me to give the audience some tips about brain health.I said, “It’s not magic; it’s simple mathematics. If you want to be healthy youcannot eat too many calories and the calories you choose need to be of highquality. Otherwise your body and brain become bankrupt. I sent you an e-mail awhile back saying if you really wanted to get the church healthy you could startby putting the calories and nutritional content on the food you serve atSaddleback. When I didn’t hear back from you, I figured you weren’t too keen onthat idea.”This is where Rick seemed to become irritated with me. “I read that e-mail andthought, ‘Oh, yeah, that’s a great idea …I am going to become the health nut andthe Gestapo for food at Saddleback.’ ”I replied, “This would be one of the most loving things you can do for yourchurch. But you have to buy into the concept, on a real emotional level, that ifyou overeat you are not being a good steward of your body. I can see we need todo a little therapy around this topic.”“But we built this church on doughnuts!” he replied.Now I was horrified. This helped to explain new research from NorthwesternUniversity that reported people who frequently attend religious services aresignificantly more likely to become obese by the time they reach middle age. Thetraditions of potlucks, ice-cream socials, pancake breakfasts, spaghettidinners, and doughnuts to get people to stay at church longer are clearly notgood for the brain, body, or soul. When your brain is sick, your soul is not atits best. We’ve got to get creative with alternative social activities andhealthier food in our churches.I left the interview feeling unsettled. Rick was asking for help but seemedresistant to it at the same time, the same way many addicts I have treated reactwhen confronted with the truth. “It is a process,” I told myself. “Be patient.”THE DANIEL PLAN TO CHANGE THE HEALTH OF THE WORLD THROUGH CHURCHESOver the next three months the staff and the other doctors and I developed theDaniel Plan, named after the prophet in the Old Testament who refused to eat theking’s bad food.In the first chapter of the book of Daniel (1:3–16), Daniel and his threeenslaved friends, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, along with other young men,were commanded to eat from the king’s kitchen of rich foods and wine. Daniel andhis friends were determined not to defile themselves by eating the rich food anddrinking the wine. Daniel asked the chief of staff, Melzar, for permission notto consume these unacceptable foods. But Melzar implored Daniel to do as he wastold, so that he, Melzar, would not be beheaded for going against the king’sorders to feed the malnourished-looking Daniel and his friends.Daniel then gave Melzar this challenge: “Please test us for ten days on a dietof vegetables and water. At the end of ten days, see how we look compared to theother young men who are eating from the king’s food. Then make your decision inthe light of what you see.”Melzar agreed to Daniel’s challenge and tested them for ten days. At the end often days, Daniel and his three friends looked healthier and better nourishedthan the young men who were eating the food assigned by the king. So after thatMelzar fed them only vegetables instead of the food and wine provided for theothers. God gave these four men an unusual aptitude for understanding everyaspect of literature and wisdom. Daniel and his friends looked better and weresmarter than the others.The Daniel Plan is a fifty-two-week small-group program to get the churchhealthy. Small groups are the secret sauce of Saddleback Church, where membersmeet weekly for an hour or two at someone’s home or at a restaurant to study aspecific topic, such as a book in the Bible. It’s the secret sauce becausesocial and community support is the key ingredient to any real change. Youcannot do it alone. These small groups enhance commitment and learning andprovide ongoing encouragement and emotional support. Saddleback has about fivethousand small groups, and the plan was to use this format to maximize resultsand help the church get healthier. The prophet Daniel had his posse oflike-minded supporters and you should too.Research shows that those who have the highest levels of social activityexperience one quarter the amount of mental decline in their golden years asthose who are not at all socially active.In November and December Pastor Warren talked to his church extensively aboutthe Daniel Plan. On December 12, with my wife, Tana, and me in the service, Ricktold the congregation that he was coming after them to get healthy on January 1.I was so pleased to see the progress of the pastor and the church. But then hesaid something that completely baffled me.“But between now and January first, eat anything you want!”I looked at my wife Tana in disbelief. “Did he really say that?” I asked. If Ihad a tomato, I might have thrown it at him. For real change to take place, thenew behavior cannot occur sometime down the road. It needs to start now, notsome date in the future.Shortly after the service, Rick and I had a chat about the comment. Almostimmediately he got the idea. “So you’re saying what I did was kind of liketelling a young man that since he is about to get married, he should have a fewlast flings before he ties the knot.”“You got it,” I said. “If people are serious about wanting to change, now is thebest time to start, not tomorrow, Monday, or January 1.”For Christmas I bought Rick a first edition of C. S. Lewis’s parable The GreatDivorce, a wonderful book about lasting change. I highlighted the followingpassage: “The gradual process is of no use at all …This moment contains allmoments.” For change to occur, you need to have a sense of urgency, in thismoment right now. That is why many people decide to get healthy after having aheart attack or being diagnosed with cancer. My hope for you is that you do notneed a crisis to start to get healthy and that the value of avoiding a crisishas enough emotional motivation.The formal start of the Daniel Plan kicked off January 15, 2011, with a bigrally at Saddleback Church. It was an enormously popular event and the churchhad to turn away thousands of people. The excitement was palpable. We’d designeda brain-smart curriculum and ninety-two hundred people signed up to be in ourresearch study. On this day, Rick weighed in at 292 pounds. By the time of ourthird rally in October, Rick had lost 50 pounds and ten inches off his waist,looked healthier, and …ten years younger! He told the congregation that hissecrets included:Rick[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_074_r1.jpg]Before[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_075_r1.jpg]Down 50 pounds after ten months of the Daniel Plan 1. Focusing on his motivation every day and deciding to view physical andemotional health as a spiritual discipline. He often repeated this New Testamentverse: “Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is inyou, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at aprice. Therefore honor God with your body” (1 Corinthians 6:19–20). 2. Keeping a food journal so he knew what he was putting in his mouth. He saidit was quite a wake-up call. 3. Drinking water throughout the day. 4. Getting proper sleep. Until we met, Rick spent a day or two a week up allnight with no sleep at all. He never knew it was a problem, but researchsuggests that when people get fewer than six hours of sleep at night, they havelower overall blood flow to the brain, which means more cravings and more baddecisions. Other research suggests that sleep deprivation causes people to beunrealistically optimistic and engage in riskier behaviors. To look and feelyounger it is critical to focus on getting enough sleep, which usually meansmore than seven hours a night. 5. Consuming high-quality calories. Rick dumped the junk food and focused ononly eating high-quality food. He told the congregation he eliminated the fourwhite powders: cocaine (he was kidding), sugar, bleached flour, and salt. Heeliminated doughnuts from his diet and started each day with a healthybreakfast. He ate smaller meals throughout the day. He stopped drinking hiscalories (especially sodas) and using artificial sweeteners, and he dumped breadfrom his diet, as it immediately turns to sugar in the body. Eating this waycurbed his cravings. He also started eating slower to enjoy his food more andincrease his sense of feeling full faster. 6. Getting regular exercise, which included weight lifting and cardiovascularwork. He was being much more consistent with his trainer. 7. Taking simple supplements, such as a multivitamin, fish oil, and vitamin D. 8. Being accountable to his weekly small group.All of the components were necessary for the plan to work, and they are allnecessary for you to look and feel younger, but it was the small-group componentthat turned out to be the secret sauce that really made the whole thing work.When you do this program with another person, your family, a group of people atchurch, work, or within your community, the healing process becomes much morepowerful.I’ve no doubt, with a team of support and the program outlined in this book, youcan do this too.Whenever I am on the Saddleback campus, I hear story after story of how people’slives have been changed, using the principles in this book in a small-groupformat, where people gather together weekly to support each other. People havetold me:“I’ve lost 20 (or 30 or 60 or 90 or 150) pounds.”“My numbers are so much better!”“No more headaches! It’s amazing. I was taking prescription pain medicationalmost daily, and now it’s been more than two weeks without any pain or pills!”“My clothes fit loose and I can get back into my old ones.”“Color is coming back to my gray hair …who knew?”“My mood is so much more stable and positive.”“My asthma is better.”“With the elimination of sugar, flour, salt, and processed foods, I rarely haveany cravings and have found I eat smaller amounts of nutrient-rich foods.”“My husband also lost 25 pounds!”“I just finished chemo. Everyone is amazed at how much energy I have and howfast my hair is returning. I am running circles around a friend who is ten yearsyounger who doesn’t have cancer. (He is not on the plan.)”“My complexion looks great; the improvement in the smoothness of my skin isremarkable.”“I’ve been off wheat for six weeks, and no more acid reflux.”“Ninety-eight percent of my headaches at night have disappeared. I wake upfeeling clear-headed instead of foggy.”“I don’t have body, joint, muscle pain in the mornings.”“I’m off my high blood pressure meds …and am working on getting off my type 2diabetes and cholesterol meds.”“I am diabetic. Now my blood sugar is dramatically better than when I was oninsulin. I am not taking either now.”“I’m having less arthritis (inflammatory) pain.”“I lost 3 inches off my waist and 4 inches off my hips.”“I have smoother, healthier facial skin with reduced acne.”“I have fewer PMS symptoms.”“I enjoy the adventure of discovering new foods, cooking new meals, and tryingnew things at restaurants.”“My triglyceride levels have lowered; I have reduced joint pain by at least 90percent and am no longer taking that harmful medication! Oh, and I can play withmy grandkids!”“Odd to say this in church, but my sex life has dramatically improved!”THE SECRET SAUCE IN PRACTICEIt is Sunday afternoon, and Cindy, a single working mother of four young kids,and a recent cancer survivor, is in her kitchen surrounded by several otherwomen friends. All have full-time jobs, and all decided to get healthy together.The house is filled with delicious smells and the sounds of happy kids in thebackground. It’s clear these women are having a blast cooking healthy mealstogether for the whole week ahead. One friend is making brain healthy nutritiousmini breakfast casseroles in muffin tins that will be warmed up on busy schooland work mornings to come. The jobs—grocery shopping, menu planning, cooking,and storing the meals—are divided up between the women according to theirpreferences. What was once an enormous chore for these single moms and workingwomen is now fun, and the time saved by pooling their efforts on meals givesthem much needed downtime to rest and be with their kids.During her cancer treatments, Cindy was given steroid drugs and gained 30 or 40pounds, which her body hadn’t been able to shed. In fact, all the drugs she tookfor her cancer therapy had still not detoxed completely from her body. BecauseCindy and her friends were no longer on a diet, but on a brain healthylifestyle, she is now consuming foods that are actually helping her body healitself. Her weight is falling off, her energy is returning, and she’s feelingthe old Cindy coming back to life. But Cindy would say it is the camaraderiethat makes all the difference—not only in helping launch a new way of eating butin sustaining the changes. In addition, the women meet to walk and talk everyweek, encouraging each other spiritually and emotionally.Dee Eastman, a friend of the Amen Clinic for over a decade and the director ofthe Daniel Plan at Saddleback, enthusiastically shared Cindy’s story above,along with many others like it. As you know by now, support in the form of teamsor groups is a major key to your success if you plan to look and feel younger.The research is clear that people rarely change in isolation; it tends to happenmost often in small groups.Dee said she expected to see people’s weight drop and their bodies get more fit,but remarks, “I was literally blown away by the amount of extra health benefitsthat were pouring in and being reported to us in such a short time. Within justthree months, the folks who immediately jumped in, got their blood work done,and ran with the program began seeing radically better medical lab results. Manywere able to get off blood pressure and cholesterol medication. Others reportedbeing able to sleep through the night without the need for sleep aids.” She isseeing with her own eyes what I’ve been saying for years: “Food is medicine.”(For more on this, revisit chapter 2 [Amen_9780307888563_epub_c02_r1.htm].) Inaddition to better lab numbers, Dee is hearing reports of depression lessening,anxiety fading, moodiness calmed. Dee admits that such impressive changes,across a wide spectrum, would not have occurred without the secret sauce ofmutual support via small groups and online support groups.Here are a few observations of the positive dynamics for change that Dee hasobserved happening because of friends supporting friends in getting healthy andfunctionally younger.Health is creatively incorporated into visiting and social gatherings. Oneactive, intergenerational group (one of the couples is seventy-nine years young)meets to walk and talk together three times a week, then meets on Saturdays at alocal gym to do circuit training. As they walk or work out, they casually sharehealthy recipes and cooking tips, along with other life joys and struggles. Theyare finding it is possible to get connected and get healthy at the same time.Inner and outer healing go hand in hand, particularly in a supportive groupculture. There is a woman who had almost thrown in the towel on life, who foundrefuge and encouragement in a group. She was about 52 and weighed in themid-300-pound range. She dove into getting healthier with her whole heart,feeling buoyed by the nutritional and exercise plan and supported by her newfriends. Not only has she lost 40 pounds (the first time she’s been under 300pounds in years), but she’s also healing emotionally while getting betterphysically. (It makes one wonder about possibilities for therapists doingcounseling while they walk instead of sit with their clients!) The exercise hashelped her depression with good endorphins and blood flow and body composition,and in Dee’s words, “being enfolded into a loving community” is healing herheart and soul. Human beings were created and wired to grow best in community,emotionally, spiritually, and physically.Healthy support groups create a safe environment for being honest with ourselvesand each other. Dee credits Rick Warren with leading the way in being truthfullyvulnerable. “It was really freeing when Pastor Rick admitted, ‘Hey, I gotoff-track in my health. I’ve been focusing on trying to save the world, but I’veneglected my physical body. Now I have ninety pounds to lose.’ Rick also remindshis congregants often that they don’t have to go through anything alone. He’s ina small group that is encouraging and holding him accountable alongside the restof the church.Groups can create change in the kind of eating that happens in socialsituations. One group meets at a well-known healthy restaurant once a week toenjoy a nutritious meal together. People are bringing brain-smart foods asrefreshments to meetings and events. One group is planning a healthy potluck,where each member is going to bring their favorite brain-smart dish, along withthe recipe and nutrition information.Studies show that overweight and obese young adults who had more social contactstrying to lose weight were more likely to want to lose weight themselves.Encouragement and approval from social contacts account for this association,researchers say.SMALL-GROUP TIPS FOR SUCCESSDebbie Eaton is an expert in small groups. She oversees seven hundred ofSaddleback’s small groups and has done so for many years. She offered some tipsfor making groups succeed. You may want to consider these as you join or createyour own support group to begin implementing this program into your life.HIGH ACCOUNTABILITY AND HIGH ENCOURAGEMENTProblems in groups almost always occur when one of these traits is out ofbalance. Too much accountability without plenty of cheerleading leads to feelingdiscouraged or feeling as though group members are pushing toward perfectionism.Lots of encouragement, without the balance of holding each other’s feet to thefire, leads to groups that stagnate and do not stretch or grow.SHARED PASSIONIt is important that those who join your group share a passion, such as passionfor physical well-being. Small groups often work best when two good friendsinvite other people they know, so there’s some sort of connection already inplace. Perhaps you have one good friend who is “all in” with you in this journeyto health. If both of you can think of one or two other friends who arepassionate about losing weight, feeling good, and growing younger, the group canform and expand quickly and organically.SIZE MATTERSThe ideal size for a support group is eight to ten people. If the group gets anybigger than this, the introverts may shut down and extroverts take over. Also,after a group exceeds ten people, they start thinking the group is so big nowthat their occasional absence won’t be missed. People aren’t as consistent andaccountability is not as high. On the other hand, if a group is too small, overtime it can stagnate and seem to get off kilter and ingrown. There aren’t enoughpersonalities or a wide enough experience base to keep the dynamics lively andvibrant.If your purposes are smaller and more specific—to exercise regularly or check inwith a nutrition coach daily, for example—it may be served by just one or twocommitted friends, such as was the case with Rick and Marco.BEGIN WITH LIMITS IN MINDGenerally, it is best to commit to a group for a set period of time. You may trystarting with a six-week commitment, and then re-up if the group is working wellfor everyone.In addition to these ideas, here are a couple more researched-based thoughts onsuccessful support teams.PROXIMITY HELPSWillow Creek Church, another of the largest churches in America, realized itssmall groups were not working to help people feel and stay connected in theirreal lives. It was not until fairly recently that Willow Creek began tappinginto neighborhood communities (called Table Groups), which met together severaltimes a week, that people once again began to care, share, struggle, grow, andbond. So consider convenience and location to make meeting together happen moreeasily. In Rick Cortez’s case, having an accountability partner at work made itconvenient to check in with each other before the work day or on their lunchbreaks. Neighbors make wonderful walking or jogging partners. Make gettingtogether as simple as you can and you’re more likely to do it.BE WARRIORS FOR EACH OTHERYou have to be ruthless for your health and a warrior for the health of thoseyou love. Research shows that when group members go soft on one another, to thepoint where they accept or empathize with backsliding too much, the groupdynamics change. Without meaning to, the group has now become supportive ofslacking off …and a deterioration of health occurs. Patients sometimes ask mewhy I am so direct and do not just simply accept excuses. This is not mypersonal nature, believe it or not. By nature, I’d love to be amiddle-of-the-road, everything-in-moderation, just-try-your-best kind of guy.But the truth is: This is not helpful, not loving, and not in your bestinterest. Have you ever had a friend who cared enough not to bullshit you?That’s me. If I’d let Pastor Rick continue telling people to eat anything theywant, we would have started the plan tomorrow, and because tomorrow never comes,his congregation would remain sick and headed toward an early grave. Let’screate a movement together. It can start with just you and a few friends.The following story is one about using the secret sauce of unwavering supportwithin marriages and families, so you can leave a legacy of joy and health toyour children and grandchildren.PASTOR STEVE: LEAVING A BETTER LEGACYRemember Pastor Steve Komanapalli? As part of his evaluation at our clinic, hehad a SPECT scan. His brain was not healthy and showed very low activity in hisPFC, the part of the brain involved in judgment and impulse control. Oncognitive testing, he also scored poorly, especially in the area of attention.He was on multiple medications for diabetes, hypertension, and cholesterolproblems. At his first appointment he had to roll off the couch owing to hisweight. When I first met Steve, he and his wife, Nicole, were expecting theirfirst child, Karis, a baby girl. I liked Steve a lot, so I had to be straightwith him. He could not have his chocolate cake (and barbecued ribs, buffalowings, fried chicken, loaded pizzas, and supersized root beers) and his healthand longevity too. He could not eat without limits and leave a positive legacyfor the next generation. I told him that if he did not get serious about hishealth, then a stepfather would be raising Karis because he would be dead. Didhe really want to put Nicole and Karis through his early illnesses and death?Around the same time, he had a talk with Nicole, during which she told him, “Ifyou die of something preventable and leave me to raise our child without you, Iwill mourn your loss, but I will be deeply disappointed that you didn’t love usenough to make your health a priority. I am really going to be hurt that youdidn’t put your well-being, and our family’s needs, above your appetite.” Thesetwo conversations began Steve’s ascent into health.Steve became one of the leaders of the plan on the Saddleback campus. “I beganto see that the single biggest impact on how I feel is what I put in my mouth,”Steve said as he described one of his many “aha” moments. Within one month ofmaking food changes, Steve’s cholesterol and triglycerides had come down to thenormal range. He is now playing Ping-Pong, which is one of my all-time favoritegames for improving the brain, and when played well, a game of Ping-Pong willget your heart pumping but is also doable at Steve’s size. When he’s hungry,Steve snacks on fruit and nuts and finds he is satisfied with a small amount,unlike the never-ending cycle of craving and hunger that junk food perpetuates.After five months on the plan, Steve lost 35 pounds and 4 inches off his waist.His health numbers improved dramatically:• Triglycerides decreased from 385 to 63• Cholesterol decreased from 200 to 130• HDL (good cholesterol) increased from 22 to 46• Blood sugar decreased from 128 to 89• HgA1c (a marker of diabetes) decreased from 7.2 (abnormal) to 5.7 (normal)• He is off both his blood pressure and cholesterol medications!Steve’s follow-up SPECT scan showed remarkable improvement in his PFC, and hisattention scores had dramatically improved. His brain, body, and mind weresignificantly younger within just five months of starting the program. Steve isblessed to have a wife who loves him enough to challenge and support him.Sometimes the best secret sauce is right in your own backyard or looking at youfrom across the dining room table.Steve’s Before Brain SPECT Scan[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_076_r1.jpg]Many areas of decreased activitySteve’s After Brain SPECT Scan[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_077_r1.jpg]Overall improved activityStudies show that people in loving relationships tend to live longer, in partbecause they help monitor each other’s health.The Saddleback story and its combined statistics are staggeringly positive. Inthe first five months the church lost a total of 200,000 pounds, about 7.68percent among our research participants. A 5 percent reduction in body weightdecease the risk of diabetes by 58 percent. Eighty percent of our participantssaid they were compliant or very compliant with the program. Eighty percent saidit was easy or very easy to do. Fifty-five percent were doing it with someoneelse in their families, and 80 percent said they had increased their exercise.However, it is the individual stories that touch your brain and inspire change.It is the real people behind the numbers that make me smile. The other day Itook a walk on Balboa Island near my home in Orange County and was stopped by anumber of people out for a walk who recognized me from public television. Onecouple, who had been incorporating these principles into their lives, had lost60 pounds between them. Everywhere I go I meet people who express theirgratitude for how this knowledge has led them to better lives.The keys to getting healthy are absolutely important to know; but the secretsauce that makes it work and last, and adds fun and motivation to the process,is doing it together. Grab a friend or family member to do this program withyou. You will both be better off.CREATE YOUR OWN GENIUS NETWORKA Tale of Two Ricks is about using the resources in your relationships to getand stay healthy. I am in a professional support group run by my friend JoePolish. In a recent group he gave us an exercise on the power of networks, whichhe has graciously allowed me to share with you. Called “Create Your Own GeniusNetwork,” it can help you thrive and keep you on track toward your goals, in asimilar way to the small groups at Saddleback. Research has demonstrated thatstrong relationships are associated with health, happiness, and success. Thehealth of your peer group is one of the strongest predictors of your health andlongevity. This exercise will help you create and sustain your own network.WHAT ARE YOUR HEALTH GOALS?

Keep your genius network constantly up to date and make sure tosupport others in their efforts to use their brains to change their age. Youwill be supporting yourself in the process.CHANGE YOUR AGE NOW: TWENTY TIPS FOR GETTING BETTER TOGETHER 1. The secret sauce for brain health and longevity is to do it together. Startmaking a list of people who will support you and vice versa. We are morepowerful when we use more than one good brain at a time. 2. According to C. S. Lewis, in his short parable The Great Divorce, “Thegradual process is of no use at all …This moment contains all moments.” Now isthe time to get well, not at some undetermined date off in the future. Choosepeople to join you who are ready to get healthy now! 3. Begin every day by focusing on your goals and planning how you’ll meetthem, and then share this with your accountability buddy. Short daily check-insare powerfully motivating. 4. You have to snooze to get healthy! Sleep is a critical ingredient tolongevity success. Focus on getting eight hours of sleep at night to boost brainfunction and follow-through. Encourage your friends to do this as well. 5. Are you a friend or accomplice? Write down the names of five people withwhom you spend the most time. Are you supporting their health efforts (are youtheir friend)? Or, are you supporting their bad habits (are you theiraccomplice)? 6. Combine healthy eating with friendships. Prepare healthy meals and snacksfor the week ahead with friends; share recipes and ideas for cutting caloriesand upsizing nutrition; bring delicious, healthy food to potlucks and parties. 7. Exercise regularly, with a partner or a group of friends. It helps if youcan make this convenient by walking with people who live nearby, or working outat the gym together before or after your regular get-togethers. 8. Create a Facebook group of friends who commit to check in with what theydid to incorporate exercise into their routines that day. 9. Incorporate exercise into social routines. Take an after-dinner walk withfriends, meet someone to play tennis before lunch, bike to social events.10. Create warm memories in the kitchen with your family in healthier ways. Forexample, instead of baking sugar cookies, let the kids decorate their own minipizzas or fruit or veggie “art” sculptures (with bits of fruit or veggies andtoothpicks).11. Remind your kids and spouse that what they put in their mouth affects howthey feel. Offer your family plenty of attractive and tasty good-mood foods thatnourish their brains and bodies.12. Determine to create a healthy legacy for your family. It starts with youshowing the way. Prioritize time for active play, gardening, or shopping atfarmers’ markets, and cooking healthy meals together.13. In your support group, whether it is made up of two people or ten, be sureyou have a good balance of high accountability and high encouragement. Bewarriors for each other’s health.14. Plan ahead when dining out for dates, social lunches, couples’ nights out,and so on by scouting out healthy restaurants in your area. Or start a dinnergroup where you take turns hosting other couples for delicious, brain healthymeals.15. Create a genius network using the form in this chapter, contacting fivepeople who you think might be willing to support each other in developing newhealthy habits.16. Spend more time around healthy people in general, as you really do becomelike those you spend the most time with. Healthy habits are contagious!17. Commit to “influence others to be thinner, smarter, happier and younger.” Bepatient with their process but consistent with your new behaviors. Encourageevery step made in a positive direction.18. “Tell the truth in love” to someone whose health you care about. It wasn’teasy for Steve’s wife, who loved her husband unconditionally, to challenge himto change. But by doing so, she likely gifted them with many more healthy, happyyears together.19. Make a group goal to celebrate your success together. Rick Cortez is lookingforward to dancing with his wife. Other groups choose to run a 5K race together,and some climb a summit to celebrate.20. Consider the possibilities of joining an online community of support. Wecreated the Amen Solution community website (www.theamensolution.com[http://www.theamensolution.com]) to offer just such an opportunity. I’m thereas your “virtual brain coach,” along with others choosing the same journeytoward a brain healthy lifestyle."},{"pageContent":"10DANIEL AND BRAIN SPECT IMAGING[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_L01_r1.jpg]WHAT YOU DON’T KNOW IS STEALING YOUR BRAINI curse you that you know something that is true that no one else believes.—ROMANIAN cURSEFrom the moment I got my own brain scanned for the first time in 1991, Ideveloped brain envy. I had already scanned dozens of patients when I decided toget my own scan at age thirty-seven. When I saw the toxic, bumpy appearance, Iknew it was not healthy. All of my life I have been someone who rarely drankalcohol, never smoked, and never used an illegal drug.Then why did my brain look so bad?Before I truly understood brain health, I had many of the bad brain habitsdiscussed in this book. I played football in high school and got my bell rung onseveral occasions. I ate lots of fast food, lived on diet sodas, and would oftenget by on four or five hours of sleep at night. I worked like a nut, didn’texercise much, and carried an extra 30 pounds that stubbornly would not go awayby wishful thinking.My last scan, at age fifty-two, looked healthier and much younger than it didfifteen years earlier, which typically does not happen with the aging process.Brains usually become less and less active with age.Why did my scan look better? Seeing other people’s scans compared with mine, Ideveloped “brain envy” and wanted a better brain.Brain SPECT imaging literally changed everything in my life. It helped me comeout of the darkness, both in my personal and professional life.OUT OF MY PERSONAL DARKNESSNever before being scanned had I thought about the physical health of my ownbrain, despite being my medical school’s top student in neuroanatomy, completingfive years of postgraduate residency training, and becoming board-certified inboth general and child and adolescent psychiatry.For example, I had no idea that:• Being overweight negatively affected the health of my brain• High-fat, sugary foods worked on the addiction centers of my brain• Spraying cleaning chemicals in a closed shower stall was a really stupid idea,as it was toxic to my brain• Getting less than six hours of sleep at night lowered the blood flow to mybrain. I rarely got more than five.• The chronic stress from working so many hours was hurting cells in the memorycenters of my brain• Being around secondhand smoke damaged the blood vessels to my brain• Drinking a 36-ounce caffeinated diet soda, not uncommon for me pre-SPECT,dramatically constricted blood flow to my brainIn short, what I didn’t know was hurting me. And not just a little. As I havelearned from looking at over seventy thousand SPECT scans from real people whowere suffering, having a less-than-healthy brain went with less-than-healthydecisions and a suboptimized life.My not-so-healthy SPECT scan at age thirty-seven[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_078_r1.jpg]Bumpy, toxic-looking patternMy much healthier SPECT scan at age fifty-two[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_079_r1.jpg]Fuller, more even, and healthier patternPrior to my first scan I had no idea that I could actually change the health ofmy brain by changing my habits. I thought that some of my cognitive issues, suchas dropping names or being unfocused and forgetful, were just a normal part ofthe aging process. After all, I was now thirty-seven years old. The dozens ofdecisions I made every day were being made without the knowledge of what I wasactually doing to my brain.As I learned about brain imaging and brain health, I put into practice all ofthe main principles in this book. I started to exercise more, improved mynutrition, got more sleep, monitored my bloodwork more often, and took targetedbrain healthy supplements.Over time, seeing the SPECT scans caused me to look at every aspect of mypersonal life, even the way I viewed the world, in a different way.• Watching contact sports was definitely not as much fun. I realized that when Iwatched boxing or football, I was watching brain damage in process. I waswitnessing athletes’ brains being ruined, which in turn would ruin their lives.I remain completely baffled as to why ultimate fighting is legal. Don’t theathletic commissions know that boxing dementia (dementia pugilistica) was firstdescribed in 1929, and that ultimate fighting is as bad, or worse, than boxing?These athletes get kicked or kneed in the head repeatedly.• When I watched the news and saw natural disasters, I wondered how manysurvivors would develop emotional trauma patterns on their scans or woulddevelop brain dysfunction secondary to the chronic stress.• When I read stories about soldiers returning from war with brain injuries fromIEDs I was horrified that the military was not routinely using functional brainscans to evaluate the state of their brains’ function and actively trying torehabilitate them early. I was an enlisted infantry medic and then an armypsychiatrist and knew our soldiers deserved the best care possible.• When I saw stories of people who committed terrible crimes, such as murder,rather than just judging them as bad, as is so easy to do, I wondered if theyhad dysfunctional brains,. I have subsequently published professional papers onour work with murderers.• SPECT changed the habits within my family, because I wanted my wife, children,and grandchildren to have the benefit of a brain healthy life. If you dated oneof my daughters for more than four months, you got scanned. I wanted to knowabout the health of the young men’s brains.SPECT definitely shed light on my own brain’s “lack of health,” and as I gainedmore experience with SPECT, I realized it was possible that by changing myhabits I could indeed improve the overall health of my brain and subsequentlychange my life. I got a burning desire to make my brain better. In a sense, Ifell in love with the health of my own brain. The extensive experience I wasgaining with patients’ scans before and after treatment convinced me even morethat our habits accelerate the aging process—or they can decelerate it.OPENING THE DOOR ON PROFESSIONAL DARKNESSBy the time I went to my first lecture on brain SPECT imaging in 1991, I hadbeen evaluating and treating psychiatric patients for nearly a decade withoutthe benefit of any brain imaging. I often felt in the dark on what to do for mypatients, even though I was highly trained and certified competent. Whenever Isaw an older person who was depressed or complained of memory problems, atreatment-resistant substance abuser, an aggressive teenager, or a couple whocouldn’t get along, knowing what to do for them felt like shooting craps. Iwould do what I was trained to do, such as give an ADHD child a stimulantmedication or a depressed patient an antidepressant, and sometimes it wouldwork, but often enough it would make the patient much worse, sometimes homicidalor suicidal.It felt as though I were throwing darts in the dark. Sometimes I got it right.Sometimes I hurt people.And I spent a lot of time anxious, knowing I was practicing a very soft scienceat best. I often wondered how well my other medical colleagues—cardiologists,orthopedists, neurosurgeons, and gastroenterologists—would be able to diagnoseand treat their patients if they were unable to image the organs causing theproblems.For me, everything changed professionally after attending that first lecture onbrain SPECT imaging at a local hospital in northern California where I was thedirector of the dual-diagnosis program, which took care of psychiatric patientswho also had substance abuse problems. (Dual diagnosis refers to a patient withtwo issues, such as bipolar disorder and alcohol addiction. Mood disorders andaddictions, for example, often go hand in hand.) From the moment I ordered thefirst SPECT for a patient, it was as if I’d been given glasses to see what washappening in the brain. No more flying blind and guessing. Of course, having aSPECT scan does not always make a dramatic difference in patient care, but myfirst ten cases were so helpful that I was completely hooked. Here are severalexamples:• Matilda, sixty-nine, had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease but did nothave the Alzheimer’s pattern on SPECT, which was already described in themedical literature in 1991. Her scan was more consistent with depression. Hermemory was restored when I treated her for depression.• Sandy, forty-four, had a clinical profile consistent with adult ADHD (shortattention span, distractibility, disorganization, procrastination, and impulsecontrol problems), yet she refused treatment. When she saw the evidence of ADHDon her scan she started to cry and said, “You mean this is not my fault,” andimmediately agreed to give the medication a try. It made a dramatic differencein her life and her marriage. I already believed I knew her diagnosis, but thescan helped her believe it.• Geraldine, seventy-two, was suicidal and suffered with resistant depression.On her scan she had two huge right-sided strokes in her brain that hadpreviously been undetected. Knowing about the strokes helped us understand herdepression better and also helped us prevent the possible third stroke thatcould have killed her.• Chris, twelve, was hospitalized for the third time for violent outbursts. Hehad been seeing a psychoanalyst in the Napa Valley who wondered if the problemwasn’t his relationship with his mother. His scan showed very clear trouble inhis left temporal lobe, an area underneath his left temple and behind his lefteye. This area is often associated with violence. When put on an antiseizuremedication, his behavior normalized and he subsequently thrived in a publicschool setting. Without the scan, he was on his way to institutional living in aresidential treatment program or jail.• Sherrie, fifty-two, had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder but refused totake her medication. She was in her third hospitalization for hearing voicescoming from the walls of her home. She had tried to pull out all the wiring inher home to get rid of the voices. Once she saw the abnormalities on her scanshe became compliant with treatment and quickly improved.• Ken, fifty-nine, was abusing alcohol and cocaine, but was basically in denialabout his substance abuse. After seeing his scan he developed brain envy andcompletely stopped his drug abuse and adopted a brain healthy lifestyle. A yearlater his brain was dramatically better.• Sara, forty-two, and Will, forty-eight, failed marital therapy multiple times.When they were both scanned, Sara had an obsessive-looking brain (too muchactivity in the front of her brain), while Will had an ADHD-looking brain (toolittle activity in the front of his brain). On appropriate treatments toindividually balance their brains, their marriage dramatically improved.• Ted, seventeen, had failed a residential treatment setting. He suffered withseveral impulsivity and criminal tendencies. He was missing the left front partof his brain on SPECT, which means he had zero blood flow to this part of hisbrain. It turned out that he fell down a flight of stairs when he was four yearsold, was unconscious for a half hour, and no one remembered the injury orthought it could have been involved in his troubled behavior.• Christina, sixty-two, had been diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome. Herprimary care doctor said she had depression and a personality disorder and senther to me. On her scan there was a clearly toxic pattern, consistent with abrain infection. She was depressed and had a disordered personality because theorgan of mood control and personality was damaged, which completely changed thetreatment plan and our approach to Christina.In a few short months SPECT completely changed how I practiced medicine. Howcould I practice without imaging? How did I know what was going on in mypatients’ brains unless I looked? My anxiety with my patients went down and myexcitement about being a psychiatrist went up. My effectiveness and confidencealso went up. I was more willing to take on complex and treatment-resistantcases.• In order to effectively treat patients, I knew it was essential to look attheir brains before I went about trying to change them. You cannot change whatyou do not measure.• SPECT helped me make more complete diagnoses for my patients and not missimportant findings, such as a past head injury, infection, or toxic exposure.• SPECT helped me be more targeted in my treatments. I have learned through theimaging work that illnesses like ADHD, anxiety, depression, addiction, orobesity are not single or simple problems in the brain; instead, they all havemultiple types and the treatment needs to be targeted to the specific type ofbrain, not a general diagnosis like depression.• SPECT made me considerably more cautious in prescribing certain medications orusing multiple medications, because they often appeared toxic on scans. I had tobe more responsible in my use of medications.• SPECT directed me to use more natural treatments, as they are often effectiveand appear less toxic on scans.• SPECT help to break denial in substance abusers. It is hard to say you do nothave a problem when faced with a scan that looks toxic.• SPECT decreased stigma, still so rampant in psychiatric illnesses, becausepatients see their problems as medical, not moral.• SPECT increased patient compliance, as patients wanted to have better brains.• SPECT led me to work with patients to slow down and in many cases reverse thebrain aging process.Over time, the imaging work led me to create a brain healthy business for ouremployees at the Amen Clinics and for other businesses. The collective health ofyour employees’ brains are a business’s most important asset. It also has led meto work on creating brain healthy churches, such as I am doing with the DanielPlan at Saddleback Church. It has even helped to change the culture of oursports, as evidenced by our work with active and retired professional footballplayers demonstrating very high levels of brain trauma.Through our brain imaging work we have been able to see which factors hurt thebrain and which ones help. Without directly looking at how the brain functions,we are just guessing at what is wrong with our patients and making way too manymistakes. How would you know about the health of your brain unless you looked?WHEN SHOULD YOU THINK ABOUT GETTING A SPECT SCAN?I think of SPECT like radar. Our Newport Beach clinic is very close to theOrange County / John Wayne Airport. On sunny days the pilot does not need radarto land the plane, because he can see the runway. But on days that are stormy,radar is an essential tool to safely land the plane. In the same way, when theclinical picture is clear a scan is not necessary. But for unclear ortreatment-resistant cases, SPECT can provide useful, even lifesavinginformation.Susan, forty-seven, came to see me for resistant depression. She had seen sixother doctors and had tried ten different medications. She was suffering withsevere depression, panic attacks, headaches, dizziness, and tremors. Everyonewas treating her as a psychiatric case and changing her antidepressantmedication and encouraging her to continue with psychotherapy that had no effecton her condition. She was feeling hopeless and suicidal, even though she had alarge loving family, a supportive husband, and three teenage girls she adored.Her SPECT scan looked awful. It showed overall severe decreased activity in apattern that was consistent with an infection or toxic exposure.Normal Brain SPECT Scan[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_080_r1.jpg]Full, even, symmetrical activitySusan’s Brain SPECT Scan[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_081_r1.jpg]Severe, overall decreased activityAfter an extensive workup we discovered that Susan had Lyme disease, for whichshe was able to get effective treatment. When I saw the scans it triggered moreextensive questions that eventually led to the right diagnosis. Over time, withextensive brain rehabilitation, she did better. Susan later told me that thescan saved her life. Until she saw the damage in her brain she had just felthopeless and helpless. Seeing her problem as medical and not moral made a bigdifference for her psychologically. It also pointed her medical team in theright direction. Too often when people do not get better, physicians diagnosethem as “psychiatric” or with a personality problem. How would we know unless welooked?Over the years it has become clear to me that the cost of having anineffectively treated brain problem is much more expensive than a scan will everbe.In our experience, more insurance companies are starting to pay for SPECT,especially for reasons such as memory problems, dementia, and traumatic braininjury. Initially insurance companies tend to deny new procedures, especiallyfor mental health care. But the denial of SPECT for patients whose treatment mayclearly benefit from it is a violation of the Paul Wellstone and Pete DomeniciMental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (the Parity Act), whichdoes not allow insurance carriers to discriminate against patients for mentalhealth issues. They need to provide the same coverage as they do for medicalprocedures. Both the American College of Radiology and the European Society ofNuclear Medicine (ESNM) have published guidelines for using SPECT with a numberof indications relevant to mental health issues, such as in cognitive decline,dementia, and traumatic brain injury. The ESNM guidelines also specificallyreference SPECT’s usefulness when evaluating psychiatric disorders. A recentanalysis of 2,711 practice recommendations in cardiology, for example, foundthat only 11 percent were based on evidence from more than one randomizedcontrolled clinical trial while 48 percent were based simply on expert opinion,case studies, or what was typically being done in practice. Similarly, a 2011analysis behind the Infectious Diseases Society of America’s practice guidelinesfound that 14 percent of the recommendations were based on a high level ofscientific evidence. Medicine, in most places, is clearly still an art, not ahard science.Applying a higher level of scientific evidence for SPECT for mental healthissues than to other covered medical procedures is a violation of the ParityAct. The Parity Act states: “The treatment limitations applicable to such mentalhealth or substance use disorder benefits are no more restrictive than thepredominant treatment limitations applied to substantially all medical andsurgical benefits covered by the plan (or coverage) and there are no separatetreatment limitations that are applicable only with respect to mental health orsubstance use disorder benefits.”WHAT CAN I DO I IF I CANNOT GET A SCAN?I have known for a long time that many people cannot get scans, either becauseof the cost or because they are not near a center that performs them. My booksare translated into thirty languages, and if you read one in China or Brazil,odds are you are not going to get a scan. So based on thousands of scans, wedeveloped a series of questionnaires to help people predict what their scanmight look like if they could get one. Then, based on the answers, we givesuggestions on ways to think about helping the brain with certain naturalsupplements, medications, or exercises. For uncomplicated cases, thisquestionnaire has proven to be surprisingly accurate, usually lining up withwhat we see on scan very well. The questionnaires can be found online atwww.amenclinics.com [http://www.amenclinics.com] or www.theamensolution.com[http://www.theamensolution.com] and they are used by mental healthprofessionals around the world. Of course, you should always talk with your ownhealth care professional when considering treatment options.BE A BRAIN WARRIOR FOR YOURSELF AND THOSE YOU LOVEBrain SPECT imaging has also taught me that I have to be a “brain warrior” formy own health. No one is going to do it for me. In fact, others will try tosteal your brain health in search of their monetary gain: “Do you want tosupersize your fries for only a few more pennies?” You would do well to be awarrior for your own brain health.• Be a brain warrior by boosting your brain to dramatically increase the qualityand consistency of your decisions.• Be a brain warrior by always working to be more conscientious and thoughtfulregarding your health.• Be a brain warrior by protecting your brain from injuries and toxins.• Be a brain warrior by saying no to the food pushers in your life who ask youto supersize, refill, have extra helpings, or eat more than you need to keepyour body and brain healthy.• Be a brain warrior by getting and keeping your weight at a healthy level.• Be a brain warrior by only eating food that serves you rather than making foodcompanies more profitable.• Be a brain warrior by getting the sleep you need.• Be a brain warrior by increasing your endurance and strength through smartexercise.• Be a brain warrior by embracing constant mental exercise and new learning.• Be a brain warrior by getting problems like ADHD, anxiety, depression, andother mental health problems treated.

Brain envy often results from seeing your own brain SPECT scan. When I sawmy scan for the first time in 1991, I realized that even though I never used anydrugs, rarely drank alcohol, and never smoked, my brain needed help. I wanted ahealthier brain. Determine to do whatever you can to give yourself the bestbrain possible, because when your brain works right, you work right. 2. Brains usually become less active with age. But they do not have to. With abrain-smart program, you can start to reverse the brain aging process. 3. When I exchanged my bad brain habits for good ones, my brain actually agedbackward. I have seen evidence of this on my SPECT scans over the years: Itlooks functionally younger today than it did fifteen years ago. I’ve seen thishappen to scores of our own clients. You too can decrease your brain’sfunctional age as you determine to trade bad brain habits for good ones. 4. Many “unexpected” things can hurt the brain, such as being overweight,eating lots of sugar, using household chemicals without proper ventilation,getting less than seven hours of sleep, overworking, being around secondhandsmoke, and drinking diet sodas. Small changes over time can add up to bigimprovements in brain function. 5. Before I became aware of brain health, I thought that some of my cognitiveissues, such as dropping names or being unfocused and forgetful, were just anormal part of the aging process. At thirty-seven! Dropping names or beingunfocused or forgetful at any age is a sign of trouble. 6. Having a less-than-healthy brain goes with less-than-healthy decisions anda suboptimized life. 7. You cannot change what you do not measure. 8. Seeing a SPECT scan of your own brain or of someone you love increasesunderstanding and compassion. If someone has a brain that is misfiring, they areliterally working with an emotional and cognitive handicap. They deserve helpand compassion, not condemnation. If the brain is balanced, better behaviortends to follow. 9. SPECT scans do not lie. If someone is in denial about the damage they aredoing to their brain by drinking too much or using drugs or trying to hide theiraddiction, a scan will reveal truth. Getting a brain scan often serves as theimpetus for going to rehab or AA, or simply making a once-and-for-all decisionto quit harming their brain.10. If you want to live a long time with your mind intact, it is critical tobecome a brain warrior for your own health. No one is going to do it for you.You have to take custody of your own brain health. Begin by building your owngenius network of supporters. The health of the people you spend time withmatters to your health.11. Be a brain warrior by getting and keeping your weight at a healthy level.Eat food that serves you, exercise regularly, and give your brain simplesupplements to nourish it well.12. Be a brain warrior by getting the sleep you need, dealing with sleep apnea,and taking sleep-friendly supplements like melatonin and GABA for a good night’ssleep, and using sleep-inducing routines to prepare for bed.13. Be a brain warrior by developing a consistent stress reduc-tion practice with meditation or deep breathing or contemplative prayer. Killthe ANTs that steal your happiness and make you old.14. Be a brain warrior by protecting your brain from injuries and toxins. Starta brain healthy rehabilitation program if you’ve damaged your brain or sufferedany kind of brain injury.15. Be a brain warrior by constant mental exercise and new learning. Keep yourchildlike curiosity and openness to new knowledge intact to stay young of mindand heart.16. Be a brain warrior by being an example of good physical and mental healthfor your family and friends. Pass on the encouragement!17. A true sign of self-love is how well you take care of your brain and body.If you are not doing it, why not? You are worth it!18. Success breeds success. When you do the right things over time they becomeeasier and easier to do.19. The quality of your life is determined by the sum of all of the decisions inyour life. With a better brain you are much more likely to make better decisionsand dramatically improve everything in your life.20. Even if you have been bad to your brain, you can literally improve yourbrain, and when you do you improve everything in your life."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIXNATURAL SUPPLEMENTSTO ENHANCE YOUR BRAIN AND EXTEND YOUR LIFEUsing supplements by themselves, without getting your diet, exercise, thoughts,peer group, and environment under control, is a waste of money. You need to dothe whole program for it to work. Yet I have seen instances in which supplementsused in conjunction with a brain-smart plan make a significant difference.Let me start by explaining the pros and cons of using natural supplements toenhance brain function. To start, they are often effective. They usually havedramatically fewer side effects than most prescription medications and they aresignificantly less expensive. Plus, you never have to tell an insurance companythat you have taken them. As awful as it sounds, taking prescription medicationscan affect your insurability. I know many people who have been denied or made topay higher rates for insurance because they have taken certain medications. Ifthere are natural alternatives, they are worth considering.Yet natural supplements also have their own set of problems. Even though theytend to be less expensive than medications, they may be more expensive for youpersonally because they are usually not covered by insurance. Many people areunaware that natural supplements can have side effects and need to bethoughtfully used. Just because something is “natural” does not mean it isinnocuous. Both arsenic and cyanide are natural, but that doesn’t mean they aregood for you. For example, St. John’s Wort, one of my favorite naturalantidepressants, can cause sun sensitivity, and it can also decrease theeffectiveness of a number of medications such as birth control pills. Oh, great!Get depressed, take St. John’s Wort from the grocery store, and now you arepregnant when you don’t want to be. That may not be a good thing.One of the major concerns about natural supplements is the lack of qualitycontrol. There is variability among brands, so you need to find brands youtrust. Another disadvantage is that many people get their advice aboutsupplements from the teenage clerk at the health food store, who may not havethe best information. But, even when looking at the problems, the benefits ofnatural supplements make them worth considering, especially if you can getthoughtful, research-based information.Every day I personally take a handful of supplements, which I believe make asignificant difference in my life. They have helped to change the health of mybrain, my energy, and my lab values. Many physicians say that if you eat abalanced diet you do not need supplements. I love what Dr. Mark Hyman wrote inhis book The UltraMind Solution: Fix Your Broken Brain by Healing Your BodyFirst: If people “eat wild, fresh, organic, local, non–genetically modified foodgrown in virgin mineral- and nutrient-rich soils that has not been transportedacross vast distances and stored for months before being eaten …and work andlive outside, breathe only fresh unpolluted air, drink only pure, clean water,sleep nine hours a night, move their bodies every day, and are free from chronicstressors and exposure to environmental toxins,” then it is possible that theymight not need supplements. Because we live in a fast-paced society where wepick up food on the fly, skip meals, eat sugar-laden treats, buy processedfoods, and eat foods that have been chemically treated, we could all use alittle help from a multivitamin/mineral supplement.AMEN SOLUTION SUPPLEMENTSAt the Amen Clinics we make our own line of supplements, the Amen Solution, thathave taken over a decade to develop. The reason I developed this line was that Iwanted my patients and my own family to have access to the highest-qualityresearch-based supplements available. After I started recommending supplementsto my patients, they would go to the supermarket, drugstore, or health foodstore and face so many choices that they did not know what or how to choose.This dilemma was compounded by the varying levels of quality among differentbrands.Another reason I developed my own line was that the Amen Clinics see a highnumber of people who have ADD. I realized if they did not get their supplementsas they walked out the door, they would forget about it or procrastinate and nothave started them by their next appointment.Research shows the therapeutic benefit of using supplements to support a healthymood, sleep, and memory. I strongly recommend that when purchasing a supplement,you consult a health care practitioner familiar with nutritional supplements todetermine which supplements and dosages may be most effective for you. Ourwebsite (www.amenclinics.com [http://www.amenclinics.com]) contains links to thescientific literature on many different supplements related to brain health, sothat you, as a consumer, can be fully informed on the benefits and risksinvolved. Please remember supplements can have very powerful effects on thebody, and caution should be used when combining them with prescriptionmedications.THREE SUPPLEMENTS FOR EVERYBODYThere are three supplements I typically recommend to all of my patients becausethey are critical to optimal brain function: a multivitamin, fish oil, andvitamin D.Multivitamins. According to recent studies, more than 50 percent of Americans donot eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables a day, the minimumrequired to get the nutrition you need. I recommend that all of my patients takea high-quality multivitamin/mineral complex every day. In an editorial in theJournal of the American Medical Association, researchers recommended a dailyvitamin for everybody because it helps prevent chronic illness. In addition,people with weight-management issues often are not eating healthy diets and havevitamin and nutrient deficiencies. Furthermore, research suggests that peoplewho take a multiple vitamin actually have younger-looking DNA.A 2010 study from Northumbria University in England tested multivitamins’effects on 215 men between the ages of thirty and fifty-five. For thedouble-blind, placebo-controlled study, the men were tested on mentalperformance and asked to rate themselves on general mental health, stress, andmood. At the debut of the trial, there were no significant differences betweenthe multivitamin group and the placebo group. When the participants wereretested a little more than one month later, the multivitamin group reportedimproved moods and showed better mental performance, helping participants behappier and smarter! Not only that, the multivitamin group reported an improvedsense of vigor, reduced stress, and less mental fatigue after completing mentaltasks.Another placebo-controlled study from Northumbria researchers tested the effectsof multivitamins on eighty-one healthy children aged eight to fourteen. Theyfound that the children who took multivitamins performed better on two out ofthree attention tasks. The researchers concluded that multivitamins have thepotential to improve brain function in healthy children.NeuroVite Plus is the brand we make at the Amen Clinics. It contains a completerange of brain healthy nutrients. Four capsules a day is the full dose, whichcontains the following:• Vitamin A and high levels of Bs, plus vitamins C, D (2,000 IUs), E, and K2• Minerals, including zinc, copper, magnesium, selenium, chromium, manganese,calcium and magnesium• Brain nutrients—alpha-lipoic acid, acetyl-L-carnitine, and phosphatidylserine• Equivalent nutrients to:• 1 apple (quercitin)• 1 tomato (lycopene)• 1 serving fresh spinach (lutein)• 1 serving broccoli (broccoli seed concentrate)• 2 L red wine (resveratrol, without the alcohol)• a cup of blueberries (pterostilbene)• 1 full dose stabilized probioticFish oil. For years, I have been writing about the benefits of omega-3 fattyacids, which are found in fish oil supplements. I personally take a fish oilsupplement every day and recommend that all of my patients do the same. When youlook at the mountain of scientific evidence, it is easy to understand why.Research has found that omega-3 fatty acids are essential for optimal brain andbody health.For example, according to researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health,having low levels of omega-3 fatty acids is one of the leading preventablecauses of death and has been associated with heart disease, strokes, depression,suicidal behavior, ADD, dementia, and obesity. There is also scientific evidencethat low levels of omega-3 fatty acids play a role in substance abuse.I can tell you that most people, unless they are focusing on eating fish ortaking fish oil supplements, have low omega-3 levels. I know this because at theAmen Clinics we perform a blood test on patients where we can measure the levelsof omega-3 fatty acids in the blood. Before I began offering the test topatients, I tested it on my employees, several family members, and of course,myself. When my test results came back, I was very happy with the robustnumbers. An omega-3 score above 7 is good. Mine was nearly 11. But the resultsfor nearly all of the employees and family members I tested were not so good. Infact, I was horrified at how low their levels were, which put them at greaterrisk for both physical and emotional problems. It is an easy fix. They justneeded to eat more fish or take fish oil supplements.Boosting your intake of omega-3 fatty acids is one of the best things you can dofor your brainpower, mood, and weight. The two most studied omega-3 fatty acidsare eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). DHA makes up alarge portion of the gray matter of the brain. The fat in your brain forms cellmembranes and plays a vital role in how our cells function. Neurons are alsorich in omega-3 fatty acids. EPA improves blood flow, which boosts overall brainfunction.Increasing omega-3 intake has been found to decrease appetite and cravings andreduce body fat. In a fascinating 2009 study in the British Journal ofNutrition, Australian researchers analyzed blood samples from 124 adults (21healthy weight, 40 overweight, and 63 obese), calculated their BMI, and measuredtheir waist and hip circumference. They found that obese individuals hadsignificantly lower levels of EPA and DHA compared with healthy-weight people.Subjects with higher levels were more likely to have a healthy BMI and waist andhip measurements.More evidence about the benefits of fish oil on weight loss comes from a 2007study from the University of South Australia. The research team found thattaking fish oil combined with moderate exercise, like walking for forty-fiveminutes three times a week, leads to a significant reduction in body fat afterjust twelve weeks. But taking fish oil without exercising, or exercising withoutfish oil, did not result in any reduction in body fat.One of the most intriguing studies I have found on fish oil and weight lossappeared in a 2007 issue of the International Journal of Obesity. In this study,researchers from Iceland investigated the effects of seafood and fish oils onweight loss in 324 young overweight adults with BMIs ranging from 27.5 to 32.5.The participants were placed in four groups that ate 1,600-calorie diets thatwere the same except that each group’s diet included only one of the following:• Control group (sunflower oil capsules, no seafood or fish oil)• Lean fish (3 x 150 g portions of cod per week)• Fatty fish (3 x 150 g salmon per week)• Fish oil (DHA/EPA capsules, no seafood)After four weeks, the average amount of weight loss among the men in each of thefour groups was as follows:• Control group: 7.8 pounds• Lean fish group: 9.6 pounds• Fatty fish group: 9.9 pounds• Fish oil group: 10.9 poundsThe researchers concluded that adding fish or fish oil to a nutritionallybalanced calorie-restricted diet could boost weight loss in men.Research in the last few years has also revealed that diets rich in omega-3fatty acids help promote a healthy emotional balance and positive mood in lateryears, possibly because DHA is a main component of the brain’s synapses. Agrowing body of scientific evidence indicates that fish oil helps ease symptomsof depression. One twenty-year study involving 3,317 men and women found thatpeople with the highest consumption of EPA and DHA were less likely to havesymptoms of depression.There is a tremendous amount of scientific evidence pointing to a connectionbetween the consumption of fish that is rich in omega-3 fatty acids andcognitive function. A Danish team of researchers compared the diets of 5,386healthy older individuals and found that the more fish in a person’s diet, thelonger the person was able to maintain their memory and reduce the risk ofdementia. Dr. J. A. Conquer and colleagues from the University of Guelph inOntario studied the blood fatty acid content in the early and later stages ofdementia and noted low levels when compared with healthy people. In 2010, UCLAresearchers analyzed the existing scientific literature on DHA and fish oil andconcluded that supplementation with DHA slows the progression of Alzheimer’s andmay prevent age-related dementia.Omega-3 fatty acids benefit cognitive performance at every age. Scientists atthe University of Pittsburgh reported in 2010 that middle-aged people withhigher DHA levels performed better on a variety of tests, including nonverbalreasoning, mental flexibility, working memory, and vocabulary. A team of Swedishresearchers surveyed nearly five thousand fifteen-year-old boys and found thatthose who ate fish more than once a week scored higher on standard intelligencetests than teens who ate no fish. A follow-up study found that teens eating fishmore than once a week also had better grades at school than students with lowerfish consumption.Additional benefits of omega-3 fatty acids include increased attention in peoplewith ADD, reduced stress, and a lower risk for psychosis. When we put ourretired football players on our fish oil supplements, many of them were able todecrease or completely eliminate their pain medications.My recommendation for most adults is to take 1–2 g high-quality fish oil a daybalanced between EPA and DHA.Omega 3 Power is our brand to support healthy brain and heart function byproviding highly purified omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) from the mostadvanced production, detoxification, and purification process in the industry.It is produced under the natural industry’s most rigorous standards. Each batchof our oil is independently analyzed by the third-party lab Eurofins for morethan 250 environmental contaminants, including PCBs. Our oil is certified to bemore than twenty times lower than California’s Prop 65 requirement of fewer than90 nanograms/day, and it exceeds all other domestic and international regulatorystandards. Two softgel tablets contain 2.8 g fish oil, 860 mg EPA, and 580 mgDHA.Vitamin D. Vitamin D, sometimes called the sunshine vitamin, is best known forbuilding bones and boosting the immune system. But it is also an essentialvitamin for brain health, mood, memory, and your weight. While classified as avitamin, it is a steroid hormone vital to health. Low levels of vitamin D havebeen associated with depression, autism, psychosis, Alzheimer’s disease, MS,heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and obesity. Unfortunately, vitamin Ddeficiencies are becoming more and more common, in part because we are spendingmore time indoors and using more sunscreen.Did you know that when you don’t have enough vitamin D, you feel hungry all thetime, no matter how much you eat? That is because low levels of vitamin Dinterfere with the effectiveness of leptin, the appetite hormone that tells youwhen you are full. Research also shows that vitamin D insufficiency isassociated with increased body fat. A 2009 study out of Canada found that weightand body fat were significantly lower in women with normal vitamin D levels thanwomen with insufficient levels. It appears that extra fat inhibits theabsorption of vitamin D. The evidence shows that obese people need higher dosesof vitamin D than lean people to achieve the same levels.One of the most interesting studies I have seen on vitamin D comes fromresearchers at Stanford Hospital and Clinics. They detailed how a patient wasgiven a prescription for 50,000 IU/week vitamin D that was incorrectly filledfor 50,000 IU/day. After six months, the patient’s vitamin D level increasedfrom 7, which is extremely low, to 100, which is at the high end of normal.What I found really intriguing about this report was that the patient complainedof a few side effects from the very high dosage, namely decreased appetite andsignificant weight loss. Of course, I am not advocating that you take morevitamin D than you need. But I think it shows that optimal levels of vitamin Dmay play a role in appetite control and weight loss.This patient’s story shows why it is so important to get your vitamin D levelchecked before and after treatment. That way, you will know if you are takingthe right dosage, or if you need to adjust it.Vitamin D is so important to brain function that its receptors can be foundthroughout the brain. Vitamin D plays a critical role in many of the most basiccognitive functions, including learning and making memories. These are just someof the areas where vitamin D affects how well your brain works, according to a2008 review that appeared in the FASEB Journal.The scientific community is waking up to the importance of vitamin D for optimalbrain function. In the past few years, I have come across a number of studieslinking a shortage of vitamin D with cognitive impairment in older men andwomen, as well as some suggesting that having optimal levels of the sunshinevitamin may play a role in protecting cognitive function. One such study in theJournal of Alzheimer’s Disease found that vitamin D3, the active form of vitaminD, may stimulate the immune system to rid the brain of beta-amyloid, an abnormalprotein that is believed to be a major cause of Alzheimer’s disease. Vitamin Dactivates receptors on neurons in regions important in the regulation ofbehavior, and it protects the brain by acting in an antioxidant andanti-inflammatory capacity.Another study conducted in 2009 by a team at Tufts University in Boston lookedat vitamin D level in more than a thousand elderly people over the age ofsixty-five and its effect on cognitive function. Only 35 percent of theparticipants had optimal vitamin D levels; the rest fell in the insufficient ordeficient categories. The individuals with optimal levels of vitamin D (50nmol/l or higher) performed better on tests of executive functions, such asreasoning, flexibility, and perceptual complexity. They also scored higher onattention and processing speed tests than their counterparts with suboptimallevels.The lower your vitamin D levels, the more likely you are to feel blue ratherthan happy. Low levels of vitamin D have long been associated with a higherincidence of depression. In recent years, researchers have been asking if, giventhis association, vitamin D supplementation can improve moods.One trial that attempted to answer that question followed 441 overweight andobese adults with similar levels of depression for one year. The individualstook either a placebo or one of two doses of vitamin D: 20,000 IU per week or40,000 IU per week. By year’s end, the two groups that had taken the vitamin Dshowed a significant reduction in symptoms while the group taking the placeboreported no improvements. Other trials have reported similar findings.The current recommended dose for vitamin D is 400 IU daily, but most expertsagree that this is well below the physiological needs of most individuals andinstead suggest 2,000 IU of vitamin D daily. I think it is very important totest your individual needs, especially if you are overweight or obese, sinceyour body may not absorb the vitamin D as efficiently if you are heavier.Vitamin D3, comes as 1,000 IU tablets, 2,000 IU tablets, or as 10,000 IU liquid.BRAIN AND MEMORY POWER BOOSTThis is the supplement formulated to help in our brain enhancement work withactive and retired NFL players. When used in conjunction with a brain healthyprogram, we demonstrated significant improvement in memory, reasoning,attention, processing speed, and accuracy. It was so effective that I take itevery day.Brain and Memory Power Boost includes the super-antioxidant N-acetylcysteine(NAC), along with phosphatidylserine to maintain the integrity of cellmembranes, and huperzine A and acetyl-L-carnitine to enhance acetylcholineavailability, and vinpocetine and ginkgo biloba to enhance blood flow. This is anovel combination of powerful antioxidants and nutrients essential in enhancingand protecting brain health. It supports overall brain health, circulation,memory, and concentration.CRAVING CONTROLThe key to successful weight management is eating a brain healthy diet andmanaging your cravings. In support of this goal, Craving Control was developed,a powerful new nutritional supplement formulated to support healthy blood sugarand insulin levels while providing antioxidants and nutrients to the body. Ourformulation includes NAC and glutamine to reduce cravings, chromium andalpha-lipoic acid to support stable blood sugar levels, and a brain healthychocolate and D,L-phenylalanine designed to boost endorphins.This is the formula we use at the Amen Clinics in our own weight-loss groups. Inthe first group, participants who used the craving formula and attended eachgroup lost an average of 10 pounds in ten weeks.RESTFUL SLEEPSleep is essential to healthy brain function. Restful Sleep is formulated with acombination of nutrients designed to support a calm mind and promote a deep,relaxed, restful night’s sleep. This supplement contains both immediate andtime-released melatonin to keep you asleep throughout the entire night, plus thecalming neurotransmitter GABA, a combination of the essential elements zinc andmagnesium, and the herb valerian, which together may produce an overall sedativeeffect to help support sleep. At the Amen Clinics we refer to Restful Sleep as“the hammer” because so many people have told us it has helped them.SAME MOOD AND MOVEMENT SUPPORTSAMe has scientific research suggesting it helps support mood, movement, andpain control. It is intimately involved in the creation of the keyneurotransmitters, serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine, which support healthymood. And as an added advantage, SAMe has also been shown to support healthyjoints and decrease pain. The typical dose is anywhere from 400 mg to 800 mgtwice a day. It is usually better to take earlier in the day, as it can beenergizing. Research suggests you should be cautious with SAMe if you havebipolar disorder.SEROTONIN MOOD SUPPORTSerotonin Mood Support promotes normal serotonin levels by providing 5-HTP, adirect precursor to serotonin, along with a proprietary extract of saffron,shown clinically to support a normal mood. Vitamin B6 and inositol are includedto provide additional synergistic support. Serotonin Mood Support is useful tosupport a healthy mood when serotonin levels are suspected to be low. It seemsto be especially helpful for people who tend to get stuck on negative thoughtsor negative behaviors. It has also been shown to help support healthy sleeppatterns.FOCUS AND ENERGY OPTIMIZERFormulated without caffeine that makes people jittery, Focus and EnergyOptimizer supports both focus and healthy energy levels. It is formulated withgreen tea and choline to help with focus, along with three powerful adaptogens,which act synergistically to enhance endurance and stamina. The adaptogensashwagandha, rhodiola, and panax ginseng have been scientifically shown toimprove the body’s resistance to stress and support a healthy immune system.GABA CALMING SUPPORTGABA Calming Support promotes natural relaxation and calm by providing acombination of inhibitory neurotransmitters vital to quieting an overactivemind. It contains clinically tested and natural Pharma GABA shown to promoterelaxation by increasing calming, focused brain waves while also reducing otherbrain waves associated with worry. Complementing this clinically tested andnatural substance are vitamin B6, magnesium, and lemon balm, an herbtraditionally known for its calming effects.ROBERTRobert was a defensive back for the Minnesota Vikings. He is tall, lean, and inseemingly good health. When he joined our professional football braintrauma/rehabilitation study he complained that his memory was not as good as itwas before and he was having to keep more notes. His main concern was that heheard that many former NFL players were struggling with memory problems, farmore than others, and he had a parent who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’sdisease, increasing his own vulnerability and anxiety.Robert’s initial SPECT scan showed highly significant levels of brain damage,especially to his prefrontal cortex (judgment), temporal lobes (memory),parietal lobes (direction sense), and cerebellum (coordination). On our memorytest, his memory scored in the 5th percentile, which means that 95 percent ofpeople his age and education scored better than Robert, who was a Stanfordgraduate.To our delight, Robert’s follow-up brain SPECT scan was dramatically better andhis memory test improved 1,000 percent. How? One of the best things about Robertis that he was compliant with all of our directions. He faithfully took ourmultivitamin, NeuroVite; fish oil; Omega-3 Power; and our brain supportsupplement, Brain and Memory Power Boost. He did not miss doses and wasconsistent throughout the period of the study. His follow-up testing showed thathis memory improved 1,000 percent and he scored in the 55th percentile comparedwith his peers. His SPECT scan showed dramatic improvement in all of the areasthat were problematic.Robert’s Before Brain SPECT Scan[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_082_r1.jpg]Overall decreased activityRobert’s After Brain SPECT Scan[images/Amen_9780307888563_epub_083_r1.jpg]Full, even, symmetrical activityBefore his first evaluation Robert was clearly headed for trouble. With thesesimple interventions, his brain and test scores have shown remarkableimprovement. His brain has literally aged backward. I am very excited forRobert’s progress. He took thousands of hits to his head playing high school,college, and professional football, some thirty years before we first saw him.Yet, despite the damage and the distance in years, his brain still showed aremarkable ability to recover.The good news about our study is that it has demonstrated the damaged brain’sability to show high levels of improvement on a simple, inexpensive, smartprogram."},{"pageContent":"NOTE ON REFERENCES AND FURTHER READINGThe information in Use Your Brain to Change Your Age is based on more than fourhundred sources, including scientific studies, books, interviews with medicalexperts, statistics from government agencies and health organizations, and otherreliable resources.
